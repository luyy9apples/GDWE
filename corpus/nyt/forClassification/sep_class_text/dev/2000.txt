the season of barbecues and lawn parties is long past , but westchester s manicured lawns have become a subject of hot political dispute in recent weeks , as the county legislature prepares to vote on provisions of a new state law that would require pesticide applicators to notify neighbors in writing 48 hours before spraying most pesticides landscapers and other industry groups have opposed the law the first of its kind in the nation which was signed by gov george e pataki in august and allows counties to decide whether to adopt the neighbor notification provision suffolk and nassau counties have already done so the provision will take effect there next year last week , about 30 supporters of the law crowded into a committee room at the county office building in white plains , where two environmentalists and two industry representatives made their case to the legislature s health and environment committees the legislature is expected to vote on the law on monday george s latimer , the chairman of the county legislature , said it was impossible to say how the vote would go we 've heard from a lot of people , he said the problem is not with the bill s intention , but how it would be implemented last tuesday , supporters of the law released a report documenting pesticide use in the county it was prepared by two environmental groups , based on data gathered by the state department of environmental conservation the report , which lists westchester as one of the state s top counties for pesticide use , indicates that 22 percent of the pesticides used in westchester , measured in gallons , are classified by the federal environmental protection agency as probable , likely , or possible human carcinogens the second most widely used pesticide in the county was chlorpyrifos , the active ingredient in dursban chlorpyrifos was banned by the federal agency in june 2000 for virtually all nonagricultural uses because of its high neurotoxicity virtually all of the county s reported pesticide use is for nonagricultural purposes , like lawn care and indoor pest control we believe these dangerous chemicals should n't be used period , and that if you are going to use them , you should be warning people , said audrey thier , pesticide project director for the albanybased group environmental advocates and author of the report with so many safe and effective alternatives to pesticides , much of this risk is entirely gratuitous but joe yedowitz , the president of the new york state turf and landscape association , said pesticides pose little or no risk when they are applied properly , and overall use is lower than it was a decade ago he said neighbor notification is problematic for a number of reasons first , there is already a law against allowing pesticide to drift from one property to another the new law would be difficult to enforce , because neighbors who are unaware that certain pesticides are exempt would likely complain , creating the need for intervention by the county health department the law would also impose significant costs on the industry , which will be passed on to consumers all for a process that many people may find unnecessary the industry would prefer the kind of registry in place in several states , which allows people to put their names on a list and be notified of pesticide applications , said gene harrington , a spokesman for the national pest management association judging from these registries , it s clear that most people are not interested in being notified , he said but many people are unaware of the registries or of the danger posed by toxic pesticides , said laura haight , senior environmental associate at the new york public interest research group , which cosponsored the report they would benefit from the opportunity to cover their barbecues , close windows or bring their children inside , she said pesticide drift from one property to another is wellestablished , according to many who worked to pass the state law a state senator from long island , kenneth p lavalle , for instance , became a supporter after he and his wife were caught in a cloud of pesticide from their neighbor s yard five years ago , he said moreover , the law includes clear guidance about enforcement , including funds for counties , said neal m lewis , the executive director of the long island neighborhood network , the original sponsor of the law we are confident that we have the resources , in working with local governments , to enforce the law , said jennifer meicht , a spokeswoman for the state department of environmental conservation we are aware of complaints from the industry and we believe that is more an attempt to avoid accountability nonetheless , the usefulness of the neighbor notification law will be limited , said john wargo , a professor of political science and risk analysis at yale university who helped write a similar law in connecticut there will be signs all over the place during the summer months , and people will get numb but as a way to educate people about the dangers of pesticides , the law could be a vital starting point , he said virtually none of the chemicals have been fully tested for their effects , he said you 've got a very inadequate toxicological database for most pesticides , but we allow their release where the most vulnerable populations small children , people with allergies , the elderly are exposed

san francisco , jan 31 estrogen strongly protected against infection by the simian aids virus in experiments with female monkeys , offering hope that it might be used to protect against the human aids virus in women , researchers have reported here at a meeting on the disease in the study , estrogen injected into a small group of female monkeys produced a thicker layer of cells in their vaginas that acted as a protective barrier against infection when siv , the simian aids virus , was squirted into the vagina to test the effectiveness of the therapy the results were striking , said the head of the research team , dr preston marx of the aaron diamond aids research center in new york city dr marx and public health officials cautioned that much more research was needed to prove that a topical estrogen cream applied to the vagina could protect women against hiv we ca n't assume estrogen would have the same effect in women or that topical application would be as effective as injected estrogen , dr marx said in an interview today a reason for cautious optimism , though , is that siv , which dr marx has been using in work with monkeys for more than 10 years , has proved a valuable model for studying its human cousin , hiv dr fred t valentine , an aids expert at new york university , said that estrogen use might become a very important method by which women could reduce their chances of becoming infected with hiv through sexual intercourse dr valentine is one of those attending this meeting , the seventh conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections , where scientists said that if estrogen protected in human studies , women might be freed of having to rely on men to provide safety against hiv through use of condoms further , estrogen could be particularly useful as an inexpensive method of protection in thirdworld countries , home to an overwhelming majority of hiv cases in the last five years , dr marx s team has used monkeys to study the role of different sex hormones in vaginal transmission of siv in 1996 , the team reported that in a similar monkey experiment , injection of progesterone had increased the risk of transmission of siv by seven times because that hormone thinned the layer of vaginal cells , making it easier for the virus to reach the body s supply of blood since progesterone and estrogen usually oppose each other s effects in the body , the obvious prediction was that if one had one effect , the other would have the opposite effect , and that estrogen should protect , dr marx said in the interview in the estrogen experiment , conducted at a primate center at tulane university , dr marx worked with dr stephen smith , an infectiousdisease specialist at st michael s hospital in newark the ovaries were removed from the monkeys to stop production of both estrogen and progesterone , and the researchers tested three groups of six monkeys each one group received no hormone replacement , and all six became infected after siv had been squirted into their vaginas in a group that received progesterone , five of six became infected but in the group receiving estrogen , none became infected these six monkeys have been repeatedly tested for siv in the year since efforts were made to infect them with the virus , and all have remained free of infection in the monkeys treated with estrogen , dr marx said , the vaginal layer became 25 to 50 cells thick in those that did not get estrogen , it was about 2 cells thick the thickness of the vaginal layer varies with the menstrual cycle and menopause status , dr marx said , and premenopausal women naturally produce estrogen and progesterone but he said he assumed that topical estrogen would increase the thickness of the layer at any given time in the menstrual cycle
calvin klein inc has filed suit to break a licensing pact with the warnaco group inc , which makes its underwear and jeans brands , in what many industry insiders consider an act of vengeance against the flinttough chief executive of warnaco , linda j wachner last october , mr klein and his longtime partner barry schwartz engaged the investment firm of lazard freres to find a buyer for their private company tommy hilfiger inc , liz claiborne and warnaco were among the companies that expressed interest but none were willing to bite at mr klein s asking price , said to be 1 billion part of the problem was that the brand was already highly exposed the klein name appears on everything from sunglasses to bed linens and therefore did not offer prospective buyers an obvious path for dynamic future growth but klein s longterm licensing deal with warnaco complicated the picture as well warnaco accounted for about 1 billion of the 25 billion in calvin klein products sold wholesale in 1999 , and ms wachner has pressed for more control of design and distribution while mr klein insists that he could have sold the company if he wanted to and that the new lawsuit is unrelated , he says that ms wachner scared off prospective partners people have told us that they were hesitant to have a relationship with linda wachner , he said in an interview last night ms wachner said mr klein s lawsuit , filed in united states district court for the southern district of new york on tuesday , was a complete surprise and that she first learned of it that night by phone while in a design meeting at calvin klein inc one must wonder why having tried and failed to sell their business that they have adopted this tack now , she said david wolfe , creative director of the doneger group , a retail consulting firm , and one of the many people in new york s garment district enjoying the fight , put it bluntly this is about calvin s failure to cut a deal he is kicking her while she is on the defensive he grew up in the bronx he is a streetwise kid it will really be fascinating to watch it play out the lawsuit seeks to terminate warnaco s longterm license to make calvin klein jeans on the ground that the company has breached its fiduciary duty by diluting the quality of klein s image among the specific infractions cited was selling new products through unauthorized massmarketers like costco and b j s wholesale club and affixing the klein name to products made by other designers or products designed by klein but altered without his consent mr klein and mr schwartz said the suit was an instrument of last resort , after years of complaints through letters , personal meetings and lawyers mr schwartz said the issue reached a turning point in march when warnaco handed over a list of its retail clients , and the top six , which accounted for over 200 million in sales in 1999 , were unauthorized offprice outlets it was clear to us then that this was a premeditated strategy to destroy the trademark , he said ms wachner says she is baffled by mr klein s allegations i am not going to respond to a lawsuit i have not yet seen , ms wachner said , but it is without merit she added that all warnaco s licensing and royalty agreements have been clearly known to the klein partners since last fall , when they requested the information to share with perspective buyers she is a liar , mr schwartz responded she can say anything she wants to the press , but let her say that in court whatever the merits of the suit , the timing could not be more devastating to ms wachner warnaco , which makes underwear and clothing under numerous names besides calvin klein s , has seen its stock plunge for almost a year as the company has repeatedly missed earnings estimates yesterday , the news of the suit pushed the stock to a 52week low of 66875 , down from a high of 29156 a share last june ms wachner , whose compensation ranks among that of the top chief executives in the nation despite her company s performance , is already a target of irate shareholders the complaint singled out ms wachner as the source of friction between the companies it called her abusive and unprofessional , a topic mr klein angrily expanded on in an interview she runs it like a monarchy , mr klein said of ms wachner s performance at warnaco she is abusive to our people verbally , the language is disgusting at least in the short term , the klein suit will surely put the already cashshort warnaco into more of a bind no one is going to step into the gap and be by her side financially , said josie esquivel , who is a stock analyst at morgan stanley the longterm effect , however , will depend on how the court rules , and longtime linda watchers do not count her out she has shown great wherewithal , ms esquivel noted photos calvin klein says ms wachner has diluted his brand by selling to cutprice retailers like costco warnaco manufactures 1 billion worth of calvin klein products a year \( associated press \) linda j wachner , the chief of warnaco , says she is baffled by a lawsuit filed by calvin klein this week she is also a target of irate shareholders who are disappointed by recent results \( bill cunningham the new york times \)
seattle , june 25 two weeks after the rock and roll hall of fame and museum opened in cleveland in 1995 , paul allen , the microsoft cofounder , sent a small contingent there from seattle to look around the group spent two days examining the museum top to bottom then , recalled peter blecha , a member of that expeditionary force , we went back to the hotel room and critiqued it we had a big board , and we wrote everything that was good and everything that was bad on it it was a classic raid , not unlike the strategy microsoft used in taking over the desktop computing world mr allen had an idea , he checked out the competition , and then he improved on it this weekend , the experience music project , 240 million worth of proof that mr allen is a rock fan , opened here in a building designed by frank o gehry that is just a few steps from the space needle the festivities included concerts by eminem , patti smith , matchbox 20 , bo diddley , dr dre , metallica , james brown and dozens of northwest bands , from pedro the lion to the kingsmen apart from its private financing , the experience music project differs from the rock and roll hall of fame in three significant ways its reliance on technology , its focus on local music and its intent the cleveland museum is in an i m pei building shaped like a turntable , a symbol of its focus as an archive where music history is always on playback the shape of the experience music project , however , has no clear message a sheetmetal abstraction based on the rich colors and curved shape of guitar heads , it looks from above like a tall tissue box surrounded by five crumpled sheets of different colored gift wrap from outside the museum , there is no way to comprehend its exact size , shape or structure because of the rolling , unpredictable curves based on the curly scribbles of mr gehry drawings in many ways reminiscent of the attempts of white hipster artists to visualize jazz in the 50 s the abstract , organic , visually elusive building speaks not about music history but about music appreciation and a person in possession of the latter quality is far better off than a person with the former where the rock and roll hall of fame generally advertises using the names of stars whose legends can be felt inside , the experience music project tries to reach deeper into the psyche , explaining on billboards that it is a museum for people who sing in the shower or drum on their car steering wheels it is a gathering place for the frustrated musicians of the world , like mr allen himself , a closet guitarist \( a cd by his band , grown men , is available in the museum gift store \) though mr allen s original idea eight years ago was simply a gallery for showing off his jimi hendrix memorabilia , it soon expanded to become the nation s second major rock museum with the national music museum now being planned in washington , it seems conceivable that museums devoted to popular music may one day become as integral to a city s cultural life as art museums are after all , on friday , with a metallica show going on nearby , there were probably more teenagers swarming through the experience music project \( open daily until 11 pm \) than some museums see in a year the experience music project s strongest point is a room called the sound lab where visitors can learn in just a few technologyaided minutes how to play guitar , keyboard or drums they can even scratch records on a turntable like a hiphop dj or adjust the separate tracks of sweet dreams by the eurythmics on a mixing board as a studio engineer does \( on friday , opening day at the museum , one visitor mixing the song was surprised to find dave stewart of the eurythmics , a friend of mr allen s , reaching over his shoulder to help him out \) in another room a group of people can pick up instruments designed to correct their mistakes and play the troggs song wild thing under the glare of stage lights and a virtual audience the cliche around here is that if you can inspire the jimi hendrix of the future , you 've done your job , said chris bruce , the museum s curatorial director if you can reach just one kid , out of the millions of people who come through , and get that inspiration to him , it would change his life the key is you 've got historical artifacts , the instruments , and the place , and then you give people the realization that they can do it , too perhaps this explains the most surprising element of the museum instead of focusing on the classic rock dear to mr allen , it overwhelmingly favors independent music in the building s permanent display on music history , for example , the minneapolis punk bands husker du and the replacements get three times the amount of space given to the entirety of the blues elsewhere , songs by the japanese maverick cornelius play on giant loudspeakers and performances by the laterday riot grrrl band sleaterkinney flash on video screens in three separate rooms there are artifacts by indierock bands from pavement to pere ubu \( a cleveland band whose inclusion serves as a subtle dig at the more mainstream rock museum in that city \) there is a focus on doityourself music , particularly punk rock , on telling visitors that anybody can pick up a guitar and make a record no special calling , ability or aptitude is needed
it has been two weeks since the murder trial of rae carruth , the former panthers wide receiver , began in charlotte , nc , and the prosecution and the defense have not finished choosing a jury even though the two sides have yet to make their opening arguments , the outlines of their cases have begun to emerge the selection of jurors has become bogged down amid charges by defense lawyers that the prosecutors are trying to keep black male jurors off the panel but many details about the events leading up to the shooting of carruth s pregnant girlfriend in november 1999 have come to light in court motions and in transcripts of police interviews with witnesses that have been obtained by local journalists what emerges from these disclosures is a muddy and sometimes contradictory picture the prosecution s case that carruth ordered his girlfriend s assassination to avoid paying future child support no longer appears cut and dried it has become clear the jurors will have to weigh the veracity of several key witnesses , chief among them van brett watkins , who has confessed to having fired the shots that killed carruth s pregnant girlfriend , cherica l adams carruth could face the death penalty prosecutors in charlotte have charged that carruth , 26 , the carolina panthers' firstround draft choice in 1997 , paid watkins and two other acquaintances , michael eugene kennedy and stanley drew abraham , to shoot adams because he did not want to pay future child support adams , who was 24 , was shot four times in her car about 12 30 am nov 16 , 1999 , on a road in south charlotte she was driving home from a movie theater , where she and carruth had gone to see the bone collector carruth was driving a second car ahead of her , prosecutors said watkins , a 40yearold new yorker with a long criminal history , has confessed to shooting adams as he and the other men pulled their car next to hers he pleaded guilty to seconddegree murder and has agreed to testify against carruth , prosecutors say watkins s testimony , along with statements the victim made to the police just after the shooting , are at the heart of the prosecution s case adams lingered in the hospital for nearly a month after the shooting before she died her infant son , chancellor , survived kennedy , 25 , and abraham , 20 , are also charged with murder , but will be tried after carruth carruth s lawyers , in a motion filed on oct 18 , said that watkins had told a completely different story to a sheriff s deputy at the mecklenburg county jail according to the deputy s handwritten notes , watkins said he shot adams because she had made an obscene gesture at him after he tried to ask her where carruth had gone in his car i had kennedy pull alongside cherica s car so we could see which way rae was headed , watkins said , according to the deputy s notes i started waving my arms to get her attention she slowed down i think she may have thought we wanted to pass her i was motioning for her to roll her window down i just wanted to ask her if she knew where rae was going she slowed down some more she looked over at the car and seen us she flipped me off , sergeant i lost it i just started shooting carruth s lawyers asserted in the court motion that they would prove kennedy had tried to borrow money from carruth to buy a large quantity of marijuana from watkins carruth had initially agreed to the loan and then , on the night of the shooting , had changed his mind at another point in his talk with the jail guard , watkins allegedly said it was rae s fault if he had just given us the money , none of this would have happened watkins s statements to the deputy may do serious damage to the prosecution s case at the very least , it has given defense lawyers a second plausible theory to present to the jury defense lawyers contend that carruth was miles away at the time of the shooting i would think mr watkins is a witness most lawyers would love to crossexamine , david s rudolph , carruth s lawyer , said in an interview prosecutors have yet to reveal what watkins said in his confession the police have said watkins , at first identified as william edward watkins , told detectives initially that carruth had offered him 5 , 000 to assault adams and force her to have a miscarriage another crucial brick in the prosecution s case is a tape of the telephone call adams made to a police dispatcher as she lay wounded and bleeding in her car carruth s lawyers maintain that he said good night to adams after the movie and went to the house of hannibal navies , another panthers player , before the shooting took place bits and pieces of adams s 12minute call to the 911 dispatcher had been made public in court motions , but the charlotte observer obtained a full transcript of the tape last week during jury selection according to that transcript , adams clearly places carruth at the scene of the shooting how did this happen \? the dispatcher asked i was following my baby s daddy , rae carruth , the football player , adams answered so you think he did it \? he slowed down and a car pulled up beside me and it shot at you \? yes later on the tape , the dispatcher asked adams where carruth went he was in the car in front of me and he slowed down and somebody pulled up beside me and did this , she said and where 'd he go \?

dick cheney , gov george w bush s newly announced running mate , is in excellent health and takes many drugs for heart disease and other medical conditions , his doctors said yesterday he is up to the task of the most sensitive public office , mr cheney s personal physician , dr gary malakoff , said in a letter dated july 22 and released by the bush campaign yesterday dr malakoff and dr jonathan s reiner , mr cheney s cardiologist , said they monitored mr cheney , a former secretary of defense , closely for a long list of medications that he takes for heart disease , gout and metabolic disorders he has shown no side effects of any of these medications which would alter intellectual performance or impair his judgment , dr malakoff said the doctors , who practice at george washington university medical center in washington where mr cheney has received care since 1985 , did not say what drugs he takes and they provided few specifics about test results , test dates or the types of conditions affecting mr cheney mr cheney has had several minor episodes of gout in his feet and receives drug treatment to prevent additional attacks and to lower the amount of uric acid in his blood he has suffered a potentially fatal allergic reaction , known as anaphylaxis , from pomegranates and has been treated for skin cancer the doctors did not say whether the skin cancer was a common , generally harmless type known as basal cell or a potentially fatal type known as melanoma mr cheney has suffered three heart attacks , but none since he underwent quadruple coronary bypass surgery in 1988 since the operation , mr cheney has had no symptoms of heart disease he leads a vigorous lifestyle , traveling extensively for work , exercising on a treadmill for 30 minutes several days a week , hunting and engaging in other strenuous recreational activities , dr reiner said in a separate letter dated july 24 heart attacks destroy muscle cells that cannot be replaced the amount of heart function lost after an attack , or a series of attacks , depends in part on how much heart muscle has been destroyed in providing new medical details concerning mr cheney s heart condition , the doctors said the three heart attacks had left mr cheney with an unspecified amount of dysfunction of the heart s main pumping chamber , the left ventricle the dysfunction was detected by an ultrasound test known as an echocardiogram and the affected regions of heart muscle correlated with the areas on the bottom of the heart that were damaged by the heart attacks , dr reiner said mr cheney s heart disease is optimally treated with medication , dr malakoff said he said mr cheney had long had an elevated level of blood cholesterol that has been vigorously and successfully treated with medication the doctors did not provide mr cheney s cholesterol count or tests of other fatty substances monitoring examinations like nuclear stress tests that are standard for individuals with heart disease have been stable and unchanged for the past several years in mr cheney s case , dr reiner said however , the doctors did not provide a crucial number known as the ejection fraction it indicates the proportion of blood in the main chamber that is pumped to the body with each heartbeat and is a principal way doctors monitor patients with heart disease the type of heart disease affecting mr cheney is known as coronary artery disease and it takes its name from the buildup of fatty substances , or plaques , in the coronary arteries that block blood flow through them surgeons perform bypass operations to help prevent future heart attacks in the operation , arteries and veins are taken from elsewhere in the body and grafted to coronary arteries to provide channels around the blockages but over time new blockages can develop in the grafted blood vessels , particularly veins no specific information was provided about the state of mr cheney s four grafts mr cheney suffered his first heart attack at age 37 in 1978 when he was running for congress from wyoming at that time , he had moderate coronary artery disease for which he received drug therapy for several years , dr reiner said he also stopped smoking but in 1984 , mr cheney suffered a second heart attack the third came in 1988 coronary artery disease often progresses despite bypass surgery and drug treatment a cardiac catheterization in 1988 showed that the coronary artery disease had progressed over the preceding decade , a factor that led to the bypass surgery
dear diary ever wonder if anyone pays close attention to the announcements we 've heard hundreds of times on flights \? if my experience on a continental airlines flight from gatwick to newark this month is any indication , the answer is probably not , because i think i was the only one who laughed at the following ladies and gentleman , we are now in our final approach please put your seats back in the upright position and stow your tray tables the flight attendants will shortly be passing through the cabin one last time , so please pass any unwanted trash , cash or jewelry to the end of your row to be collected karolyn wrightson dear diary i was walking by those great giant legs of the world trade center this morning and it dawned on me what i'm actually going to remember most about new york city when i'm living out in the burbs five years from now doing the wife and mommy thing it s not going to be those monstrous darth vaderlooking twin towers that i walk under every day or the empire state building or statue of liberty not even central park it s going to be the millions and millions of driedup , flattened globs of gum that people have hurled all over the sidewalk no matter where you go upper east side , west side , you name it just look down and you 'll see these black spots glued to the sidewalk , like flattened quarters left on a railroad track check me out look , there s one , two , three see ! chris maloney connie layman , who lives in malvern , pa , was crossing seventh avenue en route to lunch and a broadway matinee with friends when a gust of wind blew her new felt hat directly into the path of an ambulance the hat landed about a foot from the vehicle s front wheels and ms layman knew that if the ambulance did n't hit it , another vehicle coming along would , and the hat would become a pancake she was already mourning the hat , a gift from her husband , when she noticed the ambulance was at a standstill and the driver was motioning her to come over and rescue her headgear traffic behind the ambulance came to a stop and ms layman ran out onto the road to retrieve her treasure she s already planning a return trip to what she now terms your great city it was a warm , humid winter day and steven metzger had a choice of seats on a muggy but nottoocrowded m104 bus the window next to his first seat choice would n't open so he moved to the next seat and that window also would n't budge after a third try , he realized none of the windows would open and asked the driver why that bus had only inoperable windows he was told that the windows were sometimes pinned closed by the powers that be annoyed but challenged , mr metzger examined the window handles and realized there was a small screw in the center unscrew it slightly and the window would open he s now added an appropriate small tool to his briefcase to control his ventilation destiny as he left the bus , the driver was smiling and motioned to his own wide open window my takeout library came home last night and found a couple more takeout menus beneath my door delivery men of every complexion have gotten wind of my menu collection my neighbors , always in a hurry to sample a new taste sensation whether blintzes , squid , ragout or curry , consult my files for inspiration how 'd i get to be a specialty tout \?

it s hard to know for sure , particularly after last week s rebound in the nasdaq market , but investors may be waking up to the fact that the markets can go down as well as up and that safety , whatever that is , is worth something that is not to say that investment vehicles , whatever the model , are entirely free of risk mattresses can get lumpy , and they are flammable to boot and even money market accounts have been known to get into trouble there are , however , some precincts in the investing world where people are less likely to suffer following are excerpts from conversations last week with analysts and portfolio managers about four such places in the market beyond a technology rush charles t freeman is portfolio manager of the 156 billion vanguard windsor fund , which has stayed almost religiously focused on value stocks over the last few years while so many other money managers chased increasingly expensive technology shares during the technology selloff from march 10 through april 14 , his fund gained 84 percent , versus a 342 percent loss in the nasdaq composite q what do you make of the volatility we have seen in the stock market so far this year , particularly in technology stocks \? a there is a lot of uncertainty and nervousness we have had a real long run in the economy and an unusual run in the stock market these are latecycle jitters and are very understandable the edginess is compounded by the fact that we are in a cycle of rising interest rates none of us really know how many times the fed is going to raise rates , and there is always the risk of them overshooting so this is a scary time technology stocks seem like the last place to hide , and that gives us extreme valuations q given the way the market has performed over much of the last 12 months , a time when technology has outperformed nearly every other sector , is it surprising that investors continue to gravitate toward those stocks \? a stocks in general have been weak since the middle of last year because of the federal reserve it is not at all surprising when the fed is raising rates to see stocks get hurt technology has been the exception from july 1 of last year through the end of march , technology stocks in the standard poor s 500 index , which represent about onethird of the index , were up 60 percent the other twothirds of the s p was down 37 percent i do n't think a lot of weight is being given to a recession right now , but it is hard to find any sign of it in the way technology shares are being valued nontechnology stocks , by comparison , have taken a much better account of what a recession might mean is technology spending sacrosanct \? probably is it deferrable \? probably , and in a recession it would be deferred q what criteria do you use to identify and invest in value stocks \? a we like to buy stocks with low priceearnings ratios relative to the market , to be priceopportunistic when we buy them , to be disciplined on the sell side and to concentrate in areas where it makes sense we try and not really stick our necks out stocks that trade at 15 to 16 times earnings are a nice platform that is how we try and deal with risk , by not paying too much for things q of your top holdings , which stocks have the potential to do very well in coming months \? a at the end of march , our top holdings were att , alcoa , citigroup , associates first , pharmacia upjohn , tjx , aventis , ibm , mci worldcom , burlington resources and washington mutual of those , the four that strike us particularly are alcoa , pharmacia upjohn , associates first and tjx those are stocks that all have upside from 30 percent to 60 percent q at some point , the market will get a handle on when the fed will finish raising rates at that point , is it your view that the broad market will rally , and that technology will fall in favor of other sectors \? a it does seem that technology will slide as the rest of the market rallies , albeit irregularly our portfolio was up 14 percent in the month of march and rose some more in april my take on the up leg in stocks like this is that the market is sniffing out the end to the fed rate cycle i think they will raise rates three more times and no more , which is what the bond market seems to be thinking if that is true , then they will have finished tightening by the end of the fall it would not be too early for the stock market to be anticipating that now when that happens , money seems to go into a broad list of stocks and comes out of technology a dull sector changes its stripes time was , utility stocks were most often associated with widows and orphans regulated streams of revenue and cash flow consistent dividend payments no muss no fuss that was before deregulation , here and around the world utility stocks are still good for widows and orphans but there are also some utility companies that pay absolutely no dividends , instead offering investors a growth stock story at a lower multiple than your basic dotcom jonathan c raleigh , a managing director and electric utility analyst at goldman , sachs company , talked about what is happening in power land q utility stocks are not the uniformly stodgy , safe places to stick money that they used to be does n't that mean that investors need to do at least some homework before considering an investment \?
investor interest perked up noticeably yesterday for nabisco holdings , the maker of ritz crackers and oreo cookies , and its parent , the nabisco group on wall street , the price of nabisco holdings shares jumped 20625 , to 46 and the nabisco group , which owns 806 percent of nabisco holdings but is saddled with potentially large liabilities from its days as a tobacco company , rose 3375 , to 230625 fear of enormous damage awards resulting from classaction lawsuits has created a wide gap between the price of the food company and its parent shares of nabisco holdings increased in response to an article in the wall street journal that a number of companies including philip morris , danone and cadbury schweppes had submitted preliminary bids to buy all or part of the food business nabisco holdings has directed its management to pursue strategies that would maximize shareholder return , including a sale of the company many expect the company to be sold by summer nabisco holdings has said that no formal deadline exists for the submission of bids but it has been widely assumed that interested parties had until yesterday to make a proposal the process is not expected to be completed until sometime next month none of the companies admitted having submitted an offer but analysts said nabisco s brands would be attractive to a wide range of potential buyers this is the best food asset that has been auctioned in over a decade , since kraft was sold to philip morris , said john mcmillin , an analyst at prudential securities whenever you get premium assets , you are going to get some interest christopher kircher , a philip morris spokesman , refused to comment on a possible bid a spokesman for cadbury schweppes also declined to comment in paris , where danone is based , diane d'oleon , a spokeswoman , said the company was in preliminary discussions with nabisco about acquiring assets that fit in with danone s core mineral water , dairy products and biscuits businesses analysts said that of the three , philip morris was most likely to be interested in acquiring all of nabisco , and was best positioned financially to swallow the entire company they have the deepest pockets , said john o'neil , an analyst at painewebber kraft is the world s secondbiggest packaged food company behind nestle it had sales last year of 266 billion , more than three times the 1999 revenue of nabisco holdings nabisco s cookie and cracker business , which accounts for about half of an estimated operating profit of 605 million for this year , is probably attractive to danone , analysts said they are the largest biscuit company in the world without a presence in the united states , said jaine i mehring , an analyst at salomon smith barney having just divested their beer business , they are flush with cash and are down to the three core businesses that last week they said they are committed to growing danone s biscuit portfolio includes the lu and britannia brands nabisco may also feel comfortable dealing with danone in the early 1990 s the french company purchased some international businesses from what was then rjr nabisco cadbury schweppes is widely assumed to be interested in nabisco s confectionary business , especially its lifesavers and breath savers brands cadbury is not a likely buyer of the whole thing , mr o'neil said a more likely scenario is that danone and cadbury combine for a bid to split the business , or danone buying the whole thing and then selling the confectionary business to cadbury ms mehring said a joint bid was quite possible , and could involve a company that has not yet expressed an interest i would not be at all surprised to see a danone nestle bid , she said , because nestle would love lifesavers thus far , carl c icahn is the only party interested in nabisco that has chosen to openly state his position mr icahn started the process earlier this year when he offered to pay 16 a share for the nabisco group it was his fifth bid for the company in the last four years in a regulatory filing last week , mr icahn said he was willing to pay 22 a share , or about 65 billion , for the holding company currently , he owns just under 10 percent of the outstanding shares there has apparently been some interest expressed in nabisco holdings by some financial investors recently hicks , muse , tate furst , the dallasbased leveraged buyout firm , was rumored to be looking for a strategic partner to buy nabisco holdings analysts said that mr icahn did not seem to have any interest in owning a food business mr icahn is only interested in buying the holding company , mr o'neil said though mr icahn is the only visible bidder for the nabisco group , the current wisdom on wall street is that he will not end up owning the company the likely winner of an auction for the nabisco group is r j reynolds tobacco rjr already assumes all of the tobaccorelated liability that is attached to the nabisco group as a consequence , it could buy the company that it had earlier spun off without assuming any additional cost or risk that would likely happen after the food company was sold after a sale of the food company , which should be in excess of 50 a share , rjr could buy the estimated 11 billion in cash held by the holding company for about 8 billion , a nice benefit to its current 24 billion market cap , mr o'neil said ms mehring from salomon smith barney noted that the idea rjr would be able to profit from its own liability is sort of laughable photo nabisco holdings products include oreos , ritz crackers , lifesavers and breath savers
in california , new york and 27 other states , people applying for food stamps are asked if they own a burial plot nebraska and nevada want to know if applicants have sold their blood , and for how much hawaii demands garagesale receipts , south dakota wants documentation of bingo winnings , and minnesota , on page 20 of a 36page eligibility application , asks if anyone in the household earns money from a paper route foodstamp applications in most states have become so onerous that they are deterring needy people from applying for the subsidies , a comprehensive analysis by a national network of food banks and advocacy groups has found many of the inquiries about income and assets have no connection to legal requirements for stamps but are either aggressive responses to federal mandates to deter fraud or part of recent state and local efforts to cut welfare costs by eliminating recipients state administrators contend that they are simply complying with federal pressure to be tightfisted with taxpayers' money and properly enforcing the tougher rules passed by congress in the 1996 welfare overhaul but federal officials say the report , conducted by america s second harvest , the nation s largest food bank network , adds to their worries that such stringency may be one reason that 12 million people who need the benefits , and are eligible , are not getting them foodstamp use is plummeting at a faster rate than can be explained by economic growth since 1996 , the number of people using food stamps has declined to 172 million people from 23 million , though a growing bipartisan consensus now holds that food stamps , like medicaid , are supports needed to keep lowwage parents working sometimes in this program we have not looked at the big picture , agriculture secretary dan glickman said in an interview about the survey , which will be released on monday it s not my goal to keep hungry people out of the program that s a disgrace , mr glickman said but it s also my job to keep fraud down it s tricky to balance those things the report , he added , is actually helpful we are going to continue to work with the states to make sure that the income limits are n't ridiculous , and that antifraud techniques are not outside the bounds of what we ought to be doing among the new sleuthing methods for countering fraud are parkinglot espionage in tennessee , computerized credit checks in delaware and texas , and calls to employers and landlords in alaska they do n't want you to have nothing , a disabled woman of 56 , who asked that her name not be used , whispered as she peered at the question about a burial space in the shabby waiting room of a foodstamp office in harlem it s none of their business you want to tell the truth , but they make it so if you tell the truth , it do n't help when the comment was repeated to the sponsors of the study , which examined application forms from all 50 states and a sampling from the nation s 3 , 143 counties , they said it underlined the unfairness of such questions , though they are not illegal she s afraid she 'll go hungry if she s honest , deborah leff , president of america s second harvest , said of the woman s concern is n't that a mess \? though the federal government finances and oversees the foodstamp program , states administer it , with wide variations the shortest application , in florida , is only a page , but most are more than 10 pages , and all warn that misleading answers are punishable by a stiff fine and up to 20 years in prison yet , the study found , many questions are unintelligible to the average applicant , and some are mindboggling even to the researchers are you or anyone in your household fleeing from new jersey \? ohio s eightpage application asks researchers nicknamed the query the soprano clause , after the television drama about a mafia family we live in cleveland , said sharon davis , 39 , a single mother of three who was laid off last month from her job as a machine operator and had spent most of the afternoon applying for food stamps why would they ask if you 're from new jersey \? in their defense , state administrators contend that all the questions including that one reflect local efforts to comply with a stream of federal dictates , including periodic crackdowns on fraud , stiff penalties on states that overpay even by 5 , and new rules in the 1996 federal welfare legislation to explain the socalled soprano clause , for example , ohio foodstamp administrators pointed to a provision by congress in the 1996 legislation it excludes from the foodstamp program any fugitive from prosecution of a felony , which in new jersey is called a high misdemeanor to be safe , said jon allen , a spokesman for the ohio department of job and family services , ohio added an extra question just to cover new jersey s terminology by the same token , nebraska , which was fined 1 million for foodstamp errors in a 1998 federal audit , asks about money from blood plasma donations and counts it against a family s food allotment which foodbank analysts say is simply wrong because in 1986 an obscure federal policy memorandum defined such money as earned income
east rutherford , nj , dec 17 there were 12 seconds left in the jetslions game today when john hall s 35yard fieldgoal attempt on a soaked , unsteady field seemed to take on a mind of its own the ball stayed low and curved far to the left , and the thankful lions escaped with a 107 victory hall , who had often bailed out the jets , trudged to the sideline , knowing he had missed a golden opportunity tom tupa , his holder , stayed by his side keep your head up , tupa told him it s no big deal it was indeed a big deal because the loss kept the jets from clinching a playoff berth this week hall knew what the game meant to his teammates minutes later , in the jets' locker room , he stripped off his jersey and shoes , and then sat on a stool facing his narrow locker his elbows rested on his thighs , and he buried his head in his arms and did not move for five minutes teammates would walk by , tap him gently on the shoulder and keep walking finally , hall sat up he flung his shoulder pads into a bag he flung his jersey into a laundry pile on the floor he looked as if he wanted to fling himself out the door he left the locker room , showered and returned he was quickly surrounded by television cameras , microphones , tape recorders and notebooks he stood like a condemned man and talked above all , he said , i'm a man , and i'm going to take it like a man with success comes failure it s tough i was surprised i missed it when i hit it , i did n't think it was n't good , so i was really shocked more than anything when i kicked it , i thought i heard a double tick like someone got a finger on it i thought it was going to make it i looked at the goal posts before the kick and thought i was going to make it like any other jets' fieldgoal attempt , this one required a good snap by brad banta , a good hold by tupa and a good kick by hall hall insisted the snap and hold were proper he acknowledged that the field was terrible , but he also said , i'm not going to talk about the field he added there were three holes in front of me , but where my foot and plant foot were , were fine the field was no big deal that s where we were supposed to play but did the weather conditions make a difference \? you tell me , hall said i take responsibility gary moeller , who became detroit s head coach six weeks ago , was not surprised the kick missed i felt we had a chance , moeller said i do know that the spot that the ball was being placed at was not a good spot it was n't a long kick , but it was a tough kick hall has been with the jets since they signed him in 1997 as a rookie free agent from wisconsin he is big \( 6 feet 3 inches and 228 pounds \) , with a baby face , a slight goatee and a strong leg in his first three pro seasons , he made 80 of 109 fieldgoal attempts , the longest success from 55 yards until today , when he was also wide left on a 47yarder at the end of the first half , his season record was 21 of 30 while hall was showering , tupa , at the next locker , talked about the lastminute kick it looked like the operation was all right , he said i do n't know what to tell you you saw what happened brad did a great job snapping in these conditions all day i think the hold was all right john was trying to find a good spot i really did n't see the kick until it was past the line of scrimmage then i looked up and saw it sliding to the left tupa left no doubt about a culprit none of the field was ok , he said it was an awful field but you just go out there and you do it it s just part of playing here other jets tried to comfort hall , but , like tupa , words were difficult what can you say \? said offensive tackle jumbo elliott , a 13year pro not much shaun ellis , the rookie defensive end , approached it like a veteran he s a good kicker , ellis said it happens it s not all his fault hall does not buy that , but he promised he would be back he was asked what he had to do mentally i 've just got to get another chance , he said there s nothing wrong with me mentally is that the mindset of a kicker \? that , he said , is the mindset of a man photo the jets' john hall , who is 21 of 32 this season , missed two field goals yesterday , including a 35yard attempt with 12 seconds left in the game \( associated press \)
jets coach al groh s moods unspooled like a skein of yarn last week , sarcasm over his team s fate giving way to a reminiscence of how he first envisioned the jets before the start of the season , tinged with only the slightest bit of melancholy it was almost exactly four months ago that groh first painted the portrait of a team , a portrait he clung to this past week in the week before the start of the regular season , groh explained that he thought the jets had evolved into a tough team , mentally and physically , one that would be tough to beat in every game of the season that turned out to be true the jets were beaten badly only twice 203 by pittsburgh , and 317 by oakland two weeks ago now the jets' toughness will be tested to a degree that even all the keyshawn johnson barbs could not reach today , in the baltimore ravens , they face a team that has the best defense in the game , perhaps one of the best in history the game will decide whether the jets go to the playoffs or complete a collapse that will send them home for the holidays of course , the jets could still make the playoffs even if they lose today , although it would take unlikely subsequent losses by the colts and the steelers to let them slip in the back door and , incredibly , the jets could emerge this afternoon as division champions but the fact that the jets are in the position of trying to stop a disastrous skid to save their season barely moved the emotional needle last week marcus coleman said that groh has had an extra edge in his voice , a sterner glint in his eyes curtis martin said that not making the playoffs would be the hardest thing he has faced in his career but groh was stolid the jets who were once 61 and the darlings of the league for their derringdo and eyepopping comebacks have already blown two chances to clinch a playoff spot and grab the division lead but groh insisted that he viewed this game no differently from any others , with no sense of desperation or higher calling in public , he tried the reverse psychology of all but conceding to baltimore , defiance dripping from every word but privately , he told his team simply if you want it badly enough , take it put in the extra time on the field , and the meetings that are required , and get it done i 'd like to be in this position every year , groh said given all the different scenarios that were painted for this team , yeah , i like this i think a lot of people are saying what s wrong with the team \? in july , they were saying this was going to be a long , hard season for this team i thought it would take 10 to do it they have a chance to get one of those 10 given all the things the team went into the season with , to come out of green bay with something other than that result , without the confidence in themselves and the leadership and the plan , who knows what would have happened in the next week \? without some of those games being pivotal early in the season , who knows what we would be looking at now \? do i feel it s more difficult to prepare for this game than any others \? hardly i feel like i 've been playing this game for 16 weeks is the second week of the playoffs any bigger than the first \? it does n't make any difference whichever you lose , you 're out but that is a tough sales job for groh his players were devastated after the loss to detroit on sunday because they knew the truth all week before the game , they had said they had to beat detroit , because they absolutely , positively , did not want to have to go to baltimore needing a victory the loss was so painful that groh took the unusual step of all but asking reporters to go easy on players in the moments after the game , explaining that a team is vulnerable to rupture after a game in which one part of the team performed well and another in this case , the offense floundered but by the middle of the week , the pity party was over and groh and the jets were back to talking tough coleman seemed to especially take offense at all the talk of the ravens' defense and their goal of a shutout he was nearly angry on friday when discussing the game when somebody is messing with your family , you 've got to do something to defend your family , coleman said they can talk , but do n't overlook what might punch you in the face when you go into the fight , do n't overlook the jab they 're already in the playoffs , so i guess they do n't have to worry about us martin spoke incredulously of the suggestion that the jets might be a bit intimidated by the ravens' defense we 're too grown to be intimidated , he said if you 're still scared , you might not even need to be playing groh has made one change for the game , replacing john hall with brett conway at placekicker whether there are other changes in store the jets could open in a spread offense to try to attack the relatively weaker pass defense of the ravens the jets have certainly changed their tune the toughness has resurfaced and players point out , correctly , that this team seems to prosper most when things are bleakest it is a mindset and resiliency that they believe was forged last season , when injuries obliterated any opportunity to go to the playoffs this season , they have been achingly close to the playoffs for nearly a month , only to find themselves standing on the brink of disaster they will try to call on the toughness that has been their hallmark one more time we 've got two strikes , martin said hopefully , we wo n't get a third one i do n't think we took it for granted i do n't think this team feels we 're that good to be able to say , 'well , we 'll get it' i think we know we 're not that good that s where the disappointment really sets in we start in march you spend almost yearround getting yourself prepared for a time like this you put in 200 some days in training , in getting your mind right , day in and day out , doing things you do n't want to do , for a moment like this to have a letdown is somewhat devastating extra points brett conway , who was signed monday , will be the jets' placekicker today against baltimore , replacing john hall , who will not play hall missed a 35yard field goal last sunday against detroit that would have tied the score with 12 seconds left this is conway s third team this season he is 4 for 4 on field goals none were longer than 26 yards photo coach al groh had an extra edge in his voice last week , marcus coleman said \( associated press \)
brokerage firms have pocketed millions of dollars from the new competitive arrangement in the trading of stock options , while passing on almost none of the money to customers , the securities and exchange commission concluded in a study released yesterday the study was ordered after the introduction of competition in the options markets where options on any given stock historically traded on only one exchange led to a proliferation of payments for order flow , in which specialists at exchanges paid money to brokerage firms in exchange for directing orders to those exchanges the sec surveyed 24 brokerage firms , which it said accounted for nearly all options trades by individual investors of those , it found that 19 had begun taking payments for order flow , and had directed orders to specialists that were paying for it one other firm had established reciprocal relationships that amounted to the same thing , while four firms have so far refused to accept the payments the sec study did not identify the firms that were refusing to accept the payments but it noted that while virtually all the brokerage firms said they tried to send orders to the best markets , the firms that took payments tended to choose markets that were different from the ones that did not have an economic stake in where the order was sent an executive of one options exchange , speaking on the condition he not be identified , said the four not taking payments for order flow were merrill lynch , salomon smith barney , morgan stanley dean witter and painewebber the commission found that from november 1999 through september 2000 the options specialists paid 33 million to retail brokerage firms for directing their orders , with one brokerage firm collecting 6 million and six others getting more than 2 million each none of the large recipients passed those payments on to customers , either through reduced commissions or rebates in fact , the report said , only one firm has significantly reduced retail commissions for executing listed options orders , and another maintains a policy to rebate payments received for order flow to customers but while the payment for order flow has clearly made money for brokerage firms , it is not clear if it has cost customers money those costs would show up in the spreads the difference between what a customer would have to pay for an option and what he could get by selling it at the same time the sec measured such spreads three ways by the first measure , the quoted spread , it appears that spreads fell when competition began , but have since risen back to the previous levels the same picture emerges if one looks at another measure , which the sec called the realized spread , which compares the price a customer gets with the price at a later point in time , and thus takes into effect the informational value of a customers' trade but by the third measure , the effective spread , which simply measures the difference between prices of actual customer buys and sells , the spread fell after competition came in and has remained around the lower level ever since by that measure , which may be the best one , it appears that the costs of payments to brokers are being borne by the specialists , not passed on to customers in higher trading costs some at the commission say they believe that situation will not endure , and that realized spreads will widen as well the ultimate effect on investors remains to be seen , said arthur levitt , the sec chairman , in an interview yesterday the case for continued vigilance is clear until august 1999 , the options exchanges had generally observed a nonaggression policy , in which the exchanges did not try to trade options that historically had been traded at another exchange but then , with a new options exchange on the horizon and the threat of antitrust action , they began to list one another s options , often relying on specialist firms that dominated the trading to bring in customer orders but regulators did not make sure that the competition would arrive in a way that necessarily benefited customers there was no electronic link between exchanges to allow an order to be sent to a market offering a better price , and there were no rules governing where orders were sent in october 1999 , susquehanna , a large specialist operating in different options on various exchanges , began paying for order flow others soon followed , and business began moving toward those specialists the chicago board options exchange , long the dominant exchange , found itself losing business and feared that its specialists , many of whom were not national firms , would be unable to compete effectively to purchase order flow so it instituted a policy of imposing what amounted to a tax of 40 cents a contract on each trade , with that money paid by the specialist or floor trader that made the trade and being available to be paid for order flow other exchanges soon followed with similar plans , although nearly all of them decried the practice another way that competition could have gone would have been a strict timeprice priority , in which the exchange that first posted a price would get the first order at that price but the sec did not require that , and without electronic links it would have been difficult to enforce in the current system specialists on the competing options exchanges typically will promise to match the displayed prices of other exchanges , the sec report said these passive 'price matching' practices may weaken the incentive to display competitive quotes , because displaying a superior quote does not necessarily ensure attracting additional order flow over time , therefore , the quotes being matched may become wider , increasing execution costs to investors reaction from the options exchanges was muted i'm happy the sec is going to continue to look at it , especially in the area of best execution , said peter quick , the president of the american stock exchange similarly , meyer s frucher , the chairman of the philadelphia stock exchange , said payment for order flow is an abomination if it does not come with absolute bestexecution requirements they referred to the obligation of a broker to get the best price for a customer unfortunately , as the report noted , it is not easy to determine how good execution is all the exchanges , and some of the specialists , are putting out information to show they provide quality executions , but the report noted that the reports are not comparable and that only the american stock exchange has been willing to provide information needed by an independent firm hired by some institutional investors to try to compile statistics

here we are , in the year 2000 , and don casey is the coach of a redhot team named the new jersey nets corporate synergy triumphs again did you know that casey s team is 103 since his new organizational ally joe torre motored over the george washington bridge to spread yankee stardust over the thenbedraggled , 215 nets \? suddenly , tantalizingly , the nets are no longer stringing together defeats , like an order of spaghetti calipari stephon marbury turned into derek jeter keith van horn morphed into bernie williams the nets have been sharing , bonding , winning and this all apparently began when they waited an hour after practice one afternoon for a latearriving torre , a development casey took as a sign that his players were desperate enough to listen to someone torre came with tales of accountability , of persistence , of stretching he said that he was lenient with rules but that he wanted guys out on the field , doing exercises together , but , most of all , not thinking about their own statistics , casey said after the nets won their franchise record ninth straight at home on thursday over orlando in case none of this sunk in , torre took the 62yearold casey aside and told him remember one thing your health comes first in 1999 , torre himself experienced the best and worst of times , winning his third world series in four seasons as the yankees' manager , while undergoing treatment for prostate cancer detected last spring all around the metropolitan area , it was a strange and in many ways torturous year for managers and coaches in the face of a winnow frenzy , under attack from outside their organizations and within , they needed a break they needed support they needed each other so bobby valentine graciously took it upon himself to drop in on jim fassel on the day fassel most likely saved his job as coach of the giants fassel s team had been spinning out of control and playoff contention his offense was a mess his defense was in chaos earlier that week , michael strahan had picked a fine time to criticize fassel s leadership , while the coach was home in california , burying his mother enter , bobby v , spiritual healer , beacon of logic in a pregame primer , valentine told fassel that at least he still had his own handpicked staff valentine had to rally the mets into the playoffs , save himself , with one eye on the field and the other on coaches who were forced on him after frontoffice meddlers fired his most trusted aides valentine survived a gutwrenching , lateseason slide and had the last laugh , or until kenny rogers sent him home from atlanta for a postseason cry inspired to better use his assistants while they were still around to assist , fassel handed off playcalling chores to sean payton , his firstyear quarterbacks coach the giants proceeded to slaughter bill parcells s jets , the game fassel had to win he salvaged mediocrity from what would have been calamity with modest success and some timely luck , by this evening he could still be smiling his way into the playoffs over at madison square garden , jeff van gundy has reportedly been asked by superiors to begin exercising his atrophying facial muscles for part of 1999 , it was not easy being van gundy , typically stuck between a checketts and a grunfeld , a ewing and a sprewell after outlasting his adversary , general manager ernie grunfeld , van gundy saw his job teeter on a miami rim during the playoffs the knicks went all the way to the finals the garden president , dave checketts , reluctantly gave up his phil jackson fixation and handed van gundy a lucrative contract extension why is this man frowning \? even parcells , who thought he was going to the super bowl until vinny testaverde limped out of this season , laughs off critics who claim he was unprepared with a seasoned backup as soon as the expected purchase of the jets by the knicks owner charles dolan is complete , parcells could well be dispatched to the garden to teach his company mate van gundy new tricks how to make players and reporters heel and roll over with all these teams living under one corporate roof , maybe parcells will usher in an age of crossfertilization , take his shot at the rangers or the knicks he probably thinks he s a better hockey coach than john muckler poor muckler he s been fired in the newspapers more than casey does anyone remember does anyone even know that this man coached edmonton to the stanley cup \? sorry the travails of a hockey coach barely register on the scale of human suffering the metrostars relieved their coach , bora milutinovic , but that was probably a favor the nets relieved john calipari last march , but that was because he drove everyone crazy calipari s 317 start was the perfect excuse casey , a likable lifer from south jersey , at 215 had the support of the nets' jerseybred owners , and george steinbrenner , too when you 're losing like that , you do n't want to go out for dinner , you do n't want to go out at all , casey said we 're not out of the woods yet , and we 've got to go win on the road but right now , the darkness of armageddon seems to be gone like the world , casey made it across the bridge to the 21st century he s happy to still be home , in new jersey
peter norton , the california software entrepreneur , and his wife , eileen , have announced that they are donating nearly 1 , 000 works by more than 450 artists to 29 institutions most of the works are from the 1990 s in sheer numbers , it is one of the largest gifts of contemporary art by a private donor mr norton , who estimated the total value of the works at more than 3 million , said gifts would go to the tate gallery in london and a variety of united states institutions , ranging from the museum of modern art \( which is to receive nearly two dozen works \) and the whitney museum of american art in manhattan to small and mediumsize museums and college art galleries across the country , though predominantly in the west he said that those museums had demonstrated what mr norton , 56 , called a spunky commitment to new art they include the johnson community college gallery of art in overland park , kan the bard center for curatorial studies at bard college in annandaleonhudson , ny and the kemper museum of contemporary art in kansas city mo the list also includes a museum in manhattan that has not yet opened , the first in the united states to be devoted to sex mr norton s gift is the first donation of art to the forprofit museum , which is planned for fifth avenue and 27th street the 1 , 000 works are generally minor but are nonetheless precious to many of the smaller institutions , some of which are just beginning to assemble collections the betterknown art ranges from setup photographs by cindy sherman to the painter john currin s parodic pornography to joelpeter witkin s surreal and often alarming photographs , the sort of art that can be difficult for small museums to raise money to buy the fiveyearold kemper museum will receive 15 works by artists including the photographer nan goldin dan keegan , the museum s director , described it as the first we 've ever received of fresh stuff , meaning new art the gift fills large holes , he said no good deed is taken at face value in the art world , and there was grumbling among rival collectors that the donation was a way for mr norton to dump unwanted art from his collection in exchange for favorable publicity you can spin anything in any uncomplimentary way or vice versa , mr norton responded we 're focusing our collection , and you can use other words , flattering or otherwise , for focusing , if you 'd like what is the whole point of having rich people wandering around among us \? to engage in certain frivolous mischief that the public benefits from enormously , he continued the donation represents some public good and some public amusement mr norton is not the only prominent collector of new art to receive conspicuous attention lately charles saatchi , the briton whose sensation exhibition just closed at the brooklyn museum of art , is in many ways the opposite of mr norton , with different tastes in art and different political views , although both men share a reputation in art circles for cunning and combativeness their paths have crossed in the past , when they fought in court over the ownership of a painting , the wizard by mr currin mr norton prevailed in that case , and now that picture is part of the donationto the tate mr norton said that the timing of his announcement , just at the closing of sensation , was coincidental the thought did n't even cross my mind , he said if people now see saatchi negatively and i'm not characterizing him that way , the criticism seems unfair to me then our making this gift is at least an example of a different kind of public behavior by a collector it s a token of what a lot of other people are doing more quietly one consequence of the culture wars of the last decade , including the tumult over sensation , in which a controversial work prompted mayor rudolph w giuliani to try to cut off the museum s city financing , seems to have been to increase skepticism toward new art , particularly the abrasive and confrontational works that mr norton sometimes embraces we tend to be interested in alternative communities , gay and lesbian artists , different ethnicities , gender issues , mr norton said of his and his wife s collecting we began , like everyone else , buying sporadically then gradually we figured out what we were doing our strengths are in hispanic and africanamerican art i'm uninterested in medium per se , but a lot of the art also turns out to be photobased because a lot of contemporary art , particularly contemporary art with social content , is photobased some works to be given away \( prints , generally \) are by 20thcentury modernists like miro , munch , jean rouault and jean tinguely with exceptions like ms sherman , chuck close , robert rauschenberg and ed ruscha , few of the contemporary artists in the donation are well known a handful including mr currin , elizabeth peyton , wolfgang tillmans and nari ward are what might be called prominent emerging artists but most of them are young , lesserknown or unknown
on jan 7 , 1982 , in a laboratory at columbia university , a littleknown science professor , laszlo z bito , finished a ninemonth experiment on the eyes of cats in his handwritten data , carefully charted in gray hardcover notebooks , lay the origins of what every pharmaceutical company longs for a blockbuster drug the drug is xalatan , a bestselling eyedrop for glaucoma with 507 million in sales last year and the potential for billions more , most of it pure profit the fouryearold medicine is the equivalent of liquid gold for its manufacturer , the pharmacia corporation the eyedrop earned columbia university about 20 million in royalties last year , and it has made a millionaire of dr bito as well yet there are other , unseen , partners in the creation of xalatan the american taxpayers , who backed dr bito s work with 4 million from the national institutes of health the taxpayers have reaped no financial return on their investment their reward , government officials say , is the eyedrop itself xalatan costs patients 45 to 50 for a tiny bottle that lasts six weeks that price about 1 a day for a drug that staves off blindness may not seem excessive but the key ingredient in that daily dose costs pharmacia only pennies to make , and americans , who live in the only industrialized nation that lacks government restraints on drug prices , pay more than twice what european patients pay for the drug that puts xalatan out of reach for patients like albert russell , a retired optician and parttime blues singer from prince george s county , md mr russell , whose glaucoma has left him nearly blind , lives on an 832amonth social security check he is among the onethird of elderly americans who lack prescription drug coverage , and when he talks about xalatan , he uses the word outrageous to describe its price to officials at pharmacia , the price is fair we are bringing forth innovation , said dr anders harfstrand , the company s vice president for ophthalmology , and innovation always brings a premium in this election year , the cost of prescription medicines is at the center of the political debate with the biomedical revolution yielding a flood of new therapies , drugs are now the fastestgrowing component of the nation s trilliondollarayear medical bill as congress contemplates expanding medicare to include prescription drug coverage , and some states move to bring drug prices more in line with those in foreign countries , the industry is struggling to fend off federal regulation that might limit its ability to set prices at the heart of the fight is dr harfstrand s contention that the price of medication is justified by the extreme risk of failure and high cost of drug discovery an average of 500 million per drug , by the industry s estimate it is an argument that the pharmaceutical industry , one of the world s most lucrative and secretive businesses , has relied on for more than 40 years but it has rarely been put under a microscope , because the industry will not divulge the costs of researching and developing a particular drug to shed light on the subject , the new york times examined xalatan , from its genesis in dr bito s laboratory to its arrival in the medicine cabinets of patients in 57 countries pharmacia declined to disclose specific financial information about the making of the drug but through interviews with key participants and an analysis of publicly available documents , the examination found , among other things , that pharmacia spent no more than 150 , 000 to buy the rights to dr bito s invention from columbia though it later spent tens of millions of its own money to develop the drug , the company acknowledges that dr bito , with the taxpayers' support , provided it an uncut diamond that later became xalatan the industry s reliance on taxpayersupported research characterized as a subsidy by the very same economists whose work the industry relies on is commonplace , the examination also found so commonplace , in fact , that one industry expert is now raising questions about the companies' arguments the expert , dr nelson levy , a former head of research and development at abbott laboratories , who now works as a consultant for industry and the federal government on drug development , bluntly challenged the industry s oftrepeated cost of developing a drug that it costs 500 million to develop a drug , dr levy said in a recent interview , is a lot of bull finally , the examination found , federal officials have abandoned or ignored policies that could have led to lower prices for medicines developed with taxpayer dollars that is partly because the government has lost track of what drugs are invented with its money , and partly , officials say , because the industry resisted government efforts to get involved in pricing as dr bernadine healy , a former director of the national institutes of health , said in a recent interview , we sold away government research so cheap going against the standard
washington , march 24 with two federal judges pressing microsoft and the government to settle their antitrust case soon , microsoft presented a formal written proposal today that would restrain some of the company s business practices , officials said lawyers for the justice department and 19 state attorneys general were studying the proposal tonight to decide whether it was promising enough to warrant weekend negotiations officials said the proposal included so much technical detail that they could not analyze it quickly , although one also said microsoft appears to have come a long way with this , but not as far as i think they should reaching agreement with microsoft , however , is only part of the plaintiffs' task they must also agree among themselves the justice department and the state attorneys general are partners in the suit , and among them hold a range of opinions on what they could accept as a settlement some attorneys general believe anything short of breaking up the company would be ineffective , while others do not want to split up microsoft but officials said proposals that would restructure the company have not been on the table in the talks on tuesday , judge thomas penfield jackson , who is trying the case in federal court here , called lawyers from both sides to his chambers to ask for a progress report on the settlement talks , which have been under way since nov 30 the trial is over all that is left is the verdict but judge jackson is withholding it to give the settlement talks time to run their course on tuesday , however , he made it clear that he was not willing to wait beyond next week and given his findings of fact in the case , published in november , he is almost certain to find microsoft in violation of antitrust law prompting the company to offer concessions today that officials said it had not offered before richard a posner , chief judge of the united states court of appeals in chicago , who is serving as mediator , has been making similar suggestions of urgency for weeks originally he said he wanted to conclude the talks by early february since the meeting with judge jackson this week , state and federal officials have been furiously calling , sending email messages and meeting in an effort to agree on a strategy many of the attorneys general have been in washington for an annual meeting that ended today , and while here some of them have met with joel i klein , head of the justice department s antitrust division but as the attorneys general consider microsoft s proposal , the states have no central decisionmaking process for deciding whether it warrants serious negotiation , requiring lots of phone calls and messages to reach a decision on thursday , after reports in the wall street journal and the washington post indicated that the pace of settlement talks had increased , microsoft s stock gained more than 7 percent today it closed at 1116875 , down 1875 cents both state and federal officials said publicly that they would not comment on the talks , and none would describe the proposal in detail microsoft declined to comment but all of them appear to be keeping their options open to meet in chicago with judge posner this weekend but they have decided not to meet on saturday if government lawyers decide microsoft s new proposal is serious , william h gates , microsoft s chairman , and mr klein might be expected to join the talks , when they do reopen , perhaps as soon as sunday or monday several officials noted , however , that it was not easy to make a decision because of the technical detail in the proposal the last time microsoft and the government settled an antitrust case , in 1994 , mr gates insisted on one detail the ability to add new features to the windows operating system that seemed unimportant to the government at the time but later proved to be the basis for the current suit , which contends in part that microsoft illegally combined its web browser with windows our experience with this is not a happy one , not inspiring of confidence , one official said several officials said it would take time to analyze the document to make sure it did not include similar potential vulnerabilities all of microsoft s proposals , they said , are for changes in conduct the company has made it clear , in the settlement talks and in public , that it would not accept a breakup of the company breakup proposals , the company has said , are an extreme and reckless resolution to the government s antitrust suit but some government officials think anything short of that would not be effective as one put it today if we do n't make fundamental changes , then soon enough we 'll be fighting this battle all over again and when mr klein met with leaders of the technology industry last fall , asking them for public support of proposed sanctions against microsoft without saying exactly what he had in mind he received something short of enthusiastic responses without industry support , a stringent remedy might be hard to enact until now , microsoft and government lawyers have been meeting separately with judge posner in chicago one day , the judge would talk to one side , the next day to the other and then the judge would try to draw the two sides together if the talks go forward next week , the two sides will probably meet face to face for the first time since their initial meeting with the judge on nov 30 at one stage of the talks early this year , judge posner asked the state and federal officials , one by one , for their proposed remedies , and as each official offered his idea , the suggestions were all over the map from restraining microsoft s behavior to breaking up the company never have all of the parties the justice department and the 19 states agreed on a common approach among the conduct remedies that have been discussed , officials said , is forcing microsoft to publish a common price list for windows so the company could not use prices to penalize or reward computer makers for their level of cooperation with the company another idea would force microsoft to publish the codes that allow software writers to link their programs to windows codes known as applications program interfaces in a uniform , formal way if the settlement talks fail , judge jackson s verdict could come

from dawn to decadence 500 years of western cultural life , 1500 to the present by jacques barzun 877 pp new york harpercollins publishers 36 the great books are back , according to a report in the new york times on jan 18 but thanks in part to jacques barzun they never did leave the curriculum at columbia now , making timelessness timely , barzun presents his account of all the great works of the western mind in the last five centuries if from dawn to decadence is not a great book itself , it is certainly a great achievement encyclopedic without being discontinuous , the book hardly seems as long , as carefully constructed or as densely packed as it is though the ideas it explains are often complicated , the explanations it offers are limpidly clear , sparkling with biographical anecdote and countercanonical observations , entirely free of those deserts of abstraction unrelieved by example often found in works of cultural theory this is the american style , and barzun owns it arriving from france as a teenager in the 1920 s , he became one of the leading lights of an exceptional generation of immigrant intellectuals now 92 and retired from teaching , he is no less the veritable pic , as french students call those classmates who remind them of pico della mirandola that young man of the renaissance who knew everything history is what this pic knows best , and barzun s two histories of the 19thcentury intellectual world have become classics but over the last halfcentury he has been focusing on a critique of scholarship and teaching from dawn to decadence will find many readers waiting , because it has been 17 years since barzun last published an oldfashioned cultural history cultural means it includes technology , sex and cuisine and both high and popular entertainments oldfashioned means it relies on narrative , and instead of subscribing to a theory it deploys dozens of them the book s form , a gallery of remarkable profiles , from the once familiar juan luis vives to the inevitable mozart , is one of which the pioneers of cultural history , germaine de stal and voltaire \( also profiled \) , would have approved and it allows barzun to display his extraordinary facility for finding unfamiliar facts about familiar characters and teasing the expectations of all levels of readers thus florence nightingale and oliver wendell holmes sr get feature treatment under boldface subheads , while that fount of modernist poetry , walt whitman , is limited to a paragraph and karl marx to a page of very short \( though very intelligent \) shrift the shift of emphasis has deeper significance , suggesting one theory that barzun finds almost universally applicable a point of view that a historian of ideas might label aristocratic pessimism punctuating his narrative at regular intervals with cross sections on cities in time , barzun devotes the last of these , on new york , to a retrospect of what he sees as the decadent culture of 1995 from an imagined second renaissance 300 years in the future it is both a virtuoso performance and an epitome of what will surely be seen as the book s major weakness , a curmudgeonly view of the century of the common man despite his view that things in general are going downhill , barzun is undiminished in his scholarship , research and polymathic interests like diderot , one of his subjects , and unlike too many professors of literature , barzun can keep up to date and comment intelligibly on almost anything human minds may light upon a musical amateur who celebrates science and has made sense of nearly every art in several languages , barzun even knows enough mathematics to defend diderot s \( though it must be said that to cite giuseppe peano as the inventor of the interlingua language instead of the axiomatizer of arithmetic is like citing arnold schoenberg as the designer of the 10by10 chessboard \) barzun reconceives people , events and even words by rehistoricizing them he deftly revises reputations as unsung as that of the swiss liberal republican jcl simonde de sismondi or as canonical as that of bach he also shakes up the meanings of words , like creationist , victorian , bourgeois , pragmatic , gas and esprit \( a quality he often displays \) even unobtrusive but significant social facts are here , including the invention of silent reading and the spoon all this will delight readers who find none of these details in the popular media , and provide prima facie evidence that the decline of history has been exaggerated even by barzun the superb range and clarity of barzun s writing are also on display his prose is fitting and never florid , full of lapidary judgments he is willing to risk letting the authors of the great books themselves set him a standard , praising the hard work and deliberate art of prose in pascal and lincoln , and criticizing flaubert s syntax as often slovenly , gertrude stein s writing as stutterings and joyce s language in finnegans wake as a blur
newark , june 7 as a former boxer who once dared to fight with a broken cheekbone , jim florio , the politician , has endured countless analogies to his middleweight pugilist days he lost the race for governor three times , once by 1 , 797 votes out of the 23 million cast , only to win the state house by an impressive margin in 1989 but after the knockout he suffered last night at the hands of jon s corzine , mr florio , a scrappy veteran of 16 political campaigns , may never again be described as a comeback kid mr florio has not spoken publicly about his plans for the future and before the returns were in on tuesday , he would not say whether he would ever run again his friends and close associates said they thought there was little chance mr florio , 62 , a presence in new jersey politics for three decades , would run again for elective office mr florio , who lost the race , 42 percent to 58 percent , spent the day with his wife , lucinda , in their home in metuchen a campaign spokesman , jim lanard , said mr florio was commiserating with friends and mulling his future after months of media attention , mr florio , he said , would not speak to the press he needs some privacy , mr lanard said besides , today is mr corzine s day having lost his previous two races , as well as the support of the state s democratic organization , mr florio , political analysts said , would have a hard time convincing even the most stalwart loyalists to fight with him another day i ca n't imagine him running again , said cliff zukin , a political science professor at rutgers university although he publicly conceded the race last night with graciousness and a smile , mr florio , friends said , is still disappointed that his opponent spent 35 million to his 2 million just as disheartening , they say , is that a liberal democrat chose to highlight the 28 billion tax increase mr florio championed as governor lost in the welter of attack ads , they said , was the fact that mr florio only did so because he was faced with a 600 million deficit and a court order to increase education spending in poor districts at one point , three different candidates were using florio s tax in their commercials , said chuck chiarello , head of the atlantic county democratic party it was one man against the universe , he said it made for pretty insurmountable odds mr florio performed well in the southern portion of the state , especially in areas he represented during his 15 years in congress but in the more densely populated north , where mr corzine enjoyed the support of the party , mr florio lost badly it s hard to make your voice heard when the democratic organization is against you , mr zukin said his supporters said the negative tone of the race obscured mr florio s accomplishments , and the media , always hungry for a good fight , helped pump up the tax issue during his years as governor , they pointed out , mr florio pushed through the nation s toughest assault weapon ban , cut insurance rates by 20 percent and solidified his reputation as a protector of the environment during his first year as governor , there was even talk of a president florio but that was then as they took stock today , campaign workers , supporters and friends said they hoped that at the very least mr florio s legacy would be rehabilitated they took heart that after years of deriding mr florio for his tax hike , most newspapers in the state endorsed him for senate , praising his record , principles and commitment to working people others said they thought such a highprofile loss would focus national attention on the need for campaign finance reform representative william pascrell jr of passaic , one of the few elected officials to stand by mr florio s side last night , said he hoped the race would prod congress to move on tougher rules for campaign finance and spending if ever we needed proof , it was this election , he said as for the future , mr florio still has his law practice and a consulting business he could always go back to teaching public policy , which is what he did at rutgers university before he decided to run for the senate there is even talk he could be part of a gore administration , if there is one but one thing is sure , associates said mr florio will not spend his days in the pursuit of personal wealth it might sound like puff , but jim florio is devoted to the public good , said angelo genova , a friend and a lawyer who worked for the florio administration he s not in it for the ego , or for the power karen kessler , who has worked as mr florio s fundraiser since 1989 , said mr florio is happiest as a public servant after he lost the governor s race , he had no idea what he would do , and believe me , today is the same , she said this time , however , things are different he has experienced life outside politics , and at least he and his wife have a car , a home and furniture , none of which they had after mr florio was voted out of trenton in 1993 he s not in the same place , ms kessler said
it was a sedate cocktail party on a summer evening in kennebunkport , me , when the wild man of the bush clan wobbled up to an old friend of his parents , a prim , welldressed matron who had recently turned 50 , her hair pulled tightly back from her forehead in the most severe way george w had enjoyed a few too many drinks , and his family members knew enough to watch him nervously so , he asked her , by way of conversation , what s sex like after 50 , anyway \? it was a vintage bush moment , recounted by friends , the kind of incident that made young george s buddies laugh and cringe at the same time he could be hilarious company , but also often outrageous and childish some acquaintances were offended by what they saw as mr bush s arrogance and immaturity , by his penchant for drinking too much and thinking too little even his wife , laura , wanted him to grow up bush was acting like a little kid in those days , recalled mel turner , a fellow republican activist in west texas in the 1970 s and 80 s he was an immature richkid brat not everyone is that harsh , and many of his friends welcomed the bombastic bushkin , as they called him , as a breath of fresh air but the upshot was that as he approached 40 , an age when al gore was already a senator running for president , george w bush was just a heavydrinking , funloving oilman struggling to control his temper , salvage his business and hold on to his marriage then mr bush did grow up a classic late bloomer , mr bush offers reassurance for 40yearolds everywhere just 14 years later , he is a multimillionaire , a successful businessman who turned around the texas rangers and prospered with them the overwhelmingly popular governor of texas , the only one to be elected to a second consecutive fouryear term the abouttobecrowned republican nominee for president , running ahead in the polls and , apparently most important of all in his own priorities , the very happily married husband of laura mr bush redeemed himself and is today very much a product of that redemption on the campaign trail , it lends him an air of authenticity , allowing him to come across as a decent man today without the baggage of having always been a squeakyclean , applepolishing mama s boy there is a popular image of mr bush s younger days , fueled by latenight television jokes , suggesting that he spent much of the 1970 s stupefied in a drugfueled haze but mr bush s elliptical comments suggesting that he used drugs before 1974 may have led people to think that he was wilder than he really was , and the fuller portrait of him in the 1970 s and early 1980 s indicates that his behavior was more callow than criminal many of his friends say that by the standards of his time he was pretty straitlaced i do n't know why he said all this about drugs , said diane paul , his girlfriend from 1970 until 1972 he never did anything like that he was the straightest guy i knew the most we ever did was go to a party and drink beer mr bush s problem , it seems , was not so much that he was dissolute as that he was irresolute he continued plodding along , acting young and irresponsible when he was well into middle age , until he faced a personal crisis a common criticism of mr bush is that he has enjoyed a charmed life , without ever having to struggle , and there is something to the idea that he has been incredibly lucky and privileged at many junctures but the truth is also more complex , and on his own terms life in the 1970 s and 80 s was no stroll through a sundappled park with oil prices plunging , mr bush struggled to keep his business going he was deeply pained that he had lost money that friends had invested with him and most cutting of all , some friends say , he worried that his wife was so sick of his boorish behavior that she would consider leaving him and taking their twin daughters these pressures , instead of breaking mr bush , changed him there is no neat onesentence explanation for how he grew up it was a gradual process , stretching from his arrival at harvard business school in 1973 until after his 40th birthday in 1986 indeed , his friends say that he is still settling down but one of the keys to his turnaround seems to have been his succession of failures in politics and business , which acquaintances said humbled him and left him much more likable another was pressure from mrs bush so mr bush gave up alcohol and turned toward religion he remade himself , and then his tremendous people skills , backed by his family connections , took over and propelled him in both business and politics less ambitious than competitive what makes george bush tick \? in the case of the father and former president , the answer arguably is fairly straightforward ambition and a fierce sense of competition the younger george bush is more complicated , and for him the answer reflects one of the critical differences between him and his father george w is fiercely competitive , but for most of his life he was not ferociously ambitious that combination helps explain both the stuttering first twothirds of his life and the triumphant latest third
think of this past christmas as the new hampshire primary of electronic commerce the race is far from over , but it was the first highstakes match now the winners are relishing their momentum and the losers are licking their wounds , rethinking their strategies and considering whether to drop out altogether the actual returns will dribble in over the next month or two as the key players announce their fourthquarter earnings some web sites that are private or part of bigger companies will never announce results assembled below are what amount to exit polls early survey data on television advertising , online promotion , site traffic and actual sales that indicate who the winners were , if not the exact margin of victory the results confirm that the leading emerchants continue to be the early internet players especially amazoncom , which is pulling away from the pack but despite the tens of billions of dollars in venture capital invested to start whateveryoucanthinkofcom , almost none of these new internet companies appeared to get any traction this christmas , despite their outsized advertising spending rather , it was the internet affiliates of wellknown store chains especially toys r us , kb toys , j c penney and the gap that surged toward the top of the ratings as more people go online , they do n't click on banner ads , they key in www companynamecom or www brandname com said stephanie shern , director of retail practice at ernst young , which provided some of the exit poll data as in politics , advertising can help a web site get noticed , but it is not enough to win the top 10 television advertisers among the online stores averaged four times the traffic of the next 40 below the top 10 , advertising did not correlate with traffic or sales there is some evidence that web sites got a return from buying the expensive anchor tenant promotion on america online s shopping channel placement that is often part of a multimilliondollar promotion deal aol s anchor tenants had an average of 48 million visitors , compared with 17 million for those that bought the less expensive gold promotion nonetheless , big merchants that did not spend any money on aol averaged 25 million visitors of course , a few debutantes appeared to be attracting business , including 800com , an electronics store drugstorecom and egreetingscom , a gift emporium but for every winner there were dozens of losers that are unlikely to be around next christmas a few powerful brands are starting to come to the fore , ms shern said the chart brought together here is data from a variety of sources about the leading sites in 10 of the most popular ecommerce categories it includes both the mostvisited sites and those that spent the most on advertising merchants are ranked by the amount of traffic on their sites here is what the headings mean has trad outlets means that a web site is affiliated with a traditional store chain or catalog company millions of visits a count of how many times people went to each site from nov 15 to dec 19 , as measured by nielsen netratings , which monitors the behavior of 38 , 000 home internet users surfing in the office , where many people shop , is not measured rather than the oftenused measurement of unique visitors , this number is the cumulative total of times that individual users visited the sites thus , stores that attracted repeat visitors and , possibly , repeat sales score higher any site that did not attract at least 01 percent of the audience or 125 , 000 visitors in any of the weeks measured is shown with an asterisk advertising impressions a measure of network , cable and local television advertising from nov 1 to dec 12 , compiled by nielsen media research it shows cumulative impressions , with one impression equaling one person seeing one commercial nielsen counted advertisements that mainly featured internet sites ads for store chains like the gap or walmart that simply mentioned a web site address were not counted aol status this is a crude proxy for how much money web sites spent to promote themselves online america online , the biggest internet advertising medium , offers three tiers of promotion indicates the site was an anchor tenant , the most expensive deal with the most elaborate online exposure stands for a gold promotion and for the least expensive silver status buyers a measure of where people did their holiday shopping , based on a survey , commissioned by ernst young , of 1 , 283 internet users on dec 26 and 27 seventy percent of those surveyed said they had done some holiday shopping online these respondents then were asked if they had made purchases at any of 50 top online retailers the number shown is the percentage of the online shoppers who said they bought from each store if no number is listed , that means ernst did not ask about the store tv efficiency a ratio of how many tv advertising impressions a web site bought for each visitor to its site those with the lowest numbers either had very effective commercials or other ways to bring people to their sites big numbers , however , may mean the money spent on television was for naught

motherkind by jayne anne phillips 292 pp new york alfred a knopf 24 kate is daughter to a mother whose cancer is killing her slowly in the guest room she is mother to a baby tumbling through the vertiginous time travel of its first year she lives with a kind and tolerant man if herbert marcuse had n't formulated repressive tolerance , kate could have she is stepmother to his two rambunctious and suspicious sons but who is she \? a caretaker , she thinks at times an ayah in an indulgent indian household \( she had traveled in india and nepal when younger , a poet , and free \) tugged at four extremities her heart stuck on center kate is staked out over the crossroads of death and three different orders of life , all of them hers or none of them hers motherkind tells of a year or so in the life of kate and her family pregnant , she brought katherine , her mother , up from her home in the south to live out a last remission that will give way to a terminal decline her baby , alexander , is born after a hard labor and delivery , followed by the nightmarish swoon of the first months' sleeplessness and troubled nursing it will be a while before matthew , her doctor lover , can marry her meanwhile she is saddled with ministering part time to the moodiness and confusion of matthew s sons , sam and jonah , and dealing with the gravitational pull upon father and sons of matthew s wife , whose infidelity smashed their marriage and whose resentments have slowed their divorce jayne anne phillips has written searchingly of several kinds of wild side in machine dreams and the short stories of fast lanes she treated the unsettled and the outraged , displaced to the edges of our domestic and social structures in shelter , a glittering partgothic novel that received less notice than it deserved , it was the storms from inside and outside sweeping through a girls' camp in the west virginia mountains motherkind the name of a householdhelp service that kate resorts to is different it aims , i think , to be a wild side but at home and under wraps like the fox gnawing out the vitals of the boy who hid it inside his shirt and smiled phillips s gift is for stretching lives taut until they shriek like guitar strings snapping here she stretches them more quietly in what has become a familiar genre a domestic novel about characters struggling to decode the lean messages of suburban existence through the encumbered signals that carry them her oncewandering kate had thought of herself as an adept of the lean now , confronted with two essentials birth and death she is clogged by errands , birthday parties , emotional balancings and the expectations of others all too frequently motherkind and its own lean message \( kate s plight is as real as many another literary way we live now \) is clogged in the same sense and by these same things perhaps phillips has identified too closely with her protagonist a fictional character is engendered by artistic compassion and artistic ruthlessness however lavishly fashioned , it requires relinquishing birds do n't fly unless nourished , but nourishment s only purpose is flight it is a dialectic phillips has previously wielded , often thrillingly there are some splendid passages in the new novel sometimes it is a phrase kate grew larger as her mother grew smaller the ringmaster s whipcrack that launches the performance or another , as kate nuzzles the justborn alexander and feels the pump and peppered skittle of his heart there is a longer , climactic exchange that evokes the nobility of a mother s and daughter s hail and farewell it comes a while before the end katherine can still walk , and has fallen at night trying to put her dog outside she did n't want to disturb kate , she tells her and kate hugs her with a convulsive oh , do n't ! then , whispering desperately , without thinking 'how much longer do we have \? think of all the nights i wo n't hear you ! you wo n't be able to call me ' kate feels her anguish as a wave and her mother , borne up , floats above it her touch on kate s hair lingered like a passage of shadow 'i wo n't need to then i 'll have gone , just as full of hopes for you' on the other hand , there are many pages that the writing fails to bring to life there is simply too much suburban domesticity lacking the kind of transformation that an updike or an anne tyler or an alice mcdermott is able to achieve talk of furniture , diapers , confidences with a neighbor and with a young woman from motherkind are like picking up on a crossed wire in a culturally enlightened area code matthew s consolatory wit is not very witty for that reason , perhaps , it fails to console set scenes a birthday party , a lunch , even kate s and matthew s tardy wedding are full of accurate but inert detail , adorned as much as written equally an adornment and with little conviction are occasional references to kate s poetry the emotions in motherkind and the questions it explores are well founded and convincing , though more as confirmation than illumination the relationships katherine and kate , katherine and her former husband , kate and matthew , kate and her stepsons are thoughtfully set out with an exception or two , though , the relationships are more real than the characters in them matthew , his two sons and several others occupy a good deal of space without really filling it in katherine there is the faint perfume of a life proper , independent and , in her dying , open to understated discovery perhaps the most suggestive character is waylon , kate s father , who is divorced from katherine big , stolid , inexpressive , he is taken for granted yet , on a brief visit , he fills the page he is the sound of silence in a world of talk my father lives in the unspoken , kate says , and when i'm with him i live there too it is her only real bit of travel out of the motherkind world \( apart from some unachieved dream scenes from her time in india \) , and for the reader it s stepping outdoors after too long inside for all that she is protagonist and moral center of her story , kate is curiously indistinct she is faultlessly placed and constructed she is genuinely admirable , yet her situation is more affecting than she is perhaps it is because through much of motherkind the events that befall kate and the people she comes up against are recounted not as themselves but as her feelings about them remarks are n't literature , gertrude stein once said feelings are n't , either

the chicago bulls had crept to within a layup , staging a furious comeback from 25 points down in the fourth quarter they had done almost everything needed to shock madison square garden back to life and put the fear of losing into a suddenly dysfunctional knicks team if they had only remembered to guard larry johnson standing behind the top of the arc almost on the left wing as lonesome as the united center in june the knicks forward took a pass from latrell sprewell with 471 seconds left last night , aimed and fired in a 3pointer that effectively ended chicago s run that shot not only provided impetus for a 9588 new york victory , it also concluded a blowout turned wild thriller at the end , amid the gasps , one could barely tell the difference between the national basketball association s haves and havenots we lost focus , johnson said in a relieved knick locker room it s the nba , and they kept playing hard those guys showed heart and character for those final , frenetic minutes , the bulls \( 527 \) treated their threegame winning streak like a precious metal they could not part with that they came in with the worst record in the league did not seem to matter they were a bunch of players who loved the game , taking it to the home team on its own floor , much like the old bulls of youknowwho disgusted with their team s meltdown , the garden fans seemed on the precipice of actually cheering for them elton brand nearly completed a stirring comeback by putting back a missed free throw by ron artest to pull chicago to 9088 with 1 minute 6 seconds left it was improbable , given that the bulls trailed , 8053 , with 24 seconds left in the third quarter it was even more stunning because the knicks \( 2113 \) were on their way laughing on the bench , pounding one another s fists about to beat a team by more than 25 points for the first time all season , they looked more conquering than complacent you get what you deserve in this game , an exasperated coach jeff van gundy said we deserved to be up by 25 , and we deserved to almost lose the game that is the bottom line i am going to keep it at that that is the best way i can explain it after a barrage of marcus camby dunks and johnson 3pointers in the third quarter he made 4 of 6 in the game and ended with a teamhigh 19 points it was clear to see how times had drastically changed , the knicks turning to the bulls to improve their confidence and inflate their statistics but first gradually and then stunningly , it happened artest , the active forward who left st john s after his sophomore year , led chicago with 24 points none of his field goals was larger than when he dropped in a 3pointer from the left wing with less than five minutes left , a shot that trimmed the knicks' lead to 8677 then toni kukoc fed center chris anstey for a dunk and artest scored inside on a tough layup suddenly , it was a game , with only 5 points separating the teams with 3 35 left the bulls' scoring binge at one point reached 266 for the quarter , chicago outscored new york , 3315 the knicks would have to fight for it with 3 11 left , patrick ewing \( 14 points , 14 rebounds \) drove to the middle and was fouled hard by anstey the two traded words and nearly shoves after a double technical , ewing hit two free throws sprewell then stole the inbound pass and scored on a layup to give new york a 9point cushion with 2 49 remaining still , the bulls would not fade they parlayed two kukoc steals in the backcourt into points to slice the lead to 9085 after artest s miss and brand s putback , the fear factor grew i was exhausted , brand said after scoring 22 points and grabbing 7 rebounds we wanted to be seen as a team that is going to fight and fight and fight for all of chicago s resilience , the game appeared over in the second quarter during an 111 knick run to close out the half , john wallace scored 7 points none more vicious than a dunk over trevor ruffin with 233 seconds left receiving a pass from johnson at the freethrow line , he took one dribble and soared over the bulls' front line depositing the ball over ruffin , who fouled wallace on the play , the knick reserve was showered with applause as the teams left the court at halftime , it was not hard to see which had been dealt a better hand this season his bulls racked by injury , coach tim floyd used two players in the first half , dedric willoughby and chris carr , who were not even on the roster until monday matt maloney , waived by the houston rockets before the season , signed with the club last week and was only playing his third game of the season and yet the knicks still needed johnson s timely 3pointer to put the game away spree penetrated and he found me , johnson said i hit a couple early and i was feeling good we almost blew it , sprewell added it s not like we quit playing totally but mentally , we just were n't in the game as much rebounds after patrick ewing sat the final 16 minutes of saturday s loss against cleveland , jeff van gundy s relationship with his franchise center has been questioned van gundy tried to put the matter to rest before last night s game , saying he had met with most of his key players last month about sacrificing in the final quarter those decisions are never going to be easy , he said it was n't a planned thing i talked to all our core guys about the possibility , which is why i did n't feel it was necessary to have another meeting photos larry johnson of the knicks scoring 2 of his 19 points last night against the bulls' elton brand \( 42 \) and

atlanta , jan 23 a sluggish winter storm dripped a crippling coating of ice on much of the southeast today , cracking thousands of drooping pine trees and cutting off electric power to more than 500 , 000 households , mostly in atlanta from northeast georgia to central north carolina , hundreds of roads were closed by fallen pines , never the sturdiest trees even in normal conditions in urban areas , the trees generally took power lines down with them , leaving many neighborhoods in atlanta a chaotic mix of scattered tree limbs , live wires and nonfunctioning traffic lights in 18 years , this is the most ice i 've ever seen accumulate , said tom moore , senior meteorologist with the weather channel , which is based here the saving grace was that it was a sunday morning many other atlantans were also thankful the storm did not occur a week later , when the super bowl will be played at the georgia dome downtown about 320 , 000 homes in atlanta a quarter of the metropolitan area were without power by this evening , said lisa frederick , a spokeswoman for georgia power atlanta is one of the most heavily forested cities in the country , and because of the large number of fallen trees , the company said it might be two days before power is restored in some cases , lights that came back on went off again an hour later when another tree succumbed it was the worst storm in the area since crews took a week to restore power to 570 , 000 customers after a blizzard in march 1993 , ms frederick said most homes in the region are heated by forcedair furnaces , which require electricity with temperatures hovering around freezing , many people huddled near fireplaces or relied on kerosene heaters , which sold briskly at stores inevitably , the reliance on heaters produced a rash of house fires , the worst of which killed three people on the southwest side of the city early today many families lost both their power and their roofs to falling trees kent m harper arrived at his dekalb county home this morning after his evening shift at the post office to find two large tree limbs protruding from his roof it was like somebody had thrown a spear or a javelin through it , said mr harper , a transportation supervisor , surveying the icicles building up in his living room i knew i should have had those pine trees cut down his family , like many others , cooked lunch in an iron skillet in the fireplace chain saws echoed throughout the city as people tried to move limbs covered with a halfinch of ice many people in the northern suburbs were trapped in their subdivisions until someone with a saw or a winch could clear an entrance road even walking was hazardous , as any branch could fall with a gunfire crack and a shower of ice i heard an explosion , and then i ran , said germaine dozier , a receptionist who was walking in her midtown neighborhood this morning this huge branch fell right where i was standing it was like wartime or something the ice coated about 40 counties in the northern third of georgia , according to the state emergency management agency , and conditions in seven counties were serious enough that the state declared emergencies , urging motorists not to go out similar conditions prevailed in parts of southeastern tennessee and western portions of the carolinas mr moore said the ice was the result of a layer of warm air that floated atop a colder layer near the ground without the warmth , the rain might have turned to less damaging snow , he said the storm extended from alabama , where 33 , 000 homes and businesses were without power , to around greensboro , nc north carolina s major utilities reported approximately 20 , 000 customers without electricity today after parts of that state got a mixture of sleet , rain and snow but , a carolina power and light spokeswoman , sally ramey , said not all of the power losses could be blamed on the weather parts of south carolina got up to 6 inches of snow late saturday , and traffic on interstate 85 came to a standstill in several spots because of slippery pavement and accidents hartsfield international airport in atlanta , the world s busiest , was open through the day , but many flights were delayed for deicing in central tennessee , where 35 inches of snow fell on saturday , a deicing truck nicked the wing of a northwest airlines dc9 at nashville international airport , the associated press reported no one was injured , said a spokeswoman for northwest , mary beth schubert jet slides off runway charlotte , nc , jan 23 \( ap \) a us airways jet skidded off the runway after landing at charlottedouglas international airport on saturday as a storm blanketed the area with snow and freezing rain none of the 142 passengers were hurt a us airways spokeswoman , sharon taylor , said flight 2399 , an md80 coming from orlando , fla , landed at 7 26 pm and was turning from the runway onto a taxiway when it slid onto a grassy area everyone was fine , ms taylor said we offloaded the passengers on mobile air stairs most of the passengers made their connecting flights , she said photo in centerville , ga , wes cups , a

it s as if keyshawn johnson were a used subaru the jets are desperately trying to trade him away rather than renegotiate his contract and it is becoming clear that the contract johnson wants would not only make him the highestpaid wide receiver in football , it would also make him the highestpaid player according to several nfl officials with knowledge of the situation , johnson believes he is worth 9 million or even 10 million a year those officials also say johnson wants a signing bonus of some 15 million giving a wide receiver that kind of money , the jets reason , would destroy their team s financial structure and create havoc with the salary cap , which is currently 62172 million if johnson were to receive 10 million a season , he alone would eat up roughly 16 percent of the team s cap johnson s agent , jerome stanley , would neither confirm nor deny what his client is seeking the best thing for me to do at this point is not say a word , he said i have no comment there is no doubt that the jets are continuing their aggressive efforts to trade johnson they have spoken to at least six teams and as many as 10 according to league officials , jets general manager bill parcells plans to continue to shop johnson at the owners' meetings that begin next sunday in palm beach , fla do n't believe any nonsense about how parcells is not upset with johnson parcells has explicitly told several football executives that he takes johnson s contract stance to mean that the wide receiver is no longer a team player the baltimore ravens remain a strong contender to get johnson , despite the public stance of coach brian billick that talks between the two teams have cooled billick and parcells will most likely talk at the owners' meetings i think bill , rightfully so , is exploring his options , the ravens' principal owner , art modell , said of parcells he s talking to a bunch of teams and taking his time with this from what i understand , there is a lot of interest in keyshawn a lot of teams are listening there is an even difference of opinion about whether johnson s demands are outrageous many executives do believe that a team cannot give a contract of that magnitude to any one player , unless he is a star quarterback they agree that the jets should trade johnson and think it is the wave of the future in football football is going to become like baseball , one head coach said you are going to see more nfl teams say , 'this player wants too much money , he s too expensive , so let s try to trade him now and get something for him' bill parcells is just the first of many who will take this approach but others point to the current pay rate for a top receiver , about 7 million a season , and ask what the difference is between 7 million or 8 million or 10 million they say it is more than they want to pay , but that is the way of modern football after all , two years in the future , when the salary cap has increased and johnson s contract is up , a 10 millionayear wide receiver might not be so ludicrous it might be the going rate for a player of johnson s caliber one owner who the jets have contacted about johnson said 8 million or 9 million does not scare me not at all it does frighten the jets , which is why johnson is in this situation to begin with rethinking replay there is an increasing possibility that instant replay might not be approved by the owners when they gather for their annual meetings this month the national football league reinstated replay on a oneyear trial basis last season it was used from 1986 to 1991 , but was then dropped until last season i'm hopeful that it will be voted in again , said minnesota vikings coach dennis green , a member of the competition committee , but it will be difficult instant replay , for the most part , worked remarkably well this past season but the impending replay battle shows a weak point of how the nfl , and other sports , sometimes do business owners tend to vote on how things affect their teams or seasons instead of looking at the big picture , which is that the current replay system , over all , works and is better for the league for replay to pass again , 24 of 31 teams would need to approve it last season , replay was adopted on a 283 vote some league officials believe that if a vote were taken today , replay might fall one or two votes short the ricky williams mess the latest complaints by new orleans running back ricky williams are an attempt by the player to force the team to trade him , one saints official said but the chances of the team s trading williams are slim to none a trade would wreak havoc with the team s salary cap in an interview with sports illustrated , williams ripped his teammates for lacking pride , said the team should be moved to san antonio because new orleans was not a nice place to live , and said that his incentivebased contract was a mess and that he wanted to restructure it williams s words should not have come as a surprise several months ago , williams said the same things , including how much he wanted out of new orleans the saints now have a mess on their hands they have an obviously unhappy key player on their roster who has criticized his teammates and the city he lives in but the saints cannot trade him without hurting their salary cap situation because his entire contract would count against this year s cap and it will be almost impossible for them to smooth over the feelings of many saints players , who even before the sports illustrated article did not like williams now they probably do not want to be in the same room with him this will pass , one saints official said the team is crossing its fingers hoping that is true vikings go to plan b now that dan marino has decided to retire instead of becoming the minnesota vikings' quarterback , the team is turning its attention back to jeff george the vikings will have to do some serious fence mending with him since they at first had decided that george was not in their plans but george is willing to listen , and coach dennis green is good at getting players to see his side of a situation photo the jets have been shopping keyshawn johnson to other teams because they are worried that his contract demands will ruin the team s financial structure \( barton silverman the new york times \)

following are excerpts from a news conference yesterday by vice president al gore , as recorded by the new york times the american people have shown great patience in these extraordinary days they understand the importance of getting this election right that is why we have asked the florida courts to recognize what observers of this process know to be true that is that the state of florida has certified a vote count that is neither complete nor accurate i understand that this process needs to be completed in a way that is expeditious as well as fair we cannot jeopardize an orderly transition of power to the next administration , nor need we do so two weeks ago , i proposed to forego any legal challenge if governor bush would let a complete and accurate count go forward , either in the counties where it was proposed or in the full state of florida he rejected that proposal and instead became the first to file lawsuits , and now two weeks later , thousands of votes still have not been counted this morning we have proposed to the court in tallahassee a plan to have all the ballots counted in seven days , starting tomorrow morning , and to have the court proceedings fully completed one or two days after that let me repeat the essence of our proposal today seven days starting tomorrow for a full and accurate count of all the votes once we have that full and accurate count of the ballots cast , then we will know who our next president is and our country can move forward unfortunately , just about an hour ago , governor bush s lawyers rejected this proposal instead , they have proposed two weeks of additional court proceedings and additional hearings right up to the dec 12 deadline for seating electors , and under their plan , none of the thousands of votes that remain to be counted would be counted at all i believe this is a time to count every vote , and not to run out the clock this is not a time for delay , obstruction and procedural roadblocks as i 've said , i believe it s essential to our country that there be no question , no cloud over the head of the next president , whether it be me or governor bush we need to be able to say that there is no legitimate question as to who won this election , so that we can bring this country together that is what we seek , and so i urge governor bush to support our proposal to bring this process to a fair , expeditious and truly democratic conclusion q mr vice president , in terms of your challenge in miamidade , what is wrong with republicans showing up at the election canvassing board and expressing their displeasure at the process \? a well , i think we all saw the videotape and audio recordings of that incident , and i think everybody can make his or her own judgment about it , but that question is going to be decided , or at least looked at , by the court in tallahassee q polls this week suggest that 60 percent of the american public is starting to tire of this , and that while they feel sympathetic to your situation and think it s a great idea to count all of the votes , that it s time to move on and put this behind us you seem to be losing public sentiment can you address that \? a well , i said during the election to many of you that i did n't think the polls mattered , and on election day , sure enough , contrary to the polls , joe lieberman and i carried the popular vote nationally by 300 , 000 votes i'm quite sure that the polls do n't matter in this because it s a legal question and the principle again is a very simple one when people cast votes , the votes should be counted and there are more than enough uncounted votes to decide the outcome of this election there are thousands of them and the margin is in the hundreds what is wrong with counting the votes \? i 'll tell you what s wrong with not counting the votes if you ignore the votes , you ignore democracy itself you ignore the will of the people you ignore the basic principle upon which our whole system of selfgovernment is based that principle is the consent of the governed and the consent of the governed is expressed in elections , through ballots , votes that are cast by the people and if those in charge of the election machinery , for whatever reason , decide that in this county or that , in this area or in that , they are simply going to ignore the votes and not count them , then the will of the people has not been fully and fairly expressed and as a direct consequence , the consent of the governed has not been fully and freely given so every vote should be counted
bloomington , ind , nov 14 indiana university opened its basketball season tonight without any of the furniture from the team bench being uprooted and transported across the basketball court , scattering fans no player was headbutted or kicked in the shins by the coach , nor was the scorer s table punched this was , in fact , a new era for indiana basketball none of the behavior that marked the tumultuous 29year reign of bob knight as head basketball coach would be expected or tolerated from his successor mike davis , a softspoken , mildmannered man with a wide range of basketball experience , has taken over the team on an interim basis indiana played host to pepperdine in assembly hall tonight one man was conspicuous by his absence knight was reported to be in spain , on a trip hunting red leg partridge there was virtually no sign of him in spirit , either no signs of protest about the end of an era , inside or outside the arena it is n't until page 124 of a 192page media guide that knight is mentioned in a souvenir shop in the arena , one of the few articles relating to knight is a framed drawing of looney tunes characters on a basketball court , which he had autographed in a moment of levity when the new coach was introduced before the game he wore a gray suit with tie in contrast to knight s traditional fireenginered sweater he received a nice round of applause and by the result of the game , anyway , knight was hardly missed as indiana won handily , 8068 knight , of course , was fired as indiana s head coach on sept 10 after a series of misdeeds and transgressions , he was warned by the university president , myles brand , that there would be zero tolerance regarding any actions that might once again embarrass the university but , as knight has said , he did not understand what zero tolerance meant when knight defied the president , he was finally gone davis , who had been knight s assistant the last three years , was with knight when the coach allegedly grabbed and cursed at a student who had greeted knight in a manner he considered disrespectful to an elder on the evening knight was dismissed , he summoned davis and another assistant coach to his home knight , davis said , told them he would pay their salaries for a year davis was making 95 , 000 if they wanted to leave indiana but could not get jobs right away when davis , 40 , was offered the indiana job as interim coach , he accepted davis has not heard from knight since , nor has he contacted knight in an interview after practice monday , davis would not comment about the situation when asked what he learned from his predecessor , davis did not refer to knight , instead mentioning that he had been at a miami heat practice and was amazed at how great a coach pat riley was davis also mentioned other coaching mentors , people he had played for and observed , from don nelson to phil jackson davis has been an assistant at three other colleges , including his alma mater , alabama , was cut from the milwaukee bucks' camp and played in european leagues and in the continental basketball association davis did say that he developed a deeper appreciation of preparation and detail from coach knight duke coach mike krzyzewski has said that indiana s failures in the last several national collegiate athletic association tournaments were , in his opinion , because the indiana players were so beaten down by the oppressive coach that they just wanted the season to end i 'd rather not comment on that , davis said but coach k , he s a great coach , too davis s team this season is primarily freshmen and sophomores there are no seniors and it may not be a coincidence that davis has said about this team , i want to let them play and have fun it is hardly easy for someone to take over for a virtual icon , a coach won the second most games \( 661 \) in college basketball history there have been questions about davis s capabilities the criticism and speculation have rankled him davis said he wanted a chance to prove himself but when reminded that he was taking over one of the most historic and spectacular programs this year marks the 100th anniversary of indiana men s basketball and told he had no coaching experience , davis said oh no i coached for two years in venezuela that was about 10 years ago , when he coached the country s national team for two summers as well as professional teams in that country some people in indiana are hoping he will not succeed as coach , opening up the possibility for a bigname entry rumors already have rick pitino and rick majerus as candidates but davis had other concerns at the moment there was pepperdine , who upset indiana in the first round of last year s ncaa tournament by 7757 tonight s game marked the first round of the preseason national invitation tournament if indiana wins and survives the next round , the hoosiers will travel to new york city for the final two rounds on nov 25 and nov 27 at madison square garden after some initial firstgame nervousness , and as the crowd cheered them on , the hoosiers wore down pepperdine with their defense and rebounding ,

in the heart of africa or the indies , you will always hear 'il trovatore' so said verdi in a letter in 1862 , nine years after the triumphant premiere of this swiftpaced , melodically intoxicating gothic chiller il trovatore remained until roughly two generations ago the most beloved of his creations then it started losing ground only last week , joseph volpe , the general director of the metropolitan opera , volunteered 'il trovatore' is n't breadandbutter like 'boheme' or 'butterfly' times change who among his predecessors would have agreed \? yet in this season of the centennial of verdi s death , il trovatore is back with a vengeance from atlanta to zurich , from helsinki to sydney , from london to tokyo , the opera is everywhere the corriere della sera , italy s leading news daily , writes of 150 edizioni of il trovatore this season performances or productions \? uniform standards , please other sources list more performances but only some 30 productions whatever these are numbers in the ballpark of aida , boheme and carmen new productions in milan , new york and madrid , unveiled within two days this month , have particular claims on the international public s attention on dec 7 , the feast of ambrose , milan s patron saint , the teatro alla scala opened its new season with a production designed and directed by hugo de ana dreamlike and monumental , choreographed beyond the point of mannerism , the show in the main delivered oldfashioned costume drama with fresh , contemporary flair but the real news in milan was the reexamination of the score \( unplayed at la scala for 22 years \) by riccardo muti , la scala s music director and supreme verdian of the age , working from david lawton s critical edition , published by the university of chicago press in 1992 to the noisy outrage of a few standees , the maestro vetoed inauthentic accretions \( read unwritten high notes \) long honored in the name of suspect tradition the papers , bursting with news of the opening , reported on little but a missing high c verdi never wrote less conspicuously but more radically , mr muti stripped off the verismo varnish applied by preceding generations , revealing an undreamedof bel canto refinement that same evening , the curtain rose on a new met trovatore chiefly noteworthy for the misbegotten production of graham vick , whose principal contribution was to transpose the action from 15thcentury spain to the risorgimento , when italian nationalists up and down the peninsula rose to shake off foreign rule elijah moshinsky , whose staging had its premiere on dec 8 at the teatro real in madrid , had the same bright idea , as if both directors were responding mr vick in an abstractexpressionist manner , mr moshinsky with a nod to the neoromantic cinema of visconti to the same sophomoric homework assignment but , of course , the concept was selfimposed as mr moshinsky told the spanish press , the political clashes in the opera reflect those of verdi s own day in fact , politics are inconsequential to the action of il trovatore , and mr moshinsky s sloppy take , like mr vick s donnish one , selfdestructed on arrival in response to the jeers on opening night , the met management eliminated some of mr vick s most laughable excrescences by the third performance , what remained between the new dead spots was still in the main mildly ludicrous , unpunctuated by the relief of a good guffaw in madrid the main interest lay not in the production but in the casting of the argentine star tenor jose cura as the swashbuckling manrico , the troubadour \( or minstrel \) of the opera s title mr cura blazed through the action in a red shirt , weapons aglitter , oozing charisma and injecting fierce sincerity into quick exchanges most singers throw away alas , manrico s best scene was mr cura s worst ah si , ben mio , that radiant love song on the eve of battle , streamed forth in an admirably seamless legato but in tones distressingly guided through the nose up in the gods , hecklers were waiting and let mr cura have it , but moments later , it was his turn from a smudged reading of di quella pira \( transposed down half a step , to finesse the traditional high c \) , he charged to the footlights , sword in hard , flung out his top note and actually flipped the gallery a bird in the stadium , where more civilized standards prevail , there are penalties for such conduct but the list of unprosecuted crimes against il trovatore is endless julian budden , author of the magisterial threevolume the operas of verdi , reports that parodies began appearing in italy and abroad within months of the opera s premiere omitting the murders , gilbert and sullivan had fun in hms pinafore with their tale of an aristocrat and a commoner switched at birth in a night at the opera , the marx brothers wrought their trademark havoc backstage and on during a performance of what just so happens to be il trovatore for a lampoon that targets specifics , look up the opera news of feb 18 , 1967 , in which the writer nick meglin and the artist mort drucker , both of mad magazine , fill in what happens offstage between the scenes we know
sydney , australia , sept 9 when the summer games begin here on friday , juan antonio samaranch will preside over his final olympiad before retiring next year , having transformed the modern olympic movement to where it has never been more successful , or more threatened when samaranch , the former spanish ambassador to the soviet union , became president of the international olympic committee in 1980 , the organization was nearly bankrupt and was caught in a maelstrom of boycotts that continued through the 1984 summer games in los angeles now , as samaranch prepares to step down next july at age 81 , the ioc generates 900 million a year in revenues , mostly from television and corporate sponsorship nbc television alone will pay 35 billion to broadcast the five games between now and 2008 boycotts are no longer a serious threat cities are eagerly bidding to play host to the games corporations are shelling out 50 million apiece to become official olympic sponsors athletes can build long , lucrative careers as professionals and women are involved in larger numbers than ever as administrators and participants during his presidency , samaranch has increased the number of female ioc members from zero to 13 and the percentage of female olympians from 21 percent to 42 percent athletes from 199 nations will participate in sydney , compared with 80 at the 1980 summer games in moscow , which more than 50 countries , including the united states , boycotted with the exception of pierre de coubertin , the french baron who founded the modern games in 1896 , samaranch has been the most significant leader in modern olympic history , said john macaloon , an olympic historian and professor of social sciences at the university of chicago the greatest single accomplishment has been a kind of political maturity , an ability to deal with political elites , heads of state , industrial elites that was something the movement never really had according to the ioc , the sydney games will reach a record audience , about 37 billion of the 39 billion people worldwide who have access to television even david d'alessandro , the president and chief executive officer of john hancock and samaranch s most vocal corporate critic in the wake of the salt lake city bribery scandal , has signed on for another four years of olympic sponsorship my feeling in the end was that the games were going to emerge hurt , but not fatally wounded , d'alessandro said i'm encouraged that what the olympics stand for continues to grow no one really believes in the efficacy of professional sports there are an awful lot of clouds around college sports the olympics are the last kind of major sport people can believe in the purity of at the same time , the olympics have been devalued by scandal and the pervasive use of performanceenhancing drugs , and they have grown so big that they have become in some ways unmanageable for the host cities sydney , which will welcome 700 , 000 visitors , 10 , 438 athletes and 21 , 046 media representatives , struggled with its train service and airport baggage handling system even before the crush of arrivals began and the new south wales state government , which is underwriting the games , had to issue bailouts of 567 million in may and 848 million in june to organizers because the cost of the sydney games had escalated to 18 billion while almost no one believes the olympics will end any time soon , olympic officials , sponsors and independent experts cautioned that a failure to address these threats could affect the survival of the games in the 21st century i do n't think there will ever be again a golden age of the olympic movement as existed between the games of los angeles in 1984 and atlanta in '96 , said john krimsky , a former executive director of the united states olympic committee donna de varona , a gold medalist in swimming in 1964 , has long been an activist for women s sports and a prominent figure in the fight against doping she said she sees troubling similarities between the current games and the ancient ones , which had problems with professionalism , corruption , cheating and bribery before collapsing after a millennium in 393 ad it was 1 , 500 years before the games were revived i think we are on parallel tracks , de varona said i think the games are coming to an important crossroads corruption uncovered corruption , drugs and the unwieldy size of the games can be attributed to two things , samaranch s supporters and detractors say first , in his attempt to return the whole world to the olympics after crippling boycotts in the 1970 s and 1980 s , samaranch made a number of decisions based on strategy or expediency rather than principle second , he seldom said no samaranch also made a habit of coopting his enemies , saying , it is better to have them inside than outside but sometimes that strategy came back to embarrass him jeanclaude ganga of congo republic had been an antiapartheid activist who led the african boycott of the 1976 summer games in montreal in 1986 , samaranch made him a member of the ioc , and problems with african participation dissolved but last year , ganga came to represent the most brazen example of the corrupted bidding process
a campaign season is usually a time for airing dirty laundry that is the case at unilever s laboratory in edgewater , nj , where filthy socks fetch 3 a pair and soiled shirts are bought for 15 each all in service of a coming marketing campaign to introduce a revamped old product there s a constant search for dirty clothes , said sebastian munden , the britishdutch company s north american laundry projects director we can never get enough unilever is locked in a race with procter gamble to reacquaint american consumers with the laundry tablet , a product they have not seen since the late 1970 s the repackaging effort is part of a strategy to shed the company s more obscure , ancillary products and pour resources into marketing wisk detergent and other core brands including ragu spaghetti sauce , wishbone salad dressing and lipton tea the company is convinced that coming up with new ways to squeeze more sales from its stalwarts is the surest path to growth in a slowmoving , somewhat beleaguered industry hence , the new wisk dual action laundry tablets , bound for stores in december i 've often heard people talk of mature categories and tired brands , but in the consumer products market i do n't buy it , said charles strauss , president and chief executive of unilever s united states operations there are no tired brands there are only tired brand managers the new wisk tablets , according to the company s news release announcing the planned introduction , offer the convenience of a measured dose with excellent cleaning they are designed to dissolve quickly at the beginning of the wash cycle , correcting a critical failure of tablets in the first goround for procter gamble , whose salvo tablets were introduced in 1960 and then taken off shelves in 1978 because they did not always dissolve well , the stakes are also high after several quarters of disheartening financial results that led to a management shakeup , p g s stock has plunged more than 40 percent this year the company , which has been casting off brands to concentrate on market leaders , hopes that tide rapid action tablets , the new incarnation of one of its flagship brands , will help ease the pain the tablets , which have a special coating so that they dissolve immediately in the washer , will be available in stores in september neither company expects consumers will suddenly do more laundry , just to satisfy their curiosity over chalky tablets that fizz up like giant alkaseltzers in the washing machine but the products' widespread popularity abroad has convinced the two rivals that convenience commands a premium price , resulting in greater revenues as consumers abandon their measuring cups in favor of the nomess tablets in britain , where unilever introduced a laundry tablet in 1998 , followed by procter gamble roughly a year later , tablets make up more than 20 percent of the 15 billion laundry market together , the companies' tablets command more than 50 percent of the tablet market propelled by a blitz of advertising created by agencies like saatchi saatchi , for p g , and lowe lintas partners worldwide , part of the lowe group unit of interpublic , for unilever , and the muscle of the two consumer products giants , the tablets have been introduced into dozens of countries in little more than a year why the delay in bringing tablets to the united states market , with roughly 6 billion in laundry detergent sales annually \? mr strauss says the technology was developed overseas and had to be adapted for this country s toploading quickcycle machines that tend to use colder water unilever said that it was reviewing marketing approaches it has used elsewhere in the world and that lowe lintas was just starting to look at how to market the tablets in the united states the campaign , the company said in the news release , would include tv and print advertising , internet , and promotional special events , with the alcone marketing group , a unit of the diversified agency services unit of the omnicom group , assigned to promotions procter gamble declined to discuss details of its tablet strategy , but did say that saatchi saatchi would conduct the ad campaign in this country according to brandweek , print ads for tide tablets are set to begin in november and run for six months , and tv ads will appear from january through june after trailing in tablets in most international markets , p g is poised to leapfrog its competitor and put tide tablets into stores in the united states about three months before unilever s wisk tablets but unilever has sent assembly line workers from a plant in georgia to italy to learn how to pack its new product quickly , hoping to shave days off the time to market if you lose days and weeks then you get worried , mr munden of unilever said because you know those days and weeks count for unilever , the tablets are one outcome of more than a decade of whittling away extraneous business ventures since the 1980 s , it has cast off its fish restaurants , trucking business , printing and chemical companies in february , the company said it would pare its 1 , 400 consumer products to 400 core brands that generate about 80 percent of its income since then , unilever has posted two strong quarters and surpassed analysts' forecasts , quite an achievement in a sector where warnings of missed earnings have become commonplace it has also gone on a shopping spree , buying slimfast foods , ben jerry s homemade and bestfoods within months of one another , a strategy consistent with the company s singular attention to bigname products but other than the introduction of dove deodorant earlier this year , none of the surviving unilever brands has received the attention the company is now dedicating to wisk tablets unilever hopes these throwbacks to the 1970 s will take as much as 20 percent of the laundry market within two years stranger things have happened after all , platform shoes and skintight jeans are back in style photo tablets are coming back to the 6 billion laundry detergent market
washington , nov 28 following are excerpts from a brief that the bush campaign filed today with the united states supreme court italicized portions show emphasis in the original statement of the case on tuesday , nov 7 , 2000 , the citizens of the several states , including florida , cast their votes for the electors for president and vice president of the united states the official initial count of the ballots cast in florida showed that the republican party candidates , gov george w bush and secretary dick cheney , received more votes than their principal opponents in the election , democratic party candidates vice president albert gore and senator joseph lieberman , subject to the counting of overseas absentee ballots because the margin of victory was less than onehalf of one percent , however , a statewide recount commenced the statewide recount , and the tabulation of overseas absentee ballots on nov 18 , 2000 , while reflecting slightly different tabulation totals , each confirmed that governor bush and secretary cheney received the most votes on nov 8 , 2000 , the florida democratic party sought additional recounts by hand in four heavily populated , predominantly democratic counties the florida supreme court thereafter issued a decree extending by 12 days the sevenday statutorily imposed deadline to submit certified vote tabulations including the results of these recounts pursuant to that extended deadline , on nov 26 , the totals were again tabulated , and governor bush and secretary cheney were again determined to have received the most votes the florida elections canvassing commission proceeded on nov 26 , 2000 , to certify them as the victorious candidates in the statewide presidential election those certified results include tabulations that reflect manual recounts that were conducted solely as a result of the florida supreme court decision under review here vice president gore and senator lieberman have filed a lawsuit in leon county circuit court to contest the certified election results the florida supreme court s decision , which conflicts with both federal statutes and the federal constitution , will thus continue to affect , and has the theoretical potential to change , the outcome of the presidential election in florida , and thus the nation reversal by this court would restore the legislatively crafted method for appointing electors in florida to its status prior to nov 7 , would allow the completion of the proper selection of presidential electors in florida according to the plan contemplated by the constitution , and would aid in bringing legal finality to this election summary of argument the florida supreme court s decision , which announced a new framework and timetable for resolving controversies over the presidential election results in that state , should be vacated because it does not comply with 3 usc section 5 responding to a presidential election crisis much like that unfolding in florida during the past three weeks , congress enacted a statutory scheme to implement the constitutional mechanism of the electoral college one of those statutes , section 5 , provides that state court resolutions of controversies regarding the appointment of presidential electors shall be conclusive only if they are made pursuant to laws enacted prior to election day the court below rejected florida statutes and deadlines for the appointment of electors and the resolution of presidential election disputes as hypertechnical instead , it resorted to its equitable powers to prescribe new standards and deadlines , suspend mandatory enforcement mechanisms , and curtail the discretion conferred on the state executive by the legislature the decision below constitutes a clear departure from the legal requirements established before election day , and announces new rules governing the resolution of election disputes the florida supreme court thus consciously and boldly overrode florida s laws enacted prior to election day and replaced them two weeks later with laws of its own invention title 3 usc section 5 is designed to ensure that disputes relating to the appointment of presidential electors will be decided under laws made prior to the exigency under which they arose it was enacted by congress to discourage precisely what has happened in florida this month , where the candidate who did not receive the most votes in the official tabulation is attempting to change the result by changing the rules but the plain language of the statute provides that state courts must adhere to preexisting law if their resolution of election controversies is to be given binding effect the court below failed to do so the florida supreme court s decision should be vacated as a result of its failure to comply with 3 usc section 5 the resulting consequences are twofold first , the executive officials in florida would be able to discharge all of their duties , including their duties imposed by federal law , under the rules in place on election day second , congress would be able to give conclusive effect to the official certification of the elections canvassing commission regarding the appointment of florida s electors made pursuant to the carefully crafted scheme put in place before the election to apply equally to all voters and candidates vacating the decision below would thus allow the electoral college process to reach a lawful , final and conclusive resolution of the presidential election
bishkek , kyrgyzstan , oct 15 sveta stretched across the couch in the cramped apartment with lace curtains , tilted her head back and slowly massaged her bare neck with the tenderness of a lover and the expertise of a longtime practitioner , aleksandr located the vein , slipped the needle into her neck and sent the heroin on its way the drug turned sveta s eyes bright and her slightly crooked smile was pretty aleksandr took her place on the couch , tugging his right sleeve up to expose his under arm sveta thumped hard on his skin , found a reluctant vein and injected the heroin a third person , yuri , sat in a chair , silent and staring , transported to his own world by the drug they had just mixed in a small pink plastic bowl pulling back a curtain , sveta dropped the needles and syringes into two separate plastic containers in a few days , they would be taken to a clinic and traded for new ones , courtesy of a groundbreaking and possibly lifesaving needle exchange program in the capital of this small , remote country bishkek , capital of kyrgyzstan , seems an unlikely spot for heroin addicts , let alone something as reformist as a needle exchange this country of 45 million is largely mountainous , and through decades of soviet domination retained many of its nomadic traditions and tightly knit communities but heroin addiction has arrived all across central asia , the sad if predictable byproduct of the transformation after the end of more rigid communist control of the ancient great silk road into a major conduit for drug traffickers united nations experts estimate that 80 percent of europe s heroin originates in afghanistan and pakistan the principal route to market winds through the mountains and steppes of three former soviet republics , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan and tajikistan the influx of drug trafficking has strained the limited resources of the police , increased corruption and helped finance islamic militants trying to destabilize the region the new availability of heroin also expanded the number of addicts heroin is cheap , plentiful and powerful an average dose , about a tenth of a gram , costs 2 in bishkek , half that in osh , the major city in southern kyrgyzstan where the supply is greater , and 50 cents in tajikistan in those poor soviet republics , where average income rarely tops 600 a year , it has replaced its weaker cousin , opium , as the drug of choice and it is far more addictive five years ago , we did n't see heroin , said col zhanybek s bakiyev , the top drug enforcement officer with the kyrgyzstan ministry of internal affairs now we are concerned that our people consume heroin in greater quantities the number of intravenous drug users in kyrgyzstan has increased fourfold in the last decade yet police and drug experts believe that the number is still small enough to avoid an epidemic tough enforcement is one means but the police are also supporting an attempt to reduce the harm to addicts through needleexchange programs this is the moment when we should act , said yuri misnikov , an official with the united nations development program in bishkek the first needle exchanges opened last february in bishkek and osh they are financed by the united nations program and the open society institute , part of the new yorkbased soros foundation they were the first needleexchange programs in central asia , though the soros group has since opened two centers in kazakhstan and plans one in tajikistan soon the idea is simple and common in europe and the united states addicts swap used needles and syringes for as many new ones as they need , usually five or six a day discarding used needles and not sharing them reduces the spread of the aids virus and diseases like hepatitis at the exchanges , the addicts also get free medical care and blood tests estebesova batma , a psychiatrist who coordinates the program , said she expected 10 or 15 new clients a month when the two exchange offices opened here within weeks , more than 500 addicts were taking part and new clients were turned away because the program was running out of needles about 180 people show up monthly at the osh center the need was demonstrated by a survey of 100 clients in march ninetysix said they shared needles and 35 reported using the same syringe more than 20 times one addict exchanged a syringe that had dangled from his belt on a key chain others turned in syringes used so often that the gauge marks had worn off and been replaced with notches to determine how much heroin to load in one in five used tap water to wash needles and syringes before the next use and half did not know they could be infected by a needle the number of drugrelated aids cases is surprisingly low when the police announced two weeks ago that a heroin user who had been jailed had tested positive for aids , it was the first publicized case of a drug user contracting the disease in bishkek , a city of about 650 , 000 residents , though experts say there are several others in addition , a study by the united nations and the soros foundation found that between 11 percent and 18 percent of intravenous drug users in bishkek are infected with hiv and between 32 percent and 49 percent in osh , where there are fewer education programs the news of the first drugrelated aids case sent a chill through the drugaddict population two dozen friends of the jailed addict showed up the next day at dr batma s two offices , asking for blood tests among them were sveta , aleksandr and yuri all three are longtime drug users who switched from opium to heroin within the last three years they agreed to be interviewed and photographed in aleksandr s apartment as long as their last names were not used the apartment was on the second floor of a rundown building on the outskirts of bishkek inside the paint was peeling and plumbing was exposed , but aleksandr s wife , olga , does not use drugs and tries to keep the place neat and clean for the sake of their two children sveta , 35 , said she started using drugs when she was 17 she said she stopped four times while using opium , once for three months but she cannot stop using heroin we are scared to quit because we know that this withdrawal is waiting for us , she said , gesturing to her friends , too i would like to quit i'm trying to reduce my use aleksandr , who once made a good living as a driver despite his opium habit , has been unable to work since becoming addicted to heroin three years ago he said he wants desperately to quit and emigrate to germany with his family to start a new life , but he cannot leave his heroin despite the expressed desires to quit , the apartment crackled with anticipation as drug paraphernalia and a foilwrapped packet of heroin are pulled out they mixed the heroin in a plastic cup with boiled water and a powdered antihistamine that enhances the effect , and drew it equally into three syringes aleksandr s 14yearold daughter lingered in the hallway , ignoring the alltoocommon scene the two bottles into which sveta deposits the used needles and syringes sat beside a bag filled with 30 or more new replacements back at the clinic , dr batma said exchanging needles is not enough heroin cannot be overcome without an extensive rehabilitation program but there are none in kyrgyzstan , where half the population lives below the poverty line and the national annual budget is only 300 million photo in an apartment in bishkek , kyrgyzstan , heroin paraphernalia is laid out a needleexchange program has been introduced to

washington the contempt trial of charles bakaly iii is something of a curiosity in washington in a town where leaks flow like a powerful torrent down every avenue , the prosecution of a spokesman based on an innocuous disclosure seems almost comically misplaced nevertheless , mr bakaly , who was the spokesman for the independent counsel kenneth starr , is facing a criminal conviction for denying that he was the source for a new york times reporter in january 1999 for defense attorneys , the prosecution of a government lawyer would have been welcome if it were for leaking information that could not legally be made public government lawyers routinely leak facts from grand jury proceedings and commit other ethical violations with no response from most federal judges but mr bakaly is not in the dock on such a charge he is accused of criminal contempt under a rule that punishes false statements that delay or obstruct a court the statements and the delay , however , came after a legal error of the court itself , which misinterpreted a federal law the decision to initiate an inquiry into confidential communications raised serious concerns for lawyers who handle highprofile cases the decision to pursue a criminal case against mr bakaly only magnifies those concerns mr bakaly s problem began with a times article citing unnamed associates in the office of the independent counsel in explaining options for the investigation the article said that the office was still considering indicting the president and that his impeachment would not affect the ultimate decision of whether to prosecute these options had been widely discussed by various legal commentators and it was already well known that , as the article also said , some on mr starr s staff favored prosecution unlike a typical grand jury case where a target s identity is confidential , the independent counsel s investigation was aimed quite publicly at the president the preference by some lawyers in mr starr s office for prosecution is hardly surprising the problem was not the content of the article , but its timing it appeared at a critical stage in the impeachment of president clinton for most judges , the article would have justified no more than a tonguelashing in chambers but in a critical error , chief judge norma holloway johnson decided the article contained secret grand jury information though nothing in it remotely resembled such information she wanted a prosecution under the federal grand jury law , which could have brought a lengthy prison sentence the court of appeals , however , disagreed , and found that the article did not contain any secret grand jury information judge johnson then proceeded to fashion a criminal contempt violation against mr bakaly , a charge that gives her enormous discretion and allows her to sit in judgment without a jury mr bakaly was now charged with lying to the court in denying that he was a source of the information and then having his office file false papers denying that it was the origin of the information mr bakaly insists that he truthfully denied releasing nonpublic information and admitted he had spoken with the reporter more is at stake here than the future of an accused leaker with a penchant for mismatched outfits most judges are uncomfortable with statements in the press about pending cases and would like lawyers to keep monastic silence lawyers , however , need to defend their clients both in court and in public all parties , even the government , are allowed to speak to reporters so long as their comments do not influence or prejudice a case or release information under seal judge johnson says she will convict mr bakaly if the government can show that his statements required the court to hold two inchambers conferences with outside counsel or imposed unnecessary work or costs hardly grievous injuries none of this completely exonerates mr bakaly , who should have been more forthcoming at the outset of the inquiry moreover , the use of leaks by all sides in the clinton crisis was itself a scandal in a city of habitual leakers , however , the prosecution of mr bakaly offers no more justice than a random execution for collective guilt

endured 10 polar winters \) and for his anthropological work among the peoples of the north this time he was taking with him , as he keenly publicized , the largest scientific staff ever to sail to the polar regions financed by the canadian government , the expedition consisted of two ships , the alaska and the karluk the alaska was carrying the landbased southern party , and the karluk the oceanbased northern party the men steamed away from british columbia as heroes , and stefansson , who was to lead the northern party , had contracts with three international newspapers in his pocket but the papers did n't know that the karluk s crew was mostly made up of boys with no experience of extreme environments , or that the ship was a decrepit whaler and wholly inadequate for polar travel the day before departure , its captain , robert bartlett , who had been north with robert peary in 1909 , sent a message to the deputy minister of the naval service informing him that the ship was absolutely unsuitable to remain in winter ice critics have accused robert falcon scott of poor organization , but stefansson makes him look like napoleon it was not quite the last days of radioless wooden ships , as one of the survivors claimed in his dotage , but it was oldstyle polar travel all right the grind of wood against pack , the whiff of butchered seal and the dying of the light as the polar night stole over the floe in the ice master , her first book , jennifer niven makes good use of a range of primary sources , including seven diaries and the published and unpublished accounts by the glaswegian magnetician and meteorologist on the karluk , william mckinlay not all the horrors of the western front , he wrote , not the rubble of arras , nor the hell of ypres , nor all the mud of flanders leading to passchendaele , could blot out the memories of that year in the arctic polar exploration is often compared to war \( ernest shackleton dedicated his account of the endurance expedition , to my comrades who fell in the white warfare of the south and on the red fields of france and flanders \) , and like all the voyages of the heroic age , this one gains emotional weight , in hindsight , for having taken place in the last flowering of idealism before the horror of the trenches the two ships soon became separated , and thereafter niven sticks with the northern party within two months , the karluk was trapped in the ice unbelievably , stefansson and a party of five left the ship , ostensibly to go hunting , but it soon became clear to the others that their leader had abandoned them the six men trekked to point barrow and on to meet the southern party at collinson point in alaska , where stefansson was quick to send off his story though not a search party roald amundsen was right to call stefansson the greatest humbug alive meanwhile , the karluk drifted in the pack , and the men unloaded supplies onto the ice in anticipation of the big freeze the polar night unraveled in a blur of dogfights , food rationing , lows of minus 40 fahrenheit and a blowout at christmas on jan 10 , not far from wrangel island , bartlett gave the order for all hands to abandon ship , and the following day the karluk went down to the sound of chopin s funeral march on the victrola windup gramophone bartlett and his men were stranded in a lugubrious spot they named shipwreck camp \( rather like shackleton s patience and ocean camps after the endurance went under \) eight men splintered off under first officer sandy anderson and alistair mackay , a doctor who had been south on shackleton s nimrod expedition they tried their luck marching over the ice , and were never seen again in desperation , bartlett , the strongest man and the hero of the ice master , if there is one , set out with one native guide and seven dogs to trek 700 miles through siberia to alaska and get help but the truth , niven writes , was that the skipper knew as much about siberia as he knew about mars bartlett left 15 people to wait on wrangel island , including one indigenous woman \( the wife of a hunter \) and her two little girls as waits go , it was quite something toes amputated with shears snow blindness a suspected murder and a mystery illness that turned out to be nephritis , an inflammatory disease of the kidney caused by a diet of too much protein and fat when their fresh meat ran out , they ate rotten flippers and blood soup in the end , three men died , and the others were finally rescued through the herculean efforts of bartlett and his companion , who had , amazingly , reached alaska and cabled for help
i live in a neighborhood built in friendlier times , before central airconditioning and television rendered front porches obsolete by local standards , my porch is barely adequate it s not particularly gracious , it does n't wrap around , it is n't screened and it s just big enough to support a couple of window boxes , a few chairs and a table but that s enough , when the weather gets nice , to give me a purchase on the outside world at the same time i'm engaged in that despicable activity known as work in the summer , i work on my porch almost every morning as long as the wind is n't too strong , and none of my neighbors have just had their lawns sprayed , if the grass and tree guys are busy on other streets and the teenagers next door are n't washing their cars with the radio blaring , i can thanks to modern technology talk or type to my heart s content i can work and yet be in touch the season real grownups those titans of industry and politics who march into the city with their briefcases and organizers and who have trouble finding enough casual clothes to wear on fridays might not understand but some of us cannot labor contently under fluorescent lights , no matter how much money , power or starbucks you offer us especially in summer i was in high school the first time i worked inside during the summer my boss was my dad , who owned a small publishing company , and i was frequently told how lucky i was to get the experience but although i made a small fortune by teenage standards , and had already begun to build my resume , i might as well have been a princess trapped in a dungeon the end of light and air in summer was , quite simply , the end of childhood fast forward a quarter of a century to life in the electronic cottage , the homebased information age economy predicted by alvin toffler how mr toffler figured this all out before the modem , the laptop and email were invented , i 'll never know but i bet he worked it out all out on that forerunner of the laptop the portable typewriter sitting on his front porch , enjoying the breeze and feeling superior to all those drones still chained to offices well , the virtual office is here and if you 're still laboring under fluorescent lights when you could be outside , you deserve your pallid complexion if necessary , put it in your schedule , said carol gerrish , a businesssuccess coach in monmouth junction because it s too good to pass up ms gerrish should know it s her job to counsel those titans of industry on how to put more success , and balance , in their lives part of what she does is to remind them that the outdoors exists and that they are actually allowed to go there ms gerrish herself is an avid gardener , and she spends as much time as possible outside once the temperature hits 60 , reading productivity magazines at her backyard bistro table , surrounded by trees and flowers research and development , she explained david alpern , a senior editor for newsweek , often does interviews about the magazine s polls from his deck in sag harbor , on long island it s clearly more fun to able to do it in the backyard with the sun and the trees and the moss and the hot tub gurgling on one side and the cat gurgling on the other , he said you do n't even have to have a yard or a laptop or a cordless if your job involves thinking , all you really need to work outside in fair weather is your brain although pen and paper might come in handy that s basically the only equipment used by ira gassman , who worked outdoors when he wrote the book and lyrics for the broadway musical the life mr gassman , who splits his time between manhattan and sag harbor , has done all his writing for the past 20 years outside when mr gassman is in sag harbor , he starts his writing shift on the porch of the american hotel by 3 pm , when he wraps up , he s worked at picnic tables , benches and beaches all over town , from long wharf to marine park i usually like to stay in the sun , so as the sun moves so do i , he said he also likes the hubbub of human activity i like people around me it energizes me , he said mr gassman , however , is more energized by people on the whole than in the specific he does n't particularly want to be reached while he s in a creative mood phooey on phones , he said another soul who likes to write on the beach is dan rattiner , publisher of dan s papers , in bridgehampton , also on long island mr rattiner has been writing on beaches for 15 years he started going there to escape his children , who were always bursting into his home study i get kind of into a dreamland state , he said i can be irritable if i'm interrupted even in the dead of winter , mr rattiner works at the beach inside his lincoln navigator and if he happens to experience a small adventure while he s there , even better since the life of the south fork of long island is , after all , his beat he s witnessed fishermen show up late for feasts that the seagulls enjoyed just moments earlier , and once , having noticed some strange tropical birds on the beach , he just happened to run into east hampton s town environmental officer , who was able to identify the species for him i too have found working on my front porch providential it s easy to strike up conversations with dog walkers , baby strollers and mail carriers who pass my way several years ago , one regular dog walker happened to mention that she was seeing an md , who was also an acupuncturist i wound up writing a story about him , then seeing him for back pain and eventually he and i became friends last winter , i attended his wedding none of this would have happened had i been holed up in my garret of course , the outside home office is n't always a garden of eden as i write this outside on my porch , of course i'm discovering that it s about 10 degrees cooler than it looked when i decided i could work outside today barely had i opened my laptop when i found that neighbors two doors down were having two trees removed now they 're feeding the limbs into a machine that turns them into sawdust , and which sounds like an electric pencil sharpener attached to jimi hendrix s amplifier and as in the garden of eden , i sometime come across knowledge i 'd just as soon not that my mail carrier reads the postcards that inform us of our property taxes , for example or that certain neighbors back out of their driveways at frightening speeds luckily so far i have n't witnessed any squalid extramarital liaisons the outdoor working life is not for everybody gil gordon , a telecommuting consultant in monmouth junction , has worked at home for 18 years , but rarely takes his job outside i want to preserve the feeling of separation and relaxation i get when i'm in the backyard or by the pool or by the lake , he said i do n't want to soil it with work mr gordon is working on a book due out next spring from random house , turn it off controlling the anytimeanywhere office mr gordon also points out that there are certain tangible physical hazards from setting up office outside , like having your children trip over the extension cord plugged into your computer actually , that happened to me just the other day , and i barely caught my laptop before it hit the deck had it crashed , though , i probably would have just bought a new and better one one with a working battery , so i would n't need that extension cord in the first place then i could take it to the pool photo dan rattiner , publisher of dan s papers on long island , does all

los angeles , nov 5 in 1997 , on the strength of jerry maguire , air force one and other hits , sony pictures earned nearly 13 billion at the domestic box office , a record that still stands as the most ever brought in by a studio in a single year put another way , more than 1 of every 5 spent on movie tickets that year went for films released by sony s columbia pictures or one of the conglomerate s other , smaller production companies there are scenes in columbia s coming thriller vertical limit many , many scenes , in fact showing struggling mountainclimbers clinging from vertiginous precipices or plummeting into the void little wonder if there is one thing columbia s executives must have come to know since 1997 , it is the feeling of clinging precariously to a great height because the news for sony pictures since that record year , outside of a handful of hits , has been one of steady erosion in market share and as of the latest quarterly earnings reports released last month profits by 1998 , sony s market share had fallen to 109 percent from 206 percent the previous year in 1999 , despite the smashing successes of adam sandler s big daddy and the computeranimated stuart little , sony was down to an 85 percent market share and this year , as of the end of october , it had fallen to 77 percent , placing it seventh , or dead last , among the major hollywood studios , without a single smash hit to show for its entire 2000 slate in a town that takes endless delight in gossip about who is up and who is down , chewing over every executive hiccup in a notoriously volatile business , sony pictures finds itself the meal of the moment but those hollywood professionals and entertainment industry analysts who had been wondering whether sony would ever be able to pull itself out of the doldrums may find that the next meal they have to eat is crow charlie s angels , which opened for columbia on friday on 3 , 037 screens in north america , brought in an estimated 405 million at the box office in its first three days if that number holds when official ticket sales figures are released on monday , it will amount to the biggest opening for a nonsummer film in movie history unless the movie suddenly collapses at the box office in coming weekends , it seems assured of making well over 100 million , and perhaps even over 150 million it played really well across the board , said jeff blake , the studio s marketing and distribution chief that was the key it played well in upscale locations and it did just as well in the suburban malls the kids bought it and the adults bought it , too of course , it takes more than one film to turn around a sagging studio but in interviews last week , sony s top executives said that they were convinced that their long drought is over and that the films on their slate in the next two months will completely turn around the studio s fortunes we 've had a number of unprofitable pictures , said howard stringer , chairman of the sony corporation of america , the united states portion of the electronics and entertainment conglomerate based in tokyo but i am not worried about the creative direction of the movie studio much is riding on the results of the next few weeks beginning with the release of charlie s angels to the coming releases of vertical limit , an arnold schwarzenegger thriller called the sixth day and finding forrester , a drama from gus van sant with sean connery playing a reclusive author in the bronx who befriends a neighborhood teenager we went from having the biggest year of all time in the movie business , then the following year we did pretty good , the year after that we did less well , we came back a bit and then this year we 're doing less well , said john calley , chairman of sony pictures entertainment , which oversees the company s west coast entertainment divisions , including columbia pictures but 'vertical limit' is one of the most thrilling action films i have ever seen in my life sean s picture is a very exciting film potentially , i think it has real oscar chances and 'charlie s angels' is as exciting as it can be plus , we have a slate next year that looks great to us if none of these films perform up to expectations , however , and the losing streak continues , sony s stateside executives said they were expecting some hard questions from their bosses in japan , especially on the heels of a recent quarterly earnings statement that showed a 66 million operating loss in the movie division two weeks ago , mr stringer announced an executive reshuffle at the studio the studio s 70yearold chairman , mr calley , is scheduled to retire in october 2001 in the shuffle , he will give up most of the direct oversight of the divisions , including columbia , while retaining his title of chairman and ultimate authority for clearing all of the studio s motion pictures instead , sony s division chiefs will report to mel harris , sony s president and chief operating officer , who returned to the corporation 13 months ago after having left several years earlier in a disagreement with a former management team ken lemberger , former president of the columbia tristar motion picture group , was named copresident , to help mr harris manage the company s financial and corporate affairs
los angeles you 've got to give it up for the guys and gals at nbc and abc for respectively finishing onetwo in the propaganda war to win the hearts and minds of the audiences of color they have for so long , so decidedly ignored on jan 5 , at the dawn of the 21st century , after having been shamed for months for its seeming inability to find a black person to populate the nonethnic new york city of friends or an asian in frasier s pale seattle , and facing an oh , it s coming phantom boycott led by the national association for the advancement of colored people , the national broadcasting company signed a diversity agreement that promised to increase the hiring of persons of color both in front of and behind the camera somehow at some point not to be outdone , or maybe thinking it was finally in vogue to stop doing nothing , the american broadcasting company announced a similar agreement two days later regardless of the embarrassing delays , the clumsiness with which the agreements were presented and even the lack of specifics , both nbc and abc should be patted on the back for their pledges and for giving serious lip service to an issue they 'd previously only given lip service to problem solved us hollywood joes should all just airkiss , be proud of ourselves and get back to cutting development deals on our cell phones right \? right \? yeah , right except , now that the networks have started to step up to the plate , it s becoming obvious that their gross unfamiliarity with the issue of diversity is the problem to the answer it s almost sad that the networks have agreed to stage a diversity day in february for its executives to explain how to go about hiring minority employees , as if it were some weird science , incomprehensible without a venn diagram it s just about laughable when the networks say they will make an effort to hire more minority directors a fairly easy accomplishment as they currently hire almost none and it s pretty insulting when the networks say that they will create a staff position for a black writer on each of its shows returning for a second season from now on , is every black who s hired to write for a network program to be considered a quota hire \? do the networks figure blacks could n't legitimately earn a position at the writer s table without having a place set especially for them \? do the networks plan to set any standards for whom they hire , or will just any black face do \? this particular halfmeasure does n't elevate minorities , but reduces us to mere tokens , making us no different from lawn jockeys with laptops these initiatives are probably well intended , or at least intended to seem that way , but the cure is as radical and dangerous as the disease itself the network executives now find themselves performing center ring in a diversity circus , an occupation they could easily have avoided if , after the success of crossover shows like the cosby show , martin , fresh prince of bel air and a different world , they had cast their nets a little wider , if they had made sure that qualified blacks , latinos and asians of both sexes had gotten interviews and earned jobs the resulting shows would employ actors who would n't look exactly like all the other people in the exclusive gated communities in the hollywood hills it s not about putting together a diversity program to rival the moon launch it s simply about being colorblind but raceaware for hollywood , maybe that s just too high concept drawing \( art hughes \)

des moines , jan 20 on a snowy and slick highway , in a grubby car packed with the paraphernalia of a political campaign , senator orrin g hatch , the utah republican , was racing to the next stop in his presidential campaign here this is it , said mr hatch , waving a bag of cold fastfood at five people squeezed into the car nothing fancy here this is the candidate s bus , the press bus , the staff bus , all rolled into one yes , mr hatch , a staunch conservative known as much for his high shirt collars as his high moral views , is running for president with the pitch that he is more experienced than his rivals he is seeking reelection to the senate as well , but said he would give that up if it appeared his white house dreams could turn into reality no question , if we start taking off , i 'd give up my senate seat , he said in an interview in the car right now , with most polls showing mr hatch getting somewhere between zero and 2 percent of the vote in iowa , and many voters not even aware that he is seeking the oval office , there is little chance mr hatch will be forced to give up the day job he has held since 1976 his presence here is a sideline curiosity in a political spectacle dominated by major candidates on both sides , and others who are barely known outside political circles mr hatch , of course , is almost a household name but his campaign here is run on the tightest of shoestrings he has little money , no television commercials , no newspaper advertisements , few brochures and a staff , mainly , of unpaid volunteers when he appears at political debates , he is often treated as an unexpected dinner guest someone who is greeted with courtesy but who everyone wonders why he is there i was embarrassed for him at the debates , said dennis goldford , a political science professor at drake university he may have done the same thing quayle did , which is to look at his resume and think he could be a shoein but it s not working how shoestring is his effort \? mr hatch raised 14 million through the end of september , according to the federal election commission even lesserknown republican candidates like gary l bauer , who raised 63 million over the same period , or alan keyes , who raised 25 million , have bigger war chests then , of course , there are the two financial gorillas in the republican race , gov george w bush , who has spent 20 million out of his 57 million war chest and steve forbes , who has spent 25 million of his own money , so far , and raised 6 million more \( senator john mccain of arizona , who is not campaigning in iowa , has raised 95 million \) mr hatch and his staff admit that the best they are hoping for here is a fourthplace showing third place , they say , is well beyond their hopes if orrin hatch came in third place in the iowa caucuses , that would be bigger news that george bush winning , said james camp , mr hatch s national political director the headlines would not be that bush wins , but that hatch takes third even mr hatch said his goal was to do fourth or better to that end , the hatch campaign is heavily depending on local newspaper interviews and smalltown radio callin and television talk shows to spread his word , since there is no cost but the unusual combination of being a national figure and having nearly nonexistent poll ratings have led to some odd juxtapositions on his campaign schedule on the same day he drove across dangerously icy roads to be interviewed by the daily nonpareil in council bluffs , the marshalltown timesrepublican and the mason city globegazette , he also appeared on cnn s equal time on a live feed from des moines , bantering with the anchor greta van susteren , and later on msnbc s news with brian williams we 're spending 18 hours a day , going to all these towns , mr camp said , as he pointed to a map of iowa with red pins snaking over it , and we go to every newspaper , every radio station we do n't have the money to compete with paid advertising mr hatch , however , did prepare a 28minute video , made 10 , 000 copies for distribution , and hawked it at his appearance at the last republican debate here to the groans and laughter of the audience , mr hatch told the crowd at least four times that his video would be broadcast tonight on channel 5 and channel 8 at 6 and 6 30 two times , he got the station identifications wrong to his great disappointment , iowa s ample mormon population around 16 , 500 , according to the church s salt lake city headquarters is giving mr hatch , himself a mormon , little help with money or support they are just not political and that s the problem , mr hatch said if i had to depend on my fellow mormon , i would not have come this far so , mr hatch came to des moines this week and spoke to 50 employees at the principal financial group , an insurance company he made his standard pitch he has more experience than his republican rivals and none of them was talking about the low moral standards of the clinton white house speaking , talkshow style , on the same level as the audience rather than from the stage , mr hatch attacked his opponents how many of those people have the experience , yes , the knowledge and the ability to work with congress and really fulfill all those campaign promises \? mr hatch asked i understand congress to the last person i passed 43 bills in the last congress sure , i ca n't get everything passed , but orrin hatch will die trying he also said the democrats in the race , vice president al gore and former senator bill bradley , were far left , and you better understand that it was difficult to tell if mr hatch won any converts jack croft said that while he liked what mr hatch said on our need for more military readiness , he was not swayed enough to vote for him david holzinger , who said he was trying to decide between mr hatch and mr forbes , said i came because he s a giant in the senate i like what he said on the ethics of the clinton administration sandy mcnamar came , she said , because i'm curious i'm still trying to sort it out , ms mcnamar said i'm an equalopportunity voter photo senator orrin g hatch conducts his candidacy on a shoestring \( associated press \)
as insurance fraud cases go , the federal government s case against dr niels h lauersen is far from typical dr lauersen , a wellknown manhattan gynecologist and fertility expert , did not deal with medicare or medicaid , the government insurance programs that often attract fraudulent billing schemes and prosecutors acknowledge that unlike doctors in most medical fraud cases , who bill for procedures that never took place or for patients who do not exist , dr lauersen treated real patients for real conditions , treatments they were desperately seeking in what legal experts say is new territory for health care fraud cases , dr lauersen is accused of billing insurance companies for routine gynecological procedures to cover for what he was really doing fertility surgeries for women who could not otherwise get pregnant over the course of 10 years , law enforcement officials say , the doctor submitted hundreds of false bills amounting to roughly 4 million fertility experts and gynecologists , as well as their patients , say that false billing is common among doctors who specialize in exacting and costly fertility procedures because insurance companies often do not pay for them but legal experts say they know of no other case in which a doctor was criminally prosecuted over such practices everyone is paying attention to this case , said pamela madsen , the executive director of the american infertility association it is very upsetting to many patients when a doctor is , through their eyes , being persecuted for trying to help them but federal law enforcement officials , their power broadened by recent legislation governing health care fraud , are sending the message to doctors that efforts to dodge rules set by insurance companies will not be tolerated the clinton administration has made the prosecution of health care fraud a priority , as a costsaving measure since 1995 , health care fraud convictions have increased nearly 40 percent the government has invested huge amounts of resources in health care fraud in the last four years , said thomas w mayo , an associate professor of law at southern methodist university in dallas congress has clearly moved to lump all health care fraud together and is increasingly giving prosecutors tools to convict the trial , which begins tomorrow in federal district court in manhattan , brings together several health care issues that have been hotly debated in the last few years they include ethical and financial quandaries over who should pay for fertility treatments and conflicts over the types of health care issues that merit government intervention the case also illuminates the quiet but common practice by doctors in many areas of medicine who tweak their bills to get approval or payment for treatments they believe patients need but insurance companies do not reimburse a recent study in the archives of internal medicine showed that 57 percent of 169 doctors who were polled said they would use deception to secure approval for certain treatments dr lauersen , who was indicted more than a year ago with his anesthesiologist , magda binion , is accused of billing insurers for procedures like cyst removals and treatments of fibroids , in place of the in vitro fertilization therapies that he was actually performing according to the indictment , dr lauersen told patients to lie about their care to investigators the patients in question were not among the wealthy or highprofile women who came through his office , who almost certainly paid cash for these fertility procedures , but rather middle and workingclass women who generally were insured by managed care companies few states have laws that require insurance companies to pay for infertility treatments , and many lawyers and policy professionals concerned with women s health say the lack of such coverage is discriminatory dr lauersen s lawyers are almost certainly counting on a jury that is sympathetic to that point of view , whether or not he actually committed fraud for over 30 years i have dedicated my life to helping women have healthy babies and to fighting those insurance companies that discriminate against women by refusing to pay for their health care , dr lauersen said through his lawyer , ted wells it is ridiculous that insurance companies will pay for a man to have viagra but refuse to pay for a woman to have fertility treatments i am completely innocent , i have never committed insurance fraud and i am confident the jury will acquit me as a rule , gynecologists who are the subject of civil and even criminal cases tend to attract support from a wide range of patients , who often feel an emotional connection because the doctors helped bring their children into the world this feeling is often magnified when a doctor has helped conceive a onechanceonly baby dr lauersen was certainly this kind of hero to many of his patients , but his clinical history is not spotless last year , he resigned under pressure from lenox hill hospital on the upper east side after a difficult delivery he tried to deliver the baby with forceps , but the delivery ultimately ended with a caesarean section , and lenox hill administrators found that he had not followed hospital procedures dr lauersen , whose practice is on park avenue on the upper east side , now admits patients through st

white salmon , wash the 2000 census , bedeviled by poor compliance and charges of intrusiveness , has at least pleased some americans by giving them far more choices than ever before on the question about race while this change may have satisfied some of the critics of the rigid racial classifying the census used to demand , it has not made the process more scientifically accurate no matter which racial box you checked , no one will be able to prove you wrong by any scientific measure , for the simple reason that there is none at the genetic level , race does not exist studies of human dna have found that there is far more genetic variability between individuals within any given racial group than between two such groups human coloration tends to vary with latitude , but skin color is not a reliable indicator of biological kinship for example , subsaharan africans are more genetically similar to europeans than to melanesians , despite the fact that melanesians and subsaharan africans share dark skin and curly hair nevertheless , the census bureau continues to divide americans into distinct racial groups , as it has done since the first census in 1790 the information is now used to help enforce the voting rights act and other civil rights legislation it also helps researchers with problems like identifying patterns of discrimination and uncovering disparities in health and environmental risks collecting racial data is a recognition that although race is not a valid biological concept , it remains a potent cultural and political one it is the pragmatic need to recognize racial divisions despite their deeper irrelevance that bedevils both the census bureau and the many americans , now filling out their forms or talking to census takers , who resist rigid racial categorization to an american woman who has , for example , a father who defines himself as half africanamerican and half asian and a mother who is hispanic , the census question exposes the whole business of race for what it is not only on the genetic level but in the daily reality of her family life forced , arbitrary and ultimately meaningless this year the census recognizes more than a dozen races , selected by a political process , not a scientific one samoans and guamanians are included , for example , but not arabs in the end , it is up to the person filling out the census to make the racial call yet research has shown that when race or ethnicity is determined by selfidentification , the results are often different than when the identification is done by an interviewer the american anthropological association argues that eventually , american society must replace racial classifications with some more accurate way of characterizing the diversity of the american people perhaps ethnic group many americans already consider race and ethnicity interchangeable in a 1996 census bureau test , many respondents viewed hispanic as their racial classification and did not see themselves as belonging under white or any of the other census racial categories whatever the eventual answer , as immigration continues and interracial marriage becomes increasingly common , the census bureau s problems with racial categorization are likely to increase meanwhile , borrowing the census phrase for those who can find no classification they like , i invite others to join me in considering themselves members of some other race the human race
a new novel from the nobel laureate saul bellow generates interest just about everywhere but nowhere as intensely as at the university of chicago and the surrounding neighborhood of hyde park , where mr bellow was a fixture for 30 years before decamping to boston university in 1993 in the living rooms and coffee shops of hyde park , novel readers have always seemed less interested in mr bellow s philosophical opinions than in sleuthing out the evidence of the exwives , faculty colleagues and former friends who are routinely caricatured and kidnapped into his pages hyde park is in a swivet this spring about mr bellow s newest novel , ravelstein the slender epic is roughly a novelized version of the life of the neoconservative writer allan bloom , who died in 1992 in this book mr bellow outs mr bloom , the author of the influential best seller the closing of the american mind , and suggests that he died of aids liberals are crying betrayal , even though they disliked mr bloom and would have been pleased to have his scalp while he was alive conservatives are seething at the novelist for invading the privacy of one of their heroes the media coverage of ravelstein has focused on mr bloom but more experienced bellowwatchers have been drawn to a character in this novel who is blatantly based on the sociologist edward shils , a longtime colleague of mr bellow at the university of chicago s vaunted committee on social thought mr shils was a force at the university in general and the committee in particular for 45 years , right up to his death in 1995 at the age of 84 the honorific mr as you read it here is required by the new york times manual of style and usage but during my years of study at chicago , some students referred to edward shils as mr even talking among themselves at a bar mr shils cut a distinctive figure on the street he never left his apartment without a suit jacket , tie , hat and one of his distinctive walking sticks he was bullishly built with a reddish complexion , wisps of white hair and a blunt , peremptory manner he could be warmly solicitous and was immensely generous with time , money and ideas but he expressed displeasure in a terse , aphoristic style that carried a devastating punch when a contributor to mr shils s academic journal rejected some editing as a matter of taste , mr shils shot back yes , it is only a matter of taste good versus bad taste when his colleague allan bloom made a splash with the closing of the american mind , mr shils said that this muddled , poorly argued tract would better have been called the closing of an american mind as joseph epstein puts it , edward shils was death on intellectual fraudulence mr shils cast an enormous shadow over mr bellow s life as mentor , character model and editor and figures prominently in the best of mr bellow s novels , including mr sammler s planet in 1970 in it , mr bellow borrowed from him to create artur sammler , a watcher of the world who notes everything and is surprised by nothing mr shils also edited the typescript , in that green dunhill ink for which he had long been famous at the university mr shils is affectionately portrayed as professor durnwald in the 1975 novel humboldt s gift , in which mr bellow describes him as one of the most learned men in the world and writes in crude chicago , durnwald , whom i admired and even adored , was the only man with whom i exchanged ideas this warm friendship had dissolved by the time humboldt s gift reached the bookstores people who knew both men say that mr shils had tired of being caricatured in the novels , that bellow was angered that the man he admired and adored did not take him seriously as an intellectual and even that the two of them had argued over a woman the animosity reaches lethal proportions in ravelstein , where mr bellow insinuates that the shils character , rakhmiel kogon , is a closeted homosexual , and describes him as having tyranny baked into his face perhaps to explain the change of heart , mr bellow writes the arts of disguise are so well developed that you are sure to undercount the number of bastards you have known lest we miss the reference , mr bellow gives rakhmiel kogon the shilsian walking stick and his famous green ink an ordinary dead man would have no choice but to go quietly into the next life but mr shils has never been ordinary when mr bellow s biographer , james atlas , publishes the writer s biography next fall , the book will have been shaped to some degree by none other than edward shils , who read a draft annotating it in that famous green ink and disgorged on his death bed a 16 , 000word editing memorandum in revising the book , mr atlas told me recently , i sat at the keyboard with this memo , communing with a dead man we have known for half a century what mr bellow thinks of mr shils come the biography , perhaps we can glimpse , at least after a fashion , what mr shils thinks of him
deitch projects 76 grand street , soho through tomorrow heidi 2 , a videoinstallation collaboration by sue de beer and laura parnes , is what the artists call the unauthorized sequel to a 1990 video by mike kelley and paul mccarthy that recasts the heidi idyll in terms that are alternately perverse and obscure the kelleymccarthy heidi included vaudevillian sex and violence involving lifesize dummies , and tutorials in aesthetics that equated the decorative impulse with wildness , filth and tattoos it gave new meaning to the crime of ornament , as adolf loos called it it ended with heidi in bed , sandwiched between grandpa and peter women dominate the 20minute heidi 2 , which picks up the story a generation later , beginning with a gory birth scene heidi has produced a second heidi , paternity unspecified mother gives daughter lessons in bulimic vomiting daughter kills her own baby and is spanked by grandpa in the showstopping finale she surgically implants a video monitor in her abdomen with mom s help the de beerparnes video benefits from familiarity with the kelleymccarthy video yet pales in comparison , lacking the vicious intellectual framework and mr mccarthy s skills as performer it is great to see two young artists take on their elders on such an ambitious scale , but once past the basic feminizing premise , the video often devolves into disjointed tediousness none of which will stop it from becoming an cult classic some of the sets are good , especially heidi s pinkandblue hello kitty bedroom , but the screening room is too dark for the installation part of the piece , which includes foam chairs and artificial turf to have much effect the kienholzian assemblages in the front gallery , which feature bloodied dolls , must be kidding roberta smith
on feb 24 , 1999 , 20 days after amadou diallo died , wnbctv broadcast an interview with schrrie elliott , a bronx woman who appeared to be the only bystander to have witnessed his shooting by four police officers the report suggested that ms elliott had been less than half a block away , on the same side of the street as the officers and mr diallo s building last monday , wnbc broadcast another interview with ms elliott , whose face was hidden in both interviews this time , however , the report suggested that she had been across the street , looking into the vestibule where mr diallo was killed the reports indicate both the importance and unpredictability of ms elliott , who is to testify today for the second time in the officers' murder trial in albany she is uniquely qualified to corroborate or refute what the officers say happened that night , but her recounting of what she saw has rarely been consistent those inconsistencies will take center stage when ms elliott , who was first called to the stand last week as a defense witness only to give testimony that was more hurtful than helpful to the defense returns as a witness now labeled adverse to the defense the officers sean carroll , kenneth boss , edward mcmellon and richard murphy will also begin testifying today that adverse label will let defense lawyers crossexamine her on her previous statements to wnbc , to the fbi and to a bronx grand jury in doing so , they will try to destroy her credibility on everything except one crucial point that she heard a police officer shout gun ! just before the shooting began they will have as ammunition her own troubled history , including a criminal record her previous brushes with the law underscore that for all parties concerned not least ms elliott her witnessing the shooting was an unfortunate twist of fate i really believe this was her worst nightmare , her sister shneaqua elliott said last week i do n't believe she thought it was going to blow up like this by her sister s account , witnessing the shooting was deeply traumatic for schrrie elliott , who had visited a cousin in the bronx and was walking from the elder avenue subway stop in soundview to her home on evergreen avenue when she saw the shooting on wheeler avenue when shneaqua elliott returned home later that morning , she said , her sister was anxious and trembling she just looked like she had run 10 blocks , with her adrenaline running , shneaqua elliott said she was just shocked schrrie elliott told the grand jury that she did not leave her home for two weeks after the shooting but prosecutors said in court on thursday that records show she had appeared in court regarding a pending criminal case against her on feb 4 , 1999 hours after the shooting regardless of her degree of trauma , there is no question that ms elliott s life had seen its share of turmoil in 32 years the oldest of 10 children raised in the bronx , she had the first of her three children when she was 15 none of her children the youngest is 10 live with her , her sister said ms elliott has supported herself by caring for her siblings' children , her sister said late last year , she moved to a housing project in the south bronx , where she lives with another sister her criminal history , as kept by the state division of criminal justice services , shows that her first arrest like several of her later ones , for drug possession came in 1991 after a 1993 conviction , she served time in state prison , and has been arrested several more times since she was paroled in 1995 shneaqua elliott said she knew that her sister s experiences with the police , coupled with having witnessed the diallo shooting , may have colored her vision of police officers she probably dislikes the police , if she had as much runins as they say she does , shneaqua elliott said indeed , when schrrie elliott decided to tell her story about two and a half weeks after the shooting , she approached not law enforcement officials , but a reporter , scott weinberger of wnbc in a later interview , she said that she had not gone to the authorities because she was worried about her family , but that not talking about what she had seen was giving her nightmares in some ways , however , the nightmare was only beginning after wnbc broadcast the interview with her , in which she said , several times , that an officer had yelled gun ! she rch 18 , 1999 , she testified before the grand jury , saying only that somebody yelled gun ! with support from the presiding judges , prosecutors did not turn over any of ms elliott s previous testimony to the defense they ultimately decided not to call her as their witness , either because of her inconsistency , or , as defense lawyers believe , because her account could prove helpful to the officers defense lawyers say they should have been given access to ms elliott s fbi interview , asserting that her statement that an officer said gun ! supports their case the judge gave them the interview , along with her grand jury testimony , only after she took the stand last week when prosecutors finally gave the names of ms elliott and her lawyer to defense lawyers , she refused to meet with them steven reed , a spokesman for the bronx district attorney , robert t johnson , said prosecutors had every expectation that ms elliott would meet with the defense she dreaded testifying , especially for the defense , her sister said she said , 'i do n't want to do this i do n't want to , ' shneaqua elliott said she did n't want to get involved

washington , march 20 the federal reserve is all but certain to raise its benchmark interest rate by another quarter of a percentage point on tuesday , to 6 percent that much alan greenspan has made clear in his public statements what is less clear is the central bank chairman s thinking about the forces that are driving him to tighten monetary policy in congressional testimony and speeches , mr greenspan has left economists and investors scratching their heads by seeming to assert that the increase in the growth rate of productivity almost universally considered to be the most unambiguously positive development in the nation s recent economic history is now to be blamed for causing inflation and although the riches generated by wall street s bull run have been reaped by relatively few people , mr greenspan seems to have concluded that the stock market is the primary channel through which inflation is being transmitted throughout the economy never mind that even mr greenspan cannot find much inflation it may be months or years before it will be possible to judge whether mr greenspan is doing the right thing for the right reasons some economists think the fed chairman is taking a straightforward situation an economy that is growing too fast for its own good and overanalyzing the causes others think mr greenspan is creating an elaborate justification for raising rates to mask a desire to bring down the stock market and it is possible that mr greenspan is deliberately sowing confusion to keep investors off balance and avoid a further runup in stock prices the markets seem to have picked up his basic message that tuesday s rate increase is unlikely to be the last , given the persistent strength of the economy and while aspects of his thinking remain veiled , interviews with economists and fed officials , as well as a close reading of mr greenspan s statements over the last few months , help to bring his views into focus on critical issues including productivity , the stock market and the scale of the changes the economy is undergoing yes , mr greenspan sees the surge in productivity growth as a root cause of the imbalances that threaten the long expansion by driving up profit expectations , productivity growth drives stock prices higher , leaving investors feeling rich and willing to spend in the short run , at least , the growth in demand exceeds the growth in the economy s ability to provide offsetting increases in supply , creating the potential for inflationary bottlenecks but mr greenspan has also tried to point out that the same productivitydriven forces that send stock prices and consumer spending up have a countervailing effect that helps dampen the economy because increased productivity implies higher rates of return on investment , productivity improvements lead to a rise in demand for capital to take advantage of those returns that in turn puts upward pressure on interest rates in the financial markets , slowing growth although chairman greenspan has taken a lot of flak for posing the inflation threat in the context of productivity s demandside effects , the chairman s larger point often seems overlooked , economists at salomon smith barney wrote earlier this month the most basic source of upward pressure on interest rates is the market itself that leaves the fed in the role of validating what the bond market is already doing making it more expensive for corporations and consumers to borrow money mr greenspan s favorite indicator of interest rates is not the yield on government securities , but the standard poor s bbb corporate debt rate , adjusted for inflation expectations by that figure , rates are up a full percentage point over the last year or so indeed , mr greenspan , who is viewed as all but omnipotent by investors around the world , seems to see his role in the current climate as merely surfing in the wake of the debt markets rather than leading them that implies that , barring a surge in inflation or a sharp drop in the unemployment rate , mr greenspan is likely to stick to his preference for incremental quarterpoint rate increases rather than grabbing the attention of the markets through halfpoint increases market forces , not the federal reserve , are driving up interest rates to close the gap between supply and demand for funds , mr greenspan told the senate banking committee last month we at the federal reserve are acting in conjunction with the market and responding to it mr greenspan sees the stock market as the mechanism through which productivity gains are transformed into wealth and increased demand but if he is to be taken at his word and some investors have their doubts he does not seem to be worried so much about any particular market index as he is about aggregate wealth creation across the economy , including the substantial wealth being generated by rising home values when they look at stocks , fed officials tend to watch the wilshire 5 , 000 , which captures the broad movement of nearly all equity capital mr greenspan has not shown much concern either about the way in which old economy dow jones industrial stocks and new economy nasdaq stocks often seem to be moving in opposite directions , as they did again today , with the nasdaq down sharply and the dow up the fed chairman seems to have concluded that the upheaval in the market represents a perhaps understandably confused effort by investors to determine where returns are highest at a time of mindboggling technological change investors in technology companies in particular , not comfortable dealing with discontinuous shifts in economic structure , are groping for the appropriate valuations for these companies , mr greenspan told a conference in boston earlier this month more than most policy makers , mr greenspan has a keen sense of history in the last few years , he has frequently described the current combination of healthy growth , low inflation , low unemployment and surging productivity as unprecedented in my half century of observing the american economy but lately , mr greenspan has gone even further , stating that technology is driving the economy into a transformation so fundamental that there is nothing to compare it to this type of economy is one that none of us has ever seen before , and indeed it may be unprecedented in our history , mr greenspan told the senate banking committee last month the type of policy we have to devise has to reflect the nature of how the new economy is working , he said a number of the old tools which we relied upon do n't have relevance to this translation even mr greenspan is not sure that traditional monetary policy can be counted on to work as it has in the past , disconcerting , perhaps , to those who assume the fed chairman has it all under control photo alan greenspan , chairman of the federal reserve
the b train that derailed tuesday night in downtown brooklyn , injuring 95 passengers , was traveling along a route it did not usually take and was crossing back to its own tracks when its third car jumped off the rails , transit officials said yesterday officials said it could be several weeks before they determined what caused the accident , which sent passengers flying into the walls of the cars and into each other but state transportation safety investigators and the national transportation safety board were focusing on a switch south of the dekalb avenue station that was supposed to redirect the b train onto a crossover that leads back to its own tracks into the early morning hours of wednesday , transit workers were unsure whether they could even with a team of 200 hoist the cars back into place and repair the damaged rails in time for the morning rush but by 5 40 am , less than eight hours after the accident , service was back to normal at the station mayor rudolph w giuliani said yesterday that the main theory was that the switch had failed why that affected the third car on the train and not the first two , i do n't know , he said in terms of injuries , the derailment was the worst accident in the subway system since 1997 , when a train rearended another waiting at a red light in a tunnel between two stations in queens in that crash , 87 passengers had minor injuries tuesday s derailment was the third near the same area in the dekalb avenue station the other two , in 1985 and 1996 , were caused by problems with tracks that were under construction but tuesday s accident appeared to have none of the elements that usually conspire to cause a derailment the tracks were not being repaired the eight stainless steel cars that make up the train are among the newest in the system , built from 1986 to 1988 the b train was apparently not going too fast it was just leaving the station and the switch that the train was passing over had been refurbished in the mid1980 s and inspected twice in the last four months , transit officials said but when the third car of the train passed over the switch at 9 52 pm , the front half of the undercarriage failed to turn onto the connection tracks , which curve to the left the whole car was pulled off the tracks , and the front of the car hit a dividing wall in the tunnel near the tracks the third car also wrenched the back half of the second car off the tracks officials said one reason they thought that the train was not traveling too fast was that the accident caused little damage to the front of the third car , where it smashed into the wall the force did not even shatter the front window of the car but it was enough to throw passengers around like dolls , especially in the front cars the train jerked , and in about two seconds , it jerked again , said ruth swen , 19 , who was heading home from her job as a saleswoman we looked at each other , and then people started flying i flew when i opened my eyes , everything was dark the driver , he came on and said 'i do n't know what is going on i'm hurt myself i banged my head i do n't know what is going on' transit officials said only one passenger remained in the hospital yesterday , a man who had suffered a head injury tuesday night , two other passengers were admitted to hospitals and listed in serious condition , one with a head injury and another who had a heart ailment and had complained of chest pains most of the injuries were bruises and cuts other passengers complained of problems related to the intense heat in the tunnel and the station officials said they did not know how many passengers were aboard the train as is normal after any subway accident , the motorman who has been on the job for 23 years and the conductor , a 15year veteran , were required to take drug and alcohol tests i have no reason to suspect we 're going to find any indications of that , said lawrence g reuter , the president of new york city transit the motorman and conductor were also interviewed by investigators transit officials did not release their names yesterday , and the officials would not comment on the results of the tests or on the interviews mr reuter said investigators began examining the switch and connecting tracks about 4 30 am yesterday , after the 37ton cars were hoisted back onto the tracks and driven to a coney island yard , where they will be dismantled and examined right now , we 're going through a process of elimination , like we do on every accident , mr reuter said we 're checking signals there s no indication there was a signal problem , but all signals are being checked in that location power systems are going to be checked the cars are going to be checked mark a yanche , the chief of operations for the division that handles track repair , said yesterday that the b train involved in the accident had been rerouted from the b line to the d line at some point before it reached the dekalb avenue station because a slowmoving work train was in front of it on the b tracks , moving from one maintenance yard to another normally , the b bypasses dekalb avenue and makes its first brooklyn stop at pacific street but because the b train involved in the accident was passing through the dekalb station , it stopped so passengers could get on and off when the train pulled out , it headed toward the switch to take it to its connection to return to its usual tracks robert slovak , a spokesman for the transit agency , said the switch and connection were often used to reroute trains from the b and from the nearby n tracks onto the d tracks to avoid congestion or repairs but transit officials were unable to say yesterday whether the b train that derailed was the first to pass over the switch that night , or whether other trains had successfully made the crossover whatever the case , the switch and connecting tracks were back in use yesterday the switch right now is not a problem , mr reuter said whether it was a problem last night , we 'll have to tell you photo the train that jumped the tracks tuesday night was on a route it did not usually take passengers were sent flying into walls of cars and into each other , and 95 were injured \( steve spak \) \( pg b1 \) chart the investigation putting the pieces together investigators are still

atlanta , oct 8 coach jim fassel of the giants has pleaded with his defense to provide more of a pass rush since the preseason today the team s defensive coordinator , john fox , used a variety of blitzes for the first time this season in fact , the giants' game plan appeared to involve getting quarterback chris chandler out of the game , because once the giants learned they could rush the pocket , they did not stop the giants collected four sacks , including the gameclincher by defensive end michael strahan with 1 minute 45 seconds remaining strahan hit the substitute quarterback danny kanell for a 7yard loss when the falcons had a secondand10 at the giants' 10yard line atlanta could not score or get a first down , basically ending the game strahan was expected to have a good game against the atlanta rookie right tackle michael thompson but thompson partly tore an achilles' tendon early in the game and was replaced by another rookie , travis claridge strahan said he watched film of thompson all week and it took him more than a half to adjust in my mind , i figured out that once i stop thinking i need to get a sack , i 'll get one , strahan said that was a long time ago , because strahan said he no longer worries about getting sacks i had one last week , he said i had one this week somebody asked if i was in a rut \? i do n't get it what s expected , 20 a game \? hamilton injured defensive tackle keith hamilton left the game in the third quarter with a sprained right knee and had xrays taken after the game the results were not immediately known plenty of boos whether it was directed at him or the play calling , atlanta running back jamal anderson heard an unusual number of boos from the crowd anderson , coming back from a major knee injury , finished with 12 yards on 12 carries and was not a factor in the second half cleared for action giants linebacker mike barrow , who has a pinched nerve in his neck , was cleared to play by doctors but did not dress for the game the injury also forced him to miss half of last week s game against tennessee , but jim fassel said barrow should return next sunday against dallas barrow , who had no history of neck problems , said last week that he had had the injury for four weeks pete monty started for barrow at middle linebacker and had five tackles and one sack solid effort by kicker with brad daluiso \( stiff back \) inactive for the second straight game , jaret holmes again served as the placekicker and had two field goals and an extra point holmes also did his part against atlanta s vaunted kick returners , averaging 62 yards on kickoffs , although none reached the end zone rafael hermoso
going into the week of april 10 , the shareholders of the vignette corporation had more reason than most to be optimistic about its stock price the company s new series of ecommerce software programs was about to be introduced , and a 3for1 stock split was to take effect that week but the optimism evaporated quickly the stock was pummeled as technology shares continued their monthlong collapse that week it fell even further when the split took effect that friday the day that inflation worries knocked the floor out from under the nasdaq vignette finished at 4225 , down 37 percent for the week and 57 percent from its high of 99 on march 10 jeff wrona , portfolio manager of the 302 billion pbhg technology and communications fund , watched the price dive and felt painfully sick sicker than perhaps any other vignette shareholder , save the software maker s executives vignette , a company that mr wrona said has great prospects for both long and shortterm growth , represented his largest ecommerce software holding by far in the days that followed , mr wrona and others asked themselves a question what exactly to do with the businesstobusiness ecommerce stocks they had poured so much money into in the previous months \? businesstobusiness , or btob , internet stocks had restored ecommerce s good name in investor circles this spring they did so during an abysmal showing by businesstoconsumer internet stocks like etoys , cdnow and scores of others that had basked in nasdaq s glow last year , but collapsed in value amid disappointing christmas performances indeed , a casual observer , looking at the performance of the two stock groups , might have thought that investors were shoveling the cash they had pulled out of etoys which fell by half from dec 31 to march 10 into the vignettes of the world just as quickly , though , the btob group turned into the prime killing ground for overvalued technology stocks the merrill lynch b2b internet holdrs trust , a security that tracks 20 such companies , fell 686 percent from march 10 through april 14 over that period , the nasdaq composite fell 342 percent there were a couple of reasons for the severity of the selloff one was the outrageously high prices to which many of the stocks had rocketed the internet capital group , an incubator for industryspecific btob marketplaces , went public at 12 in august and screamed to an intraday high of 212 a share on dec 22 a dozen btob stocks including internet capital , ariba , commerce one and purchasepro which were not yet public before the middle of last year had soared to garner 125 billion of market capitalization between them in roughly six months another problem was the rising tide of skepticism that seemed to engulf the sector , much of it was wellfounded in the mania , it seemed as if any company that had ever sold a good or service over the internet rolled out a btob play , hoping to net a quick jolt in its stock price in march , yahoo , the internet portal company , announced the creation of a business marketplace where industries could research and buy goods that came five days after ebay announced its own btob exchange while bidding up the stock prices of the early marketplace leaders , investors failed to account for the very real threat posed by industry incumbents like general motors , ford motor and general electric , whose entry promised to undermine the revenue dreams of socalled pureplay internet companies these stocks certainly got way ahead of themselves , said ed mccabe , a merrill lynch analyst btob addresses huge market opportunities , but today there s still little traction , so these stocks are discounting a rosy future when you discount 20 years of good news , even slightly bad news today can have a significant effect on the present value of those stocks investors had come to look at information through the rosiest glasses one of the most widely quoted statistics on the businesstobusiness sector was one put forth by the gartner group it estimated that a staggering 73 trillion worth of global corporate spending would go through the internet in 2004 , up from 145 billion last year few people , however , cited the more salient figure in that same gartner report that nearly twothirds of that money would go directly from manufacturers to suppliers , not to the btob internet companies providing software , technology and the marketplace platforms to clear the path for that spending still , that leaves roughly 27 trillion for the btob internet market a healthy number by any standard , even if not enough to justify market all the euphoria and the recent selloff has done nothing to diminish the prospects of the btob sector generating that much business , analysts and institutional investors said indeed , according to geri spieler , a gartner analyst , there will be enormous pressure from both buyers and suppliers to adopt ecommerce over the next five years because of the enormous cost savings involved ms spieler said that in 2005 , when the first round of corporate technological buildup nears completion , the entire supply chain between suppliers and buyers will be automated any company will be able to order anything on the web and have it customized , whatever , she added that s nirvana

ocean city tyler hill was teeing off at the first hole , a grudge match with his brother and his father neither one was much watching him , though their heads were turned to the small cherokee with an open cockpit taking off not 100 yards behind them , and then whipsawing to look at an attractive woman in a bikini who was walking by presumably , tiger woods never had the distractions that 8yearold tyler had last saturday afternoon but then , mr woods has never played the ocean city municipal golf course , in all likelihood the only 12hole golf course in the country and one of few bordered on one side by an airport and three blocks from a jampacked beach legend has it , says the city s director of recreation , mike allegretto , that the course built in 1957 just as the postworld war ii building boom was billowing in earnest at this noalcohol familyoriented resort just south of atlantic city was rushed to completion that summer with only 12 holes because that is all that were ready i was about 10 years old when they did it , said mr allegretto , who took over responsibility for the golf course this spring then i guess it was like any other city project you get going and then you lose steam , and then sometimes , you do n't get to the final phase of it eventually , the land near 26th street and bay avenue , where the golf course entrance is situated , was put to other uses a recycling center and soccer fields , instead of six more golf holes , now lie west of the existing 12 holes curiously jutting only a few yards behind a swath of marsh grass along the 8th , 9th and 10th holes is the runway for the ocean city municipal airport built in part for commercial and military dirigible traffic along the coast as a works progress administration project during the great depression in 1935 , the airport now parks as many as 100 small planes on a summer weekend it costs 7 to park a plane there 24 hours , although the fee is refunded if the golf course is played theoretically , you can fly in , play a round of golf , walk to the beach and fly out , said mr allegretto some people do actually do that it s a good day , i would think a small pro shop is connected to the airport waiting room by a winding corridor go through another door in the waiting room and you come to the airport diner , a restaurant with 50 seats that boasts the best breakfast at the shore an allpurpose friendly place , said mr allegretto indeed , complaints about exorbitant prices are rare here complete breakfasts at the diner include creamed chip beef with home fries for 550 and a large stack of french toast for 450 ocean city golf shirts go for only 11 , golf umbrellas 9 but the real bargain is the golf a round 12 holes , remember costs 9 , and 7 for those over 62 and under 19 on weekdays it costs 5 to rent clubs and a bag \( emblazoned rental in twofoothigh letters to thwart theft \) there are two carts that can be rented , though mr allegretto says the 1 , 560yard layout is not much of a strain a 10play pass is 75 russell hill was getting his 10play pass punched for himself and his sons , tyler , 8 , and stephen , 10 the hills stay about three blocks from the course on summer weekends , and while none of them profess to be a great golfers , all like coming to ocean city municipal it s good for the kids , even if it can be slow when it s crowded , said mr hill frankly , i come here because its the only place i can par a hole ocean city municipal plays to a par 37 , which means that all holes except the 235yard 10th , which has a bit of marsh surrounding it , are a par 3 the first hole , in fact , going from the airport runway east to just short of bay avenue , is only 60yards long even i use a pitching wedge on that one , said mr allegretto , who gives golf lessons during the school year through the recreation department , and admits to having once played a par round there even novices are unlikely to use a wood on the course , except for perhaps the parfour 10th hole the bag of rental clubs includes only a 3 , 5 and 7iron , a wedge and a putter but it is the coziness of the course that attracts rich dominico and his son , richie jr , 16 we come down for vacation for a week and we get to play twice or so , said the elder mr dominico it s great instead of driving somewhere and taking five or six hours to play , well be done here in two and a half hours and be on the beach a halfhour later richie jr added when you 're on vacation , you want to do a lot of things ocean city is a place where you can do everything mr allegretto said the course more or less ran itself , and he got few complaints , though he would like to hire someone next summer to give lessons because the course is so close to bay avenue and the runway , large nets are suspended from utility poles to protect passing vehicles we just want to be safe , said mr allegretto , though we have n't had anyone slice one into an airplane taking off yet photos the ocean city golf course , next to the airport \( inset \) , was hurriedly completed in 1957 with 12 holes the town never finished it \( photographs by nancy wegard for the new york times \)
austin , tex , feb 4 in the past , when gov george w bush pondered his astonishingly charmed political career , he sometimes sought metaphors to describe the feeling of being propelled and kept afloat by forces that were larger than he was , and beyond his control he once compared himself to a cork in a stream it was an acknowledgment that he had managed to become the governor of texas without too much fuss or any previous experience in office it also remarked on the dizzying spectacle of watching republican kingmakers and money men beat a path to his door after his landslide reelection in 1998 mr bush , in other words , has had it pretty easy so his crushing defeat to senator john mccain in the new hampshire primary , after what many republicans call a halfhearted campaign there , has led many political observers and republican officials to wonder how much they really know about the level of determination , energy and humility that mr bush can bring to this quest can he reach down into his gut and find the passion , inspiration and invention that a pivotal juncture like this one requires \? can he regroup , retool , hone a message that apparently did not resonate and find a tone that is more commanding , and less merrily lackadaisical , than the one he has used so far \? those are very real questions rooted in the nature of how all of this came about , said bruce buchanan , a political science professor at the university of texas here the governor did not go out and build this possibility for himself in any kind of dogged , persistent way of bill clinton or richard nixon , two prototypes of people who decided they wanted to be president at the age of 4 but the new hampshire primary cast doubts on whether mr bush or , for that matter , his advisers were fully prepared to capitalize on that chance in the days leading up to the contest , mr bush clung to a confidence about the outcome that proved entirely unwarranted , and he followed a schedule that was sometimes curiously undemanding he took midday breaks he played in the snow for television cameras and he gave the impression of being tired and homesick they mailed in the campaign , marveled a republican strategist in washington they did an endorsement a day , and they went sledding even one of mr bush s advisers acknowledged i think he worked hard in new hampshire , but i think they were all surprised by how hard he had to work until you do this , you do n't get it now more than ever , mr bush has to fight and the signals of whether he is up to the task indeed , whether he truly appreciates the need are contradictory and inconclusive his public manner since he left new hampshire has been relentlessly upbeat and even as polls showed that support in south carolina was flagging , he arrived there with an arsenal of optimistic quips about shaking the snow off his suit , moving past a bump in the road and onto a smooth highway , forsaking an alien land for a patch of terra firma that was clearly bush country he chalked up new hampshire as an aberration , and so , too , did some of his senior aides , almost all of whom have been with mr bush for the last five years in texas and know him as a charismatic , easygoing man who always rides high but mr bush said in a private interview in detroit today that anyone who mistook his jocularity and stubborn optimism for an inability to hunker down and fight was misreading him make no mistake about it , he said emphatically in the back hallway of a church where he was campaigning not only do i want to win , i'm going to win i want to win bad enough to win , and i'm going to win you can mark it down in your book on this day , i told you , looked you in the eye , and said i'm going to win the nomination , and i believe i'm going to win the presidency you should not be lulled into a false sense about me , about my competitive nature and my desire to lead this country , he said there are external signs that mr bush is heeding the lessons of new hampshire in the past two days , he has significantly ratcheted up his criticisms of mr mccain he began to question mr mccain s calls for more integrity in government , noting reports in newspapers that the arizona senator sometimes received favors or campaign contributions from people who appeared before the senate commerce committee , which mr mccain chairs he challenged mr mccain s claims that his proposal for tax cuts did not leave enough surplus money for social security , a charge he answered less aggressively in new hampshire the bush campaign began running a television commercial in south carolina tonight that belittled mr mccain s assertion , likened mr mccain to president clinton and other democrats and labeled mr bush the true conservative on taxes , the ad states , mccain echoes washington democrats , when we need a conservative leader to challenge them ari fleischer , a spokesman for the bush campaign , said more was in store i think you 're going to see the fire in the governor s belly when he comes out on monday , mr fleischer said we are not going to let senator mccain again engage in the type of misrepresentation of the governor s position he successfully engaged in in new hampshire mr bush also began rounding out the economic thrust of his oratory in new hampshire with some of the broader themes he articulated all through the first phase of his campaign last year like the importance of personal responsibility and trying to diminish the number of children born out of wedlock and encouraging youths to stay off drugs but he still seems to be hanging much of his campaign on the promotion of a massive tax cut that polls suggest is not high on many voters' lists of priorities and even in the wake of new hampshire , he continued the parade of endorsements that played directly into mr mccain s claim that what was happening in the republican primary was a coronation , not an election on wednesday , in greenville , sc , mr bush trotted out former vice president dan quayle the gesture left some political analysts scratching their heads mr bush s friends and advisers say that none of this should be read as complacency moreover , it remains to be seen if mr bush can harness and sustain the energy for what is shaping up to be a longer primary fight than anyone originally envisioned when clay johnson , mr bush s texas chief of staff and lifelong friend , praised mr bush s discipline in an interview two months ago , the anecdote easily yielded to a different interpretation he had two hard halfdays , mr johnson said of mr bush s schedule as governor he said mr bush began at 8 30 am , ended around 5 30 pm and had 90 minutes to two hours of personal time it requires a lot of discipline not to get sucked into a lunch or a meeting or something , he said but it s an inviolate part of his routine , and so , be it a light lunch or exercise or whatever it is , he insists on getting that it s very hard to do , as you can imagine all my friends say it s impossible to exercise i say , how can the governor carve the time out if you ca n't \? photo in light of george w bush s defeat in new hampshire primary , some people have questioned whether the texas governor has been overconfident and has sometimes followed undemanding schedules campaigning in detroit yesterday , mr bush recited the pledge of allegiance at the perfecting church academy of performing arts \( agence francepresse \) \( pg a11 \)
on jan 26 , just three weeks into rehearsals for the broadway musical the wild party , the hollywood producer scott rudin wrote a letter to george c wolfe , the producer of the joseph papp public theater , to tell him that he was pulling his money out of the show when we agreed to go forward together , i fully understood that you guys were going to be the lead producers on the venture , which i never had a problem with , provided that the criteria we agreed upon were put in place and adhered to , mr rudin wrote to be told yesterday 'george is an artist and does n't have time for producing issues' so contravenes the understanding , that i feel it is pointless to try and continue mr rudin was ultimately persuaded to stay on , a decision he later said he regretted although the show opened in april and went on to receive nominations for seven tony awards , it won none and quickly closed the commercial failure of the wild party raised broad questions both about the public and about broadway s capacity to handle unorthodox fare an examination of the musical s short , troubled life highlights those issues and the problems that can arise in the increasingly frequent partnerships between nonprofit theaters and commercial producers although many say the wild party might have had an easier time starting at the public rather than highstakes broadway , the public theater wanted to produce it uptown from the beginning the production , which mr wolfe wrote with the composer michael john lachiusa and also directed , was the season s second adaptation of the 1928 poem by joseph moncure march , which chronicles a debauched evening of orgies , shared misery and murder manhattan theater club did the first wild party , written and composed by andrew lippa , in january the public considered the wolfelachiusa version to be broadwaycaliber material , particularly because vanessa williams had initially agreed to star the public s board chairman , kenneth b lerer , said that going straight to broadway also made economic sense because the public planned to put up just 24 million , or half the cost of the show , only 900 , 000 more than it would have cost to produce it downtown at the public on lafayette street and to do the show justice , mr wolfe and mr lachiusa said , they needed an orchestra pit and sizeable proscenium stage \( in addition , they said , their female star , toni collette , who replaced ms williams when she became pregnant , would agree to appear only on broadway ms collette s agent , adam isaacs , however , said this was totally untrue \) to help bring the show to broadway , everyone working on it agreed to work for belowbroadway rates , said john breglio , the public s lawyer the public knew it could not afford to produce wild party on broadway without outside financial help , given that musicals usually cost from 5 million to 10 million these days and that the public spent 8 million on a failed revival of on the town last year so mr wolfe approached mr rudin , who in turn invited three other commercial producers to take part roger berlind , elizabeth williams and anita waxman mr rudin s team put up half of the show s 48 million cost while the public provided the other half and agreed to cover any overruns , which ultimately amounted to more than 1 million the public agreed to split the profits almost evenly with the commercial producers mr rudin said that he was initially enthusiastic about the project and that he expected vanessa williams s name to sell tickets i thought it had great artistic promise , although the subject matter made it a tough bet , he said those present at the show s first rehearsal remember the excitement in the air still , board members say they were realistic about the show s financial prospects we never thought of 'the wild party' as another 'chorus line , ' never thought it would be a commercial hit , mr lerer said in my wildest dreams i thought it would break even mr rudin saw the public s attitude toward potential losses as cavalier , which is partly what soured him on the partnership george wolfe invited me and my colleagues into this project because he said he wanted a partner in producing this show with the public theater , mr rudin said in fact what he wanted was investors to hand over the money and walk away and not care where it was spent , how it was spent or whether there would ever be even the possibility of a return more than a clash of nonprofit and commercial cultures , mr wolfe said , it was a clash of personalities the theater is fundamentally about collaboration , he said it was not a good collaboration with scott because scott is not a good collaborator he needs to be in charge if he is not in charge , it tends to color his passion and his generosity of spirit mr rudin said that over time he came to feel that the show was badly managed because mr wolfe closely guarded all decisions on elements like marketing , advertising and publicity

tallahassee , fla , nov 24 lawyers for gov george w bush asked a judge today to direct more than a dozen florida counties to reinstate the absentee ballots of overseas military voters that were disqualified because they lacked postmarks , dates and proper signatures , and even some that came from unregistered voters but the judge , l ralph smith of leon county circuit court , gave them little hope without any proof that any of these canvassing boards have not complied with the law , the court is very hardpressed to grant any relief , because the court just does n't enter orders telling elected officials to comply with the law , judge smith said he said he would consider further arguments on saturday before issuing a written ruling even without a ruling , though , some counties have begun to reassess absentee ballots that they had disqualified , winning mr bush at least 17 more votes officials in clay county were dropped as defendants in mr bush s suit today after they reconsidered overseas absentee ballots and decided to count 14 of the 17 that they had rejected earlier mr bush picked up a net gain of 12 votes there mr bush gained two more votes in okaloosa county two in bay county and one in nassau county , republican officials said oddly enough , it was the republicans' defeat in the florida supreme court , which extended the deadline for certifying the state s election results until sunday evening , that gave the republicans time to raise the absenteeballot issue , get some disqualified votes counted and file the lawsuit fred h bartlit , the lead attorney for mr bush here , seized on the newly counted votes to declare victory if one more soldier got to vote , it will be a success , he said after the hearing if today s hearing clarified anything , it was just how muddy and full of conflicts florida elections laws are one state law says that only overseas ballots with postmarks can be counted , while an administrative rule says that overseas ballots can be counted as long as they have a postmark or are properly signed and dated before election day and , in a conflict that seemed particularly troublesome to judge smith , florida law states that absentee ballots must be received by the supervisor by 7 pm the day of the election , while an administrative rule states that absentee votes can be received up to 10 days after the election judge smith asked repeatedly about the discrepancy mr bush s lawyers argued that the administrative rule should be given precedence over the state law , contrary to the usual practice , because it was written in response to a federal suit challenging florida election laws today s hearing was the outgrowth of a major publicrelations offensive that the republicans began late last week accusing the democrats of trying to disenfranchise members of the military by challenging their absentee ballots , which tended to favor mr bush suddenly , the positions of both sides in south florida were reversed , with the republicans arguing for leeway in evaluating ballots and the democrats calling for strict compliance with the rules mr bartlit argued , for example , that even overseas military ballots with neither a postmark nor a date could be counted , because many absentee ballots contain no request or place for a date judge smith sounded skeptical about the idea so you can have an undated ballot received by the supervisor of elections after the election has already taken place , and that should be counted \? he asked mr bartlit also argued that writein absentee ballots should be accepted , even when the county has no record of a request for an absentee ballot and he argued that absentee ballots from unregistered voters in the military should be counted , citing a federal law that recommends that states waive registration for military voters but does not require such a waiver only a few of the defendants made it to court none had been given proper notice of the suit , and several said that they learned of it only after 5 pm on wednesday , the day before thanksgiving those who came to the hearing in a mostly darkened courtroom that was supposed to be closed for the day argued that they had complied with the law we feel we have done exactly what the law requires us to do , mike chester , a lawyer for okaloosa county , said photo fred h bartlit , a lawyer for gov george w bush , offered a federal writein absentee ballot as an exhibit yesterday in leon county circuit court \( chang w lee the new york times \)
washington , july 21 successive house and senate votes on thursday night to ease restrictions on american travel and certain sales to cuba are the latest evidence of a gradual but seismic shift toward normalizing ties with the marxistrun island , according to lawmakers and experts on cuba republicans defected by the score from their party s traditional proembargo stance and this week handed a dual victory to the coalition of farming interests , business groups and democrats trying to lift american sanctions both chambers of congress approved the sale of food and medicine to cuba and the house went one step further , seeking to allow american tourism to the island by barring money to the federal agencies that enforce against it none of the provisions are expected to win final approval before september , if ever but they signal an important change in how american decisionmakers view cuba , possibly the most momentous shift since 1994 , when the clinton administration first decided to intercept cuban refugees at sea and send them home and , the experts and lawmakers say , the change raises the likelihood that the next president and congress will feel freer to remove the remaining restrictions on ties with havana clearly the barriers are coming down , said peter hakim , president of the interamerican dialogue , a hemispheric forum in washington the people who want to hold onto the structure of the embargo are slowly losing the game an administration official predicted the trade ban would likely be eliminated after the november elections , no matter who controlled congress or the white house the embargoeasing amendments in the house on thursday night , sponsored by representatives mark sanford of south carolina and jerry moran of kansas , both conservative republicans , passed with votes of 232 to 186 in favor of the travel provision and 301 to 116 supporting food and medical sales within an hour , the senate overwhelmingly approved 79 to 13 an agriculture bill that also approved food and medicine sales but barred american credits to facilitate the trade the votes are likely to strengthen the prospects for a separate measure by representative george nethercutt , republican of washington , to allow food and medical sales , which moves into a conference committee in september republican leaders and cubanamerican lawmakers who have sought to stymie the nethercutt proposal will have to rethink their stance , said john s kavulich ii , president of the uscuba trade and economic council , a clearinghouse for american businesses interested in trade with cuba it used to be democrats fighting republicans on wanting to expand the relationship with cuba , mr kavulich said now , it s republicans fighting republicans , with the democrats standing to the side waiting to see what happens cuba watchers say several factors have changed the perception of cuba and the united states policy of diplomatic isolation and economic boycott the bruising battles over trade with china and the clinton administration s rationale that engaging beijing is in america s strategic interest have invited charges of hypocrisy over cuba in advocating greater contact with cubans , mr sanford invoked a conservative icon , former president ronald reagan , saying his decision to let american students travel to eastern europe helped bring down the berlin wall the rhetoric behind this was that you change societies by contact , and that americans can make a difference by being there , said pamela falk , a cuba expert at the city university of new york s law school but some supporters of sanctions say fidel castro has shown himself much more impervious to liberalizing reforms than china s leaders the american public believes cuba has changed because the world has changed , said senator robert g torricelli , democrat of new jersey it s an assumption that unfortunately is contradicted by reality another significant factor influencing americans' shifting perceptions of cuba came in the elian gonzalez case from the morning news through the nightly talk shows , americans were forced to think about cuba and cubanamericans for months the administration s decision to return elian to cuba over what many saw as the strident objections of the 6yearold s miami relatives undercut the image of the wellfinanced cubanamerican lobby as invulnerable and not to be challenged in a recent interview , joe garcia , the newly appointed executive director of the cuban american national foundation , a lobby that long exerted virtual veto power over united states policy , acknowledged losing critical ground probably the most important thing we realized was we have to depend on ourselves in this struggle to educate the american people , mr garcia said

westminster , md it took only a short time before baltimore ravens linebacker ray lewis got a taste of what his return to the national football league was going to be like after the nationally televised trial in which he was accused of killing two people the ravens were scrimmaging recently against the washington redskins and lewis was doing what he always does hitting hard , running fast , simply dominating suddenly the voice of a fan wearing a redskins jersey rose over the clang of banging shoulder pads other voices joined in they yelled to lewis , we know you did it lewis had been waiting for that first comment from a fan , and when it came , he said , he felt no twinge of anger he said the harsh words rolled off his back like water in a rainstorm at one point , lewis had faced the real possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison , where there are no super bowls or big paychecks so tough words from a few fans meant little to him they do n't play in between the lines , lewis said i do you know what \? guys who yell that stuff are n't fans they 're jerks i ca n't let them bother me little seems to bother lewis right now as he works his way back to normalcy in his private and professional lives while simultaneously changing his lifestyle lewis maintains that he will now choose his friends better and that when he does go to a night club , he will try to avoid the more raucous hangouts lewis also says he will take the extraordinary step of hiring an offduty police officer to accompany him whenever he is in a social setting a bodyguard for an allpro nfl linebacker \? not bodyguard in the true sense of the word after all , lewis has muscles on top of his muscles he simply wants an extra set of eyes to watch his back there are certain situations where i might go out and do something with friends or my teammates , lewis said even in the most careful setting something can happen i want to make sure what happened to me in atlanta never happens again i want to have an officer with me who will say , 'ray lewis was with me the entire time' that s what you have a bodyguard for please forgive lewis if he seems overly cautious as recently as may , he was wearing an orange prison jumpsuit after being accused of taking part in the stabbing deaths of two men outside an atlanta night club hours after the super bowl lewis and two friends , reginald oakley and joseph sweeting , were charged with murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon the trial ensued and lewis , rightly or wrongly , became a symbol of nfl athletes run amok but the prosecution s case crumbled and in early june the murder charges were dropped in exchange for a guilty plea by lewis to obstruction of justice , a misdemeanor lewis admitted that he had not told police investigators all that he knew about the murders when he was questioned shortly after the incident , and that he had told his codefendants to say nothing about what had happened as part of the deal , lewis agreed to testify against oakley and sweeting , who were later found not guilty by a jury despite those tortuous months , anyone expecting a downtrodden , or extremely bitter , lewis will be disappointed i can sit here and gripe , i can grind , i can be mad at the world and hate everybody , he said but that s not me but let me be honest with you you 're always going to have some moments where you have these thoughts in your mind saying , 'why would people treat me like that \? ' that s the tough part about it not to the point where i want revenge no , i did n't like the way the prosecution treated me no , i did n't like the way the police handled me i did not like that never will but i do n't hold a grudge i 'll just never have dinner with those guys the experience actually motivated lewis , who at age 25 is already one of the nfl s premier linebackers lewis was the league s leading tackler last season , with 167 , and he has been selected for the pro bowl three times in his four nfl seasons his team will play a preseason game with the jets tomorrow night in baltimore lewis worked out each day after court in atlanta with his good friend shannon sharpe , and as a result lewis is a sturdy 253 pounds with 7 percent body fat he is in the best shape of his career what was happening to me made me push myself even harder , lewis said sometimes we would walk out of the weight room , and then turn around and go back in , because i would think of the trial , and it would make me angry , and then i 'd want to take it out on the weights he now reaps the benefits of those workouts , as does his team because of solid freeagent signings , including that of sharpe , a tight end from denver , an excellent draft from the most underrated personnel department in football and a motivated lewis on what last season was already the league s secondranked defense , there is no question baltimore is a super bowl contender the ravens are dreaming of a championship , but their motivation goes beyond x s and o s the players indeed , the entire organization have rallied around lewis to a man , his teammates view him as someone who made serious mistakes in judgment with his choice of friends and his lying to the police , but nevertheless was someone overcharged by a zealous prosecutor no one in football was more loyal to lewis than the ravens' owner , art modell when lewis needed money to pay for an estimated 15 million in legal fees , modell advanced a portion of lewis s salary most of all , modell defended lewis , both to the nfl and to the public part of modell s motive was keeping a great talent from going to prison , but an equally large reason was modell s belief in being loyal to his players modell says he also felt strongly that lewis was not guilty of murder i was criticized by people in the league office for leading with my chin , modell said i told the league , 'if i am going to lead , it should be with my chin' people in the league said , 'well what if he s guilty \? ' i told them , 'he s not capable of killing anybody' it does not take long when watching a ravens practice to hear a sudden sound that is a cross between colliding cars and a bolt of thunder the noise is lewis crashing into a running back or an offensive lineman no player in the sport hits harder and none is more motivated when i think about where i could have ended up , where i might be right now , lewis said , that makes football all the more important photos ray lewis \( 52 \) with shannon sharpe , who during lewis s murder trial worked out with his friend and ravens teammate every day in atlanta \( doug kapustin the baltimore sun \) \( pg d2 \) ray lewis , who has received support from the ravens , plans to ignore any harsh remarks by fans \( associated press \) \( pg d1 \)
arming america the origins of a national gun culture by michael a bellesiles 603 pp new york alfred a knopf 30 for many americans , the gun is a holy object , the emblem and guarantor of their identity without it , they would not be the selfsufficient persons they consider themselves , the very models for all lovers of freedom to take away this external prop would tear out of them their very essence this private conviction is verified , in their eyes , by a public fact that american history , separateness and virtue have always been associated with the gun , if \( in fact \) they did not take their very essence from it imagine , then , the shock if this star of the show should turn out to be missing through much of our history it seems impossible and that was the reaction of michael a bellesiles , a colonial historian at emory university , when while searching through over a thousand probate records from the frontier sections of new england and pennsylvania for 1763 to 1790 he found that only 14 percent of the men owned guns , and over half of those guns were unusable what happened to the gun we know was over every mantel , the omnipresent hunting weapon , the symbol of the frontier \? bellesiles looked elsewhere , examined many different kinds of evidence , trying to find where the famous guns were hiding arming america the origins of a national gun culture tells us what he learned that individually owned guns were not really in hiding they were barely in existence before the civil war , the cutoff point for this study , the average american had little reason to go to the expense and trouble of acquiring , mastering and maintaining a tool of such doubtful utility as a gun in the colonial period , the gun meant the musket , an imported item that cost the equivalent of two months pay for a skilled artisan without constant attention its iron rusted , and blacksmiths were ill equipped to repair it \( they shoed horses and made plows \) the musket was not efficient for selfdefense or hunting it was not accurate beyond a few hundred feet \( it had no sight , and soldiers were instructed not to aim , since volleys relied on mass impact \) it frequently misfired and was cumbersome to reload , awkward qualities for individual selfdefense by the time you had put ball and powder back in , your foe would be upon you with knife , club or ax most murders were committed with knives , and contrary to the myth of primitive violence there were few murders outside indian warfare \( in north carolina , on the average , there was only one murder every two years between 1663 and 1740 \) the same factors that made the musket ineffective for selfdefense made it practically useless for hunting scare the rabbit with one inaccurate shot \( which threw out dense smoke \) , and all game would be gone by the time you got out ball and powder and deployed them properly besides , most americans were farmers , with no time to maintain expensive guns for hunting when domestic animals \( chickens and pigs \) were the easily available sources of protein that is why no american factories were created to make guns if most individuals did not own guns , where were the weapons for the militia \? the state was supposed to supply them , but rarely did in 1754 , there were only enough guns to arm a sixth of the eligible militiamen in 1758 connnecticut owned 200 firearms and received 1 , 600 from the crown , which made 1 , 800 guns for 5 , 000 militia , bellesiles writes the government set about buying and impressing every gun it could find , offering additional bounties to any volunteer who would bring his own gun surprisingly few people were in a position to take advantage of this offer of quick cash in one company of 85 men , only seven showed up with their own guns the record indicates that this figure of 8 percent was fairly typical throughout the colonies this chronic shortage led to widespread confiscation and regulation of the rare firearms colonies had to take a gun census to know what was available owners were commanded to take care of their weapons weapons were confiscated for militia use if the owners could not use them bellesiles sums up no gun ever belonged unqualifiedly to an individual it could not be seized in a debt case , could not be sold if that sale left a militia member without a firearm , had to be listed in every probate inventory and returned to the state if stateowned , and could be seized whenever needed by the state for alternative purposes guns might be privately owned , but they were statecontrolled there was a gun culture in 17thcentury america , but not among europeans native americans anticipated the modern cult of the gun by treating it as a magic instrument , despite the fact that they had perfected their own technology they could fire arrows rapidly and accurately , and bows were easily maintained , repaired or replaced all qualities lacking in the gun of the time benjamin franklin , that shrewd judge of the practical , wanted europeans to acquire facility with the bow , as the better weapon spain s colonial authorities deliberately addicted indians to the gun since , as bernardo de glvez said , native americans would then lose their skill in handling the bow and would be dependent on europeans for ball and powder the south carolina government adopted the same policy , reasoning that we shall be able to ruin them by cutting off the supply of ammunition
if jacob goldman has it right , the next great real estate rush in manhattan will be to cooperative village , a mostly jewish neighborhood just south of the williamsburg bridge that gained some fame as the home of the bubbe in the movie crossing delancey as if to prove it , mr goldman , a lawyer who recently obtained his real estate broker s license , has hung a 975 , 000 price tag on one apartment there , although he has hopes the final sale price will be even higher last week , he showed a reporter his prized listing a threebedroom , twobath apartment with plenty of closets \( eleven ! he says , running from room to room \) , ample internet and cable connections and the largest kitchen counter the seller could find our apartment , at a minimum , is worth a million , he said while some people in the neighborhood say that mr goldman is asking twice what the apartment is likely to sell for , the profit potential for the seller would still be impressive the same apartment actually two apartments combined into what mr goldman s web site calls a luxurious ranchstyle home would have cost about 190 , 000 just over a month ago the free market has come to cooperative village , which was built by unions in the 1930 s and 40 s to create housing their members could afford until june 12 , the prices for the 4 , 500 apartments in cooperative village s 11 buildings were still amazingly low , capped at several thousand dollars per room when owners left , they were required to sell the apartments back to the coop at the same price at which they were bought , minus a flip fee word of vacancies spread faster than gossip , so there was little need for a real estate broker but after the original financing structure governing the apartments was phased out , coop owners voted to cast off the price caps and charge market prices real estate brokers both the homegrown variety like mr goldman and established , highend firms are now showing prospective buyers homes to die for you ever see bees around honey \? said heshey jacob , general manager of cooperative village , when asked if many brokers had been active in the neighborhood recently they 're doing cold calling , selling , attacking my office they want to get exclusive rights douglas elliman , halstead , corcoran , plus local people we 're talking about the best names they all want to be working down here with the people who want to sell mr goldman , 29 , is the head of loho realty and has bumper stickers , buttons , postcards and fliers proclaiming as much he has sent fliers to each apartment in the 11 buildings , asking people to call him if they want to buy or sell in the neighborhood , where he has lived for five years nine out of 10 apartments have my magnets on the fridge , he said i'm mr loho , he added , relishing the term he said he and a friend came up with a few years ago , a contraction of lower than houston it s not the lower east side or grand street , it s loho we are loho we are going to be like any other neighborhood in the city in the last several months , the neighborhood has drawn attention for attracting an influx of young , orthodox jewish couples , who like the nearby synagogues , kosher food stores , yeshivas , and sabbath elevators that automatically stop at each floor on saturdays , bypassing the prohibition against using mechanical devices on the sabbath now , the cooperatives are expected to attract a wider variety of people in search of the latest real estate bargain in manhattan and not all of the asking prices are astronomic mr goldman is showing a onebedroom with an eatin kitchen for 225 , 000 , with maintenance fees of only 400 a month , including gas and water the mortgage for that would come out to 1 , 400 a month , he said for 1 , 800 a month people are paying more rent than that in a studio mr jacob said he believes that several people who have moved to florida without selling their coops are likely to sell now cooperative village also owns some of the apartments , which it could now sell theoretically you could see 150 to 200 in the first year , he said , estimating the number of apartments that could be offered for sale , and the prices would stabilize he is not convinced that an apartment here could sell for 1 million , and he predicted that the fanciest one mr goldman shows would bring in 400 , 000 to 500 , 000 the market is feeling for itself , mr jacob said it s searching for a ceiling , a floor most brokers and owners arrived at the current asking prices , mr goldman said , by subtracting 33 percent off the prices in nearby neighborhoods you find a similar apartment in the east village , and take onethird off the price , he said you 're getting a onethird better deal and while he and others speak about the nearby tennis courts , the safety of the neighborhood and the fabulous deals at the hillman , seward park and east river complexes that make up cooperative village , they acknowledge that the area is not quite ready for prime time
tokyo , sept 11 for anyone who has read his new biography of the japanese emperor hirohito , herbert p bix , cuts an almost jarringly unassuming figure it is not unheard of for historians to praise the work of others or to insist that they deserve only a modest portion of the credit for casting light on their chosen periods but over lunch here the other day , mr bix went a step further , insisting that he did not want anyone to think that with hirohito and the making of modern japan \( harpercollins \) he had uncovered any deep , dark secrets about a leader who always lived scrupulously shrouded behind a heavy veil throughout his 62 years on the throne as the author eagerly acknowledges , much of the information in his book was uncovered and carefully researched by japanese colleagues , only to be almost completely ignored by the public as the country s newspapers and major publishers shrank from taking on such a project the triumph of mr bix , 61 , is that of a tailor able to assemble disparate scraps of material and sew them into a seamless whole relying heavily on the diaries and letters of the emperor s advisers and contemporaries , he has produced a picture of a militarily aggressive leader who was minutely informed , often literally down to the minute , about japan s war efforts authorities on japan in the united states have rushed to declare that the new biography definitively changes the widely accepted view of hirohito , who died in 1989 , as a virtual hostage of a clique of militarists during the war in the pacific and a peaceloving , avuncular symbol of the nation afterward with the search for a japanese publisher still under way , the more interesting question for this harvard historian who has devoted his life to japanese studies and currently teaches at the elite hitotsubashi university here is whether the japanese will finally begin to reappraise the emperor now that mr bix s book has so thoroughly decked him out in new clothes given japan s willingness to avert its eyes from the most troubling chapters of its history and to resist critical selfevaluation and discussion of the country s atrocities in china and korea and the militarism that led to the pacific war , mr bix says he considers it unlikely when you face restrictions like i was given , i'm skeptical , he said , citing among other experiences the refusal of a major newspaper publisher here to allow him to view a 67yearold warpropaganda film featuring hirohito the right wing is constantly recycling myths about the lost war , and the mindset here has n't changed much before it does , there will have to be laws that will protect companies that publish or broadcast critical things on this subject publishing houses have been attacked in the past for producing works critical of the emperor rightwing sound trucks , which blare highdecibel denunciations to enforce a kind of nationalist political correctness , are still common here but in his distinct boston accent , which pervades his fluent japanese , mr bix said almost plaintively that he did not want to see his book used by people to browbeat japan over its past i do n't want the japanese people to wallow in this , he said i want them to put it behind them i do n't have an ax to grind i want something positive to come out of it that would start with an excavation of the facts mr bix s description of the origins of his fascination with japan sounds almost like a fateful epiphany i read a book about the place when i was in high school , about the imperial way , he said it got me interested in japan , and after i finished my studies in officer candidate school i was stationed there after a stint in the country as a navy officer , he went to harvard university , where he earned his doctorate in japanese history , studying there at the same time as john dower , the author of embracing defeat japan in the wake of world war ii \( w w norton \) , a pulitzer prizewinning account of japan s postwar transformation mr bix s book had been in gestation for many years , during which he said the two men sometimes shared materials strangely , though , what would become a defining book about the emperor started out as a much broader project , a portrait of japan s elites as they struggled to come to terms with modernization i was n't even interested in hirohito when this began , mr bix said but little by little his story grew on me he became the center i was n't even preoccupied with the question of war guilt i was trying to tell the story of japan s 20thcentury trajectory , but what i found was like looking through a kaleidoscope you turn things and make a teeny little change suddenly the key person , the man who has been removed from the picture , is at the center where he belongs in the end hirohito cannot escape responsibility for the war , mr bix said , because he was the only free man in all of japan free in a double sense he was never until the very end lacking in options , he said and he was free in the sense that there was no person above him to whom his will was subject , except his ancestors
beijing , march 6 in one of the most forceful statements yet on taiwan , the chinese military said today that it would spare no effort in a bloodsoaked battle to protect china s territorial integrity and that china would not be tricked into negotiations with taiwan leaders who secretly opposed rejoining the motherland while it did not mention by name any candidates in taiwan s presidential election on march 18 , the warning , in an editorial of the liberation army daily , seemed to be aimed at chen shuibian , the candidate of the opposition democratic progressive party for years mr chen and his party campaigned for taiwan s formal independence from china , which considers the island an integral part of the nation that was separated by civil war mr chen has recently moderated that position , saying a formal declaration would not be necessary because taiwan already enjoys de facto independence he promises that if elected , he will seek deeper economic ties and peace talks with the mainland but in language clearly intended to describe mr chen , the editorial said taiwan leaders who consistently pushed for independence had used sweetsounding rhetoric to bluff that they want to have 'benevolent harmony , positive cooperation and lasting peace' with the mainland all to swindle the taiwan populace we must on no account be dazzled by the pretty phrases , the editorial said the editorial from the military s official mouthpiece was reprinted in people s daily and other newspapers , indicating that the views had been approved at the highest levels of the communist party and the government also signaled its resolution when the finance minister , xiang huaicheng , announced a 127 percent rise in military spending for this year while mr chen appeared to be the subject of the editorial , neither of taiwan s other leading candidates has unambiguously accepted what china calls an unshakable precondition for talks that taiwan is legally part of a beijingcentered one china some creative compromises in language will be needed if the hopes in taipei and beijing for renewed dialogue later this year , with a new president of taiwan , are to be realized the military editorial was part of an orchestrated barrage of warnings from senior leaders here as taiwan s election approaches , the american congress debates a proposal for closer military ties with the island and the clinton administration weighs taiwan s request for advanced weapons it will be many years before china has the military capacity to mount a blockade of taiwan , let alone invade it , foreign analysts say but the chinese leaders have clearly decided that they must put pressure on the island now to halt a slide toward independence in a policy statement on feb 21 that created new worries in taipei and washington , china said more clearly than before that taiwan s indefinite footdragging in negotiations could set off an attack , a threat previously made against an outright declaration of independence but the report stressed china s desire for a peaceful settlement and its willingness to grant taiwan extraordinary autonomy that report gave no deadline for talks , and none of the subsequent statements indicate changes in the carrotandstick policy it outlined but the recent pronouncements have stressed china s desire to secure the return of taiwan at an early date on sunday ,

carnegie hall has been swept by a wave of resignations and dismissals as its new executive director prepares to present a strategy that will bring significant change to this 109yearold landmark institution in an unusual atmosphere of apprehension and resentment , five of the hall s top executives have resigned or been dismissed in the past six weeks , two yesterday none of those who left would comment on the reasons , but a growing resentment directed at the management style of the executive director , franz xaver ohnesorg , has manifested itself in widespread grumbling among employees , anonymous letters to the news media and ugly graffiti scratched on the inner door of mr ohnesorg s concert box the anxiety ran so high that staff members were informed yesterday that the hall s board had hired an outside consultant to speak with them privately about their concerns and to report back to the trustees the announcement of this hiring came at an extraordinary private meeting with 30 hall employees called by isaac stern , the revered violinist who spearheaded the campaign to save carnegie hall from the wrecker s ball 40 years ago and who has since served as its president mr stern , still recovering from heart surgery , traveled from his home in connecticut to meet with the employees , many of whom he has known for years mr stern helped recruit mr ohnesorg from the cologne philharmonie , in germany , last year and described him in an interview as the most gifted man in the world for this kind of work during the halfhour meeting , two employees said , mr stern pledged his firm support for mr ohnesorg , who was not there , and said , you ca n't change change they reported that he was aware of the rumors and gossip he asked for a show of hands of those who believed that morale was deteriorating almost half of those present raised their hands , said the employees , who requested anonymity , citing fear for their jobs in a recent interview mr ohnesorg said that change had to come to carnegie hall to broaden its audience and keep it up to date it is our idea to provide the very best music under the very bestrun conditions for a wellinformed audience and to celebrate existing music and the new , he said that means that we will go through a process of change change itself is certainly an art asked about employee complaints that he was unusually demanding and autocratic , mr ohnesorg said he had tried to analyze the hall s operations carefully and to make changes with dignity i give them more than 100 percent , and for some it sure might be too demanding , mr ohnesorg said of the employees , adding , i am here to make some change mr ohnesorg is poised to present a fiveyear plan to the trustees he described it broadly , and it includes proposals to revamp the way performers are booked , to open the hall to more contemporary music and to eliminate part of one of carnegie hall s most fabled elements the network of studios where artists , who in the past included marlon brando , leonard bernstein and isadora duncan , have lived and worked for more than a century mr ohnesorg s efforts come as a 50million project to convert a basement movie theater into a concert hall is running at least 20 million over budget , by his estimate although his plan is still a few months from presentation to the carnegie hall board , the most striking sign that a shift is under way is that the hall has declined to renew the leases of some longtime tenants of the studios , putting them on a monthtomonth status yesterday bob fumo , the hall s longtime director of real estate operations , who ran the studio system and was popular with the tenants , was dismissed the studio enclave , which is in two towers of 12 and 15 floors at the north and south ends of the hall s renaissancestyle building , is sometimes labeled upper bohemia for its unconventional citizenry al jolson took his voice lessons there isadora duncan rehearsed dances in studio 61 leonard bernstein lived in studio 803 while he was an assistant conductor at the new york philharmonic jeanne beauvais , a cabaret singer who directs young performers in the finer points of stage comportment from an apartment cluttered with the flotsam of a 55year career , recalled hiding away marlon brando , the bongoplaying star of a streetcar named desire , as fans stalked him to his studio on the eighth floor mr ohnesorg said he planned to clear out some studios to make room for administrative offices and a growing educational wing he said he also wanted to reduce outside bookings in order to assume more control of programming , to expand online marketing and to cash in on the name of carnegie hall , through credit card tieins or carnegie hall books , for example finally , he also plans to widen contemporary offerings with rap , world music and cuttingedge acts with the downtown feel of locations like the knitting factory we are not only a building , said mr ohnesorg , 52 , who added that he was n't interested in renting out the hall like a mere garage

roosevelt all but lost in the adult wrangling over the roosevelt children s academy , the island s first charter school , are its 147 students , who arrive for class each day in crisp blueandwhite uniforms a second grader , 8yearold donnamarie cooper , her hair decorated with blueandwhite bubble barrettes , said i love doing math and reading , and after we get to read dr seuss stories like 'fox in socks' but i especially like my 'nine times' tables another second grader , simon strong , 7 , said that he was working hard on his multiplication tables , too i do all the math in school by myself , he said , but when i get home , i can use a calculator on wednesday , the first of the academy s students left their temporary makeshift classrooms in the gym of the police athletic league in roosevelt and moved into their new quarters on pleasant avenue outwardly , appearances are all school as usual , at least as far as the students are concerned but behind the scenes , legal and financial conflicts between the academy and the roosevelt union school free district are becoming increasingly contentious the latest round in the fight involves money erik heyer , the vice president for business development at victory schools inc , the company that runs the charter school , said that the district had failed to pay some 600 , 000 that it owes the academy right now , we 're exploring ways to get the money , mr heyer said he added that the state education department has the authority to direct the state comptroller to withhold aid from the district until it pays up under state law , the first 200 , 000 was due july 1 , the second 200 , 000 on sept 1 and the third on nov 1 victory schools is covering the shortfall , mr heyer said critics of the roosevelt charter school contend that it will drain money and talent from other schools in the district but its advocates maintain that the charter school will actually save the district money , that it will provide a superior education and because it is competing with other roosevelt public schools , that it will provide an incentive for improving them the conflict started in earnest last may 24 when the school district requested an injunction to keep the charter school from opening judge joseph sise of state supreme court in albany denied the injunction on sept 15 , but the district appealed in may , the district also filed a lawsuit contending that the state law on charter schools was unconstitutional and that the charter schools institute of the state university of new york acted capriciously in granting the charter for the academy , which is offering kindergarten through secondgrade classes its first year charter schools are financed by the school districts the students leave for each student enrolled in a charter school , the district passes along a percentage of its perpupil costs , determined by a formula set by the state state law says children within a 15mile radius can attend a charter school , so the roosevelt academy draws students from baldwin , brentwood , freeport , hempstead , malverne , new york city and uniondale in the latest dispute over payments , dr darlene m mengel , the supervisor of the charter school unit of the state education department , said that the roosevelt school system owed the charter school the largest amount , 622 , 986 these are the amounts other localities owe , she said baldwin , 4 , 814 freeport , 8 , 573 hempstead , 16 , 878 new york city , 6 , 630 and uniondale , 5 , 408 horace williams , the superintendent of the roosevelt school district , said any funds that are due we will pay , by state law , but we have to verify enrollment in a cashstrapped district like ours that s losing more than a million dollars to the charter school , teachers will have to be laid off and the kids in the district will ultimately be the victims mr heyer said that enrollment figures went to the state education department on aug 18 and again on sept 25 , with copies sent to the roosevelt district the escalating tensions between the charter school and the roosevelt district underline the philosophical divide between advocates for traditional public education and those who seek to improve it charter schools are nonsectarian public schools created by parents , teachers , nonprofit organizations or forprofit companies with the goal of improving education in public schools particularly in lowerincome neighborhoods through competition for students and tax dollars to enroll a child in a charter school , parents submit applications , and students are accepted on a firstcome , firstserved basis , with priority given to students from the home district roosevelt is a onesquaremile school district with an enrollment that is largely black and latino in the midst of a more affluent suburbia in statewide achievement tests for fourth and eighth graders last year , the scores in roosevelt s schools were among the lowest in nassau county and in the state for example , 81 percent of the fourth graders failed to meet state standards , and none exceeded the standards in math and reading
they were parents and grandparents who thought they had fully grasped the perils facing their teenagers in the tough workingclass streets north of kennedy airport in queens they said that they understood the power of peers , the lure of gangs and drugs , the impact of movies and music and television that with relentless repetition depicted a culture of casual violence and , they said , they believed they had taken the necessary precautions they gave their children beepers and cellular phones to keep better track of them they lined up mentors , and set curfews , and encouraged faith when there were small signs of trouble skipped classes , foul language , low grades they cracked down with more rules they had hearttoheart talks about being leaders , not followers , about making distinctions between friends and manipulators , and of course they prayed , as parents everywhere do , that all their efforts , however imperfect , had somehow inoculated their babies from trouble but on tuesday , when the detectives began knocking at their doors with questions about murder and robbery , many of these adults said that they began for the first time to recognize with terrifying clarity the limits of their control over their children five teenagers ages 14 to 17 each from relatively stable middleclass homes , and none with a criminal record are accused of luring jinsheng liu , the owner of the golden wok restaurant , to a secluded , vacant house in springfield gardens , queens , and then , during a bungled ambush to steal their 60 order of chinese food , beating him to death with a brick according to prosecutors , the teenagers have confessed to varying degrees of involvement , and so now between waves of tears and anger and disbelief , between frantic calls to lawyers and fending off reporters five stunned families find themselves confronting a nightmarish tangle of questions where did they fail \? what did they miss \? what more could they have done \? it just rips you apart , said jean smith , the mother of james stone , the 16yearold who police officials said threw a sheet over mr liu s head moments before his skull was shattered by repeated blows it makes you think maybe you failed but i tell you , i tried so hard i tried my hardest my whole family did the contours of this parental anguish became clear this week during extended interviews with relatives of three of the teenagers and with neighbors , close friends or lawyers for the other two deepening their anguish is an unfathomable reality an immigrant who struggled resolutely to build a restaurant business is dead , leaving behind a wife and two children i feel so terrible for what happened , said the mother of robert savage , 14 , who the police say was the one who hit mr liu with the brick can you imagine what they are going through \? they lost their father for what \? stupid food i cannot believe i raised that child he knows better than that she added i ca n't eat , i ca n't sleep i really had no idea my life could get into something like this on the night of sept 1 , only hours before mr liu s death , all five teenagers seemed fully occupied with the usual rhythms of teenage life early in the evening , jamel murphy , 17 , was flirting with girls at one of his favorite hangouts the fosterlaurie police athletic league building in st albans , queens a tall , stocky boy who was obsessed with the notion of playing professional basketball , mr murphy had spent most every day of the summer at the building , coaching a basketball team of 9 and 10yearold boys his supervisors gave him high marks but that night , children were performing dance routines to the music of whitney houston , and mr murphy watched some of the performances with his close friend , ebony cheston , 16 he and ms cheston had talked often recently of their futures , of getting out of queens ms cheston said they had both become wary of street violence mr murphy had vowed to avoid confrontation i 'll walk away , he told her mr murphy left about 7 30 pm , saying he was going to see his friend darryl tyson , 17 , another student at hillcrest high school in queens mr tyson lived in springfield gardens , in a neighborhood of twisting deadend streets and singlefamily homes just off merrick boulevard by that time , stacy royster , 17 , had caught a bus to mr tyson s home from her grandmother s house in rosedale on the eastern edge of queens she knew mr tyson from high school , and they remained close friends even after ms royster left school and finished her studies at home ms royster was about to begin her first semester at queensborough community college she had just bought her first batch of textbooks , said her grandmother , anastasia brown , who has raised ms royster since the death of her mother nine years ago ms brown worried about her granddaughter she was fragile , prone to acting out , vulnerable , she said for several years the girl had struggled with bipolar disorder , but doctors assured ms brown that ms royster would be fine if she took her medication around 8 pm , ms brown decided to beep her ms royster promptly called her back from the cell phone her grandmother had given her for just that purpose stacy , do n't get home too late , ms brown said
port washington , ny , april 28 forget hillary and rudy never mind george w and al gore for political insiders from here to albany , the race to watch right now is a special election for a seat on the nassau county legislature although only about 41 , 000 people are eligible to vote in it , the special election that will be held on long island on tuesday will determine the future of nassau county politics and could have ramifications for those other , betterknown races that are coming down the road in november the nassau race is occasioned by the death in march of barbara johnson , a democrat who represented port washington and neighboring communities on the north shore the loss cost the democrats their first majority in the legislative branch in 80 years and left it evenly divided between nine democrats and nine republicans , at a time when the county government is grappling with a fiscal crisis the party that wins the election wins the decisive vote as darren bloch , the chief of staff for democrats in the legislature , put it , it is a jump ball for the legislature the election offers nassau s republican party a rare second chance to regain some of the ground it lost in november , when it not only lost control of the legislature but also suffered major upsets on town and local levels as voters rebelled over the financial troubles that have bedeviled the county under recent republican stewardship the question now is whether nassau county s republican machine , long a force to reckon with on the state and national levels and virtually omnipotent in local affairs , is broken down or just temporarily out of service since the suburbs are expected to play a pivotal role in the race for the united states senate , it is no idle question but winning has its risks as well the party that gets control of the legislature will almost surely have to enact a series of unpopular measures , from layoffs and service cuts to fee and tax increases , to help put the debtridden county back in the black does anybody really want to win this \? remarked howard a scarrow , a professor of political science at the state university at stony brook the candidates all profess that they do the democrats chose ms johnson s son , craig johnson , a 29yearold bankruptcy lawyer , to run for the seat the republicans picked linda green , 52 , an assistant principal and former north hemsptead town clerk who was voted out of office during the antirepublican backlash in november then there is the noneoftheabove option benjamin l zwirn , 48 , a former north hempstead town supervisor who has built a reputation as a maverick by winning elections but making many enemies in both parties along the way , is running on the green party line the district is considered up for grabs on paper , republicans might have a slight edge there are 16 , 000 registered republicans and 15 , 000 registered democrats but there are also 10 , 000 unaffiliated registered voters and democrats have had many successes here during the last decade ms johnson , a democrat , won twothirds of the vote in her last campaign so far , the campaign has focused on three r s republicans , reassessment and residency mr johnson is largely running against the republican party one of his campaign mailings attacks the republican county executive , thomas s gulotta you know the old adage about the fox guarding the hen house \? asks the brochure , which shows a fox looking at several newly hatched chicks that s what it would be like if tom gulotta s republican machine regained the majority in the county legislature ms green has tried to counter by stressing her independence from the party ladies and gentlemen , it is true i am a republican , she said at a debate two weeks ago and before i was a republican , i was linda green and i still am ms green has tried to run on an antireassessment platform in march , nassau agreed to overhaul its property tax system and reassess every property in the county the problem with the current system , critics say , is that people in poorer communities pay more than their fair share of taxes and the cashstarved county is forced to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to people who win challenges of their taxes but a countywide reassessment would probably raise the assessments on homes in wealthy areas like those in the district ms green has seized on the issue with campaign fliers that say , linda green will fight the democrats' tax reassessment scheme democrats respond that she is fearmongering , and note that the countywide reassessment has already been approved and that it is not a product of the democrats alone , since it was supported by charles o shea , the republican county assessor , mr gulotta , and five out of nine republican legislators mr zwirn is campaigning as an outsider there s not a dime s worth of difference between the parties , he said , but officials in both parties say he spoke with them about running on their ballot lines before going on the greens' line although mr zwirn is running on a pledge not to raise taxes and to place a limit on the amount of increases caused by reassessment , he has attracted the most notice for his accusations that mr johnson is not really a resident of the district he faxed reporters copies of a 1999 alumni directory in which mr johnson is listed at a manhattan address , and a listing for mr johnson from the manhattan phone book mr johnson responded that while he has an apartment in manhattan , his official residence is a house in port washington he said that he has always voted in port washington and that his driver s license lists port washington as his home address after two of mr zwirn s supporters tried to have mr johnson removed from the ballot this week , a state supreme court justice sided with mr johnson and ruled that he was a legal resident of port washington and could run in the race but the charge may be sticking as he campaigned in east hills , amid the condolences for his mother s death and promises of votes on tuesday , he also got this question from one man he stopped on the street are you the johnson that lives in manhattan \? although mr johnson is favored slightly in the race , political analysts say the outcome is anyone s guess joseph n mondello , the chairman of the nassau county republican party , made no secret of how difficult he expected the race to be when he announced the selection of ms green this is an uphill battle for us , no question , he said at the time , and since then he has flooded the district with volunteers distributing leaflets for her the democrats were planning to spend about 60 , 000 on the race , nearly three times as much as the republicans said they would spend mr zwirn said he expected to spend 10 , 000 to 12 , 000 this will be a referendum on whether the troubles of the republican machine have abated , said dr herbert d rosenbaum , an emeritus professor of political science at hofstra university i would argue that the outcome hinges on the famous turnout question , which in local , offseason elections tends to be low in this race , the wellorganized campaign has a tremendous edge photos craig johnson , above , the democrat seeking his late mother s seat in the nassau county legislature , campaigned last week in east hills his republican opponent , linda green , below , campaigned in greenvale \( photographs by scott brinton for the new york times \) \( pg b5 \)
the jets moved forward on two coaching fronts yesterday the one who is coming and the one who quit al groh , the linebackers coach , is expected to be named the new head coach on monday , succeeding bill belichick , who lasted one day as bill parcells s successor several members of the jets' organization said that the 55yearold groh , who was parcells s first choice , had been endorsed by the new owner , robert wood johnson iv parcells , who never wavered from his desire to retire from the sidelines at age 58 , will remain as head of the club s football operations it is believed that johnson offered parcells 4 million to return next season groh s only previous headcoaching experience came at wake forest from 19811986 the jets said they would have an announcement on their coaching situation on monday the news of groh s elevation came after national football league commissioner paul tagliabue ruled yesterday that belichick had breached his contract for the year 2000 and could not coach another club without the consent of the jets tagliabue s decision could be a prelude to another jetspatriots compensation battle the decision was not a complete victory for the jets , who contended belichick was bound to them for the three years remaining on his contract tagliabue asked both sides to reply by feb 1 to justify their positions a patriots spokesman said yesterday the club would not comment on tagliabue s ruling the patriots have interviewed four potential head coaches , but none of them were offered the dual role of general manager , as belichick was thus , it seems certain that the patriots will formally ask for belichick , who will come with a price to be paid to the jets groh has had a successful career with parcells he was the linebackers' coach for the giants during the 198990 seasons , which included a super bowl victory he was the giants' defensive coordinator in 1991 under ray handley in 1992 he joined belichick at cleveland , where belichick was the head coach , and then was reunited with parcells in what to be a fouryear run as linebackers coach and coordinator at new england when parcells took over the jets in 1997 , groh came with him he helped mold the linebackers into the club s most respected unit belichick was coach for a day , jan 3 , after parcells stepped down , buthe resigned suddenly parcells vowed to straighten out the mess , saying that it happened on my watch he believed that by elevating groh , the coaching staff and players would find stability that is likely to mean that romeo crennel will be elevated to defensive coordinator \( the browns were planning to interview him for that role \) it also could mean that dan henning , the quarterbacks coach who helped to restore vinny testaverde s career in 1998 , and to give ray lucas one in 1999 , will stay the day belichick was formally named to succeed parcells , the patriots faxed the jets and asked to interview belichick as their coach and general manager the jets replied that they had a contract with him even though the patriots have not made another formal request to speak to belichick , tagliabue reportedly spoke to at least one patriots official then , in a separate phone call , he spoke to a jets official , presumably johnson or the team s president , steve gutman tagliabue was said to be frustrated that he could not get the sides together to agree to a deal in almost every case where a coach has been found to be under contract to his existing team , another team that wants him parts with draft choices but that scenario is complicated with these two clubs only three years ago , the jets parted with four draft picks including a firstrounder over a threeyear period to get parcells , who had a year left on his contract with new england we think the commissioner s decision is unlawful and we are actively assessing all of our legal options , said one of belichick s attorneys , neil cornrich of cleveland , upon learning of the decision another belichick lawyer , jeffrey kessler , added , i think it was a legal travesty i do n't think you could put coach belichick in a position to prevent him from pursuing his livelihood for next year we 're very disappointed the commissioner does n't have the power to do it we 're going to consider everything the jets would not comment on the decision , other than this by parcells the commissioner s ruling and order are clear and selfexplanatory if belichick had remained , the jets would have been led by one of the most respected defensive minds in pro football history his greatest success has been with parcells as defensive coordinator in five years as head coach of the cleveland browns , he made them competitive again and produced one winning season and a playoff appearance but he also served as coach in the browns' last season in cleveland as the team collapsed when word got out it would be moving to baltimore photos al groh , the linebackers coach , has been a longtime parcells

value of recordings sold in the united states in 1999 paul vidich , an executive vice president for time warner s warner music group who has been negotiating with mp3com s lawyers , said his company was not trying to shut down mp3com s music storage service , which is called mymp3com the purpose of the settlement discussion is to establish the legitimate basis on which the service can continue , he said i do n't think anyone in the recording industry is looking to stop new business models that take advantage of the uniqueness of the internet recording companies praised the decision as an affirmation of copyright protection a validation of the legal standing of a copyright is very good news for anybody who s directly involved with artists , said danny goldberg , chief executive of artemis records , an independent label that releases cd s and runs internet radio and music subscription services the ruling does not affect the widespread use of mp3 \( a compression technology that is not owned by mp3com \) to make copies of music available across the internet the popularity of mp3 has alarmed the recording business because it allows listeners to copy and distribute music from any compact disc still , according to the international federation of the phonographic industry , cd shipments in the united states rose by 10 percent in 1999 , even as mp3 use exploded and many companies offered fulllength songs as free samples it seems counterintuitive , but an increase in free downloads coincided with an increase in paid sales , mr goldberg said particularly among the young audience , the people who are most wired , the evidence is that it s bonding a new generation to music the ruling also does not address the issues in the suit the recording industry association has brought against napster , an online music service whose software allows listeners to freely swap songs in the mp3 format over the internet , since napster does not retain any copies of songs mymp3com is a small part of mp3com , most of which is devoted to offering free music from thousands of performers almost none of our revenues are attributable to mymp3com currently , mr robertson said mymp3com is an online storage system for music in the mp3 format , allowing listeners access to the music in their own cd collections over the internet other music storage services , like myplaycom , require listeners to convert songs from their cd s into mp3 files , a timeconsuming process mymp3com recognizes a compact disc in a listener s computer , and if the recording is in mp3com s database , it can be added instantly to an individual s online collection , which is protected by a password mp3com purchased 80 , 000 majorlabel cd s for its database in order , it argued , to provide consumers with easier access to music they had already bought the recording industry s suit successfully contended that mymp3com was using copyrighted recordings without paying licensing fees the mere existence of technology that allows for an easy subversion of copyright protection does n't make it correct , said al teller , chief executive of atomic pop , an independent label that sells cd s and mp3 downloads if you 're building a commercial enterprise by virtue of performing this service , then you have an obligation to get the rights from the owners of the copyright mr robertson said that the ruling would only affect those cd s released by the companies in the suit the mymp3com infrastructure will continue to be in place , he said there are tens of thousands of cd s in the system which labels and artists have requested we put into the system the service has 400 , 000 registered users jim griffin , chief executive of cherry lane digital , a consulting firm for digitally distributed arts companies , said the current case is part of a broader conflict music is the canary in the coal mine for all digital entertainment , he said this is a minor skirmish in the war between record companies and their socalled pirates the dotcom companies thrive on an image of constructive rebellion , he suggested , so the lawsuit could add to mp3com s prominence in a way , mp3com s biggest risk is of obscurity , he said any damages borne by mp3com must be weighed against the value of distinguishing the company as the prime mover for digital music and change photo michael robertson of mp3com is optimistic about a settlement \( associated press \)
few politicians have been able to resist exploiting public anger over 2agallon gasoline in the midwest but none have shed much light on the subject vice president al gore suspects that oil companies are gouging customers , and he would not mind if voters took revenge on gov george w bush , a former oil company executive mr bush accuses the administration of having sat back while opec tripled the price of crude oil he also cites mr gore s book on the environment to suggest that mr gore thinks gas prices are too low to begin with others have called for relaxing environmental standards but beyond the accusations lie rather mundane facts the industry has often been accused of price collusion , but investigations have never turned up evidence opec decisions explain why prices are up nationwide but not why they are skyhigh in the midwest whatever role environmental regulations have played in boosting gas prices , their impact is temporary and appears to be waning a study by the congressional research service provides rough estimates that supply cutbacks by opec have boosted gasoline prices nationwide by about 50 cents a gallon over the last 18 months gas prices in the midwest are about 50 cents higher than that approximately half of the gap can be traced to broken pipelines the other half could be due to a peculiar interplay among various environmental rules and ethanol , a fuel additive to meet provisions of the 1990 clean air act , refiners in certain midwest cities blend ethanol into gasoline to reduce carbon monoxide and toxic chemicals but ethanol also tends to make gasoline evaporate easily , and in so doing adds to urban smog in recognition of the smog problem , the environmental protection agency on june 1 imposed updated rules designed to reduce evaporation this meant the refiners had to figure out anew how to blend ethanol with gasoline in a way that alleviates one air pollution problem without aggravating another this task , in turn , has complicated production and may have at least temporarily contributed to the shortage even modest interruptions in gasoline supplies can drive prices upward , in part because refineries hold small inventories and thus have little gas on hand to absorb production drops but the interruptions , though troublesome , are temporary they do not justify suspending the june 1 environmental rules that are important to cleaning up the air and have been years in the making besides , they are unlikely to raise prices by more than about a nickel a gallon once the system has time to settle down in truth , many scientists now question the need to add ethanol or any other ingredient to gasoline to control carbon monoxide emissions but this is a matter for congress to decide , and should not be driven by shortterm supply imbalances in the midwest until the federal trade commission completes its current study of the situation , no one will know for sure why gas prices rose above 2 a gallon but it seems unlikely that the commission will find a single villain
profits and principles global capitalism and human rights in china by michael a santoro 241 pp ithaca , ny cornell university press 2995 who could have imagined that so wonkish a subject as trade with china would turn into the kind of overheated political issue that , like abortion and gun control , splits people into noisy warring camps \? lines have been drawn in the sand , with choices reduced to stark eitherors human rights or expanded commerce , worker protection or globalization but to anyone looking for reasoned discussion instead of rhetorical posturing , michael a santoro s profits and principles is a fine place to start santoro , who teaches at the rutgers graduate school of management , has been visiting china every year for nearly a decade he has spoken with hundreds of businessmen , workers , government officials and human rights advocates inside and outside china the stiffness of his prose will doubtless limit his readership , but his solidly grounded analysis deserves a wide audience santoro begins with a valuable distinction american companies doing business in china can be broadly divided into two types those seeking to expand their operations by establishing themselves in the increasingly lucrative chinese market , and those in a global marketplace wishing to reduce their production costs by taking advantage of the country s lowwage labor the first group makes a firm , longterm commitment to china motorola , for instance , has invested more than 15 billion in stateoftheart facilities santoro reports that the company s tianjin plant , which employs about 10 , 000 workers , is spacious , clean and well lit none of the workers appear to be in the least bit haggard or oppressed it is , he concludes , a place that a young graduate of purdue , north carolina state or cal tech would find congenial the businesses of the second group , on the other hand , are responsible for the sweatshop image that dominates american notions of chinese workplaces they tend to be in lowtech , laborintensive , cutthroat industries like apparel and toys , where the economic pressures are constantly downward in their race to the bottom , these companies \( or , more often , their local subcontractors \) provide the lowest possible wages in the grimmest possible conditions santoro s distinction immediately complicates the human rights question the first group , the market builders , are improving human rights in china , he points out , simply through their presence there they are changing their workers' values by teaching individual initiative outside the factory , they foster a business environment that adheres to rule by law perhaps most important , they are creating a meritocratic middle class with a power base independent of the communist party the market builders , santoro says , are doing good while doing well it is among the second group that the human rights problem is most acute after reviewing proposals for voluntary regulation , santoro urges the world trade organization to adopt an enforceable code of international labor standards his impulse is honorable , but one wishes he had been tougherminded santoro notes that third world governments consistently oppose international codes not because they are eager to exploit their own citizens but because they see the codes as a kind of hidden protectionism if wage , health and safety standards are set too high , these countries lose their comparative advantage as usual with such matters , the chinese present the most dramatic illustration of the issue it is estimated that china will have to create 18 million jobs each year for the foreseeable future simply to stay where it is in a malthusian world where millions of chinese are faced with the alternative of jobless desperation or employment under what the west considers sweatshop conditions , the sweatshops win every time attempting to define wage and safety levels that are not so high as to jeopardize job opportunities for people already living at the edge and to do so under a system of fluctuating exchange rates is a task to try the capacities of even the wisest of men , women and computers just how many solomons are there at the wto anyway \?
beausoleil , france little wonder that lucinda childs is fluent in french these days her choreography may be quintessentially american , a product of her early training with merce cunningham , her years at the judson dance theater and her long association with robert wilson , philip glass and john adams but when it comes to pursuing her career , this tall , striking new yorker leaves her soho loft and invariably heads for europe , usually france the explanation is simple enough european governments have always spent generously on the arts , with france showing particular interest in contemporary american dance and when choreographers like mr cunningham , trisha brown and ms childs were struggling to find backers in the united states in the early 1980 s , france stepped in to rescue them today , ms childs is revered across europe as a grande dame of american dance in the united states , though , her work is so rarely seen that she has assumed almost mythical status this week , the lucinda childs dance company is appearing in new york for only the second time in 11 years having spent the summer performing across europe , ms childs and her 12 dancers are presenting parcours at the brooklyn academy of music s harvey theater for four performances starting on wednesday the 75minute program , without intermission , comprises four united states premieres along with radial courses \( 1976 \) , performed in silence , and concerto \( 1993 \) , with music by henryk gorecki , which was seen at the joyce theater in 1994 during the company s previous new york season ms childs has included radial courses as an echo of her most minimalist new york period , when her choreography was stripped of all artifices not only music , but even recognizable dance movements and reduced almost to the act of walking on the other hand , she is also eager to show how her work with modern composers has led her choreography to ever more complex geometric patterns , marked as always by skips , jumps , turns and sudden changes of direction the new pieces in the brooklyn program are commencement \( 1995 \) , a fourminute solo by ms childs with music by the polish composer zygmunt krauze from the white edge of phrygia \( 1995 \) , a full company 23minute work with music by the american stephen montague sunrise of the planetary dream collector \( 1998 \) , set to music by the minimalist american composer terry riley and variete de variete \( 2000 \) , with music by mauricio kagel of argentina yet even this occasion illustrates the fragility of ms childs s dance company because of difficulty in raising money for just four performances at the academy , the troupe s 25th anniversary season is taking place 27 years after its first appearance , at the whitney museum of american art in new york further , the company has always been an onagain , offagain affair it never worked for more than 30 weeks a year it was disbanded in 1995 and reconstituted only in february of this year and on sunday , after its tour ends in new york , it will be dissolved again i do n't regret a minute of all this hard work of putting the company back together , ms childs said , but i do n't see myself jumping back into this situation immediately until i feel that things in the united states are moving along in a slightly better direction still , at 60 and in good health \( although she recently broke her right arm in a fall \) , ms childs remains much in demand in europe as a guest choreographer last month , while her company took a break after performing in eight european cities , she began creating a new work , the chairman dances , to music by mr adams , for les ballets de monte carlo after this 12 1 2minute piece has its premiere in december , accompanied by a reprise of concerto , ms childs will travel to munich to create a new work for the bayerisches staatsballet and start preparing choreography probably for gluck s orfeo et euridice at the scottish opera i have always loved to do other things , she said in an interview between rehearsals at the monte carlo ballet s headquarters in beausoleil , just across monaco s border with france i would never try to make a company work all year you ca n't do this week after week after week other things have come easily in europe over the past 20 years , she has created works for dance companies in paris , lyon , berlin , munich , monte carlo , charleroi \( belgium \) and even new york \( for the martha graham company in 1997 and 1999 \) having worked on the glasswilson opera einstein on the beach in 1976 and again on its 1984 and 1992 revivals , she also moved into mainstream opera since doing the choreography for the dance of the seven veils in luc bondy s production of salome in 1992 , she has worked on five other operas , including mozart s zaide , the first she has directed and most recently , she has spent two years as an actress , touring europe alongside michel piccoli in mr wilson s frenchlanguage production of marguerite duras s play la maladie de la mort
hong kong , oct 11 compared with the firestorm that engulfed the stock offering of petrochina last april , the impending sale of shares in china s secondlargest oil company , sinopec , has generated barely any smoke but as the chinese government prepares to set a price for the initial public offering here on thursday , sinopec has been jolted by an 11thhour disclosure that one of its subsidiaries has invested in sudan the subsidiary , zhongyuan petroleum , had a joint venture with china national petroleum , the parent of petrochina , to conduct surveys and drill oil wells in sudan the venture , reported in the asian wall street journal on wednesday , was transferred to china national petroleum in june it was another , far larger project in sudan backed by china national petroleum that led human rights and labor groups to organize a bitter campaign against petrochina s offering they said the company abetted a regime that a united nations report had accused of genocide the critics have left sinopec in peace , which may reflect the waning of china as a political hotbed now that the united states has granted beijing normal trade status also , based on its sales pitch , sinopec is a cleaner version of petrochina sinopec s prospectus makes no mention of sudan because the venture was immaterial and irrelevant , said an executive with ties to the company it was never part of the listed company it was a minuscule part of the parent company , and it is history , the executive said several portfolio managers agreed that sinopec s past link to sudan would have little effect on the global stock offering , which seeks to raise 35 billion the company s shares begin trading on the new york stock exchange next wednesday and in hong kong and london the next day but the disclosure underscores how even a comparatively open chinese stateowned company can be a pandora s box the problem with all chinese ipo s is that you 're buying a box , and you do n't quite know what s in it , said alan troner , president of asia pacific energy consulting , based in kuala lumpur , malaysia the aflcio said it was concerned by the sinopecsudan link but brandon rees , a researcher in the aflcio s investment office , said it would not campaign against every chinese offering we have n't done a counter roadshow against sinopec because we think we already made an impact with petrochina , mr rees said analysts said sinopec , china s largest refiner and distributor of petroleum , had fewer troubling entanglements than china national petroleum , which has operations in tibet in addition to sudan still , in beijing s pellmell restructuring of corporate china , most companies end up owning some unpalatable assets zhongyuan petroleum is one of 60 subsidiaries of the sinopec group , a sprawling state empire formed in 1983 sinopec inherited zhongyuan and the sudan venture as part of a complex swap of assets with china national petroleum in 1998 executives close to sinopec said it was well aware of the implications of ties to sudan they said it decided to dispose of the venture before entering the marketplace yet sinopec has not severed its ties completely zhongyuan still maintains an office dedicated to the sudan venture at its headquarters in henan province its purpose , one executive said , is to provide residual services after the transfer of its sudan employees to china national petroleum sinopec has issued no statements about sudan the company did not return a telephone call today in deciding whether to buy sinopec s stock , analysts and investors said they were more concerned about fluctuating oil prices and the vagaries of the stock market than the ethics of investing in sudan if it was n't a problem for petrochina , it s not going to be a problem for sinopec , said andrew look , a strategist at ubs warburg in hong kong henry lee , a money manager at hendale asia here , predicted that concerns about sudan would not derail the offering these companies have gotten very sophisticated at carving out safe territory for themselves , he said nevertheless , mr lee said he would pass on the shares in part because it is an extremely large offering at a time when the appetite for stock issues from china , and asia in general , seems lackluster petrochina , after scaling back its offering in the face of protests by the aflcio and rights groups , was able to raise 29 billion the shares have risen 40 percent since then , thanks to soaring oil prices and investor disenchantment with technology stocks but investing in oil companies may be as much a roller coaster ride as buying nasdaq stocks analysts say oil prices are likely to swing wildly through the winter , before declining later in 2001 sinopec estimates that the price of crude oil will decline from an average of 2670 a barrel this year to 2170 next year and 1940 in 2002 the company calculates that a 1 decline in the price would result in a relatively modest 4 percent decline in its operating earnings the integrated nature of our business gives us the ability to mitigate any negative impact from the expected decline in crude oil prices , said sinopec s chairman , li yizhong , in a news conference last sunday the appetite for sinopec s stock has been slack in the first three days of the offering , according to fund managers but the underwriters , morgan stanley dean witter and china international capital , have hedged their bets by parceling out much of the shares to strategic investors these include exxon mobil , royal dutch shell , and bp amoco , as well as the politically friendly hong kong tycoons , li kashing and lee shaukee none of the investors will get a seat on sinopec s board , however , raising the old question of who will represent the shareholders executives who know the company say investors should be comforted by its chairman , mr li he helped persuade beijing to relax state controls on the price of crude oil sinopec has always been a commercially minded organization , mr troner said its managers are outwardlooking photos the disclosure that sinopec , china s no 2 oil company , now preparing a public offering , had invested in sudan did not cause the same uproar faced by petrochina , the top concern , because of its larger project there \( associated press \) like other oil companies , sinopec faces a rocky ride because of oil price fluctuations still , sinopec s chairman , li yizhong , left , said it could withstand a price drop
lucky gold , who makes 30 or more business trips a year , says that being able to work out using a treadmill and free weights while on the road is crucial to his wellbeing so when mr gold s job as senior vice president for business development at the marvin group , an aerospace company in inglewood , calif , takes him to boston , as it does at least once a month , he does n't race out of logan international airport the minute he arrives instead , he stops for an hour or so at a health club on the airport grounds , at the hilton boston logan airport hotel sometimes he even catches an earlier flight than necessary , to allow time for exercise before his meetings in the city having this facility right at the airport is so handy , mr gold said working out helps me stay mentally fit and better prepared for any meeting i'm going to , or any presentation that i'm making and if i wind up getting delayed at the airport for any period of time , then the health club becomes even more important as the air travel system becomes ever more congested and prone to delays , airports are adding ground services to meet the needs of business travelers or to simply help them pass the extra time these include more stores and restaurants , but also creature comforts like gyms and health clubs some , like the one that mr gold frequents in boston , are in airport hotels others are in the terminal itself or in freestanding facilities on airport property nobody looks forward to a three or fourhour layover , but it is a major stress reliever for business travelers to do a little shopping or get a quick workout while they 're waiting at the airport , said randy petersen , publisher of inside flyer , a magazine for frequent travelers mr petersen himself expects to spend 200 days on the road this year for business airlines depend on business travelers who fly more often and pay much higher fares than tourists for 46 percent of their revenue , according to the national business travel association , which represents corporate travel managers airport authorities and airlines alike have an economic stake in making airports as appealing as possible to these road warriors of course , many harried business travelers , when faced with a long delay or layover , are not looking for any distractions , just a quiet spot to catch up on work or reading there are those times when i just want to return a few calls and look over some materials before a meeting while waiting at the airport , said ira birns , treasurer of arrow electronics , a components distributor in melville , ny , who travels about 25 times a year for his job but for those who do want a break from the laptop and the cell phone , a growing number of airports are helping to soothe frazzled nerves by offering onsite gyms , like the airport fitness center at pittsburgh international airport mark knight , regional director of baa usa , which operates shopping and other concessions at the airport , said the center included exercise equipment , showers and sauna , and had workout clothing available for sale or rent a single day s visit costs 999 a oneyear membership is 420 in march , mccarran international airport in las vegas added a branch of the 24hour fitness health club chain , the chain s first at an airport the club offers aerobics classes in addition to the usual exercise facilities , and employs a sports nutritionist who will pack healthy snacks for business travelers to take along on flights airport hotels are also trying to tap into the growing pool of the stranded , by marketing their facilities to airport passengers beyond their regular guests like its sister hotel in boston , the hilton chicago o'hare airport regularly distributes fliers at information booths throughout the airport encouraging business travelers to buy 10 daily passes to its health club , which includes a pool , whirlpool , exercise machines , sauna and showers , according to the club s manager , steven andos tanning beds and a personal trainer are also available about 100 of the 800 people who use the health club on a typical day are not hotel guests , mr andos said , and roughly 15 percent of the 500 regular members are travelers who pass through o'hare regularly without staying at the hotel the club at the boston hotel , which charges 9 to 15 for a day , gets about 20 percent of its traffic from nonguests some of these people do n't even mind that much being in the airport for a few hours between flights , since they know they can have a good workout , take a shower and leave feeling refreshed , mr andos said a chance to work up a sweat is not the only amenity that airports , big and small , are offering to betweenplanes travelers t f green airport in providence , ri , has just 22 gates in its terminal , but passengers can get a 15minute massage there for 15 last month , the airport added express manicure and pedicure service the massage service at nashville international airport proved a godsend for jerry daly , who owns daly gray , a public relations firm in herndon , va , and who threw out his back on a recent trip seeing those massage chairs was like finding an oasis in the desert , said mr daly , who paid 15 for a 15minute massage just before heading home from a business trip i was in so much pain , and this made me feel somewhat better this is a great service to have at an airport other airports , like orlando international , have interminal salons where travelers can get haircuts , massages or manicures and the number and range of retail stores and restaurants in airports growing , too in the airmall at pittsburgh international , many of the 105 stores are specifically aimed at business travelers , including a staples office products outlet as many as 10 percent of business travelers we 've surveyed have said that they will purposely try to connect through pittsburgh rather than somewhere else , just to use our shops and services , mr knight said for what ails some travelers , though , exercise or pampering or shopping may not be enough kennedy international in new york , for example , provides services for which there is no substitute the airport s chapel offers a setting for quiet prayer and a chance to speak with a priest , minister or rabbi and when the pain gets really bad , there is an onsite emergency dentist finding treadmills in the terminals it is not always easy to know in advance if an airport you will be visiting offers a health club or other services most airports have web sites , but they vary greatly in content and organization some offer extensive details about services and concessions , while others offer little or none facilities at airport hotels are generally not included on airport web sites , though many hotels have their own sites a good source is the airport s information desk , which generally can be reached by telephone , or its administration office travel agents and corporate travel planners may also be familiar with specific airports many customerservice representatives of airlines can answer questions about their hub airports , and have the advantage of being reachable most hours of the day photos richard laninfa works out at the pittsburgh airport gym , where a day visit costs 999 gyms are among new amenities at major airports in pittsburgh , the airport

listening to music , in most cases , one is also listening to something else an experience of shape , a swerve of feeling , a message from another time , evidence of a creative personality , the skill and taste of a performer check if none of these things are to be found , you are probably listening to one of the longer works of morton feldman , whose for philip guston was performed at the paula cooper gallery on sunday during a long afternoon that started at 3 and ended after 7 30 feldman needed such great extents of time in order to say little enough if for philip guston lasted , say , 10 minutes as it might , with all the repetitions taken out then it would be a piece it would have an identity you could carry around in your head afterward but going on for fourandahalf hours a duration exceeded only by the same composer s string quartet ii , also performed in the city recently it becomes something that is simply there , a fact facts always defeat you you might start out listening to for philip guston a tribute to one of feldman s painter friends as if it were saying something , as if it were going somewhere , as if there might be something to be gained from following its progress , but it offers no help to such modes of appreciation , and you cannot go on doing all the work for fourandahalf hours soon you relax you let the music go on you do not stand in its way you notice how so much of it emanates from a fournote melody heard at the start , though often the players flutist , pianist and player on tuned percussion will be repeating just two notes , in constant rhythmic realignments that way similarity is maintained with randomness the ear may be caught by occasional events , whether because they increase the sameness one low vibraphone note hit softly again and again through maybe half a minute \( though time has stopped meaning very much \) or introduce a sudden change , like a sprinkle of high notes but nothing is to be gained from noticing such features being always the same and unpredictable , the music keeps hovering in the rare space between what you can ignore and what you can understand all you can say is that you are there and when it is all over , that you were there those who were there on this occasion included petr kotik on flute , joseph kubera on keyboards and chris nappi on percussion , all of the sem ensemble they matched their sounds and rhythms finely , so that sometimes one might have to think before recognizing which was playing what at other times , repeating a middleregister note alone , mr kotik might vary his tone with breathy attacks and squeaks of harmonics in the manner of a shakuhachi player , and one was glad of that but the musicianly qualities most necessary and most evident were those of quietness and dedication even more impressive was the dedication of the 10 or so audience members who sat in their chairs all through perhaps another 20 stayed and moved from place to place a few others came and went , tiptoeing in and out , like visitors to a long religious ceremony photo from left , petr kotik , joseph kubera and chris nappi \( hiroyuki ito for the new york times \)
time was when freshman orientation consisted largely of campus tours and introductions to the football team and the student newspaper but in recent years , college officials have been trying to squeeze extra mileage out of those early hours on campus when students are most open to new ideas and experiences , offering them serious social issues to digest , not just choices of fraternity rushes last week , for example , after the briefest of welcomes , incoming students at baruch college were greeted on their first day with a discussion of the massacre of nearly one million tutsis in rwanda in 1994 rather than being asked over the summer to pore over lists of dormitories and teams , the students had been asked to read we wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families stories from rwanda and philip gourevitch , the author of the book , was the freshman convocation s featured speaker for the 1 , 350 freshmen at baruch , a campus of the city university of new york , this somber introduction to the world of current events was like a plunge into an icy lake it caught their attention while the subject at baruch was especially sobering , students at other colleges were also being steeped in the problems of the world at the university of pennsylvania , freshmen attended seminars on topics from eating disorders to bribery and corruption incoming students at mount holyoke college will be pounding nails with habitat for humanity at defiance college in ohio , freshmen are fanning out to the community to register voters barnard freshmen are cleaning up a local playground and helping at local charities like the leukemia and lymphoma society and the gay men s health crisis and in one of the more inventive twists on diversity , the barnard freshmen joined students at columbia last wednesday for an evening of theatrical monologues reflecting differences in cultural practices based on essays from some of the freshmen s own college applications the monologues reflected the experiences of an iranian woman growing up in a traditional home , a taiwanese student adjusting to the united states , a secular jew dining with orthodox jews , an asian woman attending a predominantly cuban high school in florida , and a black man discovering pride in the color of his skin colleges are looking to recreate common experiences , particularly intellectual experiences that set an academic tone and raise expectations , said john n gardner , a senior fellow at the national resource center for the first year experience at the university of south carolina such experiences were common 40 or 50 years ago , he said , when there was greater homogeneity of students and more commonality in the curriculum , but eroded in the 60 s and 70 s midcentury , it was easier to make assumptions about a body of knowledge that the students could relate to , he said at baruch , which had not assigned a summer reading before this year , myrna chase , the acting provost and a historian , said she had wanted a book that would make the students think about the world , about ethical concerns and about their responsibility for each other , issues she hoped the students would keep in mind throughout their college years for nearly an hour last wednesday , in baruch s ornate auditorium at lexington avenue and east 23rd street , mr gourevitch , a slender , darkhaired man of 38 , offered the students a kind of template for learning by relating his own odyssey from his days as a cornell freshman in 1979 when he was excited and anxious about all that seemed possible to his exploration of the horrifying complexities of rwanda in words , he took the students with him on the physical journey to rwanda flying for hours on end over the swiss alps , across the mediterranean sea and then across the vast immensity of the sahara desert but he also tried to take them with him on the intellectual pilgrimage that began with questions about why the hutu majority had killed 800 , 000 members of the ruling tutsi minority , how the killings had been allowed to occur , and what hell was like he said he kept hearing that the genocide was chaos , but could not believe it because it seemed obvious that it required the opposite of chaos to achieve such terrible and widespread destruction in such a concentrated fashion over and over again , he seemed to be telling the students that it was all right not to have all the answers when starting out , so long as one looks for ways to find them pushing students to think critically has become a major theme for colleges like mr gourevitch s quest for answers in east africa , the students' passage through college may also seem bewildering at times in his preface to his book , before he even gets to the decomposed cadavers and stillclothed skeletons in a church on a rocky hill in eastern rwanda , mr gourevitch says this is a book about how people imagine themselves and one another a book about

to hear chris mcquarrie tell it , the origins of the new film he wrote and directed , the way of the gun , lay in disgruntlement , frustration and anger we pick up the story about four years ago , shortly after he was awarded the oscar for his screenplay the usual suspects at that point , the project that most enthralled mr mcquarrie , who appears to be one of those formidably intelligent people who can produce a trove of well thought out , cogently stated reasons in support of his opinions , was to direct the life story of alexander the great but the then 27yearold mcquarrie , author of a screenplay that was nonpareil in its genre , was finding no one who would let him direct a movie about a 20yearold who had conquered the world it was probably a bad idea to pursue that as the first film , he now grudgingly concedes but i decided if i wanted to direct that i should direct other films first so i came up with ideas for some smaller films but literally every time i would go to a meeting , the only interest anybody had in me making a film was if it was a crime film but i did n't want to be the crime guy so i started lowering my price , and then i started lowering my back end money to be earned through foreign distribution , cable television or video sales and then i started lowering my standards , and finally it got to the point when i was in a meeting and i said , 'i will take no salary , i 'll take no back end , i 'll eat craft service and i will live in the jungle while i make this movie you decide the budget and the casting , as long as you let me make the film i want to make' and they still said no after that meeting , a frustrated and fairly furious mr mcquarrie went for coffee with the actor benicio del toro and the producer ken kokin , both of whom had worked on the usual suspects i was feeling completely miserable , mr mcquarrie recalled recently during a visit to new york , and i said , 'that s it , i'm going to quit this whole business , i'm going to go write books' and benicio said 'it seems that they 're willing to let you make a crime film if you want to say what you want to say , you have to make the movie they want you to make why do n't you make a crime film \? ' so i conceded that he was right , and we started thinking about a crime film but not happily this movie was written from a place of real anger , he said as mr del toro explained later by telephone sometimes you get to a point where you think everything is going to be easy , but then there s another mountain to climb he has so much talent he just had to use it before time passed him by the way of the gun , which opens friday , is the story of two sociopaths , parker and longbaugh , played by ryan phillippe and mr del toro , who decide to kidnap a surrogate mother \( juliette lewis \) and hold her and her unborn child for ransom as it turns out , the kidnapping becomes a bloody mess , and , what s worse , the man for whom she is carrying the child is mob connected soon the screen is populated by a number of very dangerous men , portrayed by taye diggs , nicky katt and an understated james caan , none of whom has a motivation that can be described as unalloyed the movie is tense and twisty it should now be harder for mr mcquarrie to avoid being called the crime guy the idea for the movie was a marriage of mr del toro s coffee shop comment that he had never seen a really interesting kidnapping movie , and a casual remark on the part of mr mcquarrie s wife heather neely mcquarrie , a film producer who also served as the costume designer for the way of the gun , happened to mention an article she had read about an executive with a much younger wife who hired a surrogate mother so they could have a child they were perfectly healthy , said mr mcquarrie , but she did n't want to ruin her body they hired bodyguards for the surrogate mother well , as soon as i heard 'bodyguards , ' the movie very easily unfolded i wrote the first draft in about five days anger included what was bugging mr mcquarrie was the film business apart from his personal difficulties , he was angry about the industry s insistence on sympathetic characters \( many executives found fault with alexander s precipitous and unattractive postconquest , thirdact decline \) i ca n't tell you the number of times i 've heard , 'well , you 'll lose the audience if that character does that , ' he said it s maddening it completely takes away the ability to make a threedimensional character they want films about crime , but they do n't want characters who are criminals no one ever asked me to change the fact that person a killed person b they just wanted me to give person a a good reason , a reason why person b deserved to die and i found that deplorable , that hollywood s answer to toning down violence was to work harder at making violence more acceptable , as opposed to taking violence out so when i sat down to write this film , i said fine , if i'm going to write a crime film , i'm going to make a film about criminals parker and longbaugh are unapologetic , unqualified thugs who really do n't care who they 're hurting or what they have to do to get their way when my agent read it , he said we 're not even going to bother taking it to the studios they 'd have wanted it rewritten they 'd have wanted that scene that inevitable , awful scene in which the characters explain why they are the way they are and end up blaming somebody else so that you can find them acceptable
hempstead , ny , nov 1 the report came early in the week running back terrell davis , who has missed five games with an injured left ankle and has rushed for only 99 yards this season , will return for the denver broncos when they face the jets on sunday that will be a treat , jets coach al groh said pardon his sarcasm , but the broncos have already scored the second most points in the league this season , behind only the highflying circus that is the st louis rams the broncos have the secondranked total offense , the secondrated rushing offense and the secondrated passing offense in the conference the team s two wide receivers , rod smith and ed mccaffrey , each have more than 50 receptions quarterback brian griese is the secondrated quarterback in the league , behind only kurt warner of the rams and mike anderson , the rookie who replaced davis , has 676 yards , more than the jets' curtis martin how good is the broncos' system \? last season after davis was lost with a knee injury in the fourth week of the season , the rookie olandis gary gained 1 , 159 yards in 12 games when gary sustained a seasonending injury in the first game of the season , anderson stepped in and was named the american football conference rookie of the month in september now , he is a backup as much as davis will be a focal point for the jets' defense at giants stadium on sunday , handling an offensive line that has made two successive rookies into suitable replacements for him will be an equivalent burden in groh s estimation , only two rushers barry sanders and marshall faulk can create openings where there are none all the other rushers davis included are dependent on the blocking of their offensive line , and denver s has been extraordinary without him , they 're still a very highranked offense , jets linebacker dwayne gordon said they always seem to find another guy that fits into that system well maybe it s the linemen that s doing the job terrell is a great back , but that line is good that s one of the things we 'll have to key on playing good technique at the line of scrimmage and stopping terrell from getting yardage while others have replaced davis s yardage , martin , who has known davis since they both felt slighted in the 1995 draft , believes davis brings something less tangible to the broncos terrell is a warrior , martin said his presence , more than anything , is what influences that team that s the intangible thing you have to be concerned with martin thinks that davis was as much a rallying point for the broncos when he was healthy as was quarterback john elway but the broncos have been without davis s presence for quite a while he was injured during an openingnight loss to the rams and has tried to come back in two other games as the broncos skidded to a 44 mark , including a stunning loss to the cincinnati bengals before a bye week , some fans have questioned davis s toughness this week , davis said that he was confident the broncos' record would have been better had he played all this after missing all but four games last season with a knee injury he sustained against the jets for davis , the 2 , 008yard season , the league s most valuable player award , the super bowl championship in 1998 when the broncos eliminated the jets in the afc championship game seem long ago obviously , it s been frustrating , especially after the year i came off , davis said to be sidelined with an injury like this is frustrating that was the feeling that spawned a friendship between davis and martin , when each one watched kijana carter , tyrone wheatley and napoleon kaufman , the now forgotten running backs , get chosen ahead of them martin was picked in the third round , because he had been hurt while at pittsburgh davis was not snubbed until the sixth round , largely because of limited playing time at georgia we both felt , 'i can do better than this guy , ' martin said we both thrive off that that made us bond together extra points broncos quarterback brian griese , who was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol saturday night , said he had a couple of drinks the league placed griese in its substanceabuse program and will require him to submit to testing for two seasons griese , the leading passer in the afc , was not disciplined by the broncos , and will start sunday interestingly , both terrell davis and coach mike shanahan said it could just as easily have happened to them he made a bad decision , shanahan said i 've had a few times , i feel very fortunate , it could have happened to me i do n't think it s a distraction to the team , but it s always got to be a distraction to himself he s tough enough to handle it the jets' injury list continues to grow , with linebacker john abraham \( abdomen \) , tight end anthony becht \( knee \) and wide receiver windrell hayes \( ankle \) , who has been inactive , listed as doubtful abraham did not practice wednesday photo the broncos' terrell davis , after missing five games with an injury , will be a focal point of the jets' defense \( agence francepresse \)

new haven as we await results from the florida recount , two things should be clear first , if george w bush , having apparently lost the popular vote , does indeed win at least 270 electoral votes when the electoral college meets , he is the lawful winner , who played by the constitution s rules and won second , we must realize that the electoral college is a hopelessly outdated system and that we must abolish it direct election would resonate far better with the american value of one person , one vote indeed , the college was designed at the founding of the country to help one group white southern males and this year , it has apparently done just that in 1787 , as the constitution was being drafted in philadelphia , james wilson of pennsylvania proposed direct election of the president but james madison of virginia worried that such a system would hurt the south , which would have been outnumbered by the north in a direct election system the creation of the electoral college got around that it was part of the deal that southern states , in computing their share of electoral votes , could count slaves \( albeit with a twofifths discount \) , who of course were given none of the privileges of citizenship virginia emerged as the big winner , with more than a quarter of the electors needed to elect a president a free state like pennsylvania got fewer electoral votes even though it had approximately the same free population the constitution s prosouthern bias quickly became obvious for 32 of the constitution s first 36 years , a white slaveholding virginian occupied the presidency thomas jefferson , for example , won the election of 1800 against john adams from massachusetts in a race where the slavery skew of the electoral college was the decisive margin of victory the system s gender bias was also obvious in a direct presidential election , any state that chose to enfranchise its women would have automatically doubled its clout under the electoral college , however , a state had no special incentive to expand suffrage each got a fixed number of electoral votes , regardless of how many citizens were allowed to vote now fastforward to election night 2000 al gore appears to have received the most popular votes nationwide but may well lose the contest for electoral votes once again , the system has tilted toward white southern males exit polls indicate that mr bush won big among this group and that mr gore won decisively among blacks and women the electoral college began as an unfair system , and remains so so why keep it \? advocates of the system sloganeer about federalism , meaning that presidential candidates are forced to take into account individual state interests and regional variations in their national campaigns but in the current system , candidates do n't appeal so much to state interests \( what are those , anyway \? \) as to demographic groups \( elderly voters , soccer moms \) within states and direct popular elections would still encourage candidates to take into account regional differences , like those between voters in the midwest and the east after all , one cannot win a national majority without getting lots of votes in lots of places direct election could give state governments some incentives to increase voter turnout , because the more voters a state turned out , the bigger its role in national elections and the bigger its overall share in the national tally presidential candidates would begin to pay more attention to the needs of individual states that had higher turnouts the nation s founders sought to harness governmental competition and rivalry in healthy ways , using checks and balances within the federal government and preserving roles for state governments direct presidential elections would be true to their best concepts democracy and healthy competition rather than to their worst compromises
durk i jager lasted 17 months at the helm of procter gamble , resigning last month after the shortest tenure of any chief executive in the company s 163year history the board of mattel asked for the resignation of the company s leader , jill e barad , this year after only three years m douglas ivester , after years of being groomed for cocacola s top job , quit in february after two years in it the evidence seems compelling that chief executives at america s largest companies have less staying power than they did just a few years ago the stock market is far more volatile than it used to be , management experts say , and directors punish poor results swiftly but what everybody believes about the careers of chief executives , at least at the nation s largest companies , is probably wrong a new study has put a kink in the widely held conventional wisdom , concluding that not much changed in the second half of the 1990 s if anything , tenure actually lengthened between the beginning of 1995 and the start of 2000 , the average tenure of leaders at 65 large companies rose one year , to 83 years , according to research by sca consulting , a new york management consulting firm looked at another way , half the chief executives in 1995 served more than six years , half less in 2000 , the median length of service is the same the results of the study have left corporate governance experts puzzled it s definitely counterintuitive , said michael useem , director of the center for leadership and change at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania donald p jacobs , dean of the kellogg graduate school of management at northwestern , agreed i would have said it would be exactly the opposite and thomas neff , chairman of spencer stuart , the headhunting firm , called it surprising , saying , we are doing an unprecedented number of searches right now , and i suspect others are , too the possible reasons for lengthened tenure are many , management analysts said the expanding pay packages of chief executives , heavily weighted toward stock options , play a role in keeping them in their current jobs , according to a separate recent study the bull market , particularly among bluechip companies , has left investors and board members satisfied at many companies and boards seem to spend more time planning succession than they once did as a result , many end up choosing better candidates you could draw a lot of conclusions from the research , said russell h miller , an sca partner who had expected the study to document just how much tenure had dropped but it probably asks more questions than it answers sca s original study , released earlier this year , looked at the 50 largest companies by market capitalization the firm recently updated the study to include those companies that fit the definition in 1995 but do not today to remove the natural bias that comes from analyzing only companies that have performed well enough to be among those with the largest capitalizations today what seems clear from the results is that turnover among chief executives at the bestknown companies has changed less in recent years than many executives , recruiters , analysts and journalists have suggested one large reason , mr miller said , may be a fact that is easy to forget in a labor market in which jobhopping among the most soughtafter managers seems rife very few jobs can match the pay , power and prestige that comes with the chief executive s chair at a major company most leaders will use all their political skills to hang onto their jobs and virtually none cast about for other possibilities where do you go if you 're the ceo of ibm \? mr miller asked of course , that bond is weaker at hundreds of smaller companies , and management experts said they thought turnover had risen at a broad crosssection of american companies the last few years over all , the average tenure of chief executives certainly does appear to have fallen over the course of the second half of the 20th century a few years ago , william ocasio , now a professor at northwestern , compared turnover rates from 1950 to 1990 and found that they had steadily risen in 1960 , for example , about 5 percent of top executives in their fifth year on the job resigned or were fired by 1985 , the portion had increased to 15 percent professor ocasio took a random sample from 2 , 700 industrial corporations , regardless of their size although no parallel statistic exists for the last five years , other research suggests that turnover has become more common recently two of three large companies around the world have installed a new chief executive since 1995 , and almost half have made a change the last three years , according to drake beam morin , the outplacement firm , which looked at 476 firms in 25 countries many of those changes happened because of mergers , however a phenomenon that says little about the behavior of executives and directors companies that have merged were excluded from sca s study , mr miller said
to the editor richard taruskin flatly describes dmitri shostakovich as a man who did not take risks casting a great composer as a fictional hero , march 5 in this context , he notes that the yevgeny yevtushenko poems incorporated into shostakovich s 13th symphony , including babi yar , had already been published in the soviet union but he omits a much more important fact about the constantly changing political winds at the height of nikita khruschev s destalinization campaign by the time shostakovich was preparing for the premiere of his symphony , babi yar had been attacked in the soviet press for focusing on jewish victims of the nazi occupiers , and on russian antisemitism this made the production of the symphony a much riskier enterprise than mr taruskin acknowledges anything to do with jews was a highly charged subject under the soviet regime in her 1984 autobiography , the former bolshoi opera star galina vishnevskaya recounts from firsthand knowledge the pressure brought to bear on singers to withdraw from the scheduled premiere shostakovich refused to alter a line of the text , even though he had been warned that the party central committee might well ban the performance the central committee did not give the goahead for the premiere until midday on the scheduled date of dec 18 yevtushenko himself bowed to pressure on an occasion when shostakovich did not only a few days after the premiere of the 13th symphony , a second version of babi yar , expurgated to conform more closely to the official line on jews , appeared in a conservative literary publication none of this , of course , qualifies shostakovich as a dissident in the sense that the term is commonly understood in the west but it hardly fits mr taruskin s portrait of the composer as a man who took no risks it is as vulgar and reductive to view shostakovich s life and music through a smug lens of postcold war triumphalism as it is to enshrine him as a dissident susan jacoby manhattan
the new season s crop of television shows is transmitting an oddly puritanical message the pursuit of wealth breeds immorality or , at the very least , extreme vulgarity on bull , the new tnt series , the founder of a prosperous investment banking firm is a manipulative , coldhearted schemer who does n't flinch from organizing an illegal trade and then foisting responsibility on somebody else the young hotshot stockbrokers in the street on fox break up their day with quickies in the bathrooms and amuse themselves by urinating prankishly in coffee cups on nbc s titans , the latest nighttime soap opera from aaron spelling , an heir to an aeronautics fortune discovers that his former lover is about to become his stepmother and she s pregnant with his baby none of these fictional concoctions , however , can hope to compete in the dubious morality department or even as melodrama with the rockefellers , pbs s juicy \( albeit soberly juicy \) multigenerational biographical study of american capitalism s royal family this engrossing twopart program , which begins oct 16 and marks the 13th season of pbs s american experience serves up a lavish spread of money lust , religious fervor , philanthropic penance , sexual impropriety and even bigamy the rockefellers addresses headon the ethical question that runs subliminally through those other programs can you do what it takes to become rich and be thought of as good \? this was also the irresistible theme of titan the life of john d rockefeller sr by ron chernow , a consultant to the pbs program and one of its expert commentators , who in his book described rockefeller as an implausible blend of sin and sanctity all these shows come hot on the heels of survivor , and the attendant commentary lamenting the nation s deplorable celebration of greed , as if this were something new but americans have always chased money with what europeans used to consider unseemly ardor in 1835 , in democracy in america , alexis de tocqueville observed , i know of no country , indeed , where the love of money has taken a stronger hold on the affection of men well , what s wrong with that \? the question may be especially relevant now , with a clearcut financial distinction between the \( very wealthy \) republican and \( merely comfortable \) democratic presidential and vicepresidential candidates or maybe not most prospective contestants for who wants to be a millionaire seem more worried about paying their bills than the unanticipated ethical quandaries that might attach to their newly fat cash balances still , the responsibility that accrues to the very rich has not been an incidental concern for the country s actual titans andrew carnegie believed that wealthy people should enrich society , not their heirs , and to that end gave away almost his entire fortune before he died he once warned his fellow robber barons that the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced the rockefellers , however , took a less apologetic stance the growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest , john d rockefeller jr once noted , sounding a little like a victorianage antecedent of richard hatch , the triumphant survivor rockefeller elaborated the american beauty rose can be produced in the splendor and fragrance which brings cheer to its beholder only by sacrificing the early buds which grow around it this is not an evil tendency in business it is merely the working out of a law of nature and a law of god yet this same rockefeller , who also had to bear the burden of being called junior , devoted much of his life to giving his family s money away , investing in medicine , science , education , the arts and foreign policy \( a practice that would provide another target for the family s critics \) he was merely continuing the tradition established by his father , who said his course was set by a baptist preacher who encouraged him to make as much money as he could , and then give away as much as he could though the senior rockefeller did n't seem to feel guilty at all about being rich , his heirs did grapple with their family s unsavory legacy which went beyond the founder s predatory business practices the family was spawned by a bigamist and alleged rapist john d sr s father , william avery \( devil bill \) rockefeller , a traveling salesman generations later , after decades of cleansing philanthropy on an enormous scale , the family s hardwon respectability would be challenged again its golden son , nelson rockefeller , who had become a national political figure , died at 70 while in the company of a young woman , in what his speechwriter joseph e persico delicately described as undeniably intimate circumstances the pbs documentary underscores the impression that the rockefeller family has always wanted \( but has not always been able \) to have it both ways to be rich and good , to be powerful and beneficent , humble and lordly to be carrying out god s will while living well emblematic of the family s historic struggle was john d rockefeller sr s decision to house his family in a mansion near cleveland with a grand facade and a threadbare interior his wife once told a neighbor , i am so glad my son has told me what he wants for christmas , so now it can be denied him when he grew up , junior was n't quite so harsh , though after he distributed allowances to his children he urged them not only to keep accounts but also to save 10 percent and to give away 10 percent despite the sort of unmitigated greed we usually see on television , a surprising number of americans follow the rockefeller model as best they can at the top is bill gates , who transferred 17 billion to the bill and melinda gates foundation , and then there is everyone else apparently there is a feeling that if you ca n't be as rich as rockefeller , or even richard hatch , you can at least try to be good \( in charity if not in personal behavior \) the share of households contributing to charity has remained relatively constant between 1987 and 1998 , about 70 percent , according to the most recent data from independent sector , a collection of voluntary organizations those stuck in the middle class can take comfort in the documentary s assurance that they may be lucky not to be fabulously rich for junior , being a rockefeller was often agonizing , especially after a bitter union strike at a rockefellerowned coal mine that left 45 people dead he suffered debilitating headaches and ultimately had to take refuge in a sanitarium he instructed his children from the bible , unto he who much is given , much is required , and once wrote i did not choose or seek to be the recipient of such wealth it has not been the greatest happiness photo john d rockefeller jr , standing second from right , with his children and their spouses at his park avenue home in 1949 standing at far right is nelson a rockefeller \( rockefeller archive center the american experience \)
portland , ore , oct 25 in the downtown streets of the biggest city in oregon , it is remarkably easy to find people who say they are truly struggling with how to cast their vote this year but it is remarkably difficult to find people in that group who see the decision as a choice between vice president al gore and gov george w bush instead , the choice they find so agonizing is between mr gore and ralph nader , the green party candidate democratic leaders here and around the country have mounted a ferocious appeal to convince such people that a vote for mr nader is tantamount to a vote for mr bush but while this argument weighs heavily on many minds here , there are also many voters who will have none of it oregon is the closest thing to nader country , after all , where polls suggest his support is higher than in any other state i 'd like to vote for nader , i really would , explained kevin mcgrorty , 31 , the proprietor of bad kitty koffee , a sidewalk stand i like what he stands for i like the questions he s raising but i 've got to vote for gore i 'd feel horribly guilty if i woke up the day after the election and bush won , and if i felt that my particular vote had in any way could have swayed things toward him but no such conflict troubled one of mr mcgrorty s customers , danielle dedee , a sales clerk at a local gallery and a fiercely pronader voter she knows her candidate is an extreme long shot on nov 7 , though she said that was no reason to withhold a vote for him and though she firmly believes that governor bush , of texas , is dangerous , especially on environmental issues , that does not mean that she would rather see mr gore become president if bush gets in , i feel that it might bring things to a head much more quickly , ms dedee said pollution s going to increase in the short term , but i think that will bring a lot more people into the environmental movement a lot more quickly sometimes you 've got to hit bottom before you come back up oregon has voted for the democratic presidential nominee in the last three elections but with plenty of support in the suburbs and rural regions of the state , mr bush stands a very good chance of winning this state and its seven electoral votes if mr nader drains away critical votes from mr gore in cities like portland and the college town , eugene the same dynamic is at work in neighboring washington state , and in some midwestern states like minnesota and wisconsin , and perhaps even in california , the biggest electoral prize of all but in no other state but oregon does there seem to be more of a risk for mr gore that goes a long way toward explaining why the vice president showed up here at a rally on sunday night , pledging to fight to protect the environment with all my heart and soul polls this year in oregon have shown mr nader with support ranging from 5 percent all the way into double digits an american research group poll of 600 likely oregon voters , taken oct 2024 and released today , showed mr bush with 45 percent , mr gore with 41 percent , and mr nader with 10 percent \( of selfidentified republicans , just 1 percent said they were for mr nader among democrats , the figure was 12 percent \) the margin of sampling error for the entire group surveyed is plus or minus four percentage points but whether those who now say they prefer mr nader will actually mark their ballots for him is a different question democrats here are banking on the notion that a blitz of rallies , speakers and radio and television advertisements will persuade many of these people to support the vice president in the end the advertisements are aimed at voters in states with significant percentages of people who have indicated they support mr nader they focus on issues such as the environment or the prospects that supreme court nominees under a bush presidency would be far more hostile to abortion rights than those who would be selected if mr gore wins the argument that a vote for mr nader could help put mr bush in the white house seems to be backfiring it s manipulative , said joe reinhorn , a shipping clerk for a computer parts company some of my friends are arguing , 'well , bush is really bad , and gore is somewhat bad , so it s important to vote for gore' whatever happened to voting your conscience \? mr reinhorn and others also said that the main point in supporting mr nader was not so much to elect him president , but to get him 5 percent of the total vote , which would award the green party federal campaign funds for the 2004 presidential election in some cases , the choice has split households susan harlan , an associate professor of art at portland state university , said she is veering toward mr nader while her husband backs mr gore i just feel , in the long run , i'm being more honest by voting for nader , ms harlan said it also bothers me that we have n't really been allowed to hear more from nader , that he was n't in the debates she said her husband , a systems analyst , was frustrated with her decision he loves nader , but he does not want to see george w bush in the white house , she explained i appreciate nader s leftleaningness , said steve fosler , who owns an architectural firm but a vote for nader takes a vote away from gore it s as simple as that tim hibbitts , an independent pollster in portland , has calculated that among those who indicate a preference for mr nader in the polls , about half are unlikely to change their minds , in part because they view both major parties as two peas in a very corrupt pod the other half , he said , are more up in the air , and may well decided to weigh in on the bushgore matchup if the race looks to be very close in their state , which it certainly does now one such a voter is sean mccuen , 30 , a mover and carpet layer who described himself as temporarily unemployed if it was n't so close , i 'd go for nader for sure , just to show my support for what he s talking about , he said but if it s close , i want to be realistic if there s really a chance of bush getting elected , i guess i 'd like to have a say about that i do n't want that to happen photos among oregon voters agonizing over voting for ralph nader are kevin mcgrorty , left rear , and steve fosler danielle dedee , right , backs nader \( photographs by shane young for the new york times \)
the newspaper industry , already radically changed this year by the pending merger of the tribune company and times mirror , was reshaped yesterday as one company offered itself for sale , a second consolidated its dominance in daily circulation and a third moved into first place in the sheer number of newspaper properties it owns central newspapers inc , owner of the arizona republic , the country s 11thlargest daily the indianapolis star and four other daily newspapers announced it was up for sale the move would take another multigeneration newspaper family , the pulliams , out of the business a few hours later , a second announcement confirmed that the gannett company and community newspaper holdings inc were growing bigger by buying the bulk of the 49 newspapers the thomson corporation had put on the block four months ago gannett is paying 113 billion for 21 daily newspapers in louisiana , maryland , ohio , wisconsin and utah with the acquisition , the company enhances its dominance in the daily circulation division it will now own 94 newspapers , including its flagship , usa today , with a combined circulation of about seven million the 31 newspapers of no 2 knight ridder have a combined daily circulation of just under four million community newspaper holdings , which is financed by the resources of the retirement systems of alabama , paid 455 million for 17 papers in indiana , southern georgia and the appalachian region of west virginia and western maryland after the purchase , the company will own 112 daily newspapers with a combined circulation of almost 11 1 million owen van essen , the president of dirks , van essen murray , the newspaper brokerage firm based in new mexico , said yesterday that these deals , coupled with the 8 billion purchase of times mirror by the tribune company and a variety of other pending agreements were likely to push the total amount of money spent on newspaper purchases to 15 billion by the end of the year for the newspaper industry , that is a breathtaking number , 150 percent higher than ever before as mr van essen said , the previous record was 62 billion in 1997 , and we blew through that with the tribune deal alone relative to other media segments , the amounts are still very , very small , mr van essen said there s going to be 40 billion of tv that sells and 30 billion of radio and probably 50 billion of cable by newspaper standards , this is a lot of activity but the consolidation frenzy is just catching on with newspapers the announcement of central newspapers whose stock symbol , ecp , mirrors its founder s initials powered its stock to a 65 percent gain yesterday the share price increased by 2050 , to 52 but with all the mergers , the vestiges of hometown newspapering are fewer and fewer the conservative pulliam family one of whose members is dan quayle , the former vice president was strongly identified with indianapolis , where it published two newspapers until the indianapolis news folded last fall gregory favre , a vice president of the mcclatchy company whose tour in newspapering has given him a close view of a generation s worth of changes in the industry , said yesterday that the pulliam family , meant a tremendous amount in indianapolis like any great publishing family he added , it s a loss to any community to lose a family like that the proposed sale is the second instance this year of a multigeneration newspaper family deciding to sell the business it created and , as with the chandlers in los angeles , the controlling shares of the company in central s case , the class b shares were held in trust for the pulliam descendants as with the chandler trusts , the eugene c pulliam trust contained language that posed a barrier to any sale according to the trust document , the limitations on the trustees' power to sell their central stock shall become void if they determine that remaining independent would seriously threaten to cause substantially complete loss of the shares' value but central s dropping stock price before yesterday , it had lost 20 percent of its value this year and the very high valuations that newspapers have commanded recently helped create a climate in which the three trustees the former chief executive , frank e russell the current chief executive , louis h weil and myrta j pulliam , a granddaughter of the company s founder decided to sell neither mr weil nor ms pulliam would comment on the decision when contacted yesterday stuart garner , the president of thomson newspapers , kept his comments brief , saying that he was very pleased with the prices the two companies paid for the 38 newspapers someone else who knew the terms of the deal said that gannett and community newspaper holdings paid prices that averaged about 128 times 12month earnings before interest and taxes the sale of the remaining 11 daily newspapers in the united states is expected to be completed within days one source said there were four potential buyers , including media general , which is based in richmond , va also out for bid are a large group of newspapers currently owned by hollinger international inc , the company of conrad black , as well as some smallercirculation newspapers owned by the new york times company none of these match the size of the republic , which has a daily circulation of 482 , 000 the republic s daily circulation dipped slightly in the last reporting period , but not as much as that of the star , which dropped more than 8 percent , to 247 , 000 nonetheless , although no executives of likely buyers like knight ridder and mcclatchy would talk on the record about the prospects , one who spoke on condition of anonymity said phoenix is a great market and indianapolis is a community that is growing tremendously
eddie layton likes playthings the organ at yankee stadium , the toy trains in his queens apartment , the tugboat he sails on the hudson yes , that strangelooking , oddsized maroonandgreen tug that elicits a hearty honk from passing tugboat captains belongs to layton and why not \? when you walk into a marina , all the boats look alike , he said they 're all white and , he might have added , none are tugboats in fact , layton contends , no one else anywhere has a private tugboat but layton wanted one he got this cockeyed idea almost 30 years ago that he would like to be a sailor , and the type of boat that caught his fancy was a tug he also had plenty of free time during the day since 1967 , when mike burke , then the yankees' president , discovered him playing the organ on three television soap operas the secret storm , love of life and love is a manysplendored thing layton has pounded the keys at yankee stadium he knows nothing about sports i thought a sacrifice fly had something to do with killing an insect , layton admitted he also knew little about boats but he learned by reading yachting magazines he saw a 26foot hull of a work boat in maine and somehow imagined another use for it a year and a half later , in 1974 , it was launched in mystic , conn , to his design he liked the colors of the classic moran tugs that ply the new york waterways maroon cabin , green hull he put on a justforshow black smokestack with a big e , for eddie , on it he added a mopheadlike cat s whiskers over the bow , which real tugs have he called the boat impulse it is only 26 feet long , about a quarter the length of most tugs pleasure boats as long as his usually weigh about 5 , 000 pounds , but his comes in at 15 , 000 the tug also has a diesel engine , just like real tugs his is only 80 horsepower , though the big tugs can go up to 3 , 000 horsepower his top speed is eight and a half knots , but it does not cost much to go places he uses about a gallon of fuel an hour and because it is so heavy , passengers feel as if they are riding in a big limousine on a smooth highway layton estimates that it costs 5 , 000 a year to maintain his tug if it were built today , it would set the buyer back about 100 , 000 he keeps the tug about a mile north of the tappan zee bridge a 20minute car ride from yankee stadium at the tarrytown boat club he often spends the nights on the boat when the yankees are away the mostly fiberglass boat sleeps four two in the front , two in the back it has a comfortable teaktrimmed day area with room for a couch and four chairs , a sink and a stove the head is discreetly hidden by a curtain the rear deck can hold four people sunning themselves his captain s seat is a narrow bench built for two his guests have included thurman munson bill white , the former yankee broadcaster and former national league president and bob sheppard , the silkenvoiced publicaddress announcer a boat is the only thing that layton drives he never learned to operate a car in fact , when burke asked him to become the yankees' organist , layton demurred because he did not drive i do n't want to take the subways home at night , he said we 'll send a limo for you , burke told him the yankees have done so for 33 years these days , though , layton gets a ride home at night from sheppard as soon as the last out is made , layton meets sheppard at the elevator they are gone before the yankees file into the clubhouse the same hands that curl the tugboat wheel have been playing the organ for well , layton does not disclose his age but the philadelphiaborn layton he majored in meteorology and minored in music at west chester state teachers college has a distinguished background for many years he worked for the hammond organ company , giving concerts in asia and europe to acquaint the public with the instrument he has issued recordings \( his latest cd is called ya gotta have heart \) , and he has recorded baseball charges and other organ music for many films , including kevin costner s for love of the game layton is still the answer to the trivial pursuit question who was the only person to play for the yankees , rangers and knicks in the same year \? he was a longtime organist at madison square garden , too and how does he know that his is the only privateuse tugboat in the world \? because if i knew where there was another one , he said , i 'd sink it photo he may not have a keyboard on board , but eddie layton is at home on his colorful tugboat \( rosalind eskenazi \)
washington president clinton s arrival in okinawa today for the group of 8 meeting of big industrial nations calls attention to something beyond the international economic issues that the leaders there will discuss the debate about whether the time has come to end the american military presence on okinawa the okinawans who have used the visit of the world leaders as a stage for demonstrating in favor of american withdrawal are protesting acts like a hitandrun incident involving an air force staff sergeant and the molestation of a 14yearold okinawan girl in which a marine was accused the japanese government , however , shows no interest in a removal of the americans , because japan s defenses are bolstered by the american base in the united states , however , the issue is most often framed as a debate between isolationists who want us to get out of asia and champions of maintaining our presence in okinawa as a sign of american resolve in that part of the world both have it wrong the united states can afford to pull its troops out of okinawa with no loss of our commitment to asian security in fact , america s position would be enhanced a decade after the fall of the soviet union , the challenges to america in asia are a chinese military buildup , the chinataiwan conflict and north korea yet in okinawa , 20 , 000 marines remain as a relic of the cold war supporters of the status quo argue that the marines on okinawa could help move supplies in the event of a war in korea or taiwan and that they provide ready reinforcements for possible rapid deployment to other regions , like the persian gulf the clinton administration codified this consensus in the 1995 nye report , when it declared that america would keep a minimum of 100 , 000 troops in asia until at least 2015 , explicitly including the 20 , 000 on okinawa in that total the truth is that the united states can not only retain but improve upon these goals by removing its forces from okinawa over the past decade the pentagon has been moving toward a new strategy based on getting american troops to global hot spots by sea and air , a strategy known as maritime prepositioning force international seas offer complete and expeditious freedom of movement , and the marines already have the equivalent of a division stationed on ships around the globe the navy is also working to improve the replenishment of ships already at sea with missiles , cannon rounds , bullets and fuel the marines in okinawa might be redeployed to bolster this strategy there are disadvantages , after all , in keeping them where they are okinawa is what is known as an unaccompanied tour , which means the marines cannot bring their wives the small okinawa base also has no room for largescale battle training more fundamentally , as the military expert paul bracken points out in his recent book , fire in the east , maintaining a string of bases in asia has rendered the american military dangerously vulnerable to chemical and ballistic missile attacks the united states , he says , needs to restructure the military to allow it to operate at greater distances from home and become less reliant on vulnerable forward bases one step would be to shift the basing of fleets so that destroyers can remain permanently stationed in the pacific rather than trundling to and from the west coast facilities in japan are already being built up , guam could be expanded , and most intriguingly , vietnam might be willing to consider leasing cam ranh bay back to the united states , especially as it fears growing chinese military strength in an era of tight military budgets and limited manpower , such measures would improve the speed with which american firepower can reach asia , and they would have none of okinawa s drawbacks
trenton , sept 12 while jon s corzine is blanketing new jersey with sunny television commercials promoting his fiscal discipline and his faith in the american dream , his republican opponent in the race for the united states senate , representative bob franks , has zeroed in on mr corzine s finances and his apparent lack of forthrightness as inviting targets for what is becoming a sharply focused line of attack in the last week , mr corzine has had to admit that he misstated his voting record and concede that he was unaware that a trailerpark company he had invested in had raised rents for poor tenants by nearly 30 percent and evicted others mr corzine , who spent 35 million of his 400 million fortune during the primary campaign , has had to continue to defend his refusal to release his personal tax returns , saying again that he is handcuffed by a confidentiality agreement with goldman , sachs company , the investment bank he headed until last year and he has had to explain why he postponed , until after the election , filing a report listing the groups that received the millions of dollars his private foundation gave out in 1999 mr corzine , who is spending 12 million this week for tv ads describing his stands on gun control , health care and education , shrugs off these recent stumbles and says mr franks is focusing on them to divert attention from his record but mr franks , who still has little money to spend for his own commercials , has nonetheless begun to get attention by portraying mr corzine s missteps as part of a larger pattern of hiding and buying concealing information that might reflect poorly on mr corzine while trying to buy the election with a largely televised campaign we are two months from this year s election , and some very disturbing questions still surround this man , said mr franks s spokesman , charlie smith his willingness to say anything at any given time , and his steadfast refusal to release what is essentially the funding behind his recordsetting campaign , starkly raise the credibility question political analysts said mr franks was right to call attention to mr corzine s wealth since part of the electorate nearly a third , in one recent poll is troubled by how much his campaign is spending none of this stuff disqualifies corzine from office , said david p rebovich , a political science professor at rider university but the effect can be cumulative if the franks campaign can draw a more detailed picture of corzine as wealthy , out of touch and unable to handle questions in a public setting , then franks can get some mileage and score some points because the way bob franks wins votes is by putting a wedge between corzine and the average voter mr franks runs the risk , of course , that mr corzine will be provoked into turning his television howitzers against his opponent sooner rather than later in the campaign but for now , at least , mr corzine is giving mr franks plenty of smallarms ammunition last wednesday , what should have been a coup for mr corzine , his endorsement by the new jersey chapter of the sierra club , became an embarrassment when reporters , prompted by mr franks s aides , asked mr corzine why he had not voted for the state s 1998 openspace bond issue , mr corzine said that , in fact , he had in fact , he had not , as his spokesman acknowledged hours later the episode gave mr franks a chance both to question mr corzine s veracity and to remind voters that mr corzine had missed 17 primary elections and 5 general elections since 1975 as if that were not enough , mr corzine s private philanthropy , the jon and joanne corzine foundation , owes the internal revenue service a separate tax return , for the year ended jan 31 for months , mr corzine has denied suggestions that he used the foundation to buy community support for his senate campaign and its tax return would list all its gifts but on monday , mr corzine filed for a second extension of the deadline for the foundation s return , until dec 15 the franks campaign immediately questioned the need for a delay until after election day tom shea , mr corzine s spokesman , said mr corzine asked for the extension because the foundation gave much more away than in prior years and because he had hired a new accountant
springfield , ill , jan 31 citing a shameful record of convicting innocent people and putting them on death row , gov george ryan of illinois today halted all executions in the state , the first such moratorium in the nation governor ryan , a moderate republican who supports the death penalty but questions its administration , noted that 13 men had been sentenced to death in illinois since 1977 for crimes they did not commit , before ultimately being exonerated and freed by the courts i cannot support a system , which , in its administration , has proven so fraught with error , he said , and has come so close to the ultimate nightmare , the state s taking of innocent life the move was hailed by opponents of the death penalty , who said mistaken convictions like those discovered in illinois were common throughout the nation since 1973 , 85 people have been found to be innocent and released from death row the nebraska legislature passed a moratorium on executions last year , citing concerns of racial disparity in sentencing , but the governor vetoed it bills that would halt executions are pending in 12 states in oregon , an antideathpenalty group led by mark hatfield , a former republican senator and governor , hopes to put a measure on the ballot that would eliminate executions and instead provide for sentences of life without parole more than 600 inmates have been put to death since 1977 , when the supreme court allowed the reinstatement of the death penalty the death penalty is on the lawbooks in 38 states , and polls show that a strong majority of americans favor it the midwest has traditionally been a center of opposition to the death penalty it is not allowed in iowa , michigan , minnesota , north dakota or wisconsin in illinois , about 150 inmates are on death row none had an execution date governor ryan s announcement of a moratorium met with little public criticism here , a measure of how public outrage over the wrongful convictions has changed the political landscape on the issue in this state until i can be sure that everyone sentenced to death in illinois is truly guilty , until i can be sure with moral certainty that no innocent man or woman is facing a lethal injection , no one will meet that fate , the governor said mr ryan resisted calls for a moratorium last year , but he said that continuing evidence of flaws in the system , including still more reversals of convictions , had persuaded him to impose a moratorium one of the leading voices for a moratorium has been that of mayor richard m daley of chicago , who , while he was cook county state s attorney in the 1980 s , prosecuted some of the death penalty cases that were later overturned mayor daley now contends that prosecutors did nothing improper in these cases but that defense lawyers were often poorly financed and sometimes incompetent in nine of the reversed illinois cases , students and professors at northwestern university unearthed pivotal evidence that freed the men from death row lawrence marshall , a law professor at northwestern who is director of the center for wrongful convictions at the university , said that the mistakes unearthed in illinois surely existed in other states this should not be seen as an illinois problem , professor marshall said what happened here is that we got lucky in the first few cases , and found the evidence after that , people were more willing to take a second look at other cases the willingness in illinois to examine such cases , the professor said , means that letters from inmates protesting innocence are not ignored the political climate has changed here , he said there has been an astonishing recognition that innocent people are being sent to death row so now people are reexamining cases in illinois that would not be reexamined in other states while illinois seems to have become a center of debate over the death penalty , the issue is gaining resonance around the nation , after many years in which it was seen as essentially a dead letter in american politics besides the halt on executions here , and the vetoed moratorium in nebraska , the death penalty has been the focus of intense scrutiny in florida and other states last year , in a visit to the united states , pope john paul ii called on roman catholics to oppose the death penalty and a new movie , hurricane , examines the life of a man , rubin carter , who was sent to death row for a crime he did not commit people are starting to raise more concerns about the death penalty , said steven hawkins , the executive director of the national coalition to abolish the death penalty it s becoming obvious that mistakes can be made , and innocent people can be sent to death row while the wrongful convictions in illinois have generated intense scrutiny and debate , florida has had 18 death row cases reversed , the most of any state governor ryan , who said he would appoint a panel to study death penalty sentences , heads the illinois campaign for gov george w bush of texas , the state that executes more people than any other i believe that a public dialogue must begin on the question of fairness of the application of the death penalty in illinois , mr ryan said in about a year as governor , mr ryan has taken some actions that have put him at odds with conservatives in his party he has called for strict gun control , expressed support for the civil rights of gays and traveled to cuba and met with fidel castro some suburban and downstate lawmakers complain that mr ryan has maintained too cozy a political relationship with mayor daley , a democrat mr ryan has lately been beleaguered by an investigation into a bribery scandal at driver s license bureaus that occurred during his watch as the illinois secretary of state while mr ryan has not been charged with wrongdoing , one of his top aides is expected to be indicted seventeen people have pleaded guilty to taking bribes to fix driver s license exams , and some of the money went to mr ryan s campaign since 1977 , illinois has executed 12 inmates , the most recent in march 1999 , the lethal injection of andrew kokoraleis , a suburban chicago man who had been convicted of an especially grisly murder the cook county state s attorney s office has instituted special internal reviews for all cases that would be eligible for the death penalty the prosecutor s office , which is headed by richard devine , a democrat , has not called for an execution date since april 1998 david erickson , the first assistant state s attorney , said the governor s moratorium was appropriate the easy thing would have been to fingerpoint , and the governor did not do that , mr erickson said if something has fallen apart here , it is a systemic problem

washington , feb 1 internet health sites collect some of the most personal information about their users , but few follow their own declared policies about maintaining the privacy of that data , according to a survey made public today the survey , by the california healthcare foundation , found that 19 of the top 21 health sites had privacy policies but that most failed to live up to promises not to share information with third parties and none of the sites followed guidelines like those recommended by the federal trade commission on collection and use of personal data the survey comes as policy makers are more closely scrutinizing the privacy practices of web sites to determine whether new laws are needed to regulate online marketers privacy advocates immediately cited the findings as proof that the internet industry had failed in its efforts to police itself this is about the 7 , 000th piece of conclusive evidence that selfregulation is not working , said jason catlett , founder of the junkbusters corporation , a company that helps people protect their privacy online the study s authors were less judgmental , comparing the online health industry to an awkward adolescent richard m smith , an internet security analyst , and janlori goldman , director of the project , said health sites were well aware that consumers expected the information they supplied to be confidential they said they believed that many sites were unaware that third parties could gain access to the information they were collecting the main reason for the privacy violations , mr smith said , is the use of socalled cookies , which track consumers' movements on the internet , and other advanced technology that delivers advertising to web pages and can pick up information entered by users on pages where the advertisements are displayed the combination allows advertisers to build detailed profiles of consumers for example , mr smith said a site promising not to share its users' names , addresses or other information had contracted with a company to administer a health assessment test on the site , providing that company with access to the data mr catlett said it was plausible that many sites were unknowingly violating their own privacy policies a lot of these sites are being set up in great haste , and often without sufficient knowledge or attention to the leakage that takes place with online advertising , mr catlett said although privacy advocates for years have been calling on congress to pass a law setting standards for internet sites to follow when collecting personal information , the clinton administration and the federal trade commission have sided with the industry in its call for a chance to prove that marketers and online merchants can police themselves

a year ago , a scooter was probably a clunky , red steel icon from a bygone era by last spring , though , streets , sidewalks and parks across the country suddenly teemed with adults and children whizzing along on sleek , aluminum scooters with brightly colored rubber wheels retailers seized on the craze , and scooters went on sale in sports equipment and department stores , toy and gift stores , catalogs and then even drug stores , minimarts and coffee bars under names like razor , oxygen , stinger , street glide , kickin' mini and rush rider the razor started the trend , and last week the company that sells that brand announced that it now owns a patent for its brake design with that in hand , razor usa immediately filed a lawsuit charging 16 competitors with infringement the president of razor usa , carlton calvin , says dozens of companies copied the razor design in a rush to exploit the fad the patent is on the brake , and the reason it is important is because the people who came to market so quickly after we became popular did n't have time to design their own product , mr calvin explained last week none of the companies had yet responded to the suit , which was filed on thursday in california and demands that the defendants stop manufacturing or selling the scooters , mr calvin said his company had not yet decided whether it would license the patent to anyone else this is just the beginning , mr calvin said there may be as many as 50 other infringers we tried to go after the infringers we felt were the most significant , but as we track others down , we 'll try to stop them , too the intellectual property world has changed greatly in recent years , with intellectual property increasingly valued as intangible wealth , with the importance of software and computer patents to the new economy , and amid controversies over businessmethod and biotechnology patents but the scooter phenomenon is a reminder that an inventor with a good idea that captures the public s fancy can claim tremendous profits with a conventional patent for a simple mechanical device razor usa represents the jd corporation , the taiwanese company that manufactures the scooters it makes three models , and new versions are planned for next year mr calvin estimated that about eight million of the collapsible , lightweight scooters have been sold since last november , and he said five million razor scooters will have been sold by the end of this year as with any consumer frenzy , the scooter fad might fizzle as quickly as it erupted mr calvin said he believes that using a patent infringement lawsuit to shut down competitors will help prolong the popularity of the scooters one thing that hurts the perception of the scooter as a serious product is if you go to your video store or neighborhood deli and can buy your scooter there , he explained and that s where a lot of the infringers are going we do n't think the popularity is going to die , he added there were 28 million active participants in inline skating last year that s 28 million pairs of skates only seven or eight million scooters have been sold , and it s easier than inline skating hopefully , new products and enforcing the intellectual property will keep the market alive for longer a motorless scooter usually has two wheels and none of the gear or chain mechanisms found on a bicycle instead , a rider propels it by pushing with a foot hence the name kick scooter the modern aluminum model can be used like a skateboard , for jumping and performing stunts and trick landings patents for scooters with two wheels date to the 1920 s in july of 1999 , a california inventor name juan banda won patent 5 , 927 , 733 for a folding , portable , nonmotorized twowheel scooter mr banda s design uses a foot brake , too , but with a mechanical assembly that differs from the razor design his patent is cited in the patent that now belongs to razor usa , meaning the patent examiner who approved the latter found it to be different from mr banda s design the importers and distributors named in the razor usa lawsuit are k2 , genx sports , asa products , the children s place retail stores , hl usa , kash 'n' gold , rapid suspension technology usa , sun rams products , titan , todo dollar wholesale , variflex , wysco , yunn haaur enterprises , z scooter , and zenital the patent on which the lawsuit is based is 6 , 139 , 035 and was issued to shuite tsai , a taiwanese inventor , who assigned it to razor usa if scooters do continue to be popular , other inventors may earn a piece of the market with variations on the theme steven patmont , who lives in pleasanton , calif , invented an allterrain scooter his design includes enlarged wheels that can roll on off road conditions like dirt , grass , trails or fields the scooter would be sold with the some assembly required caveat , since the larger wheels must be shipped alongside the scooter to reduce the size of packaging the consumer would attach them with bolts mr patmont received patent 6 , 012 , 539 robert brock , who lives in anchorage , last month won a patent for a scooter with a tow bar extending from its front a tow rope can be fastened to the bar and attached in turn to one or more dogs the tow bar is low enough on the frame to ensure that the scooter will remain upright and stable while being pulled though he calls his invention a dog training and exercising device , mr brock also suggests that the scooter chassis can be lengthened \( with more wheels added \) to carry loads , just like a dog sled he received patent 6 , 135 , 059
a quarter century ago , the old order passed on wall street a new system forced price competition where there had been none , and that soon changed the financial landscape in ways no one had expected something very similar will begin next week the change on may day 1975 was the end of fixed commissions suddenly , brokerage firms could seek business by offering to charge less on stock trades commissions on institutional orders collapsed far faster than wall street expected some brokerage firms were forced out of business discount brokers appeared , and big blocks of stock traded as never before on monday , the new york stock exchange and the american stock exchange will begin trading a total of 13 stocks in dollars and cents , rather than using fractions sometime next year , all stocks will be traded that way that change , in itself , is unimportant whether a price is quoted as a quarter or as 25 cents is irrelevant what is important is that arbitrary limits on price competition are vanishing in 1997 , the smallest change in price on the big board was cut in half , to onesixteenth of a dollar , or 625 cents now it will go to a penny wall street hopes that will bring a gradual reduction in spreads , the difference between the best price offered to buy a stock and the best price offered to sell it bernard l madoff , the chairman of a firm that bears his name , says that for the largest 600 stocks , the spread now averages 10 cents a share he thinks that will come down to a range of 5 to 7 cents and forecasts that additional volume will preserve brokerage firms' profits unfortunately for wall street , these changes have a way of arriving at inopportune times in 1975 , the market had just ended a severe bear market , and the public had lost interest in stocks so , wall street was confronted with shrinking profit margins when it could least afford them now , profits are high but the internet has opened up new ways to trade stocks and set off intense competition among different markets that competition makes it likely that spreads at least for the most active stocks will sink more than many brokerage firms would like the options markets , where competition is less cutthroat , have adopted rules to limit price changes to a nickel on many options and a dime on others but efforts to arrange such civilized competition among stock markets fizzled such efforts will continue , and the securities and exchange commission will have to watch closely to make sure that rules do not inhibit price competition but if the sec is vigilant , the world will change michael labranche , the chief executive of labranche company , a leading big board specialist firm , forecasts that exchanges and market makers that pay brokerage firms for sending orders to them will have to pay less that will put pressures on profits of internet brokers that charge low commissions and make their money from such payments wall street fears that a surge in message traffic will strain computer systems but once the computer power is in place , trading methods will change the role of limit orders in which an investor sets the price at which he or she will trade could expand since it will almost always be possible to seek a price between the posted prices none of this will be immediate , in part because the stocks that go decimal next week are not among the most active ones but big changes will come , and the wall street that emerges will be very different from the current one graph tracks average spread between bid and ask prices in the nasdaq 100 since 1992
trenton , june 29 hoping to spare the lives of newborn babies whose mothers are too desperate to care for them , the new jersey state senate gave final legislative approval today to a bill that would allow parents to abandon an infant at a hospital or police station without facing criminal penalties the socalled safe haven bill , which was passed by the assembly on monday , will change the state s legal code , which currently treats the abandonment of any child as a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison gov christine todd whitman is expected to sign the bill into law , said jayne o'connor , a spokeswoman for the governor texas became the first state to enact a safe haven law last year legislatures in 11 other states , including new york , have approved similar measures this year one of the trenton bill s sponsors , senator gerald cardinale , said he thought such legislation could have prevented several recent incidents in which new jersey infants died after their parents abandoned them so far this year , five infants have been abandoned in new jersey , one of whom died in 1996 , a teenage couple , amy s grossberg and brian c peterson , made national headlines when they threw their newborn son into a trash bin outside a motel in delaware , killing the child women who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy will know that if they carry the baby to term , they can surrender custody of the baby without having to go through all sorts of legal hoops , said mr cardinale , a republican of bergen county they wo n't have to reveal who the father is they wo n't have a social worker trying to change their mind and they wo n't have to involve their parents or relatives in the decisionmaking process some child advocates contend that statesanctioned dropoff centers for infants could hinder the process of placing abandoned newborns in adoptive homes by complicating the legal child custody issues because an abandoned child has no identifiable guardian nina williamsmbengue , a policy analyst for the national conference of state legislatures , said it was unclear whether the laws would work during the first four months the texas law was in effect , nine babies were abandoned across the state , none of them at a hospital or police station but supporters of the texas law said that the disappointing response resulted from their failure to publicize the new law and that they were now raising money to start a statewide advertising campaign new jersey s law will allocate 500 , 000 for a public awareness campaign and will establish a 24hour tollfree phone line to inform prospective parents about the law , said diane allen , a republican state senator from edgewater park
tokyo , jan 3 the park hyatt hotel here is a favorite watering hole of the wellheeled and is known for its fantastic views of the city and the marbled , meltinthemouth maezawa beef cooked to order just across the street in shinjuku chuo park , homeless people , more concentrated here than in most parts of the city , spend the day sipping from halfempty juice boxes and picking through the garbage discarded by children using the playground contrasts like these are rare in japan , which has long regarded itself as the world s most egalitarian industrialized nation but the gap between rich and poor japanese is widening , spurred by economic and social changes people are living longer and accumulating more wealth increasingly , pay is being set by performance rather than seniority women , once relegated to the home , are trooping to office jobs tax laws have been changed to let the the rich keep more of their money , and loopholes once exploited by the middle class are closing where once everyone seemed to be treated more or less the same , merchants and marketers are focusing on the affluent and it is paying off even during japan s prolonged recession mercedesbenz luxury cars are selling at a brisk pace while overall car sales have slumped private banking services offered to the wealthy are also proliferating for years , everyone s pay increased as they got older , said shoji hiraide , general manager of mitsukoshi s flagship department store branch in central tokyo , which has begun a campaign to woo the wealthy it made everyone think that we are all in the middle class but lifetime employment is crumbling and salaries are based more on merit and performance , he said in seven or eight years , japanese society will look much more like western society , with gaps between rich and poor that can be clearly seen increasing income stratification raises potentially troubling questions for japan , where sameness , or the perception of it , greatly contributes to the social harmony that is so prized here government officials concede privately that greater income disparity is inevitable as the economy becomes more competitive but they fear that differences between the rich and the poor will lead to more theft , petty crime in general and a host of other social problems already , job losses and other economic hardships have added to the ranks of the homeless politicians fear that a wider income gap could threaten the power of the liberal democratic party , which has governed japan virtually unchallenged since world war ii it s a really controversial issue in japan , said hiromitsu ishi , president of hitotsubashi university and a member of the prime minister s tax panel company owners and big company presidents are complaining about the tiny gap between their salaries and the salaries of new employees , but most japanese people like the notion of a notsouneven income distribution still , he said , a less egalitarian attitude is spreading because the average level of income has continued to increase in japan , extremely poor people do n't really exist much now although after the restructuring of the labor market , that may change , and with it tolerance thus he believes that the government s fears may be overblown , a sentiment shared by several economists and policy makers japan s income distribution has always been wider than policymakers were willing to admit forbes magazine s annual list of the world s wealthiest people features a fair share of japanese , who have become famous for spending large amounts of money on luxury goods , impressionist paintings and beachfront property in hawaii but for the last 30 years , about 90 percent of the people responding to surveys on income have said that they regard themselves as middle class being rich , or even welltodo , is rather unseemly here , and wealth is not flaunted people thought that income and wealth distribution in japan was equal , and maybe that was true 20 years ago , said toshiaki tachibanaki , an economics professor at kyoto university but i say that kind of myth should be abandoned japan has become a normal country the disparities that exist now are far less pronounced than they are in the united states and britain in the average big japanese company , the chief executive made 357 million yen , or roughly 350 , 000 , according to one estimate , while the labor ministry puts the average salaryman s pay at 55 million yen , or roughly 56 , 000 by comparison , total compensation in 1998 for chief executives at the 500 largest american companies averaged about 8 million , according to graef crystal , a compensation consultant and since world war ii , the japanese government has used one of the world s most progressive tax codes as a social leveler , so there was no point in striving to make more money the higher the remuneration , the more the government took away that , too , is changing , although the government is quick to point out that the leading factor behind japan s widening income disparity is aging income and wealth differences are generally more pronounced among the elderly , as some have saved and invested better than others japan increasingly has more older people as a percentage of its population than other developed countries , and it faces the growing problem of providing social security benefits for all of them as long as the major contribution to the rising income differential comes from the population aging , it is a function of aging , not a real rise in inequality resulting from government policy , said hiroko tada , an official at the economic planning agency who wrote a study confirming the widening income gap miss tada and her colleagues note , however , that research by private economists and academics suggests the phenomenon is driven by government policy as well as changes in the private sector they also insist that the changes are necessary if japan is ever to recover economic momentum

lightning on the sun by robert bingham 291 pp new york doubleday 2395 it can be as difficult to understand other people s addictions as it is to understand their obsessive love affairs if something is n't your object of desire , its appeal can remain obscure all you see is the tortured lover , endlessly reaching lightning on the sun is the first and last novel of robert bingham , a scion of the kentucky newspaper dynasty , who died of what appeared to be a heroin overdose last year at the age of 33 , six months after getting married and five months before the publication of this book he was also the author of a collection of short stories , pure slaughter value , published in 1997 while both books roam around various territories new york , love , cambodia , political strife , journalistic morality , the disorder and early sorrows of the freshly minted children of the upper class they are founded on a bedrock of addiction his illfated characters are forever being pulled downward by an uncontrollable force , more powerful than love or money , whose charm bingham wisely never really explicates it s just the thing , the shadow , a kind of bleak vocation to say that his great subject was addiction is not to take anything away from his accomplishment as a writer on the contrary , as an artist he was funny , mordant and quick his brand of black comedy is curiously tender , every line etching the painful , hilarious knowledge that this fickle chemical beloved is spectacularly not worth it bingham s heroes are fully aware of how foolish they look , spending their lives chasing junk in pure slaughter value , the staging of such knowledge is generally a local affair young upperclass men get drunk before weddings , hit their girlfriends , pick up women in rehab and occasionally od in wellappointed new jersey suburbs like the people in lois smith brady s vows column in the new york times gone to hell , these characters seem to delight in wreaking havoc on centuries of good breeding they waste themselves extravagantly in lightning on the sun , this metaphysic goes global asher , the main character , is a privileged young man who has drifted to cambodia for vaguely political reasons and stayed for the excellent heroin his fate is entwined with that of his old flame julie , a philosophicallyminded harvard graduate , sometime user , strip club bartender and sabertoothed sexpot , who muses on lines of blake while on her way to rip off drug dealers in harlem asher and julie , like a latterday mccabe and mrs miller , cook up a big , flawed scheme involving cash , fraud and heroin that neglects to take into account that cambodian drug lords can be slightly crueler than graduates of eastern private schools bingham unravels this folie deux lovingly but precisely despite all their advantages , these two wise guys never have a chance very late in the game , gaunt and halfruined but still believing he s on top , asher realizes , he was he was it was difficult to admit , but he was a drug dealer no , thought asher , i am a rugged individualist and merchant prince lightning on the sun cuts deepest when bingham lets his wicked sense of humor wield the knife a subplot involving a journalist pondering the ethics of his profession is never really believable cambodia is more expensive backdrop than truly engaged terrain but , paradoxically , bingham s writing is at its most alive when it is most nihilistic , when he lets the devils play in one extended sequence set in new york , two of the more minor characters are left to take the beatings for asher and julie s grand illusion being wellborn young men , however , they hide out in upper east side town houses , the racquet club and f a o schwarz in between games of court tennis and backgammon , with black eyes and swollen noses , they run for their lives , then repair to the oyster bar for martinis and new england clam chowder meanwhile , back in cambodia , asher and julie reminisce over dinner about their speed dealer and touch glasses at the serendipity of both of them being wanted i killed my boss , julie confides , and asher fondly replies , ouch then they decide to go to the beach in scenes like these , bingham elegantly inverts every horatio alger story ever told crime by crime , none of them committed for any good reason , he constructs for each character an antiresume they 're not even very good at being criminals against privilege , he asserts haplessness against conscience , a faintly ridiculous stupor in its way , it s wonderfully antiamerican as a writer , robert bingham will be missed good satirists are hard to find , and a true gift for darkness is rare the difference between art and addiction is that the latter has such a predictable narrative in how to stop time heroin from a to z , the former addict ann marlowe writes heroin is a counter in a shell game you play with yourself you smirk at the betrayal addiction when it finally arrives it was , after all , to be expected this is under her entry for love drawing \( danijel zezelj \)
mike hampton has maintained through the year that he will not address his future until after the mets' season is over after his mediocre outing last night , hampton did not want to contemplate that his season and perhaps his mets career could have ended so miserably i do n't think of it that way , said hampton , a potential free agent after the world series i think i'm going to get another start i think we 're good enough to win at least two games at home and come back here , and have a chance to pitch again because hampton was wild early and because he was unable to match an intimidating and dominant roger clemens , the mets fell to the yankees , 65 the yankees lead the fourofsevengame series by two games to none , so the mets must win at least two games at shea stadium to return to yankee stadium next saturday in his first world series game , hampton looked nothing like the masterful pitcher who dominated the cardinals twice in the national league championship series he allowed four runs on eight hits in six innings he walked five after walking a total of seven in his three previous starts this postseason fiftynine of his 124 pitches were balls now he hopes he can enter the offseason with at least a better start to remember i want to get out there bad , hampton said i hope i get another opportunity i think we can do it if we come out and play like we did tonight , be aggressive and battle our tails off like we did hampton hit david justice with a pitch in the sixth inning , but he never appeared to retaliate for clemens hitting mike piazza with a pitch in july or throwing a broken bat near piazza in the first inning last night i threw inside enough , hampton said i wanted to get into a comfort level and i wanted to get out there and get out into a groove i thought by the second inning i started feeling a lot better i started making pitches and working both sides of the plate but by then it was too late the way roger was pitching this was the overwhelmed hampton who walked nine batters on opening day in japan , the pitcher who struggled with his control and his confidence for the first month before becoming one of baseball s most dominant starters hampton then indicated that he had allowed himself to be overcome by the pressure of coming to a team looking for him to guide it to the world series he finally decided to be aggressive and won 18 of his last 26 decisions hampton lost his first postseason game before being voted the most valuable player of the nlcs his threehit shutout of the cardinals last monday sent the mets to the world series for the first time in 14 years hampton threw his arms into the sky as timo perez caught the last out of the game , aware he had accomplished his mandate hampton was a very different pitcher last night while clemens was throwing a broken bat in piazza s direction and otherwise stifling the mets , hampton was unable to stop the yankees' momentum from their 12inning victory on saturday clemens threw a firstpitch strike to the first 10 mets batters he faced before hitting edgardo alfonzo on the left biceps in the fourth inning hampton fell behind on 8 of the first 12 hitters he faced the yankees led by 30 before the mets even batted around hampton threw 76 pitches in the first three innings after retiring the first two batters in the bottom of the first , hampton threw nine straight balls justice and bernie williams each walked before the mets' pitching coach , dave wallace , approached the mound with a 10 count on tino martinez two pitches later , martinez sliced a 12 pitch to left field to score justice from second posada grounded a fullcount pitch up the middle to give the yankees a 20 lead , and the yankees had runners on second and third when jay payton dropped the ball as he was reaching into his glove for a throw reliever rick white began throwing in the bullpen could hampton s mets' career really end this way \? he struck out paul o'neill swinging to end the inning the mets trailed by only 20 but hampton never regained his control he allowed scott brosius s leadoff homer in the second and continually worked out of jams i'm not going to think of it as his last start , said al leiter , hampton s close friend on the team , who started game 1 i'm going to think of him being back out there next saturday i hope so that s our only chance
the date was jan 1 , 2000 , but the fickle computers in most of the 16 police precincts in queens did n't see it that way on saturday , criminal complaints printed out by new york police officers on an antiquated computer system listed the date of the crime as jan 1 , 1900 , instead of jan 1 , 2000 , said the queens district attorney s office , which first noticed the problem the forms also popped up with the inexplicable notation of jan 4 , 1980 , for the date the officers had signed the complaint the errors continued on a smaller scale sunday and yesterday , with some computers listing the crime dates as jan 2 and 3 , 1900 jack ryan , chief assistant district attorney in queens , said the problem was not serious because the flaws were quickly spotted , and police officers were instructed to correct the dates on complaints bound for the district attorney s office mr ryan estimated that 50 to 100 complaints with incorrect dates went to the district attorney s office in the last three days , but he said he believed none had gone on to court other than being off by 100 years , everything is fine , he said we 've survived worse some arraignments , however , were delayed slightly , he said mr ryan said he believed the problem was limited to queens because it is the only borough where the police use a program called caps , for complaint arrest processing system , to write up complaints after drafting a complaint , officers print it out and fax or deliver it by hand to the district attorney s office for approval most of the precincts in queens were affected at first , but by yesterday the problem had been confined to three precincts , said lt sean crowley , a police spokesman he said computer maintenance workers were trying to have the problem corrected by today still , the error continued to confound and confuse yesterday , when some complaints appeared with the correct date for officers' signatures but incorrect dates for the crimes last week , i was worried about flashlights , mr ryan said this is what i'm worried about today next week , who knows \?
john deutch was an effective and enlightened head of the central intelligence agency but his handling of classified information was sloppy , and he was stripped of his high security clearances last august , more than two years after he returned to a teaching post at mit now it is disturbing to learn that mr deutch s former colleagues at the cia may have tried to shield their former boss from an immediate and exacting investigation when they first learned of his misconduct mr deutch was a demanding director willing to examine past cia abuses and take corrective action that earned him enemies at the agency and may have influenced his decision to work with classified material at home , where colleagues could not see his critical notes and analyses but by placing these files on unsecure home computers , he left the information vulnerable to outside viewing mr deutch s conduct came to light as he was preparing to leave the top cia job at the end of 1996 when he sought permission to continue using the agencyowned computers in his home , cia security experts discovered the files and informed their superiors an internal inquiry was begun but , according to a report by the cia inspector general , that inquiry was slowed by the actions of top agency officials in particular , the report faulted michael o'neill , then the cia s general counsel , and nora slatkin , who was the agency s executive director both deny delaying the investigation , as does the cia s current chief , george tenet , who served as mr deutch s chief deputy before becoming his successor the cia has rightly set up a special panel to examine whether these and other top officials handled the investigation appropriately an independent review by the senate or house intelligence committee may be needed as well as far as can be determined , none of the data mr deutch moved to his personal computers were read by outsiders mr deutch has been appropriately punished by having his security clearances suspended still , any mishandling of classified national security information is a serious matter all such cases should be investigated rigorously and promptly , even when they involve former directors of central intelligence

as you like it is taken by the liars' club as an invitation from shakespeare rather than as a mere title , and the company interprets the invitation pretty broadly that s not a bad idea this is a hardy play , and turning it into a circus not only produces unexpected laughter but also reminds us of how infinitely subversive the playwright s imagination was this young company , which last year transformed romeo and juliet into a street fight spun out of control in the back lot of a lower east side car repair shop , has invaded west 42nd street for a few weeks , and it begins its as you like it with a whoop in an empty groundfloor commercial space a few steps west of sixth avenue , it has stacked seats on two sides of a performance space outlined by makeshift footlights once viewers are seated , the six actors , like a pack of tourists searching for excitement , burst into the place through the street door , one shouting to the others , an audience ! it never gets quieter than that until the last line rings out little more than an hour and a half later the 6 are listed in 13 roles actually they take many more , since most of the minor characters are folded here into a few drew cortese has it fairly easy being both dukes , the good and the bad , plus other people , since the dukes have only one common scene playing the determinedly innocent rustic sylvius is a tougher assignment , and he handles it very well lorenzo pisoni as the brothers , orlando and oliver , is in a tighter spot several times , and his efforts to get out of it are vastly entertaining , including a heated argument between the two that ends with mr pisoni in handtohand combat with himself until the noble brother decks the scheming one in a pair of spectacular backward somersaults teasing the audience about identity switches is all part of the fun in his boasting scene charles the wrestler is a leather mask handed off from actor to actor and speaking in various voices , but when he is in the ring with orlando , the wrestler is actually a woman , and the struggle becomes a fine spoof of ballet we always know when lethia nall is celia , daughter of the bad duke , because celia carries a complete tiny tea set with her everywhere that she unpacks daintily from a tiny wicker picnic case none of the actors depend entirely on a mere change of costume to signal a new role they have n't time for that anyway but when rosalind becomes the boy ganymede , angela goethals manages to stuff rosalind in her silk dress inside the short pants of a schoolboy so quickly that she certainly earns the appreciative gasp of the audience ms goethals brings much more to this character , however the exchanges between rosalind disguised as a boy and orlando practicing lovemaking have a poignancy that cuts right through all the high jinks of this troupe at times identities simply float among the actors , who help one another jump from role to role by snatching off caps , hats or wigs from their nearest neighbors one wig is essential the white head of orlando s old servant , adam molly ward , who is admirably restrained as both country women , audrey and phebe , is triumphant as adam it is n't the white hair alone that makes her appear the most bedraggled , beaten down , whimpering old adam i can recall inevitably this approach to the play now and then goes over the top johnny giacolone s pratfalls , when he is a touchstone with a few of the play s other yokels folded into him , are fine oldfashioned clowning but noticeably out of place here and you know for certain that when ganymede says , this is the forest of arden , some actor will spring in from the sidelines to sprinkle autumn leaves on the floor in a version so truncated some things are lost , most notably the songs but i am not sure i would trade amateur singing of ersatz elizabethan melodies for the exquisite mockery of the acting tradition realized when jaques \( again mr giacolone \) pleads with a whistling stuffed bird for more singing to feed his melancholy since in the sheer speed and robustness of this performance a good deal of the languorous personality of jaques is blown away , i would resent the loss of this intensely funny reminder of who he is in the original play as she did with romeo , erica schmidt , the director , stamps such a distinctive shape on this presentation and gives it such sharp rhythm that it feels much more like a goodhumored tribute to shakespeare than an invasion of him , especially since the actors speak with gratifying clarity and precision those lines that have n't been pruned as you like it by william shakespeare directed and designed by erica schmidt lighting by shelly sabel a liars' club production presented by chashama at 111 west 42nd street , manhattan with johnny giacalone \( touchstone and jaques \) , angela goethals \( rosalind \) , lethia nall \( celia and william \) , lorenzo pisoni \( orlando and oliver \) , drew cortese \( lebeau , the dukes and silvius \) and molly ward \( adam , audrey and phebe \) photo angela goethals and johnny giacalone in as you like it \( dixie sheridan as you like it \)
the usual questions about heaven are where is it \? how do you get there \? what s it like when you do \? some of the answers are provided in a substantial new anthology , the book of heaven \( oxford university , 30 \) , edited by philip zaleski and carol zaleski , who has also produced books on otherworld journeys \( answers to the second question \) and the life of the world to come \( third question \) \( philip s books include gifts of the spirit \) the zaleskis are cheerfully learned distinctly proheaven themselves , they wish everybody else were \( we neglect heaven at our peril \) but they claim that even skeptics will find pleasure in these accounts of it , especially if they savor the comic elements , here represented largely by satirical or jocular contributions from henry fielding , lord byron , rupert brooke and mark twain , none of which , if one may say so without falling into heresy , is particularly funny the pleasures of the anthology must be sought elsewhere heaven is usually regarded as a place and a happiness to be enjoyed in the future notions as to what it is like depend either on certain canonical but bewildering reports of it \( ezekiel , isaiah , revelation \) or on hints gathered during one s earthly life the most interesting of these are related to childhood heaven lies about us in our infancy , said wordsworth , in the course of lamenting that it soon ceased to do so the most exquisite recollections of heaven in infancy are probably those of the 17thcentury english poet thomas traherne in some prose meditations that were lost and turned up only a century ago , and it is one of the pleasures of this book that it includes extracts from them certainly adam in paradise had not more sweet and curious apprehensions of the world than i when i was a child i was a little stranger which at my entrance into the world was saluted and surrounded with innumerable joys \( i would recommend anybody who does not know it to listen to gerald finzi s exquisite setting of these words in his cantata dies natalis \) contemporary with traherne , the welsh poet henry vaughan recalled childhood \( our angelinfancy \) as an age when we still have fading memories of the heaven from which we came , and can still feel through all this fleshly dress bright shoots of everlastingness these memories are always accompanied by a sense of loss , but for some they give a true image of heaven since it is difficult to think of heaven merely as a placeless state of being , earthly cities are often conscripted to provide an image of it jerusalem is the favorite , but there are others it used to be said that good americans , when they died , went to paris venice is sometimes preferred , though venice somehow has an inseparable sinister side witness proust and thomas mann most people prefer a heaven with no flipside hell mythical lands like cockaigne , vulgar versions of grander imaginings , occur in many cultures in cockaigne the rivers run with wine , the hills are made of sugar candy and there are no lawyers heaven is a glorious carnival , exactly as you like it yet one man s heaven can be another man s hell few would enjoy the valhalla of the norse heroes the men do nothing all day except fight and drink , starting at breakfast what the women do is obscure presumably they serve drinks , tend wounds and cook heaven , according to the sukhavativyuha sutra , my knowledge of which is limited to what i learned from the zaleskis' book , would surely be distressing to anybody with a tendency to photophobia or migraine from every flower issue thirtysix hundred thousand million rays of light , and from each ray thirtysix hundred thousand million buddhas and that is by no means all the illumination a dazzling company to encounter as one emerges from the dark one obvious source of information about heaven is spiritualism , but the news , as it is given here , is not encouraging there is a dismal narrative by sir arthur conan doyle of a seance during which the newly dead , with their understandable tendency to get lost and confused , are helped to find their way in the other world robert hare , a 19thcentury american chemist , summons a convocation of defunct worthies to answer questions about the afterlife among those who respond to his call are george and martha washington , john quincy adams , benjamin franklin , isaac newton and lord byron hare s questions are loaded with information he has had from other contacts the august witnesses agree with everything he says they certify that in those regions there are mountains , plains , rivers , lakes , brooks , rills , trees , flowers , birds , beasts and every attribute of the most admired portions of this lower sphere the arts of poetry and music flourish , and the pleasures of social intercourse are more highly enjoyed than upon earth hare can claim to be right about everything , including , of course , chemistry he got the heaven he wanted everything depends on the individual taste the bestselling novelists elizabeth stuart phelps and marie corelli describe a bestselling novelist s heaven , on the whole rather insipid , though phelps , with a show of spirit , objects to the hymn that presents heaven as a place where congregations ne'er break up , and sabbaths have no end , while approving of other verses from the same hymn that assert that there is no hunger , heat , nor cold , but pleasure every way
ben tillman and the reconstruction of white supremacy by stephen kantrowitz illustrated 422 pp chapel hill the university of north carolina press cloth , 4995 paper , 1995 benjamin ryan tillman came of age in 1876 , stephen kantrowitz writes in this thoughtful biography as the commander of edgefield county s sweetwater sabre club , a paramilitary unit dedicated to terrorizing republican officeholders and restoring white rule in south carolina , the 29yearold tillman , with his redshirted troopers , participated in the hamburg riot on july 8 , an occasion marked by the coldblooded murder of a number of black militiamen who had had the effrontery to conduct a celebratory parade through the mostly black town of hamburg , sc , four days earlier on the fourth of july as tillman himself would later put it , the leading white men of edgefield had decided to seize the first opportunity that the negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach the negroes a lesson by having the whites demonstrate their superiority by killing as many of them as was justifiable none of the perpetrators of the hamburg murders were ever brought to justice tillman s role in the hamburg riot established him as a leader of men in that time and that place his involvement , about which he boasted constantly in future years , was the cornerstone upon which he would build a remarkable political career , first as governor of south carolina and then , for 24 years , as a united states senator how could these executionstyle murders of 1876 serve as the springboard for such extraordinary political advancement and a legacy of racism that would keep tillman s name alive as pitchfork ben well into the 20th century \? the explanation lies , kantrowitz believes , in the determination of white men in the postcivil war south to reclaim what they had lost through emancipation and the experience of reconstruction their sense of independent , unfettered manhood tillman sought to transform the slogan 'white supremacy' into a description of social reality , reconstructing white male authority in every sphere from the individual household to national politics , kantrowitz , who teaches american history at the university of wisconsin , madison , writes tillman s constituents responded to his leadership because they too believed that the end of slavery and the enfranchising of blacks had set loose a threat to white society that had to be checked by whatever means necessary it took a man like tillman an ideologue , an organizer and a terrorist to give voice to their fears and to translate their determination into physical and political action tillman proved to be a master at pillorying his wellbred political opponents white negroes , he called them , or effete urban dudes produced by aristocratic institutions of higher learning like the citadel or the university of south carolina when it came to reforms that might actually help to relieve the farmer s economic plight , however , tillman offered precious little an agricultural college for white men \( clemson \) , a new school for white women \( winthrop college \) and a staterun dispensary system to regulate liquor sales almost everything else he proposed had a single goal the suppression of the state s black population to a position of permanent inferiority in 1892 , a group of tillman s supporters in abbeville , sc , prepared a banner anointing the governor the champion of white men s rule and woman s virtue earlier that year , tillman had coupled a statement opposing lynching with a declaration that he would willingly lead a mob in lynching a negro who had committed an assault upon a white woman his lynching pledge , as this promise became known , was never personally carried out , but it reveals a great deal about tillman s rhetorical and political strategy the black man , in tillman s words , must remain subordinate or be exterminated an epidemic of mob killings broke out in south carolina in the 1890 s , and in the upcountry counties of abbeville , edgefield , laurens and newberry , lynchings outnumbered legal executions during that decade when tillman went to washington , his message went with him now known as pitchfork ben in 1892 he had threatened to stick a pitchfork in that bag of beef grover cleveland tillman became the resident wild man of the senate his record was a model of negative consistency he opposed woman suffrage \( the vote would rub the bloom off of the peach , he said \) he opposed american overseas expansion \( building an empire comprising nonwhite peoples he looked upon as a form of insanity \) and he opposed any exercise of federal authority that would allow the national government to intrude in a state s domestic affairs this ensured his opposition to any measure that might actually provide some economic relief for the farmers back home tillman also became a star on the national lecture circuit his lecture on the race problem was by far the most popular , aiming to preach the gospel of white supremacy straight from the shoulder , and preach he did , year after year , from one end of the country to the other he offered up a witches' brew of bareknuckled , noholdsbarred racism and earned a handsome annual income from these performances when the 70yearold tillman died in 1918 , he left behind a political legacy almost totally devoid of positive achievement but , kantrowitz reminds us , he left a powerful and tenacious legacy of another sort in south carolina , tillman and his political allies fatally undermined the possibility of the development of a raceneutral language of manhood and citizenship the consequences of this perversion of democratic doctrine would burden the south deep into the 20th century tillman s true legacy lives on wherever americans continue to shore up the battered foundations of white supremacy , kantrowitz notes at the end of this thoroughly researched , brilliantly argued book it lives on wherever dissent is met with violence , wherever white men are the only firstclass citizens , wherever 'populism' is reduced to what one contemporary called tillman s 'gospel of discontent' ben tillman and the reconstruction of white supremacy is a rich and insightful dissection of the rise of american racism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries kantrowitz has given us the best study we have of benjamin tillman , but he has also given us a way to understand how racism took hold in the postcivil war south and gradually spread its tentacles to the rest of the country white supremacy was hard work , he observes , and no one worked harder at it than pitchfork ben tillman

paris , july 23 lance armstrong made it official today , winning his second consecutive tour de france as easily as he did his first this victory pleased him more , he said , since he viewed it as confirmation of his talent , proof that the first triumph was not a fluke , as he thought was implied by some rivals who were absent then everybody s here , the critical ones were here , armstrong said today before the last of 21 daily stages everybody was on the start line july 1 , when the 87th tour began i did n't answer their criticism last year , but i heard it , thought about it , he said if i did answer it , i answered it simply , subtly i said 'they 'll see we 'll see' channeling his anger , armstrong , the 28yearold leader of the us postal service team , crushed his rivals in the first major individual test on july 10 , the hautacam climb in the pyrenees it was fullon , armstrong says now , fullon aggression and he remained virtually untouchable thereafter in a 6minute2second victory as lucid and inevitable as a bach suite today , the traditional mass sprint that closes the race was won by stefano zanini , an italian with the mapei team , who is usually the pacesetter for mapei s top sprinter , tom steels but steels dropped out of the tour two weeks ago after scoring two victories , so zanini was free to ride for himself today he finished half a wheel ahead of erik zabel , a german with telekom , who ended a threeyear victory drought on saturday third was roman vainsteins , a latvian with vini caldirola they and nearly all the rest of the 128man field finished the 87mile 21st stage in 3 hours 12 minutes 36 seconds robbie mcewen , an australian with farm frites , who won in paris last year , was eighth this time armstrong rode serenely in the pack to record his second successive tour victory , the second american to repeat as champion since greg lemond won the race in 1989 and 1990 armstrong saw the sights of paris on his way to the top step on the victory podium there was the eiffel tower as the starting point for the first time , followed by such tourist spots as the louvre , the place de la bastille , the new opera , the hotel de ville , or city hall , and finally 12 passages along the broad champselysees surrounded by his teammates and easy to notice because of his yellow jersey as the race s leader , armstrong crossed the final line in a discreet 76th place he finished the 3 , 660kilometer \( 2 , 774mile \) race , generally considered the toughest endurance event in sports , in a total of 92 33 08 so armstrong remains no 1 , four years after a diagnosis of testicular cancer , which had spread to his abdomen , lungs and brain and which needed three months of chemotherapy and a year off from the sport to arrest like his first victory , this one was marked by panache , the flair that bernard hinault , five times a winner of the tour , has described as the cherry on top of the cake last year , armstrong won a long time trial and the first stage in the alps back to back this year , he generously allowed a major foe , marco pantani of italy , to pass him at the finish line for victory in the climb of mont ventoux the gesture worked out badly the italian climber , whom armstrong regards as one of those absentees from last year who did not respect his victory , said after the ventoux climb that he did not need any help to win and that indeed he had received none i regret mont ventoux , armstrong said saturday i felt i was the strongest rider there , but i also respected him then and thought he deserved the honor of winning a monument i still respect him as an athlete , a rider , a climber he s the best but if i'm in a position to give a gift next time , he ai n't getting it that was spoken like a patron , as the riders call the dominant rider who sets down the informal rules of the race armstrong rejects the role there has n't been a patron in years , he said the last one was hinault racing has changed hinault retired in 1986 yet armstrong , a texan , is in the classic mold of the patron he intimidates his opponents with his supple power in the mountains and the time trials , convincing them that their attacks will not succeed so why try \? his physical superiority was evident throughout this tour except on the last of three days in the alps , and there he lost only two minutes of his sevenandahalfminute lead he dominated , he said , over a course that did not please him last year s course was almost perfect for me not a lot of climbing relatively , two long time trials good time trials for me , in metz , rolling hills , perfect , armstrong said but this tour de france , it s almost as if they designed it for other guys lots of climbing , one time trial , and the time trial in jan s hometown he was referring to jan ullrich , the german leader of the telekom team , who finished second over all mentally , it was less stressful for me this year , armstrong said physically , it was more stressful it was a harder tour , harder for me , more mountains not that he has any complaints now asked if he could remember disappointments in the threeweek race , armstrong thought long and hard the team time trial , he finally said i thought we could win the team time trial the us postal service finished second among the 20 teams , not really much of a disappointment to anybody but armstrong i'm a virgo , he said always looking for perfection photo lance armstrong , yellow jersey , and us postal service team yesterday in paris \( agence francepresse \)
paris , jan 31 the european union warned today that its 14 other members would diplomatically isolate austria if its antiimmigrant freedom party led by jorg haider enters a coalition government the statement , issued in portugal , said the other members of the european union will not promote or accept any bilateral official contacts at a political level with any austrian government that included mr haider s party portugal now holds the european union s presidency austrian candidates for posts in international organizations would find no support , it said , and austrian ambassadors will only be received at a technical level it said that the portuguese prime minister and the minister of foreign affairs had already informed the austrian authorities that there would be no business as usual in the bilateral relations with a government integrating mr haider s party prime minister antonio guterres of portugal justified the action we had to send a very clear signal that behavior of a racist or xenophobic character will not be tolerated within the european union , he told portuguese television it was the first time the union has issued such a warning to a member state austrians were shocked , and a diplomatic crisis seems inevitable i find it strange if the 14 eu states were to come to such a decision without consultations with the member state austria , the associated press quoted foreign minister wolfgang schussel as saying , adding that he appeared caught offguard and was trying to make contact with his portuguese counterpart mr haider s own reaction , reuters said , was that if the president and other parties bowed to foreign pressure , then we might as well abolish democracy in this country straight away since it became clear last week that mr haider had a chance of being in government , the european news media have been full of articles implying that nazism is on the rise in austria , a charge that many austrians vigorously reject and resent mr haider s party , which favors cutting off immigration to austria and preventing european union expansion because it is likely to bring more eastern europeans over austria s borders , came in second in the october elections , with 27 percent of the vote the party has grown from 5 percent when mr haider took over in 1986 , but political analysts say it is not entirely because of its stance on immigation instead , they say , the party s supporters are fed up with the cozy patronage relationship between the social democrats , in power for 30 years , and the people s party , which has governed jointly with them for the last 13 last week , the firstplace social democrats and the thirdplace people s party failed to revive their coalition so mr haider began negotiations with the people s party on forming a coalition with 104 seats in the 183seat legislature , squeezing out the social democrats israel immediately reiterated a threat made in october to cut off diplomatic relations other european countries , led by france and belgium , steadily ratcheted up their denunciations prominent austrians seemed dumbstruck today by the european announcement this is very , very , very , very strange , said alexander van der bellen , the leader of the green party , which came in fourth in october as an austrian , i feel terrible as head of the green party , i can only say that we wanted to block the participation of the freedom party in government , but still the threats , he said , would probably only make austrians more likely to snap back that no foreigners can tell us what to do , as was the case had when they elected kurt waldheim as president after he had been soundly condemned abroad for lying about the fact that he had been an officer in a german army unit that committed atrocities in yugoslavia during world war ii mr haider contends that the hostility is really panic by social democrats elsewhere europe and that even israel is reacting largely to the prospect of an ally being forced out of power france and belgium face thirdparty challenges , while christian democrats in france and germany are engulfed in scandals he also says his critics know almost nothing about him president jacques chirac of france , mr haider said this weekend , greeted me warmly at a state reception not long ago , and now suddenly he is against us the french foreign minister , hubert vedrine , gave a radio interview today in which he enumerated ways that a european country could be punished if it was found to have violated fundamental human rights he said that what we want is for them to give up on plans to let the freedom party into government but if they do n't , then austria will be under surveillance as no country has ever been in the european union , he said he also used the expression , europe is no longer in the 1930 s , as other diplomats have to remind listeners that hitler , an austrian , came to power in germany through the ballot box mr vedrine was apparently making the point that europe now has mechanisms to discipline countries in such circumstances
austin , tex , dec 13 george w bush spoke to the nation for the first time as presidentelect tonight , declaring that the nation must rise above a house divided after one of the closest and most disputed presidential elections in united states history speaking from the podium of the texas house of representatives , precisely 24 hours after the united state supreme court ended a fiveweeklong dispute by halting a recount of florida s disputed votes , and thus preserving mr bush s razorthin lead , the 54yearold governor devoted his entire speech to themes of reconciliation i was not elected to serve one party , but to serve one nation , mr bush said whether you voted for me or not , i will do my best to serve your interests , he said , and i will work to earn your respect transcript , page a24 a little more than an hour before , vice president al gore called mr bush to say he was withdrawing from the 17monthlong presidential race , and congratulated the texas governor , who was first elected to office here only six years ago , on being elected the 43rd president of the united states minutes later , in his own speech from his ceremonial office next door to the white house , mr gore said that while he disagreed with the court s ruling i offer my concession mr bush appeared by turns relaxed and slightly nervous , licking his upper lip as he looked around the large chamber , dominated by a huge christmas tree and filled with his supporters and staff i have a lot to be thankful for , he said in a speech that emphasized only common ground between democrats and republicans , and made only glancing references to the disputes that punctuated the campaign and its often bitter aftermath i am thankful for america , and thankful that we are able to resolve our electoral differences in a peaceful way the choice of locale for his speech underscored the theme the texas house is under democratic control mr bush used the moment to reiterate some of his campaign themes , talking of making all our public schools excellent , strengthening medicare and creating a prescription drug benefit for all of our seniors he talked of a broad , fair and fiscally responsible tax relief a phrase so vague that it could embrace many varieties of tax cuts and like mr gore an hour before him , talked of common ground during the fall campaign , we differed about details of these proposals but there was remarkable consensus about the important issues before us he spoke of serving every race and every background , aware that minorities voted overwhelmingly against him in last month s election it was not the kind of speech mr bush would have delivered had he won the large victory his aides were predicting on election night he offered nothing to the conservative wing of his party , and evoked none of the cultural issues that often divide the two parties mr bush is expected to travel to washington next tuesday , aides said , and meet both president clinton and vice president gore but his transition is already under way , and with tonight s concession by mr gore , mr bush will now have use of the 5 million transition budget and a large office blocks from the white house within days , he is expected to start naming his senior staff and cabinet members , probably starting with gen colin l powell as secretary of state though he briefly invoked the words of abraham lincoln at the opening of his speech , mr bush referred directly to only one of his predecessors , thomas jefferson , who took office in a disputed election in 1800 i will be guided by president jefferson s sense of purpose , he said , to stand for principle , to be reasonable in manner , and , above all , to do great good for the cause of freedom and harmony the presidency is more than an honor it is more than an office , he concluded it is a charge to keep the last phrase was also the title of a book he published at the beginning of the campaign to introduce himself to the american people mr bush s speech to the nation tonight was no ordinary victory address after weeks of legal maneuvering and two rapidfire decisions by the supreme court which effectively ended mr gore s hopes for a recount on tuesday night , mr bush had much more to accomplish tonight than declaring himself the victor on a typical election day a man who is at his most uncomfortable with formal addresses in formal settings was called on to give one that he knew would set the tone of his first term it was a night for perfect pitch and appropriate symbolism , chiefly the olive branch , one aide said his words were simple , his rhetoric not as lofty as the speech mr gore gave an hour before in discussions leading up to the drafting of the speech , aides said he had to be humble , while making it clear that other nations and his political opponents at home should not question his command of the office it is unclear whether he accomplished that goal his only reference to america s role in the world was a call for bipartisan foreign policy and a military equal to every challenge , and superior to every adversary
the voting on march 7 represents the closest this country has ever come to a national primary to choose the major parties' presidential candidates contests will be held in 16 states from coast to coast and in american samoa nearly a third of the 2 , 066 delegates to the republican convention and 4 , 338 delegates to the democratic convention are at stake chances are , when all of tuesday s votes are counted , it could be clear who will be nominated at both conventions in august most of the public attention and the candidates' resources have been devoted to california and new york , which together have 42 percent of the republican delegates to be chosen on tuesday and 46 percent of the democratic delegates but other large states , like ohio , georgia and massachusetts , are also voting and new england is holding what amounts to its own regional primary with contests in every state except new hampshire , which had the first primary on feb 1 the potential combinations are intriguing for instance , senator john mccain is the favorite in all five new england states that are voting and that together have 102 republican delegates , 1 more than new york if mr mccain wins most of the delegates in new england and new york , that could offset a victory by gov george w bush in california , which has 162 republican delegates on the other hand , mr bush could sweep georgia \( 54 delegates \) and missouri \( 35 \) and do well in caucuses in minnesota \( 34 \) , and that could balance losses in the east the situation is complicated by the republicans' voting rules in most of the states voting on tuesday , only a fraction of the delegates are allocated on the basis of who wins statewide , and most are awarded to the candidate who carries each congressional district as a result , in many states , mr bush and mr mccain are each likely to win some delegates , and it is possible they will be divided fairly equally on the democratic side , vice president al gore appears to have a clear lead over former senator bill bradley in every state voting on tuesday and while mr bradley may win some delegates in congressional districts , he may not win the majority of the delegates in any state in all states , democratic candidates are allotted delegates according to their proporton of the vote new york population 18 , 175 , 301 median income 37 , 394 voting rules party members only delegates 243 democratic 101 republican candidates have slates of delegates in the 31 congressional districts , 93 in all the three delegates with the most votes in each district win state party committee chooses eight atlarge delegates candidate visits bradley 27 , bush 6 , gore 26 , mccain 12 for a long time , most people in politics assumed they knew the contours of the new york primary there would be a huge fight on the democratic side , as mr gore faced a stiff challenge from mr bradley on the republican side there would be , well , nothing or almost nothing , as the state s republican machine once again ensured that its favored candidate , this time mr bush , had the primary ballot to himself what is actually happening is the reverse the republican party failed to keep mr mccain and alan keyes off the ballot this resulting fight the first competitive republican primary in new york since 1980 appears to ride on a few factors the first is a harsh attack directed at mr mccain by mr bush , in the form of mail and radio and television advertisements , that portray him as antinew york , against breast cancer research and antienvironment the second factor is the system delegates appear on the ballot , with the candidates' names in tiny type underneath unlike mr mccain s delegates , mr bush s tend to be elected officials , who are better known the third factor is mr mccain , whose campaign would seem particularly well suited to the state s moderate republican electorate by contrast , mr bradley s campaign has been barely perceptible what might prove most significant is what happened long before the vote mr gore s methodical campaign to nail down support from unions , democratic officials and constituency groups these are the people who get the vote out and they could make the difference in a presumably low democratic turnout connecticut population 3 , 274 , 069 median income 46 , 508 voting rules only party members can vote in primaries delegates 54 democratic , 25 republican , winner take all candidate visits bradley 4 , bush 2 , gore 2 , mccain 4 a poll published this week by zogby international shows mr mccain and mr bush in a statistical tie several factors stand in mr bush s favor strong support from the state s governor , john g rowland , who has overseen a statewide effort on mr bush s behalf , and family history president george bush , the candidate s father , was born and raised in greenwich , george w bush was born in new haven and attended yale university mr mccain s antiestablishment message has widespread appeal in connecticut , where 40 percent of the state s 19 million voters are independent but the senator is hindered by the state s voting rules , which bar independents from the primaries and prohibit crossover voting voters have until monday at noon to register in a party
medina , wash , july 23 dan mcdonald and stewart greenleaf , two veteran republican state legislators , share a special reason for confidence in their efforts to oust democratic incumbents from the united states house of representatives this fall for they are running in the two true swing house districts left in the united states , not districts that just look like juicy targets to the party on the outside , but districts that regularly switch from the control of one party to the other each of their districts washington s first , where mr mcdonald challenges representative jay inslee , and pennsylvania s 13th , where mr greenleaf runs against representative joseph m hoeffel has changed hands three times in the 90 s it used to be that swing districts were the bellwethers of national politics , closely watched as the parties slugged it out with issues and insults election after election but in the 1950 s their numbers began to decline as parties receded in importance and candidates for congress ran increasingly on their own , raising their own money and , once they were in power , inventing dozens of perks to help solidify incumbency the vanishing swing district is one of the most telling examples of how the nature of congressional election politics has changed for all the talk of a momentous battle for control of the house of representatives , where republicans now hold an 11seat majority , there is real competition in only a handful of districts fewer than three dozen these two genuine swing districts , 2 , 800 miles apart , have a lot in common both are overwhelmingly white suburbs of broad lawns and shopping malls , where most adults have been to college both have aboveaverage incomes and expensive houses william h gates s 60 million house here , and the more prevalent sports cars on seattle s streets , suggest that the washington district is a little better off than the pennsylvania one in both places , issues like education , abortion and taxes are on people s minds there is no simple reason why these districts in and around philadelphia and seattle have remained so competitive other constituencies with similar demographics and politics have settled into the hands of one party or the other but the biggest cause may be the failure of the republicans who won these seats back in the gingrich revolution of 1994 to stay in touch with their voters , hanging on in 1996 but losing in 1998 the single biggest reason for the decline of the oldfashioned swing district is the set of advantages the system gives incumbents they can overcome anything short of tidal waves in national politics thomas mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution , cited resources that allow members to present themselves in favorable light back home , everything from being able to raise the money to run active , visible campaigns , travel home on a regular basis with a subsidy and use their legislative positions for commandeering the attention of the local media perhaps none of those advantages is as important as being able to help constituents finding a lost social security check , getting a visa for a relative to attend a wedding , arranging a longforgotten medal for a veteran the advantage most easily proven is financial incumbents raise more money this month mr inslee reported a campaign cash advantage of 955 , 551 to 546 , 891 for mr mcdonald similarly , mr hoeffel had 818 , 468 in the bank to mr greenleaf s 440 , 334 but those advantages are unlikely to be decisive in a year when control of the house hangs in the balance national party organizations and their front groups , along with special interests of all complexions , are expected to put total spending in the 30 or so most competitive house districts at around 5 million each the edge that neither challenger can really combat was on display on a recent saturday at the acme supermarket in east norriton township , pa , where mr hoeffel set up a table full of government not campaign literature and met constituents some came because of a governmentpaid mailing others were just weekend shoppers several wanted help with tax problems one wanted mr hoeffel to persuade his insurance company to pay for a particular drug politics came up , too voters talked about gun laws and taxes on married couples one woman wanted to change her registration to democrat from republican because republicans tried to extend the patent on the allergy drug claritin mr inslee has been demonstrating another edge of incumbency , publicity in recent weeks the seattle newspapers have reported that he got the electronicsignature bill passed by adding consumer protections , that he was working on pipeline safety legislation after a fatal accident at bellingham , wash , last year , and that he was critical of the judge in the antitrust case against microsoft , whose headquarters at redmond is in his district , and whose employees contribute heavily to mr inslee one advantage the democrat enjoyed two years ago is gone in 1998 , bruce craswell , a conservative thirdparty candidate , took 6 percent of the vote , just a bit more than mr inslee s margin over rick white , the republican incumbent most of the craswell votes came from mr white without him , the race would have been about even this time mr inslee is opposed only by mr mcdonald , a powerful 22year veteran of the state legislature
boston if there is an intellectual center of big business , it is the immaculately maintained fauxgeorgian campus of harvard business school , for nearly a century the training ground for the people who run and advise the world s largest companies from turning out future chief executives of ibm , merck and procter gamble to being the home of strategy gurus like michael e porter , harvard has practically stamped its crest on the large industrial companies that defined the 20thcentury economy but the west point of capitalism , as the school is known , has spent the last few years behaving like anything but an academy of big business instead , harvard has undergone a transformation worthy of the case studies that are the hallmark of its mba curriculum this one goes something like this fearing new kinds of competition , an industry giant changes how it does business to remain relevant and retain its dominance under a new set of economic rules the crux of the changes is an effort to reorganize harvard around the study of entrepreneurial ventures , be they dotcom startups or divisions of large companies trying to act like small companies those are the places that many harvard students want to work today , and they are the businesses that occupy the thoughts of the nation s most soughtafter academics the shift has touched every harvard student and has caused the business school the world s richest , bestknown and most influential to start a series of initiatives in silicon valley , where stanford , its most important rival , is preeminent the mba s who received their diplomas earlier this month here , across the charles river from harvard university s main campus in cambridge , were the last who were required to take general management , once the school s signature course students now must enroll in a firstyear class called the entrepreneurial manager over the past school year , more than onequarter of the electives chosen by secondyear students were in the entrepreneurship department , which 20 years ago consisted of just two classes next year , 40 students will opt out of regular classes for two months to receive credit for working inside mostly small companies in silicon valley and massachusetts already , officials have taken to boasting that harvard sends more graduates to the valley than any other business school we need to change , indeed get out in front of the parade , to continue to attract these bright 25yearolds , said jay light , a harvard professor for 30 years and one of the school s senior associate deans overseeing the curriculum changes if we do n't maintain our relevance for what they want to do with their lives , there s a problem the shift brings some significant risks in essence , harvard has allowed its current students' interest in working for small companies an interest that cynics might brand a grasp for instant riches to play a major role in shaping its curriculum for the next decade and while the internet may be here to stay , the stock market s recent volatility suggests that entrepreneurial fervor may be more fleeting the consolidation spree of the last decade also indicates that large companies indeed , ones larger than in the past will continue to dominate the economy yet harvard , as it reinvents itself , could alienate the bigcompany recruiters who have faithfully trekked to boston every autumn for decades the school has made quite a radical set of changes , said adrian j slywotzky , a vice president at mercer management consulting near boston who has often written about large organizations' attempts to reinvent themselves and who received his mba from harvard in 1980 large companies could say , 'i'm not sure how harvard is serving me , ' mr slywotzky said harvard professors , however , say that the economic changes of the last five years have forced them to act and that , in any event , they are not really leaving behind the study of big companies almost like a mantra , the professors repeat wordforword a definition of entrepreneurship that they say applies to general electric as well as it does to a dotcom operated out of a garage the pursuit of opportunities beyond means that are currently available we think of entrepreneurship not as a personality type or as a stage in the life cycle of a business but as a way of managing , said kim b clark , the dean since 1995 , whose overhaul of the business school has earned him mention as a candidate for harvard university s presidency , now vacant the concepts of leadership that are important now and are going to be important in the future spring out of an understanding of entrepreneurship rosabeth m kanter , a professor of management , added , big companies are dying to behave more like startups in the broadest sense , harvard is simply catching up to its alumni the school teaches students to think like general managers chief executives or presidents but not all of the 800plus harvard mba graduates each year can end up in such jobs at big companies in fact , about onethird of graduates who have been out of harvard for at least 15 years own their own businesses , according to studies done by the school
to the editor your sept 14 editorial about the movie theater crisis ends with a question is there enough good material to put on all those screens \? the answer is a resounding yes but almost none of it gets beyond screenplay format rightly or wrongly , most of hollywood and its financial backers believe that the american public wo n't pay money to see good material , so those screenplays do n't make it to celluloid personally , i think hollywood is wrong but as the screenwriter bill goldman once said about the industry , nobody knows anything j peter shapiro seattle , sept 14 , 2000 the writer is president of the northwest screenwriters guild
although i recently retired as a reporter for the new york times , i still ca n't resist checking the news wires on my desktop and glancing through the press releases that come in overnight on my fax somehow these old habits are comforting to my surprise , i even find myself missing those stomachchurning deadlines for filing copy i wrote hundreds of stories , some of which now seem almost surreal , like the long island rail road massacre , the ghoulish trials of several serial killers and the travails of joey buttafuocco and his teenage lover , amy fisher after such assignments , reporting on lighter subjects , like the return of the bluebird to long island after near extinction , came as a welcome relief i no longer travel about the island chasing bluebirds , or for that matter following fire trucks and ambulances to scenes of plane crashes and industrial plant explosions i now cruise at a more dignified pace , although still perhaps less leisurely than what many people expect of a socalled retired person that s a term i and my wife , who also recently retired , have yet to accept if anything , we are busier than ever , gardening , traveling abroad , going to plays and concerts in manhattan and seeing the world anew through the eyes our first grandchild , 15monthold faith she says only a few words , but has already begun to master the world of mass communications her little right index finger can turn on any computer or television set in the house and can thoroughly confuse the printed circuits of a cellular phone she is fearless and will not be satisfied until she has pushed every button within reach the world is now definitely more hers than mine and i can only hope that i'm around long enough to see what she and her contemporaries do with it for starters , perhaps , as an old reporter and observer of the past several decades , i can clue her in on where to find some of the best , beginning right here on long island she already loves the beach her first trip to the ocean included a ride in her stroller along the boardwalk at jones beach , which has got to be among the best seaside treats anywhere in the world every seashell she can find is a new treasure , which she holds to her ear to listen to the sound of the sea another of long island s best experiences , which i plan to introduce her to in the spring , is the annual hatching of thousands of young wild ducklings at the wertheim national wildlife refuge wideeyed , pert and fuzzy , the hatchlings all take to the waterways of long neck and yopahank creek , which feed into the carmans river and the great south bay now that i can choose the time and place of my travels , i find the long island expressway to be among the best things the island has to offer perhaps it is little more than a parking lot during rush hour , but i find that during off hours , especially at midmorning early in the week , i can make it from my home in bayville , on the northern most tip of nassau county , to riverhead in about an hour the wineries just east of riverhead on the north and south forks are at their busiest this time of the year , producing some of the best wines in the country the rapid development and expansion of the industry has helped long island to maintain its role as the largest producer of agricultural products per dollar value compared with any other region of the state now , instead of reporting on these wineries , i can be an anonymous observer , taking the tours and tasting the freshly uncorked chardonnays and merlots on a recent sunny tuesday , my wife and i sat beneath an umbrella at a table at the duckwalk winery in the hamptons , sipping beaujolais as workers lifted the bird netting from acres of vines , preparing for the next day s harvest for lunch , we stopped off at the chequit inn on shelter island , a peaceful retreat between the north and south forks our table on a patio shaded by trees in peak fall foliage overlooked deering harbor , where several sailboats were waiting to be pulled onto dry land for winter the setting was idyllic , but i could not forget that the last time i came to shelter island , i was covering the murder of a local man who was shot to death at pointblank range by his neighbor the gunman , who earlier this year was convicted of murder by a jury in suffolk county criminal court in riverhead , told the police he killed his neighbor because he had sexually molested a young girl i remember interviewing some employees of the chequit inn , where the victim had once worked in the kitchen washing dishes luckily , none of those same employees were serving my wife and i our lunch in fact , i almost hesitated stopping there to eat , but realized that if i followed such a rule , there would be many other places on long island i could no longer visit and my wife would miss out on all those intriguing stories no one will ever find in a guidebook on the best of long island drawing \( santiago cohen \)

on feb 4 , the abc news correspondent john stossel hosted a report on 20 20 that probably surprised many viewers it made the case that organic food is not necessarily healthier than conventional food and might actually be dangerous citing research he said was commissioned by abc news , mr stossel said that organic food seemed more likely than conventional food to be contaminated by e coli bacteria he also said that conventional produce does not necessarily have more pesticide residue than organic produce , contradicting one of organic food s primary selling points our tests , surprisingly , found no pesticide residue on the conventional samples or the organic , he said in the report but the two researchers who were commissioned to do the testing dr michael doyle , a scientist with the university of georgia , and dr lester crawford , director of georgetown university s center for food and nutrition policy said they never tested produce for pesticide residue for abc abc executives are now looking into whether the statement about produce , a key premise on which mr stossel built his case , was made without any basis in fact all i agreed to do was test for indications of pathogens , dr doyle said i did n't do tests for pesticides dr crawford said that while he did not test produce for pesticides , he did test chicken and found residue on the samples of conventional poultry but not on samples of organic poultry those findings were not mentioned in mr stossel s report the doctors' denials were first brought to light by the environmental working group , which supports the consumption of organic produce members talked to the doctors after the report in a letter to mr stossel , the group asked for an explanation the producer of the segment , david w fitzpatrick , responded in a letter by saying that the pesticide tests were done and that the results had been forwarded to the organic trade association , a group that spoke in defense of organic produce in the segment the executive director of the association , katherine t dimatteo , said friday that the organization had not received results from any tests for pesticide residue on produce despite being told by the environmentalists of the doctors' denials , abc showed the report again on july 7 during an ontheair conversation with cynthia mcfadden , a 20 20 anchorwoman , mr stossel said , it s logical to worry about pesticide residues , but in our tests , we found none on either organic or regular produce last week , abc news executives still could not address the questions raised in february they , at first said pesticide tests were performed on produce by dr crawford told that dr crawford maintains he did not do such testing , they later released a statement saying they would look into the matter and if a mistake was made , we will correct it mr stossel had no comment and mr fitzpatrick was on assignment in africa and unavailable jim rutenberg photo john stossel of abc news said organic food was not safer \( abc \)
lavallette in this seaside town of 2 , 600 people which swells to 30 , 000 in the summer , where joe pesci bought a house for his mother and where the mayor strolls around in shorts you would n't expect a dispute over what a sidewalk is even more peculiar , the disagreement is setting the borough government against its 13member police department and resolving the rift over something so seemingly trivial appears headed for the courts at added expense to the taxpayers do n't judge a book by its cover or a resort by its surf here , for instance , where charming houses line 15 miles of oceanfront , the police chief often sports a shortsleeved shirt with a department logo instead of a uniform on the bay side , where mr pesci bought his mother s house , newer homes sell for as much as a million dollars then there s the issue of the sidewalk it started on aug 8 when a police officer ticketed the fire chief s car for being parked on the sidewalk in front of fire headquarters borough officials were at once surprised and angered , contending that there was no sidewalk there to begin with we 've looked into it , and our opinion is it s an illegal ticket and therefore obviously he ca n't give it because this is not a sidewalk , mayor thomas walls said at the site where the incident occurred and a study of the ground at his feet did indeed seem to show no discernible sidewalk , but rather a continuous asphalt parking lot stretching from the firehouse to the curb about 200 feet away two feet from and parallel to the curb is a painted line going back obliquely from the line toward the firehouse are other painted lines creating spaces for eight cars to park to the police , that is the sidewalk sitting in his office , police chief frederick h swearingen , jr opened the new jersey police manual , which included the state s motor vehicle laws , put it on his desk near some photos of the 146 big eye he recently caught and pointed to section 39 11 highlighted with magic marker the manual read sidewalk means that portion of highway intended for the use of pedestrians between the curb line of the lateral line of a shoulder , or , if none , the lateral line of the roadway in the adjacent right of way line the chief said public safety was involved , especially when people had to walk in the street after concerts in a nearby park nonetheless , mayor walls , 48 , who owns three restaurants and a hotel , insisted that 60 percent of town had no sidewalks if this is a sidewalk , there are 500 other places in town with the same situation , he said why single out the fire chief of all people \? accounts differ mayor walls put it this way the lot had recently been paved and , on aug 8 , the borough s department of public works was painting parking lines a worker wanted the fire chief s official car moved from near the firehouse so lines could be painted there a councilman , james borowski , who is also a volunteer firemen , moved it into one of the newly painted spaces near the curb at 11 am an officer , raymond toscano , ticketed the car aside from questioning the legality of the ticket , mayor walls said he felt professional courtesy was breached the police and fire departments should be brothersinlaw , he said i can understand not getting along with your employer , the governing body we 're trying to work through that what bothers me is giving a ticket to one of their own but chief swearingen had his own take on professional courtesy about 7 30 am on aug 8 , he received a call from officer toscano , who saw chalk lines near the curb for parking spaces that would block the right of way the chief then asked the workmen to delay painting the lines until he could file a memorandum with the town administrator saying the spaces were in violation of state law but as the chief was writing his memo , the workers had painted the lines to mayor walls the ticket was just another example of bitterness arising from contentious contract negotiations with the police over the last three years , though the police denied there was a hidden agenda then why , mayor walls asked rhetorically , had he received 12 tickets in the last three years when in the previous 10 years he had never received any \? officer walter g lacicero , president of local 372 of the patrolman s benevolent association noting that willie sutton robbed banks because that s where the money was said maybe the mayor s getting tickets because that s where the violations are officer lacicero , who also happens to be mayor wall s next door neighbor , was the one who gave the mayor his first ticket for putting out his trash too early mayor walls said this occurred soon after he had voted to suspend tuition payments to police officers taking college courses not directly related to police work officer lacicero , who is a lawyer , was attending law school at the time nonetheless , officer lacicero said there was no personal animosity and that a neighbor had complained about the trash i was the officer on duty , he said needless to say , their relationship has become more coolly professional and less neighborly , although their wives continue to be good friends and one of the walls children babysits for the laciceros we tried in good faith to perform our duty to look out for public safety , officer lacicero said about ticketing the fire chief if we had n't done something here and someone had been injured they would have asked us why we had n't done anything since then , the department has issued a halfdozen more tickets , all to people taking part in a lunch program for the elderly if you were to pull up here you would think this is a place to park , said mayor walls chief swearingen agreed , but he added , we get paid by the town to enforce ordinances and state laws , and they ca n't really pick and choose the laws they want to enforce for now , it appears the case will go to court with an independent judge and independent prosecutor a 44 ticket will cost thousands of dollars adjudicate these are the kinds of issues that affect a small town , mayor walls said , the sort of things that can win and lose elections photos mayor thomas walls is incensed because the police ticketed the fire chief s car , which was parked outside fire headquarters \( dith pran the new york times \)
the ritual was exasperating for pete mackanin every time his 21yearold relief specialist did not pitch well , the manager of the class aa bowie baysox would have to talk him out of quitting armando

there s a car waiting outside for you in the depths of his despair , new york was sometimes a beacon to benitez but not because of baseball i had a lot of frustration , he said i was n't real patient i said i would rather drive a taxi in new york than be here i disappointed my team benitez would have to drive a cab for centuries to make the kind of money he is making now in new york after a successful first season with the mets last year , benitez signed a fouryear , 22 million contract in february it was the mets' largest financial commitment of the winter when the mets acquired benitez from baltimore in december 1998 , in the threeway trade that sent catcher todd hundley to the los angeles dodgers , they were told benitez was an intense competitor who could improve his emotional control he gave them everything they wanted 77 games , a 185 earned run average and 22 saves in 28 chances without the theatrics he grew leaps and bounds last year , mets general manager steve phillips said benitez has been growing physically and emotionally since he was signed at age 17 the orioles scout carlos bernhardt had watched him in the dominican republic , and although benitez threw only in the range of 80 miles an hour , he had an easy motion and a 6foot4inch frame bernhardt had to fly to florida , so he called his wife , janet , and asked her to take a contract to benitez s home and sign him she did benitez received only 2 , 000 that day , but it was his first step in helping his mother escape poverty the family had a home , but benitez spent most of his days in the streets while his mother worked several jobs later , when benitez s frustrations with baseball seemed overwhelming , bernhardt would remind him why he was playing he believes that if you help your mother , god will pay you back double , bernhardt said that s what it s all about though his mother speaks english , benitez did not speak it when he signed the language barrier was the most difficult adjustment to make , he said , and it isolated him he heard a lot of things that bothered him , said the orioles' bullpen coach , elrod hendricks , because he did n't quite understand benitez s radargun readings were impressive , but his reluctance to throw anything but fastballs frustrated coaches and teammates mackanin remembers having to call sliders from the bench , because benitez was so insistent on throwing fastballs we had to put it in his head that you 're not going to live with that fastball , said orosco , a 21year veteran who added he has never seen a harder thrower than benitez i mean , 'i wish i had your fastball , but i 'd like to have other pitches , too' after a year as a setup man , benitez became the orioles' closer in 1998 he converted 22 of 26 save chances , but never felt that the job was his alone the bullpen would stir when benitez got in trouble , and he did not sense confidence from manager ray miller the orioles signed mike timlin as their closer in november '98 , effectively giving up on benitez deep down inside , i think that getting away from here was probably the best thing that happened to him , because he had a lot of scars over here , hendricks said there were a lot of people that he did n't trust the mets wanted a righthanded power pitcher to set up for closer john franco , and they targeted benitez when they got him , powers was unsure how his client who he said generally does not respond well to change would handle new york but almost immediately , benitez liked the mets benitez was best known in new york for drilling tino martinez in the back earlier in 1998 , inciting a brawl with the yankees jay horwitz , the mets' media relations director , told benitez he would be hearing questions about the incident and asked how he wanted to respond it was a simple gesture , but it made an impression on benitez he was not being told what to do , and his opinion was respected he has not always felt that way i give respect to people who give it back to me , said benitez , who has expressed remorse and apologized to martinez powers said that to benitez , respect means something different than it does to most athletes
washington , march 8 the senate voted 82 to 17 this evening to modernize an 80yearold law that airlines have used in the last few years to limit payments to families of passengers killed in crashes at sea the provision was tailored to help families of people who died on trans world airlines flight 800 , with the law retroactive to july 16 , 1996 , the day before that 747 exploded off the coast of long island , killing all 230 people aboard its backers say the change in the law would also help those who lost relatives in the crashes of swissair flight 111 in 1998 and and egyptair flight 990 last fall the house is expected to vote soon to approve the change , which is part of a compromise on aviation finance that house and senate conferees agreed to on tuesday the provision lets families sue for loss of care , comfort and companionship under the 1920 law , the death on the high seas act , families were limited to collecting the value of lost wages if the passenger was a child or a retired person , or if the relative suing did not rely on the passenger s income , then the family generally could not collect any money korean air lines successfully used the law to limit the amount it paid after one of its planes was shot down by a soviet fighter plane in 1983 over the sea of japan twa is seeking to use the law , too it s good news for the families , said frank carven , a director of the twa flight 800 association , whose sister and nephew died on the flight the death on the high seas law originally covered deaths beyond one marine league , which is three nautical miles , the common definition of territorial waters in the 1920 s in june 1998 , judge robert w sweet of federal district court in manhattan ruled that when president ronald reagan extended american territorial waters to 12 miles in 1988 , the definition of high seas moved out that far , too twa has appealed his ruling under the provision approved by the senate , the families of victims in crashes within 12 miles of shore could use state laws to pursue claims against airlines where to sue is a complicated question in crashes , but families can often go to court in the jurisdiction in which the passenger lived , or the place from which the plane departed beyond 12 miles , the families would be allowed to sue in federal court for loss of care , comfort and companionship james p kreindler , a lawyer whose firm represents the families of 86 passengers , said that the law would push the airline and its insurance company to offer more generous settlements the defendants in twa 800 know they 're going to pay , he said , and have appealed judge sweet s decision in an effort to delay payments but mark e abels , a twa spokesman , said that the change in the law , presuming the house passes it and president clinton signs it , is not a major concern as far as we 're concerned there s been no finding of liability against twa , and we do n't anticipate that there will be , he said in order to successfully sue , there has to be a finding of willful malfeasance , and there has been no finding by anybody of any malfeasance on the part of twa , willful or otherwise the cause of the crash is still under investigation lawyers say that the airline and boeing , the manufacturer , are potentially liable mr abels said the company had appealed the judge s decision because it did not think the judge could retroactively change the terms of the 1920 law to conform with the later policy on territorial limits mr kreindler said that none of the cases had been settled yet mr abels said that some had , but that he would not say how many much of the lobbying for the change in the law was done by hans ephraimsonabt , the father of a young woman who died on kal 007 , and the law was not backdated to cover that crash we did all the work , and we wound up with nothing , he said after 17 years , they are told that other families , with crashes a few years later , are entitled to something , but they 're just thrown on the heap mr kreindler said the new provision would also affect families who lost relatives on swissair 111 and egyptair 990 the swissair flight crashed five miles off the nova scotia coast on sept 2 , 1998 , killing 229 people egyptair 990 crashed about 50 miles out at sea last oct 31 killing all 217 people on board a main backer of the change in the law was representative donald l sherwood , a republican whose district in pennsylvania includes montoursville sixteen teenage members of the town s high school french club died on flight 800 where a loved one died , on land or at sea , should not determine the legal rights of family members in a court of law , mr sherwood wrote in letters to colleagues supporting the change no parent should be told by our nation s legal system that longitude and latitude will determine the value of their child
port st lucie , fla , feb 19 in venezuela , there is baseball royalty then there is melvin mora , king of kings mora , the reserve infielder outfielder who is one of the more intriguing position players reporting to the mets training camp today , has only 11 major league hits , but he is the man of the moment in his homeland the most famous venezuelan in baseball history recently crowned him as such dave concepcion , the shortstop who starred for the cincinnati reds from 1970 to 1988 , is revered at home and honored by the current generation of venezuelan players six of the nation s major leaguers , including the mets' edgardo alfonzo , wear concepcion s no 13 so imagine mora s joy and shock , and pride when concepcion came to a winter league game in caracas , pulled him aside and said i came here to see one guy i 've been playing baseball all my life , and i never saw anybody play like you you play in new york , but you 're not scared i 've never seen a kid play with such heart mora , who was playing for magallanes , was amazed that concepcion even talked to him before mora could ask for a picture , the legend produced his own camera and said he wanted a photo with the rookie he told me , 'you 're my favorite player , ' mora said recently in a telephone interview from his mother s house in valencia , venezuela i do n't know why he told me that , because i just started my career but mora started on a big stage his fifth hit \( in his 31st and final atbat of the regular season \) sparked the gamewinning rally against pittsburgh on the final scheduled day of the regular season , sending the mets to a onegame showdown against the cincinnati reds that secured the wildcard spot he played in all six games of the national league championship series against atlanta , slamming his first career home run , batting 429 \( 6 for 14 \) , stealing two bases , throwing out three runners and becoming a cult hero mora planned to rest before joining the magallanes team in december , but he received such an overwhelming reception that he quickly changed his mind they treat me like a king , mora said i'm not a king , but they respect me because i play hard how i played in the playoffs in new york , that s how i 've always played here when i came back from new york , they saw me at the airport and they called my name 'we want you to play ! when are you going to play \? ' what could i tell them \? no \? three days later , i played mora led the team in hitting at 333 , and his performance increased his fame in december , when floods ravaged venezuela , mora s mother watched on television as an orphaned boy claimed to be a relative of the family s mora suggested he might adopt the boy and found out the two were distantly related , but a closer relative took custody it was that kind of winter everybody wanted him around melvin was the spark plug of our ballclub , said the former major leaguer cesar cedeno , a coach for magallanes as melvin goes , so goes magallanes john gibbons , who managed mora at class aaa norfolk \( va \) last season , said he s in the middle of everything good when he first got called up , we were leading the league there was definitely a big dropoff without him , because he was the spark plug on the mets , there is no place for mora to start every day his best chance for playing time is as a replacement for derek bell if the right fielder struggles early , or for rickey henderson on the left fielder s days off mora is not an accomplished base stealer and the mets do not consider him a potential leadoff hitter but he could be valuable , if anyone could figure out exactly what he brings manager bobby valentine said he thinks of mora first as a utility infielder , a lonely position on the mets at the same time , valentine praised mora s versatility and professionalism , and called him his trump card he has n't played a lot in the major leagues , so it s hard to start saying what he is at the major league level , valentine said but he s a talented player he plays both sides of the game , offense and defense , and he does a lot of things better than most as an extra man , he is probably underutilized and as an everyday player , he 'd be subjected to a lot of scrutiny so he s an interesting character general manager steve phillips said that mora could be a potential starter , just at a different position each day , the way tony phillips used to play second and third and left and right i could envision his role at some point developing into that , the general manager said to start the season , it s a little unclear still to those who know mora , one thing is certain he will make an impact mora is resourceful his father died when he was 6 years old , and to escape poverty the boy tried boxing and soccer he took up baseball at 15 because he realized there was more money in the game mora impressed scouts , but his mother who paid no attention to baseball told him not to sign a professional contract she did not want him away for seven months of the year but the houston astros ran an academy near his home , and eventually the money was too much for mora to resist he was already 19 when he signed for a 10 , 000 bonus in 1991 he s one of those people that says , 'it s myself against the world , ' said andres reiner , who directs the astros' venezuelan program you have to have this real special feel for surviving , and he has that you can put him in an airplane with a parachute and drop him on the north pole , and he would survive he is one of those guys , and you have to respect those kind of people mora spent seven seasons in the astros' system , partly because he needed to learn so many positions but at none of those stops did mora bat 300 , hit 10 home runs or steal 25 bases , and the 5foot10inch , 180pound utility player had the makings of a class aaa lifer they did n't have a lot of money in him , he s not 6foot4 with an adonis body , and he does n't have a real position because of his versatility , said dave engle , a mets minor league manager who managed mora in the astros' system he s the prototypical guy that s a quality player in triple a he s going to have to be clutch , and he s going to have to keep knocking on the door , wedging his foot in when he has a little crack fed up after 1997 , mora signed with a team in the chinese professional baseball league in 1998 but when he batted 335 , he encountered trouble he was approached by men he suspected were gamblers , and they were not happy with his success over there , they do n't pay you for hitting , they pay you for striking out , mora said i know they were talking about gambling , because i was hitting pretty good i told them , 'i do n't speak chinese , ' and they ran away i said , 'i 've got to get out of here' i left mora contacted alfonzo s brother , edgar , a mets' minor league coach that led to a job at class aaa norfolk as a nonroster invitee to spring training last year , mora hit 421 and was the last player cut but his door had opened , even though he would n't burst through it until october mora liked what he saw on the other side , and now he wants to experience more of it people know me , and i do n't have as much pressure as before , mora said last year i was invited to spring training now , i'm on the roster and waiting for the chance to play every day they know what i can do photo the versatile melvin mora made a splash with the mets in the playoffs last season \( associated press \)
san francisco , feb 2 one of the mysteries of the aids epidemic is that a small number of female prostitutes in africa seem resistant to the virus that causes the disease even though they often have sex with infected men despite an intensive search for immunologic explanations , none have been found now an even more baffling finding has turned up in a study of 1 , 900 prostitutes in nairobi , kenya four of them became infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids , but only after they stopped working as prostitutes or took breaks of two months or more , leaders of the study reported at the seventh conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections , which ended here today scientists cannot explain this seeming paradox but say the answer could affect development of an aids vaccine the prostitutes work in a nairobi slum in 1984 , researchers from the university of nairobi and the university of manitoba in winnipeg , canada , began to study and treat the women s sexually transmitted diseases when the women enrolled in the study , twothirds of them were infected with hiv the prostitutes said they had five clients a day on average and used condoms with about four of them the researchers estimated that each prostitute had unprotected sex with 60 to 70 infected clients a year a small percentage of the prostitutes remained free of infection for at least three years no link has been found between the women who became infected after stopping commercial sex and their condom use or sex practices dr stephen wolinsky , an aids researcher at northwestern university , called the findings provocative and said he had confidence in them because they came from a scientific team known for meticulous work scientists have been stymied in identifying what immunologic factor specifically correlates with protection against hiv infection findings from the nairobi study may provide another way of seeking the factors that are known as correlates of immunity , dr wolinsky said in an interview at the meeting such information is needed to help create a vaccine but the findings could be bad news for vaccine development if they meant that booster doses would be needed every few weeks to maintain protection , dr anthony s fauci , who directs the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases , said in an interview at the meeting dr fauci offered two possible explanations for the phenomenon it could be , he said , that to maintain protection , people need nearly continual exposure to hiv so that antigens in the virus can constantly boost the immune system or , he said , perhaps sperm or semen somehow stimulate a relatively shortlived immunologic reaction in the women that protects them if either explanation is correct , an effective hiv vaccine may need to be given frequently , dr fauci said

what exciting news the mayor s political friends just announced that they have already raised 12 million for his unofficial senate race the first lady s camp says she has raised 8 million and by the time the campaign is over , we learned a few weeks ago , the two expect to have spent 45 million 25 million for her , 20 million for him for a job that pays 141 , 300 a year \( plus expenses \) that s 45 million if you are not hillary rodham clinton , rudolph w giuliani or one of their hirelings , 45 million may not mean much what is 45 million , except a lot \? a 45 million race would set a new national record , beating 44 million spent in a california race for the senate six years ago but that does n't mean much , either herewith , then , the first installment of what could become a continuing series of commentaries call it let s get real 1 in campaigns , 45 million is never 45 million the prediction that the two candidates will spend 45 million is probably outdated already but even if it turns out to be technically accurate , it cannot be candidly accurate because it does not include soft money huge sums that will be spent on behalf of the candidates by boosters allegedly uninvolved in their campaigns the illnamed soft money is almost impossible to police it s made up of contributions from individuals , corporations and unions that are much larger than any candidates can collect under federal law national and state parties then spend the money to promote their favorite candidates , but pretend that they are merely sharing their independent points of view with the public so far , mrs clinton has raised about 360 , 000 for a soft money account , and the democratic senate campaign committee has already spent nearly 340 , 000 in upstate television ads starring mrs clinton none of this money counts toward her projected 25 million total there just is no tracking this kind of campaign spending what if a commercial stressing democratic candidates features al gore and mrs clinton \? whose account his , hers or the party s \? mr giuliani has harshly criticized the clinton softmoney spending , but he wo n't rule out creating his own soft money account and the mayor is indulging in similar deceptions already for example , he s promoting the city in radio ads created by the city s tourism bureau and paid for by the taxpayer not political , he says 2 the campaign as arms race with no limits on ways to advertise a candidacy , it is safe to predict that both candidates will spend whatever they manage to raise , even though they are among the bestknown politicians in america both are elaborately publicized and analyzed in books , magazines , newspapers and television features , and can command all the free television time they want they are so well known that , polls show , only about 10 percent of new york s potential voters are in the undecided column but no candidate is smart enough to know what incremental money is needed to swing that last vote , said mark green , the city s public advocate it s not unlike an arms race mr green has suggested an arms control agreement banning soft money , to no avail instead , it s been bilateral escalation 3 the candidates as new coke mr giuliani and mrs clinton figure they have to spend and spend and spend for another reason new yorkers know them , all right , but they do n't particularly like them in a new york times cbs news poll three months ago , mrs clinton had a 38 percent unfavorable rating mr giuliani s was a close 34 percent a marist poll taken last week showed him with a 28 percent unfavorable rating , to her 43 percent they either have to change people s opinion , make the other candidates look worse , or spotlight new issues that cause people to overlook their dislike , and that is the most difficult thing a candidate has to do in politics , said phil friedman , a democratic political consultant the two will have to change the minds of the already very much decided voters , which is sort of like getting people who rejected new coke to reconsider and that s expensive in the new york city market , television commercials can cost from 80 , 000 for 30 seconds on a primetime hit to 1 , 500 on a morning news program 4 the remote control as political tool the targets of all this spending the voters are in for total saturation therefore , a helpful reminder for those who do not have relatives in philadelphia your television remote comes with two useful options a mute button , and an off switch
shots explode at a school in oregon , a brokerage office in atlanta , or a church in fort worth , and the nation is witness to another sudden , seemingly random violent rampage before the ambulances leave , the news crews arrive the killers' neighbors , friends or families submit to interviews , and inevitably , they say something like this he just snapped but the killers do not just snap an examination by the new york times of 100 rampage murders found that most of the killers spiraled down a long slow slide , mentally and emotionally most of them left a road map of red flags , spending months plotting their attacks and accumulating weapons , talking openly of their plans for bloodshed many showed signs of serious mental health problems but in case after case , the times review found , the warning signs were missed by a tattered mental health care system by families unable to face the evidence of serious mental turmoil in their children or siblings by employers , teachers and principals who failed to take the threats seriously by the police who , when alerted to the danger by frightened relatives , neighbors or friends , were incapable of intervening before the violence erupted james davis , whose coworkers had nicknamed him psycho , warned his colleagues at a tool warehouse in asheville , nc , if they ever decide to fire me , i 'll take two or three of them with me his employers did fire him , and feared he would respond with violence , but despite his threats , they failed to protect his coworkers when mr davis returned to take his revenge in 34 of the 100 cases , however , families or friends of the killers desperately did try to find help for a person they feared was a ticking time bomb , but were rebuffed by the police , school administrators or mental health workers sylvia seegrist caromed in and out of mental institutions 12 times in 10 years , while her parents searched for a residential program where she could stay in treatment they knew she was dangerous she had stabbed a psychologist and tried to strangle her mother , and had hidden a gun in her apartment but each time , she was released from the hospital when she seemed to improve we were always fearful that maybe some tragedy would happen , said ruth s seegrist , sylvia s mother she threatened it someday before i kill myself , i 'll bring some people down with me' sylvia opened fire in a suburban philadelphia shopping mall in 1985 , killing three people and wounding seven in response to the recent spate of rampagestyle mass shootings in schools , workplaces , stores and other public places , the new york times reexamined 100 such violent incidents that occurred in the united states over the last 50 years the times gathered extensive information on all 100 , and looked closely at more than 25 of the cases , a surprising number of which attracted little but local attention the examination included reviews of court cases , news coverage and mental health records , and interviews with families and friends , psychologists and victims , in an effort to glean what the people closest to each tragedy had learned in some cases , reporters questioned the killers themselves based on this information , the times found that in 63 of the 100 cases \( which involved 102 killers \) , the killers made general threats of violence to others in advance fiftyfive of the 100 cases involved killers who regularly expressed explosive anger or frustration , and 35 killers had a history of violent behavior and assaults they were so noticeably unstable that even in their very separate circles they had been awarded similar nicknames crazy pat , crazy john , crazy joe and in 40 cases , family members and others said they noticed a sudden change in behavior in the period before the rampage the more you find out about each of these cases , the more it makes sense , said prof dewey g cornell , a clinical psychologist at the university of virginia and director of the virginia youth violence project , which studies school safety and violence prevention this notion that someone just snaps is based on ignorance and denial , professor cornell said people do n't just snap pressures build up many psychologists caution that it is impossible to predict violent behavior , and that most people who threaten violence never follow through often , it is only in retrospect that each killer s life appears to be a coherent chilling narrative foretelling obvious danger looking back , it is easy to marvel , how could the people who knew the murderer have failed to see it coming \? in particular , how could so many psychiatric workers , and even the police , have missed the warning signs \? in many cases , there was no single person in the potential killer s life to put together the lethal clues colleagues , friends , family members , mental health professionals , teachers and the police may have independently sensed something disturbing , but they did not communicate with one another frightened neighbors or coworkers decided it was safest to keep their distance friends laughed off homicidal talk parents did not know where to turn , or just hoped the irrational fury was merely a phase
london , aug 11 it was a scandal that riveted swinging sixties london and left behind a tantalizing question that has gone unanswered for nearly 40 years at its center was margaret , duchess of argyll , a rich and seductive society beauty who inspired cole porter s you 're the top in what was then the longest and costliest divorce proceeding in british history , she was accused by her husband , the duke , of leaving him behind in his dark baronial castles in scotland and going on a highkicking romp through the salons of london during which she took , by his count , 88 lovers , including cabinet members , hollywood actors and members of the royal family the duke knew this , he said , because he had stolen her diaries from her desk drawer and also found compromising pictures submitted to the edinburgh court but kept from public view , the photographs reportedly showed a naked man gratifying himself and pictured her , dressed in nothing but three strands of pearls , performing a sex act on a naked man in the mirrored gilt and silver bathroom of her mayfair apartment the pictures , taken with a polaroid camera , showed the man only from the neck down it led the judge in the case , lord wheatley , to identify him as the man without a head and prompted british gossips ever since to ask , who was the headless man \? for years , the two most prominent suspects have been winston churchill s soninlaw , duncan sandys , who was defense secretary in the government of harold macmillan , and the american actor and society figure douglas fairbanks jr a television documentary shown on britain s channel 4 this week came up with what it called the definitive answer it was both of them the fouryear divorce proceeding had magnified significance for the british public because it revealed fresh evidence of upperclass decadence during the same months in 1963 that the scandal involving the war minister , john profumo , was unfolding mr profumo had to resign in disgrace when it emerged he lied to parliament about his relationship with the call girl christine keeler the duchess was found to have committed adultery with four men by the judge , lord wheatley , who , in a 50 , 000word report that took more than three hours to read , pilloried her as a highclass harlot she is a highly sexed woman who has ceased to be satisfied with normal sexual activities and has started to indulge in disgusting sexual activities to gratify a debased sexual appetite that can only be satisfied by a number of men , he said he added , her attitude to the sanctity of marriage was what moderns would call enlightened but which in plain language was wholly immoral there have been books , biographies , articles and a fulllength opera devoted to her since , but she died in 1993 without ever revealing her secret both mr fairbanks , who died in may , and lord duncansandys , who died in 1987 , always denied involvement the television documentary , titled secret history the duchess and the headless man , said the man shown in the pictures was in fact two men peter jay , later to be british ambassador to washington but then a treasury official assisting in the official investigation , told how the senior judge leading the inquiry , lord denning , proved that mr fairbanks was one of them he deliberately invited the five principal suspects to his office to discuss the matter , obliging them to sign in on an official guest book each signature was examined by a graphologist to find the match with the thinking of you caption found on the snapshots lord denning , who died last

waterford , conn for 35 summers the national playwrights conference has been the tall ship of the eugene o'neill theater center , giving a berth to hundreds of new plays and new playwrights this year there is a major difference james houghton as the new artistic director mr houghton , 41 , the founder and director of the signature theater company , has succeeded lloyd richards , 80 , the first , and until now , the only head of the conference commonly known as the o'neill looking ahead , mr houghton said , the o'neill is about to be born again in his first season at the conference mr houghton is trying to put the emphasis even more firmly on the writers , and he has made small but significant alterations for the first time all the writers are living on the o'neill campus for the month of their residency instead of being boarded at a nearby college , and they are encouraged to bring their families with them on a recent weekend , playwrights were very much in evidence in the grand o'neill environment , an elegant estate with a green lawn leading down to long island sound the writers were in rehearsals or staged readings , talking to members of the staff or simply meeting their colleagues and comparing notes about their plays in progress in the past there were critical forums following the readings , with directors , dramaturgs and critics \( from the national critics institute , an adjunct of the conference \) speaking out about the plays while the playwrights were asked to remain silent in some cases the result was a wounded playwright now there are no longer such sessions criticism of the work may be offered privately and informally greeting the audience at the opening event of the monthlong conference , a staged reading of parts unknown , a new play by ron fitzgerald , mr houghton spoke about the need to take the time and to have the patience to allow the writers to create he said that when the process works , it elevates us all john henry redwood , one of this year s playwrights , was at the o'neill in 1995 with the old settler , which was later presented at primary stages in manhattan looking back on his first residency , he said , it served me , and it served the play his new play , about the rape of a black woman by a white man in north carolina in 1949 , has the provocative title no niggers , no jews , no dogs mr redwood , who is black , said he was aware that the title might present problems for any theater producing the work informally , he was referring to it as the no play in the limited rehearsal time he had not done much work on it , but the actors \( tonya pinkins and ruben santiago hudson \) and david esbjornson , as director , were adding their touches the playwright said he would be seeing the results that evening when the play had the first of two readings on opening night theatergoers , some from boston , some from new york , many of them from the o'neill center and the surrounding area , filled the bleachers in the outdoor theater , named the edith in memory of edith oliver , the longtime off broadway critic for the new yorker and an o'neill dramaturg mr houghton made his introductory remarks , again stressing that the conference was for the playwrights then on an open stage under a large tree mr redwood s play began after the performance , as is customary at the o'neill , the actors did not take a curtain call but the audience , realizing that the playwright was seated in a rear row , rose , turned and applauded him afterward there was no critical forum , no outsiders dissecting a writer s work , but mr redwood has the option of private conversations with his director , mr houghton or others then , in the o'neill tradition , he can go back to work on his new play each year at this conference a dozen or more plays go through a period of brief but intensive rehearsal and then have public readings on the various stages many of the plays have gone on to great success , beginning with the work of august wilson george c white created the center in 1964 , leasing eight and a half acres of the former hamman estate the following year , with mr richards , he began the playwrights conference the center itself also includes a music theater conference , a symposium on cabaret , the national theater institute and the monte cristo cottage , eugene o'neill s childhood home in nearby new london mr white , 64 , is retiring at the end of this year , to be succeeded as executive director by howard sherman , 38 , the managing director of the geva theater in rochester during mr white s years in waterford , the o'neill has inspired similar conferences in other states and also in russia and china in an interview mr houghton said that he admired the pioneer work of mr richards and mr white , but he also made it clear that he was aware of his position as a new artistic director in a new century he said that his first responsibility was to empower the playwrights , to give writers a place where they can explore their plays in a relatively safe environment
his voice , a whisper to begin with , had been scrubbed of every bit of emotion barry bonds , disappointed and drained , tried hard to be gracious last night he said in many different ways that the mets deserved to win the game and the series then , over the hiss of the showers that seem to become amplified in the locker room of a team whose season has just ended , bonds was asked about his lack of production in the san francisco giants' three straight losses to the mets in the division series bonds , 1 for 14 in those three games , said he did not want to comment but he could not help himself suddenly , he was talking louder , and he was becoming more animated i do n't think it s fair to put it on one person s shoulders , bonds said , meaning his shoulders i was n't pressing at all , bonds said , referring to the playoffs that was one of the most comfortable times i 've had a lot of us did n't hit a lot of us did n't hit but if you want to blame me , go ahead the giants hit 205 in four games against the mets and managed only one hit last night off bobby j jones in a 40 mets victory bonds hit 176 in the series , but he had a lot of company six of the eight giants with at least 10 atbats hit 231 or less none of us did any good in this series , giants second baseman jeff kent said but because bonds has done things like hit 494 home runs in his career , because he is coming off a most valuable player caliber season in which he hit 306 with 49 home runs , his failures , especially postseason failures , are amplified a day after he went 0 for 5 in a 13inning loss , bonds was 0 for 4 yesterday with the giants facing elimination he ended four innings with outs he struck out in his first two atbats , then flied deep to left field in the fifth and to center field to end the game with fireworks exploding outside the centerfield fence , bonds trotted back to the dugout and almost collided with a television cameraman who had sprinted on the field to capture the mets hugging each other and jumping around his lack of production in the past week was a mystery to bonds he hit 323 against the mets in 31 atbats this year he mentioned that the giants might have scuffled against jones because they had not faced him this year , and he also said that it was hard to pick up pitches because the game started late yesterday afternoon but he did not want to use either factor as an excuse the mets , he said , pitched him the way they always do and jones got on a roll he was n't keeping us off balance , and he was n't tricking us , kent said i just think we were being too aggressive because our backs were against the wall that aggressiveness led to frustration as dusk rolled in and the shadows went away mark gardner , the losing pitcher , said , guys kept coming back to the dugout saying , 'we 're going to get this guy' it just got harder and harder for us dusty baker , the san francisco manager , said he kept waiting for one of his players to pop one jones was not surprising any of the giants with his stuff , but he was getting them to hit the ball at the other eight mets it s not like we got completely dominated , baker said trailing , 40 , bonds belted a jones pitch far into left field the ball seemed to take a swan dive at its apex and landed in benny agbayani s glove around 15 feet from the fence it was one of those days for the giants , though bonds clearly did not want to talk about coming close of that long fly ball , bonds said , that really is irrelevant now , is n't it \? the mets' fans booed him every time he came to the plate , and a fan , in the orange seats right behind third base , waved a sign with an obscene greeting in fluorescent orange paint it delighted them that the giants' season ended with bonds making an out but he will be back he said that baseball fuels his fire he said the giants were ready to play after saturday s crushing loss , that no one was down , that the music was playing before the game as loudly as it ever has in the locker room i truly believe that one day god s going to bless me , bonds said the ballplayer blessed with so much talent was talking about winning the world series for the first time that day has been postponed for at least one more october photo barry bonds was 3 for 17 in the division series against the mets \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
the dozen police officers in the back room of the american diner and restaurant yesterday scanned their menus , ordered their meals and , as the waitress took their orders to the grill , promptly spun their chairs to face the television the trial of the four officers accused of murdering amadou diallo last year was being televised live on the set over the soup pots for the police , it had a mesmerizing hold throughout the city this week , in pubs and restaurants frequented by the police , in precinct houses and transit commands , at one police plaza and in officers' homes , the refrain was the same do n't touch that dial everybody is watching this , as much as they can , said a plainclothes officer who sat in the back room of the diner , at east 20th street and second avenue he predicted that the four officers would be acquitted the rarest of events was unfolding a state supreme court justice ruled last month that the diallo trial could be televised so when the trial began this week , police officers around the city gravitated toward the television , where they could see their fellow officers , live from albany , and listen firsthand as witnesses described the events surrounding a shooting that left an unarmed mr diallo dead not since 1993 , they said , when corrupt officersturnedinformers commanded a citywide television audience at the mollen commission hearings , had they seen anything like it of course the officers drew distinctions between the diallo trial and the mollen hearings , during which police officers spilled details of illegal beatings , shakedowns and drug deals in the trial televised this week , they said , the officers on television seemed more like them for example , one officer said that he , like the accused officers , had worked in an anticrime unit , aggressively patrolling neighborhoods in plain clothes he said he understood the pressures and confusion of some encounters on the street , and how , in an instant , a mistake in identity or judgment could end in a horrible shooting it s a terrible tragedy , he said and it could happen to any one of us on any day , another officer at his table said , finishing the sentence as for mr diallo , who died on his doorstep in a fusillade of 41 bullets , the second officer said it s terrible it seems like he was a good guy while police officers huddled in front of televisions during their lunch and coffee breaks , a senior officer said the entire trial , which was being televised on court tv , was being videotaped by the department and might be used in future training films even from our mistakes , we can learn , he said none of the 18 officers interviewed for this article , all of whom requested anonymity , doubted that the officers who shot mr diallo had made a mistake but nearly all wondered whether it was a criminal one they said the unedited televised coverage of the trial would provide the answers in a shooting shrouded in gray it s a very debatable case , said a transit officer near a platform on the no 1 and 9 subway lines what were the light conditions \? who was where \? what were they thinking and seeing \? what was diallo doing \? this stuff matters because the answers to these questions are potentially complicated , the transit officer said , the trial had been on television almost continuously in his transit command center and was the talk of his peers for his part , he said , he had watched the case from home but was trying to avoid it at work i wanted to watch it on my 20minute break , he said but i was worried i 'd get hooked on it , and then my boss would find out and i 'd get all jammed up patrick j lynch , president of the patrolmen s benevolent association , the city s police union , said that its members were grateful that the witnesses' testimony was available to the public this can help the public understand what police officers go through , he said we think it s good that the folks can sit down and watch and see the facts , instead of the misinformation that has surrounded the case still , some officers said the televised testimony was a mixed blessing one said that even if the four officers are acquitted , they will be so widely recognized they will have trouble working again in the neighborhoods another officer said that he had faced more hostility on the street this week , which he attributed to ill will from residents who were watching the trial so far today three people have told me off , out of the blue , he said , at his post on the upper west side some officers watching the testimony noted that it was at times dramatic at one point , shortly before noon , the television showed an assistant district attorney , paul rosenfeld , questioning debbie rivera , a witness who lives across the street from where the shooting occurred mrs rivera testified that she was looking out her window that night and saw the officers closing in on the door to mr diallo s apartment building as she returned to her sofa , she said , she heard the shooting when mr rosenfeld asked her to imitate the noise by tapping her finger on the witness box , ms rivera softly beat out two brief drum rolls inside the american diner and restaurant , the back room was quiet

music silence by rose tremain 485 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 25 rose tremain s new novel takes place in and around copenhagen in the early 17th century , a good three decades after shakespeare provided the skinny on what was going down at elsinore a few centuries earlier but things are still pretty rotten in the state of denmark king christian iv s treasury is depleted and his latest moneymaking schemes have come to naught his second wife , kirsten munk , openly despises him and is having an affair with a german count as for christian s aging mother , queen sofie , she has turned into a goldhoarding miser who would n't dream of helping her son out of his financial difficulties sent into an inebriate tailspin by these woes , christian looks for solace to his court musicians especially one angelic english lutenist , peter claire , who dares not speak of his own romantic frustrations to such a lovelorn king will harmony find a way to win out \? or will sterile silence prevail \? that s the premise of tremain s latest novel , and for admirers of her best book , restoration , it looks promising the glimpse of court life the tentative musicenhanced friendship of lutenist and king the shrewish outbursts of the musichating kirsten these are ingredients that could add up to something marvelous why then does music silence , winner of britain s prestigious whitbread award , feel so choppy and flat \? one reason is tremain s use of the present tense throughout the book , which all too often comes across not as urgent or immediate but as static and affectless , especially in straightforward expository passages manic monologues in the present tense are another matter , though , and kirsten s account of her own sexually voracious egomania is the liveliest thing in music silence whether she s holding forth on how mirrors make her look fat , how children are nothing but barbarous monkeys or how she wishes she were a man so that i could attack somebody with a lance , she s the bad girl you love to hate a busty and lusty early feminist true , she s a bit simpleminded , but at least she has energy her presence in the book is much diluted , however , by others tremain has crammed into the narrative , most of them less animated and all of them presented in a listless , droning manner the cast is extensive peter claire , of course , is in the forefront he s beautiful , talented , wistful , considerate and , alas , incredibly dull \( although he does hedge gracefully when discussing matters of love with king christian \) then there s christian himself cuckolded , miserable and as dimwitted as his wife , given that his one idea for jumpstarting the danish economy is to get his mother to give him her money so he can try his hand once again at silver mining in norway also playing a key role is emilia tilsen , a jutlander who becomes kirsten s servant peter falls for her immediately perhaps because she s so dull \? true , she has a pet hen and a kid brother with a psychiccosmic bent and a sexhappy stepmother who has seduced emilia s widowed father and is threatening to have her way with his teenage sons but none of this adds to emilia s own intrinsic interest in supporting roles we have kirsten s mother , hatching some schemes of her own christian s longdead best friend , whom he seems to mourn more than his first wife peter s family back in england , including his jolly \( but still dullish \) prospective brotherinlaw peter s former employer \( and lover \) , the countess o'fingal and many more with all these characters taking their turns at center stage , music silence is intricately structured , not just in its action but in the elaborate pattern of imagery to do with music , silence and , more eccentrically , buttons that tremain twines around her narrative snippets frustratingly , this yields no correlating intricacy of theme or subject matter the characters , once outlined in broad strokes , do very much what you 'd expect occasionally , surprising things happen to them illness , robbery , betrayal but the greatest insights these setbacks induce are realizations that acceptance is the harshest lesson life teaches and the one most important to learn , or that a human life led without love is not worth living not exactly stopthepresses epiphanies , yet tremain offers these hoary platitudes as if they were news to the world missing altogether is a sense of complex characters locked dynamically into complex fates christian repeatedly complains about denmark s decadent noblemen , yet we do n't meet a single one of these highliving feudal lords kirsten caterwauls about being ostracized from court life , but we hardly glimpse it at all the terms in which tremain tells her story are those of fairy tale an influx of cash will solve everything separated lovers will find bliss once reunited evil souls will get a taste of their own medicine but at almost 500 pages , music silence needs more going on upstairs than fairytale palliatives the book also has problems in its dialogue , which sometimes reads like bad translation , outright parody or both \( foul war ! christian fumes worse than plague ! war more terrible than all ! \) in the absence of absorbing characters , the reader starts to examine more closely the accuracy of the historic detail did 17thcentury norwegian villages really have no access to poultry unless it was imported from denmark \? would russian engineers trying to reach that norwegian silver mine really not know how to prepare for winter travel , thus succumbing to frostbite and starvation en route \? maybe so , but tremain does n't make you believe it a few episodes work in the fabular way she intends the best one concerns the countess o'fingal s husband , who is driven insane by a melody he dreams but ca n't recreate in the light of day still , the novel s engaging moments are far too intermittent these are rich times for historical fiction any era that can offer the likes of hilary mantel s place of greater safety , ferdinand mount s jem \( and sam \) , c s godshalk s kalimantaan , john vernon s peter doyle and any of penelope fitzgerald s period fictions is a veritable golden age tremain s restoration , an allofapiece tale about a scheming social climber in the court of charles ii , has its place in this impressive lineup music silence , unfortunately , falls far short of the mark
i would have liked to have been a justice of the supreme court for one case , yes , mario m cuomo said it would have been this case mr cuomo son of a ditch digger , threeterm governor and never quite presidential candidate was boiling mad he rejected a seat on the united states supreme court , he has said , because he feared it would be the equivalent of having his tongue cut out he wanted to speak out freely on the issues speak out he has as the world stared in fascination , disbelief and not a little disgust at america s marathon election drama , his bulletshaped head became a staple on television as he was approached by stations from upstate new york to the british broadcasting corporation to mr cuomo , 68 \( and still playing a mean game of basketball \) , the drama is evidence of an ever fiercer level of partisanship by republicans he likens it to the way they pounded on his 20 vetoes of death penalty legislation to beat him in 1994 they are ugly people , and they behave in ugly ways , he said he doubts that anyone could have swayed the five justices opposed to a recount but he said he felt energized , not discouraged , by the court s ruling the game is now more exciting than ever , he told his wife , matilda , at 1 am wednesday she replied , you 're impossible he said thanks a lot , sweetheart goodnight political passions still run high in this child of illiterate parents , who was rejected by the city s elite law firms because two summa cum laude degrees were canceled out by his italian background , who went on to fight for the underdog in queens and then held high state office for 20 years along the way he made a speech or two , including the stirring address to the 1984 democratic national convention a generation of new yorkers learned to love or loathe but never ignore him still , some things have changed the cuomos live on sutton place south he glides around manhattan in black cars he has a majestic view of manhattan from his law office window , and he says almost all his legal colleagues are republicans once known for never leaving albany , he now travels often to europe he no longer commits thoughts to his famous diary his queens roots , which once loomed like lincoln s log cabin , seem now as distant as the view from his apartment window in 1995 , his superb voice touched souls at the funeral of his beloved 92yearold mother , immaculata then he went straight back to his office at wilkie farr gallagher to put in some billable hours sometimes he does n't even sound like a liberal i'm representing wealthy people , trying to make them wealthier , he said mr cuomo s world turned upside down around 9 pm on nov 8 , 1994 , when he knew for sure that he had lost his bid for a fourth term as governor , losing to george e pataki a realization hit him i have no home , i have no job , i have no money , he thought at 1 30 am , in the pitch darkness over the hudson river , the helicopter taking him back to albany dipped sharply , and the governor remembered something else he had only 200 , 000 in life insurance i got to thinking that if the plane had gone , matilda would have had to live with one of the kids because i did n't have any money , he said how could i get myself into this predicament \? the short answer was that he had been busy with a succession of state offices , being secretary of state and lieutenant governor before winning the top job in 1982 unlike previous secretaries of state , he had given up his law practice , and he declined gubernatorial pay raises the long answer was that he had been on a crusade to preach his vision of a sweeter his favorite adjective america , in which people look after one another and the government cares his foes saw only a prima donna on an awesome ego trip , a selfinvolved hamlet on the hudson , but his eloquent speeches roused people in ways politicians seldom do anymore then he lost maybe new yorkers were tired of him , or regarded his quest for a fourth term as plain greedy maybe most agreed with the victor , mr pataki , that new york state taxes were too high even democrats criticized his failure to build a stronger party but mr cuomo drew solace from election day exit polls showing that 60 percent of new yorkers thought him a man of great integrity who cares about me he is not shy in offering excuses for his loss the lingering effect of gov nelson a rockefeller s taxes , president reagan s budget cuts , the recession of the early 90 s a few days after the election , the phone rang and on the other end was the unmistakable bray of former mayor edward i koch mario , do not be depressed , mr koch said there is life after death look at me , and you will do everything i'm doing and more like mr koch , mr cuomo now works as a lawyer , writes articles for new york newspapers and has a radio show the show , me and mario \( broadcast on wamc in albany and carried by 46 stations \) , features mr cuomo and the radio host alan chartock discussing issues from baseball to the definition of judaism to the death of mr cuomo s dog , ginger
the schedule said yesterday was opening day at shea stadium , but it was really mother s day only derek bell did n't send his mother a card none of that sappy hallmark stuff for him no overpriced flowers either let the roses wilt no , derek bell gave his mother a unique present and he sent it special delivery with his mother in the stands , the mets' new right fielder hit a tiebreaking home run in the eighth inning that produced a 21 victory over the san diego padres it was probably the most thoughtful present for an athlete s parent since mark mcgwire hit his 61st home run in 1998 on his father s 61st birthday , with his father in the stands in st louis i go to all of the opening games , chestine bell , a resident of tampa , fla , said in the mets' dugout after the game this is the first time he hit a home run and won the game that s exciting i got chills bell is one of the new members of the mets he came to them as a required throwin with mike hampton , the 22game winner the mets wanted for the no 1 spot in their starting rotation the houston astros wanted to shed bell s 5 million salary and told the mets , in no uncertain terms , you want hampton , you take bell steve phillips , the mets' general manager , said ok when steve phillips called me , bell said , i told him 'you got the good end of the deal because they gave me away you got a guy who can steal bases for you , a guy who will get some rbi , produce runs , play some good defense , throw some guys out and is a great guy in the clubhouse and a great team player' so i told him , 'hey , you got a good deal to throw in derek bell' bell was expendable to the astros not only because of his salary and his status as a potential free agent after the season , but also because he had the worst season of his eightyear career last year his 236 batting average , 12 home runs and 66 runs batted in did not bode well for the future , the astros felt playing down his injuryinterrupted season , bell said the first time i had struggled in nine years and people were writing me off it was like i had done this for a couple years i just had an off year there was nothing wrong with my year last year i told myself , 'there s nothing wrong with you , just come here and relax and have fun' before the game , phillips was detailing why he thought the mets had a better team than last year , when they won 97 games and the wildcard spot in the national league playoffs we 're expecting derek bell to bounce back a little bit , he said , citing one of his reasons chestine bell did not travel to japan to see her son play his first game with the mets the north american opener would be good enough my mom has n't missed an opener of mine since i 've been in the big leagues , said bell , who threw out a cubs runner at the plate in the second game of last week s twogame series in japan jeff bagwell teased me last year he said , 'you never do bad in front of your mom , ' and today i did well as he stepped to the plate to face donne wall with two out in the eighth inning of the 11 game , bell looked into the stands behind home plate when she s here , he said , i always look at her each and every atbat i look at her and she says , 'hey , let s go' in this particular instance , bell said , he wanted to keep the inning going by getting on base ahead of edgardo alfonzo and mike piazza i wanted to draw a walk or get a good pitch and drive it , he said if he had reached base , he had planned to steal , another of his attributes but there was no need to steal bell got a good pitch and drove it over the leftfield fence stepping on home plate , he pointed to his mother every time i do something i point to her , especially when i hit a home run , said bell , whose father left when he was 10 years old it s just been me and my mom for the past 21 years she s my mom and my dad , my girlfriend , my wife she s everything to me people know how special me and my mom are and how much she means to me the mets' faithful let bell know what he meant to them at that particular moment yesterday they saluted him with a thunderous ovation and demanded a curtain call , something he had never experienced in toronto , san diego or houston it was awesome , bell said , still savoring the moment unbelievable photo derek bell pointing toward his mother after homering in the eighth inning yesterday \( barton silverman the new york times \)
norman , okla , oct 27 it is the little things , like the oranges that are showing up on campus again it is the big things , like barry switzer , the favorite son and former coach , showing up on the sideline it is the familiar things , like talkradio programs buzzing with all things sooners it is the forgotten things , like a big game in october against a bitter rival it is something oklahoma fans have awaited for 12 long years the undefeated sooners \( 60 \) versus the undefeated cornhuskers \( 70 \) on saturday , with both teams carrying hopes for an orange bowl appearance and dreams of a national championship nebraska is no 1 in the bowl championship series ranking , oklahoma no 2 their rivalry is dotted with great names and bitter history the coaches bud wilkinson and switzer and the players joe washington and billy simms on the sooners' side bob devaney , tom osborne , johnny rodgers and roger craig on the cornhuskers' side nebraska ended oklahoma s 74game conference unbeaten streak in 1959 the sooners have handed nebraska its only loss of the season five times nebraska has outscored the sooners , 17928 , in their last three meetings their last game , nebraska s 697 rout in 1997 , was the most lopsided in the 78year history of the series the key to turning around a program is buying into that program , oklahoma s current quarterback , josh heupel , said when you do that , you win games when you win games , you get respect heupel never stops sounding like the son of a football coach , which is what he is his father , ken heupel , is the coach at division ii northern state university in aberdeen , sd after switzer coached his final game in 1988 , the sooners went through three head coaches , none of whom were able to unite the university s powerful constituencies switzer s immediate successor , gary gibbs , resigned after the 1994 season despite a 44232 record and persevering through two years of being banned from bowl games for national collegiate athletic association violations the program incurred under switzer alumni and boosters were unhappy with his 2151 mark against three major opponents texas , colorado and nebraska and they let him know it by flying planes over memorial stadium with banners urging him to move on howard schnellenberger , who had won a national championship at miami , was forced out after a single 551 season he tangled with the school s president , david boren , and alienated his players with a hardnosed swagger that permeated throughout a staff he had brought with him from his previous job at louisville the threeyear tenure of john blake , a former sooners player , was the worst in oklahoma history blake , who was an assistant with the dallas cowboys before returning to oklahoma , shuffled quarterbacks , abandoned his offense and tried to install the wishbone he was dismissed after compiling a 1222 record safety j t thatcher , who started at running back as a freshman under blake , played in that 1997 loss to nebraska there were too many people going different ways thatcher said of the lean times there was not enough trust the missteps finally ceased in december 1998 , when oklahoma hired bob stoops , then a 38yearold defensive coordinator for steve spurrier at florida who also helped bill snyder rebuild the program at kansas state stoops , playing against type , installed something the sooners' faithful had not seen much of from their own team a wideopen passing offense he s been mentored by two widely different coaches in snyder and spurrier and taken the best from both of them , said merv johnson , who was the assistant head coach under switzer and is now an assistant athletic director at oklahoma unlike a lot of defensive coaches , he understood you got to open it up and move the football and score points he got that from steve , along with a sense of fun from bill he learned the attention to details and a work ethic that makes your assistants and players accountable stoops s mantra is balance , an emphasis he attributes to his time with spurrier he displays it administratively by holding dinners for his staff and their families every other wednesday and by scheduling the first meeting of the day for 8 45 am , so his coaches can get their children to school he demonstrated it by asking switzer to speak to his team and stand on the sideline , so the sooners' glorious past could be linked to their promising future stoops also showed it on the field this year when , after a 75 season last year , he decided the sooners needed to run the ball more , to give the defense time to rest the fulcrum on which this onfield balance swings is heupel , one of the most unlikely heisman trophy candidates to emerge in some time heupel , a senior , began at division iaa weber state in ogden , utah after a season , he transferred to snow junior college in ephraim , utah he was an allamerican but unwanted by most bigtime programs until stoops s offensive coordinator , mike leach , stumbled across heupel s videotape leach knew he had found the right quarterback to run a spread offense , so he called heupel and left a message on his answering machine , offering him a scholarship heupel showed up here in january 1999 and so haunted the weight room and cultivated his teammates that he was elected captain four months later this was before he had played his first game as a sooner or stoops had coached his first game here last season heupel passed for 3 , 460 yards and 30 touchdowns , broke 13 school passing records and was named big 12 offensive newcomer of the year leach , now in his first year as head coach at texas tech , has called heupel the best quarterback in the country from the neck up this season heupel has completed 686 percent of his passes while throwing for 1 , 894 yards and 11 touchdowns two weeks ago , in oklahoma s 4131 upset of kansas state , then no 2 in the associated press poll , he got knocked down 14 times and still completed 29 of 37 passes for 374 yards but heupel also demonstrates why he is considered a thinking man s quarterback the point is to get in the right place and in the right situation and take care of the ball , he said if you do that , you 're going to have success there is a chance that oklahoma , 30 in the south division of the big 12 , and nebraska , 40 in the north , could meet again on dec 2 in the conference championship game but no matter how the sooners fare on saturday , heupel believes he knows where oklahoma football is heading we need to get back to the level where it has been , where it should be , he said the championship level
charlotte , nc rod autrey , a republican city councilman here , is a supporter of the death penalty in a state where it has long been entrenched but even in reiterating that support , mr autrey urged the council in september to approve a resolution favoring a moratorium on executions in north carolina the council adopted the measure , which calls for a twoyear halt while steps are taken to ensure that capital punishment is administered justly it s apparent to me that those with little resources are not going to get the same treatment as others , mr autrey said with a statewide moratorium campaign being waged by clergy , civic leaders , lawyers and citizens' groups , charlotte became the seventh municipality in north carolina , and the largest , to pass such a resolution since mid1999 the latest was greensboro , where the city council acted in early october with the support of three members who are deathpenalty advocates the north carolina cities joined more than two dozen other municipalities , including philadelphia , atlanta , baltimore and san francisco , that have also adopted moratorium resolutions none of the measures have the force of law capital punishment is a matter for the state legislatures , not local governments , and no legislature is actively considering abolishing its death penalty but the votes reflect an important shift in public attitudes , experts say a quartercentury after the supreme court allowed reinstatement of the death penalty , vast numbers of people , including elected officials , are expressing doubt about how it is administered nearly twothirds of americans approve of capital punishment , according to polls but that is the lowest level in 20 years and a significant decline from a high of about 75 percent in 1994 in addition , even the current figure drops further , to about 55 percent , when the polls offer life imprisonment without parole as an alternative one recent national poll , conducted jointly by republican and democratic organizations , showed that when reminded about cases in which death row inmates had ultimately been released on the basis of dna evidence , 64 percent of americans favored a temporary halt to executions while steps are taken to ensure that the system works fairly statewide polls around the country show similar numbers even some of capital punishment s staunchest defenders concede that there is demand for reforms one prominent death penalty advocate , paul cassell , a professor at the university of utah college of law , said that the public is obviously on board for fixing identified problems in identified jurisdictions , though not on board for a permanent abolition of the death penalty the reexamination of the system has been prompted by a number of factors , including a decline in homicide rates , the barrage of publicity given death row inmates exonerated through dna testing , and the execution moratorium declared in january by gov george ryan of illinois governor ryan , a republican who supports capital punishment , cited the exoneration of 13 death row inmates since illinois readopted the death penalty in 1977 and said he would permit no more executions until a study of a system he described as fraught with error was completed moratorium supporters also cite a columbia university study , issued in june , finding that two of every three appealed death sentences were eventually overturned , mostly because of serious errors by incompetent defense lawyers or the withholding of evidence by overzealous police officers and prosecutors the reassessment coincides with intense media scrutiny of gov george w bush s presidential campaign and his support for capital punishment in texas , which leads the nation in executions mr bush has remained firm in his position that the system in his state is administered fairly he has said that no moratorium is needed there and that he would oppose a moratorium on federal executions mr bush s democratic opponent , vice president al gore , also favors capital punishment mr gore has chosen not to make a campaign issue of texas' executing more prisoners than any other state , has voiced no support for moratoriums in states other than illinois and has said he does not think a federal moratorium is needed at this time though questions about the death penalty previously focused on the morality of statesanctioned killing , more attention is now being paid to the ability of government to administer the system fairly without racial , geographic or socioeconomic inequities and in a way that minimizes the risk of executing anyone innocent the moratorium movement has both inspired this change and benefited from it in explaining her support for the charlotte moratorium resolution , lynn wheeler , a republican city councilwoman who favors the death penalty , said , when you realize that the governor of illinois , who s a republican , called for a moratorium because there were 13 innocent people on death row well , that raises a question for everyone indeed , pat robertson , founder of the christian coalition , is among a number of prominent death penalty supporters who have said they favor a moratorium

john thompson waited patiently at courtside while patrick ewing fulfilled all his news media obligations a solid 20 minutes after ewing s baseline fallaway over dale davis with two seconds left had delivered the knicks a crazy , controversial victory over indiana , his former college coach embraced him amazing , really nearly 20 years ago , a gangly high school kid from massachusetts showed up at georgetown university to play for thompson he managed to have a professional career that has lasted into the new millennium through crushing playoff losses and catastrophic injuries , he can still bring the people to their feet the big boy is back ! thompson , the television analyst , bellowed on tnt as ewing s shot swished through the net thompson no longer coaches , just as larry bird , the indiana coach , no longer plays most of ewing s allstar peers from the 1980 s and early 1990 s are gone how he has aged better than hakeem olajuwon this past season is a mystery he had 20 points and 10 rebounds in the knicks' 8381 victory last night , made madison square garden as loud as it has been since the 1999 playoffs , took the big shots and made them at the espn zone in times square last week , a 20something knick fan opined that he could not stand when ewing started backing his defender into the post he said the big fella was too predictable as he gradually started his move on offense before either squaring up , fading away , ducking under , rolling to his right or overpowering a small defender underneath the rim the fan said that he and his fellow season ticketholders felt a negative energy each time the ball ended up in ewing s hands , as if the whole spreeallanandmarcus show had been preempted for classic sports reruns he ended his antipatrick soliloquy with this gem how many times has he delivered in the clutch \? you try to explain diplomatically your feelings about ewing , the player how he sent the knicks to the national basketball association finals in 1994 with a tipin against the pacers in game 7 how there would be no crunch time for the past 15 years if ewing had not carried a franchise of essentially role players on his shoulders how , deep down , buried beneath his proud and stubborn words , ewing understands he is going only as far as latrell sprewell and allan houston take him without larry johnson as a thread on both ends and the special dynamic marcus camby brings , ewing knows he will retire without a title but you ca n't get through to him you just say , watch him play , and leave it at that watch what he does at 37 years old watch the calls he gets that few players in this league still get , the kind of respect that makes the most veteran of officials , joe crawford , somehow allow ewing s offensive goaltending in the final minute , a play that allowed larry johnson s woefully short 3pointer to stand up even though it was actually tipped in by ewing negative energy \? the great thing about him the real beauty of patrick is that he s always been able to cope with people s impressions and perceptions of him , no matter how bad the things they 're saying are , thompson said he has never marched to the beat of what other people think about him never in many ways , beating the pacers last night was indicative of ewing s resilience and this backtobusiness knicks season the knicks have rebounded from a number of tough losses , none more crushing than miami s overtime victory on sunday off a fling and a 3point prayer from tim hardaway at the buzzer undeterred , they hunted down the team with the best record in the eastern conference we were emotional , ewing said afterward you guys give us a lot of flak about our backtoback record , but we played well enough against miami to win the knicks probably cannot catch either miami or indiana for homecourt advantage , a nice luxury in the later rounds of the playoffs but healthy bodies and minds mean more in may and june and given his remarkable stretch of doublefigure games in points and rebounds lately , ewing is healthy and happy as spry and agile as he has been at this point in the season since 1997 , confounding critics who thought he was physically done camby finally has his timing back , too he changed the game defensively johnson , his innumerable aches and back pains a major concern at age 31 , elevated two feet under the rim and threw down a vicious dunk over derrick mckey at the outset of the second quarter last night sprewell is finding an offensive zone again he erupted for 10 points in the first nine minutes when the knicks needed a score in the fourth , he nailed a long jump shot and moments later spun around jalen rose on the left baseline , softly dropping in a lefthanded scoop shot with less than seven minutes left in the east , it may come down to healthy bodies a month from now which feels better hardaway s creaky knee , rik smits s chronic sore feet or ewing s tired , old bones thompson is betting on the player he dined with after last night s game , the 30something franchise center who hit the gamewinning shot and again brought delirium to the garden , the gangly teenager he recruited all those years ago he s not the same as he was then , thompson said god , i hope not he s a mature veteran with a lot of game still left in him that s who patrick is if people knew how hard he worked to get himself ready for every game i do n't think i 'll ever be objective about patrick i ca n't

columbia , sc for a country like the united states that has kings only on chessboards , where nobility is a trait rather than a social class , where pedigrees typically concern dogs , there are a couple of peculiar things about this presidential contest the first is that most of this year s major presidential candidates arose from a privileged elite vaguely reminiscent of the nobility that the united states has always forsworn this is easily the most patrician cast of contenders in many decades , and the november general election could pit george w bush , a thirdgeneration politician who is the grandson of a senator and son of a president , against al gore , the son of a senator the second thing is that nobody seems to care my dad was a truck driver , said robert despres , a truck driver who watched a speech by mr bush in new hampshire when i was 6 years old , i knew i was going to be a truck driver , too so if he wants to follow his dad and he does well , it does n't matter to me in delaware , a whitehaired welder named fred dobrzynski said that he worked for a company that had been passed down from father to son and said of the political dynasties that s america ! i do n't really have a problem with nepotism halfway across the country in iowa , a retired teacher named larry hamilton shrugged at the thought of political dynasties in the united states we have this idea in the us that anybody can grow up to be president , but we also know that s not quite right , mr hamilton said it does n't really bother me and in the hamlet of wolfton , in central south carolina , wanda reese stood at the counter of her little general store and put it this way you ca n't hold it against them , just because they got some advantage if somebody came in here and gave me a sack of gold , i 'd take it in interviews in recent weeks , many voters said that the candidates had enjoyed a leg up because of their parentage but instead of being uncomfortable with this , some regarded a candidate s blue blood as a plus it would probably be an asset that his father had been president , debra l devine , a former nurse who is now a stayathome mother , said after a bush rally in new hampshire maybe he s had more firsthand experience it is not just mr bush and mr gore who grew up with famous names that helped them launch political careers senator john mccain s father and grandfather were both wellknown admirals and public figures steve forbes , who recently dropped out of the race , inherited his wealth and fame among major candidates , only former senator bill bradley is an exception his father , a banker , was a big man in a small town but not a politician paradoxically , although americans sometimes poke fun at political nepotism in countries like japan or at the doddering heirs who until last year filled britain s house of lords , it is probably the united states that throughout its history has had the most political dynasties john adams and his son john quincy adams were both president and three other adams descendants sought the presidency or vice presidency william henry harrison was the grandfather of benjamin harrison , and theodore and franklin roosevelt were distant cousins stephen hess , a scholar at the brookings institution in washington , calculated in a 1965 book , america s political dynasties , that , until then , 17 percent of members of congress had come from families that had sent at least two members to the house or senate it s fascinating to see this in a country that in its constitution prohibits titles of nobility , mr hess said in a telephone interview of course we have created a nobility yet he cautioned that while a famous name helped , a rule of thumb was that it simply allowed a candidate to start a career one rung higher than would otherwise be possible for a congressional seat , say , instead of one in the state legislature mr bush and mr gore may have been initially helped by their names , he suggested , but since then have emerged as contenders largely on their own strengths the success of second and thirdgeneration politicians this year may also reflect the good economic times and less resentment of privilege certainly none of the candidates seem bashful about their family backgrounds , and mr bush in particular refers to it in speeches in ways calculated to win applause when it comes to selecting parents , i did a fabulous job ! mr bush sometimes tells audiences , and they roar back in approval still , there has been speculation that former president bush s campaign appearances for his son in new hampshire may have undermined the younger mr bush , by reinforcing the perception among some voters that he is a lightweight riding on his father s shoulders since then , mr bush has been more restrained about having his father make campaign appearances some voters said that they thought there was something vaguely undemocratic about a system that produced so many second and thirdgeneration politicians , but they said it lightly and did not seem much perturbed it bothers me , because it s not democracy , said bradley j wilson , an iowa farmer but i realize that you can be from that background and still have good views while it may be that neither mr bush nor mr gore would have entered politics had their fathers not been politicians , there are also liabilities associated with the genes mr bush wrote in his autobiography that when he ran unsuccessfully for congress in 1978 , ronald reagan endorsed his primary opponent possibly because of fears that a victory would have helped mr bush s father if he had challenged mr reagan in 1980 it is difficult to describe the political aristocracy in this election as a trend , both because of the historic strength of political dynasties and because the last presidential election featured a race between two selfmade men , bill clinton and bob dole so why are this year s candidates so drawn from the social register \? perhaps it is a fluke , or perhaps it reflects the importance of money and name recognition in campaigns today scott harshbarger , the president of common cause , said that the prevalence of familiar names underscored the pressures these days of campaign fundraising and , in his view , the need to change the system for financing campaigns if you do n't have the money , you ca n't compete , mr harshbarger said noting that several credible candidates had dropped out even before the primaries , he added , the presidential selection process was bypassed bill sousa , a social studies teacher in merrimack , nh , said that this year s election might make it a bit more difficult to teach students that anyone can become president but , he quickly added , he already emphasizes to students that the political playing field tilts here and there mr sousa said that today s political aristocracy was not unlike the situation a couple of centuries ago in america , when wealthy plantation owners regarded themselves as an elite who would serve the country with honesty and dedication referring to today s second and thirdgeneration candidates , mr sousa said , that s what the founding fathers intended photos george bush , in the early years of his political career , posed in 1968 with his son george w after he became a texas air national guard officer senator al gore of tennessee and his wife , pauline , congratulated their son , al jr , and new daughterinlaw , tipper , at their 1970 wedding \( photographs by associated press \)

johannesburg , jan 14 south africa s name is famous around the globe , a legacy of the apartheid era that etched the country into the conscience of the world but left it a foreboding and unfamiliar place to many of the travelers it would now like to attract talk to travel agents in the united states or britain who specialize in south africa , and they report the same queries from curious but confused customers is there toilet paper in the bathrooms \? are the roads paved \? do the people speak english \? are there restaurants \? do we have to bring our own food \? anne bellamy , vice president of african travel in glendale , calif , has heard them all some people think all they eat is fresh elephant meat , ms bellamy said determined to dispel the myths , south africa has turned to madison avenue this month , the country makes its first major foray into the world of international marketing with an 18 million promotional campaign aimed at the united states , britain , germany , france , italy and the netherlands its emphasis is on enjoying south africa s exotic outdoor attractions and urbanity rather than experiencing the opening of a door to a new multiracial democracy in the united states , where travel to south africa jumped almost 25 percent from 1997 , to more than 166 , 000 trips in 1998 , the effort will focus on new york , los angeles and miami , the three markets where south africa thinks it has the best chance of drawing far more tourists for a country as big as the united states , the numbers are small , but the already increasing interest from the world s richest nation gives south africa hope it wo n't be easy , but we 're really making a start , the country s minister of environment and tourism , valli moosa , said by world standards , the campaign is modest , forsaking television in favor of more affordable media like newspapers , magazines and billboards but for a country that until now had placed just a handful of ads overseas , it is a huge step into the media age the advertising giant ogilvy mather worldwide , a unit of the wpp group , was hired to develop the campaign and the firm s johannesburg office , ogilvy mather rightford , has spent the last 18 months working with the country s tourism industry to design a strategy that will try to turn tourism into the humming economic engine that so many in south africa believe it can be to listen to the leaders of this new democracy talk about tourism , nothing less than the future of the nation is at stake widespread unemployment , poverty and crime have made employment one of the government s highest priorities with just over 3 percent of the south african work force directly employed by the tourism industry , and another 4 percent employed by related industries , the tourism business here still has a long way to go before it overtakes the country s mines , whose mineral and metal riches built modern south africa mining accounts for just under 11 percent of the nation s jobs , down from 1325 percent a decade ago but still the economy s biggest single source of jobs the tourism minister said he was confident that in just a couple of years more than 300 , 000 additional tourism jobs could be created in this country of about 44 million people we 've reached a point now where there is a consensus in south african society that tourism must be regarded as a priority , mr moosa said it was not always so for many years , south africa was ostracized because of its repressive racist regime promoting south africa , particularly in the 1970 s and 1980 s , would have been a waste of time that changed in 1994 when nelson mandela was elected president with little effort , tourism took off , albeit from almost nothing it did not take long , however , for it to taper off , as the curious came and went , and not all that many people followed you 've got to build for the future , and south africa did not , said malcom peasnall , the director of the independent traveler , a british agency that saw its bookings to south africa surge from none during the apartheid era , when the agency refused to book trips to the country , to 500 a year immediately after mr mandela came to power , before leveling off at about 1 , 000 trips a year south africa got a lot for free , but now they 've got to pay glenn van heerden , deputy chairman of avis south africa , the regional franchisee for avis rent a car system , and deputy chairman of the country s tourism business council , looks back on the days after the election and wonders where the country might have been today if tourism had had the attention then that it has now we probably had a golden opportunity to launch something then , he said , but it was obviously and regretfully not a priority now , he says , the industry and the government have realized that the country s vast potential will begin to be exploited only if they take their message to the people of the world to the people with the money and the motivation to make the trip nothing will sell in the supermarket unless it s on the shelf when you go in , mr van heerden said that is a welcome message to the travel agents around the world who , until now , have found themselves alone in their struggle to steer tourists to south africa we 've been playing the role of educating people about africa as a whole , geography lessons , cultural lessons , anthropology lessons , the whole gamut , ms bellamy said
pittsburgh like the fantasy pleasure dome of xanadu , the term movie palace conjures up a magical image a romantic time when the film world was bursting with technological advances , complemented by live entertainment in downtown pittsburgh alone , there were once eight such extravaganzas within a few blocks' radius , and in their heyday , the 1920 s and 30 s , people flocked to the cinema and to vaudeville acts in an atmosphere that dripped with gilded plaster and crystal chandeliers fast forward 30 years pittsburgh was in a financial slump but the pittsburgh symphony , thriving nonetheless , required a new home beyond the syria mosque gordon bunshaft of skidmore , owings merrill was hired to design a new home , but , to the city s eventual good fortune , the effort stalled then in 1967 henry john heinz ii , who had recently retired as chairman of the h j heinz company , made a momentous visit to the oncelavish loews penn theater , accompanied by the president of the symphony with a grant from the howard heinz endowment , the symphony bought the property and the rest is legend heinz hall for the performing arts opened in 1971 , with its plush threestoryhigh domed lobby and an arcade of corinthian columns with gilded capitals this became the turning point and the gold standard for an imaginative urban renaissance based on heinz s theory that the arts lead the way to economic development rather than destroying an old neighborhood to build a congested performing arts center , pittsburgh opted to create a performing arts district many of its cultural institutions are housed in the restored regal surroundings of its surviving movie palaces , scattered through a 14squareblock area that had been a redlight district it is now called the pittsburgh cultural district and is overseen by the 16yearold pittsburgh cultural trust on a recent rainslicked saturday night at curtain time , the streets were bustling with theatergoers coming from parking lots dispersed sensibly through the area or from neighborhood restaurants the thrill is enhanced by the great marquee of the benedum center for the performing arts , the former stanley theater , where the chaser lights are miraculously intact on a side facade of the center , flashing lights still announce stanley s photoplays inside , the immense barrelvaulted lobby and performance hall have been restored to their original palette of etruscan colors , with decorative plasterwork burnished with aluminumfoil gilt relighted with chandeliers , the entire space glows with a festive air that inspires the audience to dress up for the occasion , on this evening a performance of massenet s opera werther by the pittsburgh opera under the artistic direction of tito capobianco the cultural district here , which includes new public squares and parkland on the allegheny river , reflects a general mood in pittsburgh as the largest inland port in america \( the delta queen calls about twice a year \) , it is a true early gateway to the west at the majestic confluence of the allegheny , monongahela and ohio rivers , the city encompasses 40 miles of riverfront and more than 2 , 000 bridges , representing almost every style of engineering while this city boasts old , established cultural institutions like the carnegie museums of art and natural history and obligatory skyscrapers like the 1984 neogothic spires in reflective glass for ppg place by philip johnson and john burgee , there is a new vivacity that accompanies the emerging biomedical and computer science industries spurred by the research units of its major universities new life for old buildings one could say that pittsburgh s fighting spirit in the face of its loss of the steel industry comes from its namesake , william pitt , who as prime minister of britain in the 1750 s gave the colonists the wherewithal to do proper battle against the french after his forces captured fort duquesne in 1758 , one of gen john forbes s last acts was to name their conquest after pitt , whose spirit had made them , he said , masters of the place this story is inscribed on a plaque outside h h richardson s celebrated allegheny county courthouse and jail , two massive turreted piles of rusticated stone linked across a city street by a bridge of sighs providing secure passage for prisoners though pittsburgh s steel industry died , none of its other important elements did the city survived , unlike others caught up in a similar economic downturn to prove it , three department stores still do a thriving business downtown but there is a lot of vacant real estate , and the trick has been to renovate and incorporate the empty structures there into the texture of urban life in a practical , affordable , useful and beautiful way , said teresa heinz , who has carried on the family s philanthropic interests since the death of her husband senator john heinz iii the cultural trust s consortium , for example , includes two other theaters in addition to heinz hall and the benedum , with at least 1 , 200 events a year taking place in the district the opera shares the benedum with the pittsburgh ballet theater , the civic light opera , visiting dance companies and touring broadway shows now in its 61st season , the opera company has been staging four operas a year next year , a fifth , therese raquin , by the american composer tobias picker and commissioned in a joint production with the dallas and montreal operas , will be staged at the nearby 1 , 329seat byham theater , a renovated vaudeville hall the size of smaller european opera houses
when dave lenovitz gets in the car and heads out to places like detroit or des moines to scout about for surplus plates and bowls , his wife , julie gaines , continues with the work of running their store , fishs eddy they opened a third manhattan location june 15 at mercer and broome streets in soho \( their second store is at 77th street and broadway \) the dishes in the store are made of china for heavyduty use in restaurants , clubs and dining halls all are surplus or overstocked , and none are used , ms gaines said a 25yearold celery dish from the greenbrier hotel costs 28 and a dinner plate from trader vic s restaurant is 48 , while a usair saucer is 95 cents dinner plates from elmira college are 12 and plates from the international monetary fund 35 the new store , with 1 , 800 square feet on two levels , is slightly smaller than the original store at 889 broadway \( 19th street \) which opened 12 years ago and is named after a town in delaware county , ny , that the couple once visited this one is a little more focused , ms gaines said of the soho store , which devotes more space to the dishes and less to frills like dried roses , dish towels and tshirts drawing
if asked to say what you love about the metropolitan museum of art , you might think of mummies or shining armor or oldmaster paintings in curly gold frames you might even think of the grand central staircase , which , when you descend it , makes you feel like an affluent if doomed character in a turnofthelastcentury edith wharton novel but you probably would n't think of contemporary art virtually since it opened in 1870 , the met has been accused of snubbing the art of the present that charge is particularly pronounced at the moment , in the wake of an astonishingly candid article by the museum s director , philippe de montebello countless citizens of the art world are asking the same blunt question does mr de montebello hate contemporary art \? no ! he exclaimed on a recent afternoon i do n't hate contemporary art you 'd have to be stupid to say yes to that question but what i object to is the tyrannical attitude of too many people in the contemporary art world , who are so insecure that they think that a divergence of opinion about a work of art signifies hostility to the whole field of the hundreds of articles written about the brouhaha at the brooklyn museum of art , whose sensation show closes today , few have had as intense an afterlife as an oped piece by mr de montebello that appeared in the new york times in october in it , he lauded mayor rudolph w giuliani for his astute critical acumen and dismissed the sensation show as unredeemed rubbish \( the emperor has no clothes \) he went on to pick a fight with the whitney museum of american art , singling out a sculpture on view there kiki smith s tale \( 1992 \) , a crouching female figure excreting a trail of dark matter as disgusting and devoid of any craft or aesthetic merit naturally , mayors and senators make hostile comments like this all the time indeed , we would think they were falling down on the job if they did n't view cuttingedge art with grimeyed suspicion yet mr de montebello is not a politician at 63 , he is one of america s most respected museum directors , a man of vast cultivation and erudition , someone who speaks six languages and likes to spend his evenings immersed in the poetry of verlaine his mellifluous baritone has acquainted millions of met audioguide listeners with the higher pleasures of art so when he came up with an inelegant adjective disgusting to describe a kiki smith sculpture , he surprised a great number of people , not least of all ms smith , whose sculpture lilith \( 1994 \) , along with 19 prints , is owned by the metropolitan museum ms smith , a 45yearold new yorker , is known for sculptures of downcast women that helped turn the body into one of the buzz words of the current art scene it was n't in the met s interests for philippe to speak out that way , ms smith said of the article he got a lot of people very upset but i 've had years of therapy , so i can afford not to take it personally among her longtime supporters is william s lieberman , the met s chairman of modern art asked what he thought of his boss s article , the 75yearold mr lieberman coughed then he said gruffly that was his personal opinion it s not mine i 've loved kiki s work ever since i first saw it what is it with the met , anyway \? although founded as an encyclopedic museum that would ideally devote the same quality of attention to the modern as to the medieval , the met has had a notoriously troubled relationship with contemporary art picketed by cubists in the 30 s and boycotted by the abstract expressionists in 1950 , the met has practically made a tradition out of alienating each new generation of avantgarde artists i think , on balance , the met has a remarkably good record on contemporary art , mr de montebello insisted we have collected contemporary art since 1870 and we offer the most valuable thing for contemporary art a continuum , the chance to see it as a chapter in art history when you see the works of willem de kooning in this museum , such as his 'attic , ' you can go downstairs and look at the pompeian frescoes which de kooning states were especially influential in his work de kooning , of course , is not a contemporary artist , and has n't been one at least since his death in 1997 but mr de montebello , who was sitting in his spacious , booklined office , where the single most recent painting is a salvator rosa landscape circa 1656 , seemed reluctant to muse on the art of the 1990 s at all suddenly and comically , he mentioned he had hoped to become a stage actor during his harvard days , and recited a poem in russian with dramatic flair yet asked which contemporary artists he admires , he was considerably more reserved i 've survived 22 years as director of the met , he explained , by never expressing opinions about my favorites of anything when his visitor pointed out that his nocomment policy did n't prevent him from publicly expressing his opinion of his least favorite work the kiki smith mr de montebello said with amusement no , it s not my least favorite you do n't know what my least favorite is you have no idea !
vienna what really gets you is the red sweater with three white p s across the breast , the same handknit sweater a 12yearold boy named paul peter porges wore as he boarded a kindertransport from vienna to france on a wet , nasty night in march 1939 , one step ahead of the nazis that this particular sweater has survived and is part of a retrospective honoring his life and work , along with that of his wife , lucie , who also barely got out of vienna alive , perhaps symbolizes what makes this exhibition compelling the everyday details of life lucie and paul peter porges style and humor opened at the jewish museum of vienna on may 31 and runs through midseptember but it almost did not open the porgeses seriously considered canceling the show when jorg haider s rightwing freedom party became part of austria s coalition government both lost grandparents , aunts , uncles and cousins in nazi camps mauthausen is only 80 miles away and mr porges s parents spent two years in theresienstadt sixty years after they were persecuted here , peter marboe , vienna s cultural affairs counselor , presented the porgeses with a medal honoring them werner hanak , 31 , the curator of the show , said i wanted the city to honor them not as an excuse for what happened but as a thank you for their astonishing generosity they are first and foremost fine artists , amazingly upbeat people who have provided a positive link between vienna and new york lucie eisenstab and paul peter porges were born at the same maternity clinic in vienna in 1926 , when the city had a thriving community of almost 200 , 000 jews today there are only about 8 , 000 after different but equally dramatic escapes to switzerland from the nazi occupiers in france , they met and fell in love at art school in geneva and eventually emigrated to new york , where they were married , raised two daughters and still live in an interview at the museum , mr porges said why should i feel any more animosity toward the austrians than the french \? they were just as bad there was a cop in france who caught me at the swiss border , took me home and handcuffed me to the window while he sat down with his family to eat dinner today people forget that engelbert dollfuss , austria s 1930 s chancellor , was a dictator , he said he was meek compared to hitler , but he was a fascist too , he said next to them haider is a ninny the early drawings in the exhibition were done when mr porges was living at la guette , a school outside paris sponsored by baron eduard rothschild to protect and educate jewish children from austria and germany the drawings tell the story of a child who was ripped away from his parents and plunked down in a country where he neither spoke the language nor knew a soul aunty ella making schnitzel and pauly eating artichokes is a poignant drawing of a child longing for home his selfportrait in his red sweater with the caption i'm doing fine is a sweet assurance to his parents \( and himself \) that he is alive the other early drawings depict a world of violence knives , hammers , hypodermic needles \( the vaccination \) , bloodspurting wounds and hitler gobbling up europe in 1940 , eight months after he arrived at la guette , the germans invaded france , and mr porges began three years of wandering through vichy france until he was captured trying to cross into spain and sent to an internment camp near perpignan once again he escaped and was smuggled with 15 other teenagers into switzerland i was the only one who was n't turned back , he said the swiss did n't like the jews any better than anybody else but because i was n't yet 16 , they had to keep me his first work in america was a comic strip , pvt adam apple , which he drew for the united states army after he was drafted in 1950 eventually his cartoons became decidedly american , depicting ordinary people doing things like watering their lawns , playing with their dogs , getting their eyes examined he became one of the most published cartoonists in the saturday evening post and a member of the gang at mad magazine but it was the more subtle cartoons of the 1960 s and 70 s in the new yorker and playboy that captured his american style a typical suburbanite who watches his calder mobile shed leaves as the tree does outside his large picture window , or an assembly line of angstridden patients whose therapist is suspended above them on a chair attached to a pulley as the exhibition shows , mr porges s drawing style looked as if it had emanated from a person who had grown up in the united states lucie porges , on the other hand , despite a successful career in fashion design in manhattan , never lost her distinctively european flair after world war ii , which she survived without once being separated from her younger sister and parents , she went to paris to become a fashion illustrator and would have happily remained to design clothes had the army not prevented her husband from joining her in france after arriving alone in new york , she took her portfolio to the designer pauline trigere she was hired the following week and remained for 43 years the actual clothes she designed made of the most luxurious thick satins and brightly colored silks , soft woolen tweeds and furs are not part of the exhibition instead they are represented by large paperdoll cutouts that attest to her talent as a designer but do not show how the garments feel or how they fall more touching are the early sketches she did in paris , a series of watercolors of herself in her little room that breathe with the aspiration of a young woman setting out on her own after the war she said she had wanted to cancel the vienna show more than her husband did , but that in the end she agreed it was important to go forward at first i thought i ca n't go back and be honored by the city that chased me out and killed my grandparents , she said but then i thought about all the young friends we have made here , none of whom want haider and i thought , 'why let him ruin it for the rest of us \? ' i feel this show is like rounding out the circle a way of showing them we won at the museum , addressing the audience of friends and family , press and politicians in english , mr porges said this is more than just a show it s a happening and without my friends it would mean nothing then , lapsing into german , he added the night i left vienna my father and i walked past the park where i had played until the jews were no longer allowed it was early morning , and no one was around 'do you want to go in and look around \? ' he said but i was too scared then he took my face in his hands and said , 'one day you will come back , and you will be honored as a jew' photo paul peter and lucie porges at the exhibition honoring them in vienna \( peter rigaud jewish museum , vienna \)
when the american international group , one of the world s biggest insurance companies , holds its annual meeting in new york on wednesday , it will be confronted by several shareholder proposals challenging the dominance of maurice r greenberg , its chief executive none of the challenges is likely to prevail advocates rarely succeed in storming the corporate gates , and mr greenberg , at 75 , has for more than 30 years led what analysts say is consistently america s most profitable insurer but experts in corporate governance say the shareholder demands that aig create a more independent board underscore the gap between aig s management structure and prevailing practices at most american corporations they say the structure has also allowed mr greenberg to designate his 45yearold son evan as his successor , even though the family does not control the company of american international s 18 board members , 10 are company executives , including mr greenberg and his son , aig s president two others are consultants to the company , leaving only six truly independent directors in contrast , more than 90 percent of american corporations have boards with a majority of independent directors you ca n't question their success and their profitability , said john nash , founder of the national association of corporate directors , a nonprofit group in washington that sets standards for corporate governance but let s say the company starts to go downhill who s going to fire mr greenberg \? in its proxy statement for the meeting , aig denies that the board is run autocratically your board of directors stresses the complete participation of all members in the board decisionmaking process , it says a spokesman for aig said the company would have nothing to add to that barber b conable jr , a former congressman and past president of the world bank who is one of the six independent board members , noted that shareholder groups have pressed for similar changes in aig governance in the past one group last year got the support of 24 percent of the shareholders they make a pitiful performance , mr conable said what are these people yelling about \? aig has gone from a very small company in 1969 to a corporate giant that is three jumps ahead of everybody else in the insurance business we have some strong people among the outside people , people who are not easily rolled over some experts and advocates have taken mr greenberg s selection of his son as his successor as a strong sign of the senior mr greenberg s hold on the company the elder mr greenberg says he has no plans to retire for years , mr greenberg , who along with other executives controls more than 20 percent of aig s voting stock , has run the company as if it were his own and many analysts say that has been all to the good this is not some guy who is milking the company , said alice schroeder , an analyst for painewebber who has just completed a nearly 300page study of aig after five months of research he gives the company 100 percent of his time and energy his goal is to make aig the best company on earth , and he s very shareholderoriented still , governance experts say , aig is out of step with corporate practice board independence is critical , said nell minow , an expert on corporate governance who has coauthored three books on the subject and is editor of the corporate library , a web site that publishes corporate governance information \( www thecorporatelibrary com \) the single most important task for a board is ceo succession , she said , and that task cannot be accomplished right unless the board is independent in both practice and appearance people who have dealt with the younger mr greenberg , who did not graduate from college , say he works hard and seems devoted to the company but they say it is difficult to compare him with his father , who is regarded with awe throughout the industry the son has yet to be proven , said charles elson , a specialist in corporate governance at the stetson university law school that s not to say the son wo n't be good but you 'd feel a lot more comfortable if a nonmanagement dominated group had approved the succession one group raising a challenge is the presbyterian church \( usa \) , which wants aig to establish a committee of independent board members to select future board members decision making at aig is a very closed process dominated by one individual , and we do not think that is healthy in the long term , said william samplatskyjarman , who is in charge of corporate responsibility at the presbyterian church in her report on aig , ms schroeder depicts a robust company poised for further growth its compound annual return since going public in 1969 has been about 20 percent , ms schroeder said , compared with just over 9 percent for the s p 500stock index at about 115 a share , the company is trading at more than five times book value , or about twice the level of most other insurers and its market capitalization of about 178 billion is nearly twice as great as the next closest insurer , the german company allianz , at about 91 billion
clifton daniel , the courtly north carolinian who served as managing editor of the new york times from 1964 to 1969 after a career as a correspondent in wartime london , wartorn europe and the middle east , died yesterday at his home in manhattan he was 87 the cause was complications of a stroke and heart disease , said his wife , margaret truman daniel mr daniel s long , adventuresome and manysided professional life was once summed up in a magazine profile with the headline up from zebulon zebulon was the tiny lumber mill town in northeastern north carolina where he was born and reared and where his parents saved the income from the family drugstore to put him through college in the depression a smalltown southern background was something that mr daniel shared with his predecessor as managing editor , turner catledge , who was from philadelphia , miss and when mr daniel was married in 1956 , after many footloose years in europe and the middle east , it was to a downtoearth young woman whose father , like mr daniel s , had worked as a shopkeeper far away from times square the bride was margaret truman , the only child of former president truman , who had run a haberdashery in missouri we had a lot in common , mr daniel wrote in his volume of reminiscences , lords , ladies and gentlemen , which appeared in 1984 we were the kind of people who would n't marry anybody our mothers would n't approve of a couple of citified smalltowners , puritans among the fleshpots mr daniel rose to be assistant to the managing editor , assistant managing editor and then managing editor in that post he was the senior news executive of the daily times , outranked only by mr catledge , the executive editor , who oversaw daily and sunday departments from a vantage outside the newsroom as managing editor , mr daniel sought to brighten the newspaper with pungent writing , eyecatching photography and an emphasis on what many newspaper editors of the time disparaged as soft news mr daniel intensified the newspaper s treatment of society news , arts coverage and obituaries society news , which had been mainly dry wedding and engagement announcements , began to burst with spicy detail , human interest and social insights cultural coverage studied the flaws as well as the fame of important artists obituaries became less reverent in 1969 , mr daniel was succeeded as managing editor by a m rosenthal and became an associate editor , remaining in new york for four more years and working in a different area of journalism , as a commentator on the times s radio station , wqxr then the daniels moved to washington , where mr daniel worked as chief of the newspaper s bureau until 1976 earlier in his career mr daniel had won respect as a foreign correspondent on some grueling and unsettling assignments for the times in moscow in 1954 and 1955 , for example , he was the only permanent correspondent of a western noncommunist newspaper in the soviet union among his colleagues , mr daniel was known for an ability to imbue his writing with a strong feeling for the places and people he had seen of a drive through the soviet union , he wrote that he had found a russia that tolstoy never knew , where factories seen across the fields and mines with towering slag heaps are giving off steam and smoke , where hitchhikers , creatures of the motor age , are on the road with bundles and thumbs uplifted , while strung out mile after mile along the highway is a convoy of new trucks in moscow , mr daniel took his readers to the bolshoi theater , an ornate and refurnished relic of 19thcentury russia with burnished gilt balconies and vivid red draperies , where muscovites circled the foyer in pairs between the acts , seeing and being seen , keeping in line and in step , as if arranging themselves for a quadrille plain people , the women generally in flowered print dresses , the men in uniforms or the sober garb of civil servants from cologne , west germany , mr daniel described carnival time in the twisting narrow streets that run around the twin spires of the city s famous cathedral , hundreds of thousands of spectators swayed , rocked and sang and danced they cheered the brilliant costumes and scrambled for barrelfuls of candy that were thrown at them any girl who could be caught could be kissed and several policemen were tossed in the air by a gang of young men breathing new life into news pages when mr daniel became managing editor , he gave a gifted reporter , charlotte curtis , a mandate to write about society as news , encouraging her to provide shrewd and sometimes impudent reporting about high society and high life ms curtis continued that society reporting after she was promoted in 1965 to be the editor of women s news her title was changed in 1971 to family style editor , and she held the position until 1974 ms curtis worked under mr daniel for nine years , until 1969 , and strove to expand coverage of fashion , society , decor and family matters to reflect the conviction she shared with mr daniel that those topics should be treated with the same emphasis on news and lively writing that politics and sports received it was mr daniel who nurtured the career of the times s food writer , craig claiborne , and helped him become one of the nation s bestknown restaurant critics
the cincinnati reds had their cake yesterday , and they ate it , too icing \? they had plenty with their general manager , jim bowden , executing his strategy perfectly to the end , the reds acquired ken griffey jr from the seattle mariners for a bargain package of players and an even bigger bargain financially griffey , who wanted to play in cincinnati , his hometown , agreed to a nineyear contract worth 1165 million , an average of 12 , 944 , 444 a year , which falls 2 million short of the game s highest annual average salary last year , he rejected a seattle offer of 148 million for eight years griffey , who has hit 398 home runs in 11 seasons , will have a 125 million salary each year , deferring 55 million the first year and 65 million each year after that the deferred money will not accrue interest until he reaches the payout period , which will run from 2009 through 2024 the contract , which in presentday value is worth just under 10 million a year , has an option year for 2009 at a 165 million salary , or a 4 million buyout bowden , who two months ago ostensibly had given up in his pursuit of the player he says is his favorite in the game , sent the mariners four players , but none of the ones seattle wanted the mariners accepted brett tomko , a stilldeveloping starting pitcher mike cameron , a center fielder , and two minor leaguers , antonio perez , a second baseman , and jake meyer , a relief pitcher the mariners did not get first baseman sean casey , second baseman pokey reese , starting pitcher denny neagle or reliever scott williamson , last season s national league rookie of the year they did not even get travis dawkins , a goodhitting shortstop who is considered the reds' best minorleague prospect wow , an executive of another club said upon hearing of the reds' doublebarreled steal that gave the national league central the three top home run hitters of recent seasons griffey , mark mcgwire of the st louis cardinals and sammy sosa of the chicago cubs when we started this thing three months ago , pat gillick , the mariners' general manager , said by telephone from seattle , the guys that were rumored we were asking for , we were asking for but they never put them in the deal anytime we tried to introduce them into the deal , they basically would not talk about them not only did the reds retain the good players the mariners wanted , they also kept a lot of their money , paying griffey far less than a player of his caliber would normally command some members of management expected the players association to be upset with the contract because it was so far below market value , but donald fehr , the union s executive director , said the deal was understandable what it demonstrates , fehr said , is that contrary to the beliefs some people have , players do n't always insist on top dollar and other things matter kevin brown , a los angeles dodgers' pitcher , is the highestpaid player at an average salary of 15 million a year derek jeter is expected to wind up with a sevenyear , 1185 million contract from the yankees \( 169 million a year \) the detroit tigers recently offered juan gonzalez a contract said to be worth 140 million over eight years \( 175 million a year \) , and an executive of another club said yesterday he had heard that the gonzalez deal was done had griffey waited until the end of the coming season and become a free agent , he could have topped them all , given the mariners' offer that averaged 185 million a year but griffey wanted to play in cincinnati , where he grew up and where his father is a coach and supposedly the managerinwaiting this is something i dreamed about as a little kid , griffey said at a news conference in cincinnati , being back in my hometown where i watched so many great players around the city , fans posted signs saying , welcome home as one of baseball s lowrevenue teams , the reds usually are paring payroll , not expanding it with an eightfigure annual salary but once the mariners announced last november that they planned to trade the 10time allstar because he did not intend to sign a new contract with them , the reds jumped into the pursuit a month later , the reds became the only team griffey said he would accept a trade to he had that right as a player who has played 10 years in the major leagues , the last five with the same team the mets thought they had a chance to land griffey in a trade in december , but he rejected the idea two days earlier , dec 11 , bowden had declared the reds out of the chase , saying he would not give up one particular player the mariners insisted on having the general manager did n't identify the player , but he was reese and he was n't going anywhere bowden held to his position , and gillick eventually dropped reese from their talks still , the talks were going nowhere because bowden resisted giving gillick other players he wanted but gillick was not dealing from strength an executive of another club said yesterday that a member of the mariners' organization told him that howard lincoln , the team s chief executive officer , ordered gillick to get the trade done because he wanted it out of the way so the griffey issue would n't become a distraction once the mariners began preparing for the season although brian goldberg , griffey s agent , had said his client would be able to play the final year of his contract in seattle , griffey had appeared to become increasingly unhappy at that prospect griffey talked about a death threat he had received by letter from seattle and said the threat was a sign that it was time to leave the teams , however , were going nowhere in their efforts to complete a deal reports kept surfacing that they were close to a deal or had a deal or would soon announce a deal but no deal was forthcoming on tuesday morning , chuck armstrong , the mariners' president , gave goldberg permission to speak to the reds it seemed like a good idea at the time , but it violated the rules only when two teams have agreed on a trade can one team talk to the other team s player , and then they have to receive permission from the commissioner s office but no sooner had representatives of the commissioner s office talked to the mariners and the reds about their transgression than the teams reached agreement on a trade and requested permission for the reds to speak with griffey and goldberg the commissioner s office granted the customary 72hour period , beginning wednesday , and the reds and goldberg reached agreement yesterday of the four players the mariners received , the one they seemed to want most was cameron , a 27yearold center fielder the reds obtained from the chicago white sox a year ago he batted 256 last season , hitting 21 home runs , driving in 66 runs and stealing 38 bases tomko is a 26yearold righthanded pitcher with a 2926 record for his three seasons in the major leagues last season he had a 57 record with a 492 earned run average in 26 starts and seven relief appearances perez has played two seasons in the minor leagues the 18yearold second baseman batted 288 and had 35 stolen bases last season with rockford of the class a midwest league meyer , a righthanded reliever , has pitched for three seasons , splitting last season between rockford and chattanooga of the class aa southern league when you get a chance to get ken griffey jr for those players , the executive said , that s a very good trade for cincinnati seattle got put into a box and could n't get out photos ken griffey jr , a 10time allstar who played for the seattle mariners for 11 seasons , will bring his 398 career home runs to cincinnati , his hometown \( dan levine agence francepresse \) this season , ken

washington , dec 8 preparing for the worst , al gore had sequestered himself with his wife and one of their daughters , kristin , in his study his aides , scattered in offices around town , were beginning to speak about the unspeakable how to orchestrate a dignified concession the vice president had been there before , on the edge of defeat , in the middle of election night 31 days earlier , when he phoned gov george w bush to concede he had driven through the rain to console his supporters , and was in the holding room awaiting that humbling moment but the words he prepared were never spoken , because the results in florida were suddenly thrown into doubt at 4 pm today , mr gore was again miraculously recalled to life , this time by the florida supreme court , which even members of his own staff had expected would dash his presidential hopes this is great , mr gore told an aide , carter eskew , who was on the phone with him when the ruling was announced i'm going to have some people over , mr eskew recalled hearing from a boss who is famously reluctant to show passion even in such a private moment for mr bush and his aides in austin , tex , where today s events had the same eerie echoes of election night , the news of the court s reversal left staff members staring in disbelief at television sets in disbelief mr bush , who had chuckled his way through a transition photo session earlier in the day , expressed astonishment that nothing had been settled a bush aide said we have no reactions left we 've had them all , and there are none left page a11 in washington , within two hours , the gore home , strung with white christmas lights and decorated for what had loomed and may yet loom as a gloomy holiday , was suddenly filled with two dozen people , all friends , advisers and staff brimming with cheer after some of the best news mr gore had heard in the postelection period this is like a new lease on life , said one jubilant guest who had been invited over to celebrate the fact that with the court s decision , mr gore trailed mr bush in florida by less than 200 votes in the endless ballot examinations and courtroom wrangling of the last month , he had never felt this close to triumph mr gore , ever mindful of his precarious political position , immediately called his legal team in florida and the rev jesse jackson , who had visited him wednesday night after a series of visits to florida to rally mr gore s black supporters there mr gore also received calls from democrats like senator tom daschle of south dakota , the senate minority leader , and senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts , who pledged continued support , even as mr bush s lawyers filed an appeal of the decision with the united states supreme court mr gore s running mate , senator joseph i lieberman , and his wife , hadassah , walked over to the gore house shortly after the decision the sun was setting , and riding in a car would have violated the laws of the sabbath when they arrived , they excused themselves for a private prayer , then rejoined the party an aide , whose family has been back in california while he works with the vice president on this endless election night , congratulated mr gore i feel sorry for your family , mr gore replied outside the vice president s residence at the naval observatory just outside georgetown , it was william m daley , mr gore s campaign chairman , who faced the cameras that had been assembling all day for the vice president let the count begin , mr daley said asked if he was confident the ruling would withstand mr bush s appeal to the supreme court , mr daley replied cautiously we feel very good about this decision some of those close to mr gore said that while he was obviously happy with today s decision , he maintained the same even temper that has characterized his conduct throughout the postelection ordeal he has been very measured in this , said mr eskew , contending that the vice president had been confident of success but had still been surprised at the scope of the ruling the real surprise was their ordering more than he asked , which he had offered but not in an official way , mr eskew said he referred to a televised address weeks ago in which mr gore spoke of the possibility of recounting ballots across the entire state , a notion that his lawyers never raised in the courtrooms instead , they had argued for manual recounts in large , heavily democratic counties in south florida but mr eskew tried to avoid the impression that mr gore was celebrating there s no question that everyone feels very good about this , and this is an important milestone , but in a journey that s going to continue , he said two hours before the florida supreme court ruling , two lowercourt judges had handed down opinions in absenteeballot cases that were adverse to mr gore s cause , and the spirits of many campaign officials had sunk in fear of impending defeat mr gore had been at the white house , quietly working for the third consecutive day on his transition , before returning home and sitting with his family by the television set aides said that it was his decision to be alone with his wife and kristin , who has spent much of the postelection period at her father s side meanwhile , gore aides were spread across town , planning the next and perhaps final steps in this postelection melodrama reports conflict about how far mr gore would have gone tonight toward a concession if the florida supreme court had ruled against him mr eskew and two other top advisers said that no concession speech had been prepared , nor was there any conversation about whether there would be a concession he added i can say pretty definitively that that s not the case there was n't wild confidence , but there was quiet and strong confidence another person involved said there were people in the campaign who said that if this does n't go our way , we 'll get out said a third we would have done something tonight , but we were n't as far along in that planning as some people thought we should be in the afternoon , gore aides had told reporters that mr gore might issue a general statement tonight if the court ruled against him and then would consider a more formal , televised concession over the weekend at the white house , about a dozen white house and gore aides huddled in the office of charles burson , mr gore s chief of staff , to watch the decision on television they went in expecting the worst and they got the best , said one person there when the court s spokesman , craig waters , announced the decision , there were whoops of joy people are beside themselves , said one the good news spread , swelling the ranks of celebrating aides a gore aide working in the recount committee s office at the democratic national committee headquarters said that the room erupted in jubilation when the announcement came a big cheer went up , there were people jumping up and down , this aide said the moment of celebration , the aide said , was followed by slight disbelief that the order was as sweeping as it was , as well as a bit of confusion aides immediately began assembling teams of democratic observers to travel to the florida counties where recounts were to be undertaken while there was joy among gore supporters this afternoon , some were more reserved , like roy neel , a longtime friend of mr gore , who is in charge of his transition team mr neel said that he was at home when he heard the news and that his pleasure was tempered by long experience in politics i 've just learned not to be surprised by anything , he said i try not to get too excited or too upset by anything like the old saying goes , 'it s not over 'til the fat lady sings , ' and

the soap operalike saga of the miami dolphins' j j johnson , who will most likely start at running back , finally ended late last week it did so with a cryptic statement from the national football league that said reports of his pending suspension for steroid use were in error and that he faced no such penalty the statement actually left more questions than answers about what happened in johnson s puzzling situation that may be a landmark drug case for the league johnson s situation again put under a microscope the larger issue of steroid use in the nfl and illustrated how difficult a job pro football has in catching players who use performanceenhancing drugs the nfl is clearly making an effort to catch cheaters masking agents and the more recent phenomenon of players blaming positive tests on dietary supplements sometimes thwart those efforts according to a dolphins official , it was indeed overthecounter musclebuilding supplements that were at the center of the johnson case the official said johnson failed his steroid test last november johnson appealed the suspension , saying the team gave him an overthecounter supplement that elevated his testosterone level , and he said he should not be suspended since the team gave the supplement to him johnson s version illustrated the problem with steroid testing in relation to supplements , since johnson s explanation created a large loophole in the league s policy here is what happened , the miami official said after the positive test , johnson told the nfl that he received the supplement from one of the team s trainers the trainer , however , told the nfl that he did not give johnson the supplement that led to his positive test the trainer was giving the supplement , a legal one , to many of the dolphins players , and none of those players has tested positive for steroids then , the miami official said , johnson changed his story and said he purchased the supplement over the counter when the nfl said that was not a valid excuse , johnson then changed his story for the final time , saying the positive test was because of the musclebuilding supplement creatine and because he had received it from the trainer , it was the trainer s fault this put the nfl in a difficult position the league did not necessarily believe johnson , the miami official maintained , but could not disprove his story even though the nfl sends players and trainers a list of banned overthecounter substances , some of those substances are not listed on the bottles of the products so it is conceivable that johnson used an overthecounter product that contained an illegal substance that was not listed last year a kicker tested positive for steroids and used a similar supplement defense he was not suspended the league gave johnson a similar break and did not suspend him the mandatory four games for a positive steroid test the johnson case was an important one for this reason aware that johnson s defense could reveal a loophole in its steroid policy , the official said , the nfl needed to take immediate steps to close it imagine if every player who tested positive for steroids could simply blame it on supplements so the league took action first , the nfl has recently made it clear to teams that blaming positive tests on supplements will no longer be tolerated then , about one month ago , according to several team executives , the nfl , in a memo to all teams , warned that any trainer who knowingly or unknowingly distributes a supplement that contained a prohibited substance is subject to a fine , as is the team before the nfl made public his successful appeal , the miami herald , cbs sportsline , espn and a sideline reporter on 'monday night football all reported that johnson was going to be suspended for violating the league s steroid policy last thursday , the nfl responded with a statement that said reports that j j johnson of the miami dolphins will be suspended for violating the league s policy on steroids are not true we cannot comment any further due to the confidentiality of the policy the ambiguous statement did not exactly exonerate johnson it did not say reports that he failed a steroid test were false was johnson fined \? was he warned that if he again tested positive supplement excuse or not he would be suspended \? no one will say what is clear is that johnson dodged a major blow to his season but as the nfl toughens its stance on steroids , any player who tries to cheat in the future might not be so lucky embracing black quarterbacks there was a time in the nfl when black quarterbacks were routinely discriminated against now , the league seems to be embracing the black quarterback in the 1999 draft , four black quarterbacks akili smith , donovan mcnabb , daunte culpepper and shaun king were drafted in the first two rounds if virginia tech quarterback michael vick declares himself eligible for the draft after this season , scouts say he would most likely be the first player selected black quarterbacks are aware of the changing nfl culture and of their place in professional football history when i was coming into the league , believe it or not , there were people still saying black quarterbacks were n't smart enough , mcnabb said , or we were only good athletes , or we could n't read defenses now people recognize everything we can do miller ruffles owner s hair several team executives and one owner went out of their way this week to bash the monday night football analyst dennis miller , who they feel is taking too many cheap shots at nfl personnel during the broadcast what seemed to irk some in the league was miller s reference to an owner s supposed toupee and miller s remarks questioning the competency of an official it was only a matter of time before miller began saying things that would upset some league personnel , who can be extremely thin skinned when asked if he planned to complain to abc sports or the nfl , the owner , who asked not to be identified , said not yet but it s only the preseason around the league general manager carmen policy of the cleveland browns met with nfl officials last week about his role in possible salarycap violations when he was in the san francisco 49ers' front office in an interview , policy maintained he had done nothing wrong and wanted to make clear he has no ill feelings toward the current 49er ownership philadelphia eagles running back cecil martin blocked for the giants' ron dayne when both played at wisconsin martin was told that in new york there was some worry about dayne s at times sluggish preseason the only people who should worry about ron are the people who will try to tackle him , martin said the jacksonville jaguars may be 25 million over the projected salary cap for the 2001 season , but they are not panicking the jaguars never use escalator clauses or voidable years in their contracts that means they have more flexibility when it comes to restructuring deals san diego chargers quarterback ryan leaf is continuing his comeback from oblivion after two disastrous years , leaf may be turning his career around after a solid preseason and will most likely start in the opener at oakland next sunday photo miami dolphins' running back j j johnson failed his steroid test last november but won an appeal to the national football league last week \( andy lyons allsport \)

orlando hernandez strolled from his locker to the trainer s room with so much ice wrapped around his arm from his right shoulder to his elbow that it looked as if he were lugging watermelons underneath the ace bandages hernandez was preparing for his start against the cleveland indians by using enough ice for a small barbecue bernie williams had a similar look yesterday as he wore a wrap of ice that resembled a flak jacket paul o'neill sat glumly as he waited to get a cortisone shot in his right hip derek jeter fell asleep inside the players' lounge , even as a rocky movie blared in front of him it was that kind of lazy day for the yankees another day to get ready for the postseason because , unlike the indians , the yankees' sizable cushion in the american league east gives them the luxury of resting players so williams and o'neill tried to heal , while jeter was given the rare chance to nap but hernandez pitched as some teammates rested and he was the primary reason the yankees stomped the indians , 63 , on a crisp , sunny day at yankee stadium hernandez retired the first 14 batters of the game and finished with a dominating fourhitter to delight a sellout crowd of 55 , 097 we need him to be right there , catcher jorge posada said we did everything we could to get guys out he was very good to catch it was a lot of fun he threw strikes and he was intense glenallen hill walloped a homer in the second inning , his 14th in 109 atbats as a yankee posada ripped his 26th homer , in the fifth and luis sojo filled in for jeter by doing an imitation of the shortstop with a single , a triple and three runs batted in while hernandez \( 1211 \) showed he was rolling into postseason form by winning for the fourth time in his last five decisions , the indians fell into a virtual tie for the al wild card with oakland , which beat tampa bay , 52 , yesterday manager joe torre says hernandez is pitching as well as he has since joining the yankees in 1998 because he is challenging lefthanded batters with fastballs and pitching economically , compliments that made the mysterious el duque incredulous that s joe torre , said hernandez , whose first words were how he refused to discuss what types of pitches he had thrown when hernandez was asked if he agreed with torre , he snapped , i do n't agree with anything but sojo talked about hernandez s mindset heading toward october when he revealed a conversation they had two weeks ago hernandez , who started the playoff openers in all three rounds last season and is 50 with a 102 earned run average in the postseason , conceded that he was peeking ahead he s preparing for the playoffs , sojo said he s not about stats he told me he s all about the postseason hernandez was the last yankee to venture onto the field yesterday , and there was polite applause soon after he emerged hernandez skipped over the foul line and stared at the ground for a few seconds when he reached the mound , perhaps uttering a prayer but the indians were the ones who needed divine intervention wearing long sleeves and sometimes blowing into his hand , hernandez threw changeups early in counts , used a moving fastball and had great control while striking out six , walking none and needing 98 pitches for the complete game hernandez struck out manny ramirez to open the second and pumped a fastball past david segui to end the inning after he made the dangerous hitters look feeble and the yankees scored three runs in the bottom of the inning , on hill s homer and sojo s tworun single off jason bere , the focus was solely on the pitcher when the yankees extended their lead to 50 in the fourth , the suspense was about hernandez chasing perfection he started the fifth by striking out ramirez and jim thome , and there was anticipation that he might provide a special memory in the bronx but segui lined an 01 pitch past second base for the first hit russell branyan homered in the sixth , and ramirez had a tworun homer in the ninth roger clemens is destined to start the opener of a division series , but hernandez will be a major factor , too torre would probably prefer to use andy pettitte in game 2 at yankee stadium , which would leave hernandez for game 3 on the road torre has spoken about the importance of the third game as a swing game , and hernandez is a comforting pitcher to have in that position even he has pondered it i think everyone that s playing in here is getting ready for the postseason , said hernandez , and that notion was much more visible in his actions than in his words inside pitch right fielder paul o'neill looked like a little leaguer whose game had been rained out after reinjuring his right hip while chasing a fly ball on friday , o'neill received his second shot of cortisone in three weeks yesterday he will miss at least five more games it s driving me crazy , o'neill said walking into the park today , it was a beautiful day you want to play a game o'neill was hampered with a fractured rib last october and a strained hamstring in the 1996 postseason , and he does not want to have a painful recurrence next month i think it 'll be gone , he said bernie williams \( strained right rib cage \) will probably start today chuck knoblauch returned after missing friday s game with a tender right elbow clay bellinger ended an 0for26 slump with a single in the second inning jorge posada , with 26 home runs , said he would rather tie , not break , yogi berra s team record of 30 homers for a catcher the yankees will pass three million fans at home for the second straight year today photos orlando hernandez retired the first 14 batters he faced to win his 12th game \( vincent laforet the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) glenallen hill made it 10 with his home run in the second inning yesterday , his 14th homer in 109 atbats as a yankee luis sojo had two hits , including a triple in the fourth that caused him to smile , and drove in three

a density of souls by christopher rice talk miramax hyperion , 2395 everyone has a devastating secret usually several in this exceedingly humid novel set among a group of wealthy , troubled new orleans teenagers first novels are often criticized for being languid and tediously autobiographical , but those are two criticisms that ca n't be lodged against christopher rice s feverish debut rice , the son of the novelist anne rice , has crammed his book so full of incest , rape , hurricanes and murder that it is simultaneously daft and disturbing the story focuses on the relationship of four childhood friends who , upon starting high school , promptly give up their games of hideandseek in lafayette cemetery and for somewhat mysterious reasons decide they are bitter enemies brandon and greg become brutish football stars who feel compelled to torment their erstwhile friend stephen , who is beautiful , sensitive and gay are they ashamed that they used to play sexual games with him \? does one of them still secretly long to \? meredith , the only girl in the group , becomes both alcoholic and bulimic , and begins an abusive relationship with greg , whom she hates none of it makes much sense , but it turns out that the parents of this dysfunctional clique have an intertwined and gothic history of their own , full of suicide , dementia and at least one longburied affair which leads to the bizarre revelation that a pair of young male lovers are , in fact , brothers this is bold , ambitious and wildly campy plotting but the book takes itself far too seriously to be fun it s scarily sincere and ultimately preposterous jennifer reese
for more than 35 years , loretta roberge and the brothers courtland and carlisle fowler have been integral members of the mohegan indian tribe courtland fowler remembers working together in the 1970 s to draft the tribe s first constitution , meeting in one another s houses because the tribe had no office , no typewriter and no telephone now the tribe operates the mohegan sun casino at its reservation off route 32 in montville , taking in an estimated 1 billion a year during the elections to fill the ninemember tribal council this year , none of the three longtime fixtures of mohegan government , people who were instrumental in getting the tribe federal recognition and later the right to build a casino , were returned to office neither was the former chairman , roland j harris we had a good idea who was going to be elected going into it , courtland fowler said i guess we just have to wait and see how it all works out he declined further comment , and his brother and ms roberge did not return repeated calls seeking comment as the indian casinos mature , the tribes are replacing the older leaders who ignited their good fortunes with a younger leadership with a different vision two years ago , the mashantucket pequots , who run the foxwoods casino , voted out skip hayward as tribal council chairman in favor of kenneth m reels mr hayward was the leader who had almost single handedly brought the tribe together and who had successfully fought for gambling rights when he ran for chairman once more a year later , he lost again marvin b roffman , a gaming analyst and principal of the new jerseybased securities firm roffmanmiller associates , said the elections almost seemed to be corporate power plays by members as the tribes' main business , gambling , becomes phenomenally successful it s amazing what happens when the money starts rolling in and the coffers start getting filled , he said , noting that both tribes had also replaced the professional managers who were initially brought in to manage their casinos when they get rich and powerful they want to do more things themselves anybody who does business with the indian tribes had better realize their future can be pretty tenuous members of both tribes either will not discuss the issues in the campaigns or will not discuss them for attribution outsiders say they think that the rapid growth of the two casinos played more a part in the outcomes of the votes than any tribal governmental issues when you 're running to be tribal council chairman , you 're also running to manage the casino and the huge revenue stream that it generates , and that s what s really at stake , said jeff benedict , author of the new book without reservation \( harpercollins , 26 \) , which criticizes the process by which the mashantuckets gained federal recognition the change in power at mashantucket was driven by greed and distrust , and to some extent by racial divisions this was a tiny tribe that has grown to more than 600 people , and it is filled with newcomers who have their eyes on the money , and the power that comes with it the changes continued this month when the mashantucket pequots elected two new members to its tribal council , charlene r jones and fatima c dames , who unseated gary a carter , a threeterm member , and antonio m beltran , who had served one term officials for both tribes said the leadership changes were simply part of the democratic process and no different than the results of many first selectmen and mayoral races around the state every two years as time passes , the electorate often seeks new leadership , they said a tribal nation is like any other democratic government , and sometimes that s what happens , said joseph a colebut , a mashantucket , and the tribe s director of state governmental affairs we have elections every year , and the people s voices are heard mark f brown , the new tribal chairman for the mohegans , acknowledged that there was a perception that the elections represented some sort of a coup and said that this notion had to be overcome people get the idea 'this guy has a machine gun and wears a beret' it s definitely an issue , mr brown said but i think when they see what this is really all about , people will realize it s not a major change in the government at all mostly what people need to see is that there are no drastic changes taking place certainly there are financial incentives to being a councilor in both tribes the 1 , 350 mohegan members receive an annual stipend of 10 , 000 as well as educational , housing and other benefits for council members , the stipend is 218 , 000 the vice chairman receives 318 , 000 and the chairman gets 408 , 000 though the mashantuckets have never disclosed stipends to tribal members or councilors , published reports have said the payments are about twice as much as for the mohegans mr hayward , the newly reelected chairman of the mashantuckets , who was unavailable for comment , was first elected chairman in 1975 , when there were only 33 members on the tribal rolls and he was the only tribal member living on the reservation at the time he was clearing trees for housing and trying to entice other members to move back

minnesota quarterback daunte culpepper made the smart throw in the face of a blitz , as he has done so many times this season , this time against dallas on thanksgiving day it was the third quarter , the vikings were in cowboys territory and culpepper , not wanting to take a sack , wisely threw the ball away his only mistake he missed a wideopen randy moss , who had gotten behind the secondary on occasion , this happens , even to hall of fame throwers , let alone young ones like culpepper on that play , daunte had a lot to think about , minnesota s offensive coordinator , sherman lewis , said , and a lot of people in his face moss was not so understanding he blew up , screaming at culpepper as he walked off the field culpepper snapped back and they went at it for several minutes , jawing before a national television audience then , as quickly as the storm erupted , it became calm again , the two shaking hands and making up and just to make sure there were no hard feelings , culpepper later found moss for a 36yard touchdown maybe they should fight more often on the surface , the chemistry between the two stars , one established in moss , another on the rise in culpepper , seems shaky but that is not the case they are actually extremely close like brothers , vikings coach dennis green said i have four older brothers and you have disagreements lewis said randy is an emotional player about two to three minutes after he erupts , he calms down , and he s fine this is the core of the 102 vikings , now perhaps the best team in football they are a solid , passionate team , led by two unlikely players some teams refused to draft moss two years ago because of offthefield issues and when green turned over the reins of the offense to culpepper this offseason , the coach was ripped by many in the news media as having lost his mind it is safe to say green has been thoroughly vindicated i do n't worry about vindication , green said i'm totally at peace we love coaching randy and daunte we think we 're the luckiest guys in the world we have two players who we rated as the no 1 player in each of their drafts randy moss was our toprated player in 1998 we had him rated ahead of peyton manning and we had culpepper no 1 in 1999 and we were lucky enough to get him culpepper was able to step in and perform at such a high level , despite this being only his second year in the league , because in addition to his talent , he has the benefit of working in green s system over the last three years , minnesota has a 359 regularseason record , the best of any team over that period if the vikings make the playoffs , which is a near certainty , then culpepper would be the seventh minnesota quarterback to lead his team to the postseason since 1992 dallas and san francisco are the only other teams to make seven playoff appearances in that span , and both did it with one quarterback at the helm in troy aikman and steve young green has gone to the playoffs with quarterbacks sean salisbury \( a career backup \) , jim mcmahon \( well beyond his prime \) , brad johnson \( good but injury prone \) , warren moon \( old \) , randall cunningham \( out of football for more than a year \) and jeff george \( a career knucklehead \) green s system is so quarterbackfriendly , he could probably plug in almost any player and he would do well stick in a talent like culpepper and you get this edition of the vikings , who could win a championship that is probably why green could not understand all the heavy breathing by the news media about his decision to let cunningham and george go and stick with culpepper green has made that kind of tough decision about the quarterback , rather successfully , a number of times green s formula for success is simple combine a fast running back \( robert smith \) with a speedy vertical game \( culpepper , moss and cris carter \) and you get a lot of victories while oncegreat franchises like green bay , san francisco and the cowboys have struggled under the salary cap , green is a lock to win at least 10 games a season because of smart drafting and the development of young players like culpepper , the vikings have not suffered a dropoff as for culpepper and moss , they said their highly visible dispute was well behind them that s just being the competitor that i am , moss said of the argument i think my whole team understands how i am and how i play they blitzed , and i was open for the first down it was n't anything that we 'll hold against one another daunte knows that i like to compete , and i know what i expect out of daunte , and that s just the best not from quarterback u you know , sometimes the nfl makes mistakes , it happens , st louis quarterback kurt warner said earlier this season as great as this league is , there are people who make mistakes in judgments about players warner was speaking of his own career you know his story undrafted arena league grocery store clerk signed by the rams and leads them to the super bowl , where he was the most valuable player the league needs players like warner , who come along and shake up the personnel status quo , forcing the league to say , how did we miss that guy \? even though warner s story is highly unusual , something interesting is happening across the nfl of all the divisionleading teams , none of the starting quarterbacks is from a traditional football university the miami dolphins lead the american football conference east and their quarterback is jay fiedler , who attended dartmouth in the central , tennessee is on top , led by steve mcnair , from alcorn state in the west , divisionleading oakland is quarterbacked by rich gannon , a graduate of delaware , known as the fighting blue hens in the national football conference , the east is led by philadelphia , where donovan mcnabb is at the helm he went to syracuse , known more for basketball than football in the central , if minnesota reaches the super bowl , it will have done so primarily because of the steady play of daunte culpepper his college \? central florida finally there are the rams in the west and warner , who will return to the starting lineup from a broken hand as early as next week , and he attended northern iowa gannon has passed for 792 yards and seven touchdowns in his past three games his 340 rushing yards leads afc quarterbacks mcnabb s four rushing touchdowns are the most by an eagles quarterback since randall cunningham ran for five in 1992 this season , warner and his backup , trent green , have combined for a 1095 passer rating , 4 , 104 passing yards , a 661 completion percentage and 32 touchdown passes culpepper has a 967 passer rating teams often scout the major colleges to find quarterbacks , and rightfully so that is normally where the best competition plays but on occasion , a player like warner shakes things up a lighter wallet the terrible season of the 29 cincinnati bengals is costing the rookie peter warrick , who was used to winning championships while at florida state , more than dents in his pride it s costing him cash warrick has only 37 catches for 417 yards the picture gets uglier when you look at his contract if warrick gets 801 receiving yards on the season , the team has to pay him a 500 , 000 bonus and increase his base salary 500 , 000 each of the next five seasons to reach 801 yards warrick needs to average 77 receiving yards the last five games considering the way the bengals are playing , that probably will not happen photo daunte culpepper , above , and randy moss have become an effective team \( agence francepresse \)
the night air vibrates as a steady stream of trucks grunt and groan on the elevated lanes of the brooklynqueens expressway below , street lights cast lonely glows on a barren block lined with rusting warehouses and a roman catholic convent , hard by the brooklyn waterfront it is difficult to imagine how this isolated spot in greenwood heights , a neighborhood named after a local cemetery , might claim any association with literary figures like madame de stael , gertrude stein or dorothy parker but on a series of weekend nights in the last year , a den of artists , writers , musicians and other performers , mostly college educated and in their 30 s , have gathered in an apartment on 25th street to create their a modernday version of a tradition dating back hundreds of years the salon apropos of this multimedia era , the evenings feature everything from music and dance performances to monologues , photography exhibits and even shadow puppet shows participants alternate between being performers and spectators , with binges of conversation throughout others just lounge about , taking in the performances and the chatter i have to read the words , but everybody is doing that tonight , said michael farkas , a musician and performing artist who , with his band , l producto , presented a new song at the most recent salon a few weeks ago that s what happens at these salons the greenwood heights salon has none of the celebrity status of the algonquin roundtable of the 1920 s at the west 44th street hotel , or the dark tower , a harlem renaissance affair that took place at a'lelia walker s upper manhattan town house , or the one at 27 rue de fleurus in paris , the apartment of gertrude stein but like its predecessors , the brooklyn gathering , which is run by mr farkas and his roommate , a performance artist named marc rosenblatt , offers artists and others a chance to gather casually in a cozy , friendly spot so they can socialize and share ideas and a variety of artistic expression the setting is a onetime warehouse that , according to neighborhood lore , was formerly a cattle hold on salon nights , mr rosenblatt and mr farkas convert their spacious loft into a compact theater , complete with rows of folding chairs and blue and black cotton curtains we are trying to create a space where people can bring and show work that is in progress , so they can work on it in front of an audience and get feedback in a friendly environment , said mr rosenblatt , who has worked as a lighting technician , a freelance photographer , a film art director and a set painter it seems to have worked as the evening opened , music , from kurt weill to sicilian folk tunes , filled the space a video featuring a performance artist known as pig lady \( elizabeth glamour of greenpoint \) was on a permanent loop in it a pigfaced woman sewed and ironed a green gingham dress in an image reminiscent of david lynch s film eraserhead one wall of the apartment was adorned with photographs of actors dressed as pig lady , and in the middle of the living room floor , a nearly antique phonograph spun incessantly , a small toy clown toy riding atop the turntable dinner started about 7 30 the menu included butternut squash soup , gypsy stew and tofu chili there were french baguettes and bottles of red and white wine as the performance space filled up , the evening s lineup was scrawled on a scrap of paper first up was what was introduced as one big long non sequitur , a monologue by mr rosenblatt loosely based on his grandfather s experience working as an elevator operator at a coffee warehouse in brazil halley devestern , a park slope singersongwriter who works as an office temp , followed with a new song , tentatively dubbed new york city happy song in what she described as her roots rock soul style , she crowed i want to be somebody s home , i want to live so long please do n't ask if anything is wrong for new york city , this is a happy song melissa ehrenreich of park slope presented an expressionistic shadow puppet show titled irma s first job in america , which through a different medium and style traced the journey of another immigrant grandparent ms ehrenreich manipulated cutout puppets while other guests rolled acetate across an overhead projector showing domestic scenes from her grandmother s storybook life the program also included music by greg boone , owner of a digital imaging company , and his girlfriend , shaleece haas , a documentary photographer , both from the windsor terrace section of brooklyn mr boone , who moved to new york from california two months ago , admitted up front that he was suffering from assimilation deficit disorder i was expecting some ranch house , with drunken , high people who were n't paying attention to you , he announced before beginning to sing as the lineup suggests , little about the affair was formal or elegant these gatherings , which have been held roughly once every two months for the last year , are more in the tradition of the bohemian salon that allen ginsberg presided over at the six gallery in san francisco , where people assembled in a converted auto repair shop for an evening of artinspired fun few of the greenwood heights performers make a living solely through their art , although they sometimes have gigs at places like mercury lounge and the bitter end \( the musicians \) , tonic , surf reality , pink pony and dixon place \( the monologuists \) and monk gallery in williamsburg \( the video artists \) but on this particular night , at least , there was no lack of enthusiasm conversations erupted between and after performances , with several people approaching ms ehrenreich about possible future collaboration , talking to ms devestern about her new song or chatting with the monologuists about their work the conversations stretched from the kitchen into the living room and even out onto the fire escape , with its views over the brooklynqueens expressway , across the east river and into the fogcovered towers of lower manhattan the evening ended with an impromptu jam session as the musicians picked up their instruments and dancers started spinning around the living room it continued that way into the early morning hours photos marc rosenblatt , a performance artist , left , runs the salon with his

few people who have heard the tempestuous argentineborn pianist martha argerich play ever forget it she is a colossal technician , a powerfully intuitive musician and an electrifying performer just last week at carnegie hall , as soloist with the philadelphia orchestra in a concert conducted by charles dutoit , ms argerich vanquished the formidable challenges of prokofiev s piano concerto no 3 her fiery , ecstatic performance elicited a frenzied ovation , including 10 curtain calls , from a soldout house though she inspires cultlike devotion among ordinary concertgoers , her admirers include many of the world s most respected musicians mstislav rostropovich , the great cellist and conductor , recently called her a pianist with no limits at all , none whatsoever but ms argerich , who will perform again tonight at carnegie hall , is the most enigmatic figure in classical music today , by turns passionate , disarming and chaotic beset with inner demons and insecurities , she can be an erratic performer and has been famously prone to canceling concerts precipitously martha is an unguided missile , as one close friend of hers has memorably put it for years the reclusive pianist assiduously avoided giving interviews , even as adoring fans worried about her and flocked to her concerts , hoping that she was well , hoping she would play ms argerich kept her silence even as rumors spread that she was fatally ill but on one recent night , close to 11 o'clock , ms argerich \( pronounced ahrguritch \) sat in the lounge of a midtown hotel for the first extended oneonone interview she has given in nearly 20 years and talked openly about her work and her health some weeks earlier she had allowed a statement to be released confirming that she had been treated for melanoma , cancer of the skin , at the john wayne cancer institute in santa monica , calif but now she revealed the extent of the problem the melanoma had spread to her lymph nodes and lungs i was afraid of my own body , she said of the trauma she faced i was afraid of myself for the first time afraid to be me so far the treatments appear to have been successful she is in remission indeed , out of gratitude ms argerich s concert is to benefit the institute all tickets were scooped up weeks ago her program tonight is also significant because , for the first time in 19 years , she is performing solo repertory in a major american concert venue during the wideranging 90minute interview , ms argerich , who is 58 , also spoke of musical matters and her tumultuous career her beginnings as a pintsize prodigy her early triumphs her crisis of confidence when she felt out of order , as she put it , like an elevator or a telephone her practice habits , which can be not very systematic and not very disciplined and her contradictory type of relationship to the piano i can be obsessive when there is music to be learned , she said but at other times i do n't touch the piano at all pinning the unpredictable ms argerich down to a time and place for the interview proved difficult when she finally arrived as promised , she had just finished practicing in an upstairs studio at carnegie hall and was in work mode dressed in slacks and a long sweater , her sleek mane of black hair a bit disheveled ms argerich , barely 5foot4 , is a striking woman with bright brown eyes and a sturdy build her hands are surprisingly small , and on this night a few finger tips were protected by bandaids in 1981 , ms argerich announced that she was giving up solo recitals entirely , and , with occasional exceptions for special , usually hushhush events , she has kept to her word why \? it s really a very obsessive situation , when you are alone onstage playing on your own , she said i have a tendency to be a very obsessive person it makes me very i do n't know of course , the solo repertory is wonderful , she added but she prefers playing chamber music and concertos , which is more stimulating and less lonely her insecurities as a performer long predate her health crisis the daughter of two universitybased economists in buenos aires , she began piano lessons at 5 when she was 8 she played a difficult beethoven piano sonata \( op 31 , no 3 \) for the renowned pianist walter gieseking , who proclaimed her a phenomenon at 16 , within the space of three weeks , she won both the busoni and the geneva international piano competitions when she was 21 she suffered a crippling bout of depression that lasted over two years after studying in europe , she moved to new york and did n't do anything , she said i just sat in an apartment watching the late late show even getting married and having the first of her three daughters , each by a different man , did not lift her from the depression i felt i could not play any more , she said since i spoke several languages , i thought i would just become a secretary she credits a former teacher , the polishborn pianist stefan askenase , and his strongwilled wife with helping to lift her out of this hole and back into music their intervention clearly worked , for in 1965 , at 24 , ms argerich won first prize in the chopin international competition in warsaw , and her career took off among the colleagues who helped was mr dutoit , to whom she was married from 1969 until 1973 and with whom she remains good friends
san francisco , june 27 the oracle corporation acknowledged today that it had hired a prominent washington detective firm to investigate groups sympathetic to its archrival , the microsoft corporation , an effort that yielded documents embarrassing to microsoft in the midst of its antitrust battle with the government oracle s admission today followed reports linking the detective firm , the investigative group international , to an unsuccessful attempt this month to obtain documents from a promicrosoft trade group , the association for competitive technology , by offering payments to janitors at the group s washington office oracle said the investigations on its behalf had established that the association and two other organizations were misrepresenting themselves as independent advocacy groups , when in fact their work was funded by microsoft for the express purpose of influencing public opinion in favor of microsoft during its antitrust trial documents from two of the organizations were cited in articles in the new york times and the wall street journal showing that the groups had received financing from microsoft an official of one of the groups said he thought documents that later showed up in the news media were on two laptops stolen from the group last june but an oracle spokesman said the company had stipulated to the detectives that nothing illegal was to be done in the operation when oracle asked igi to investigate numerous microsoft front organizations , we did n't specify how igi should go about gathering information , the spokesman said we did , however , insist that whatever methods igi employed must be legal he said oracle was repeatedly given such assurances norman harrison , president and chief executive of the detective firm , issued a statement saying he had no comment the firm s chairman , terry lenzner , did not return calls the episode indicates the profound bitterness of the softwareindustry rivalry between microsoft and oracle , companies headed by two of the world s richest men william h gates of microsoft and lawrence j ellison of oracle vivek varma , a microsoft spokesman , said tonight , this is further proof that our competitors have conducted and paid for and orchestrated a public relations and lobbying campaign to generate government intervention into a industry that is highly competitive and delivering for consumers the detective that oracle turned to , mr lenzner , a onetime watergate investigator , has come to prominence in recent years in his work for the tobacco industry and the clinton white house , gathering information on their accusers a microsoft law firm even hired the lenzner firm earlier this year to assist in a software piracy and counterfeiting case oracle said it had retained the detective firm in june 1999 to investigate the independent institute of oakland , calif , a freemarket policy institute that had just placed fullpage advertisements defending microsoft signed by 240 academic figures and portrayed as reflecting independent views in the washington post and the new york times in september , the times , citing internal institute documents , reported that the independent institute s ad was actually paid for by microsoft the times said the documents had been provided by a microsoft adversary associated with the computer industry who refused to be further identified a times spokeswoman , catherine mathis , said it had long been the paper s policy not to disclose the names of confidential sources last month , an article in the wall street journal reported that the national taxpayers union , which had issued a study blaming the antitrust case for a loss of value in state pension funds , had received financing from microsoft it attributed the information to a person familiar with the group s corporate fundraising we take it that there has been no suggestion of any improper activity by the journal , or any knowledge by the journal of any such activity by any of its sources , and we know of none , said richard tofel , a spokesman for the newspaper the other group that oracle acknowledged was a target of the investigation , the association for competitive technology , is a promicrosoft trade group according to documents from the company that manages the association s office space , a woman offered two cleaning workers cash on two occasions early this month to hand over trash from the group s office the offers were rebuffed the woman making them had gained access using a key from another tenant , whose credit application bore the name of an investigator identified in the past as an agent of the lenzner firm a oracle executive said the company knew nothing about that incident other than what had been reported in the press and the executive said oracle had had no involvement in another episode , in which microsoft s support for a freemarket lobbying group called citizens for a sound economy was reported in the washington post both that group and the independent institute reported recent thefts of laptop computers from their offices that they said might have contained documents that later appeared in the press the targets of the oraclebacked investigation expressed outrage this evening , suggesting that the company was guilty of the same dirtypool tactics of which it has long accused microsoft it s despicable , said jonathan zuck , president of the association for competitive technology i would hope to get a letter of apology from larry ellison and an explanation of how , in a climate over so much concern over the issue of privacy , he could think this is an acceptable business practice he said he was considering legal action over what he said was a violation of his employees' privacy in the trashbuying attempt this is not dumpster diving in offices outside the building , this is bribery , he said it s also a security issue repeated requests by phone and email for comment from mr ellison , the oracle chairman , were unavailing david j theroux , president of the independent institute , said oracle had called into question its own credibility clearly anybody who stoops to whatever was done here , you ca n't trust , he said he asserted that the documents that were cited in the times obscured the debate because they implied that the independent institute was a front for microsoft mr theroux said the institute was advocating freemarket policies for years before microsoft ever became a supporter it s unfortunate that instead of engaging the issues in a visible public forum , mr theroux said , speaking of oracle , it was considered to be appropriate to use subterfuge and backalley tactics to deal with the issues john berthoud , president of the national taxpayers union , based in alexandria , va , said , it s disappointing but perhaps not unexpected that microsoft opponents , who are trying to use the american judicial system to run down microsoft , would stoop to these kind of political tactics against the voices of the free market mr berthoud said he had been approached by reporters contending they had been given internal financial documents from his group but he said he had not seen the documents and could not verify their authenticity he said his group engages in the rough and tumble of politics , but added , this kind of nonsense is uncalled for and below the belt photo terry lenzer , a former watergate investigator and the head of the investigative group international \( associated press \) \( pg c2 \)
fort lauderdale , fla , nov 12 a funny thing happened at the polls here and in many other sites in broward county last week after waiting in long lines caused by heavy turnout , thousands of people stepped into the voting booths and then , if the results are to be believed , did not vote for president the republicans say they believe the counting machines the democrats say a hand recount will prove that it is a matter of poorly set equipment or hanging chads , the tiny pieces of paper that can cling to a punched ballot card gloria fantl , a coconut creek city commissioner , knows something about that in helping her 93yearold motherinlaw vote with an absentee ballot , ms fantl noticed the chads had refilled the punched holes i pulled them all off , she said it s a rotten system whether ms fantl s neighbors had the same problem , or just could not make up their minds , might be resolved on monday when county officials plan to inspect a sampling of ballots in all , 6 , 686 voters in this sprawling county just north of miami handed in ballots seemingly without marking a choice for president broward is now poised for the same storm that has swamped its neighbor palm beach county , 20 miles to the north , which is undergoing a manual recount for a different reason its butterfly ballot was accused of misleading supporters of vice president al gore into voting for patrick j buchanan broward county did not use the butterfly ballots in broward , republicans contend that many voters routinely opt to pass on some races and that the unpunched ballots are a perennial phenomenon certainly , some counties in florida this year reported similar numbers of ballots on which no choice for president was punched but a weekend tour of this county , famous for its springbreak events and docked cruise ships , turned up mostly people with strong political convictions , people who take sides if anyone who actually voted decided to skip the race for president , no one was admitting it at a break in services at the 15th street church of christ in pompano beach today , the pastor , the rev matthew moore , saw heads shaking no when he asked his flock if anyone had flipped past the first page of the ballot there was no apathy of voting in this county , let me tell you , mr moore , a 75yearold evangelist , said later the people went to the polls and they voted lenny degeorge , 45 , who owns the lt coin laundry a few miles west , said everyone who comes in here is involved in issues very astute , sharp and at the wynmoor retirement community , where senator joseph i lieberman , mr gore s running mate , introduced his mother two weeks ago to a packed theater , today s crowd at the 19th hole coffee shop insisted that they picked a president , and they were eager to say why women s rights , declared jean krakower , 85 , who moved here from massachusetts i still remember the days when women had abortions in the back alley and , ms krakower said , she was also concerned about the selection of supreme court justices after a big voter turnout that topped 66 percent , many people here have not bothered to take down their campaign posters i think everybody had a personal interest in the presidential race , especially black folks , said the rev aaron wiggins , a baptist pastor , except on saturdays when he serves roadside ribs in pompano beach broward hardly stood out in election day tumult the county has swelled to an estimated 14 million people , causing some of its 609 precincts to burst at the seams jane carroll , the supervisor of elections , knew that her operation s telephone system was inadequate , but she was unable to get money to expand it so ms carroll shipped 30 laptop computers to the largest precincts to help workers communicate and check various databases workers in other precincts who had to rely on phones to get answers to their questions faced an average wait of 40 minutes , county officials said i would n't do it again , said a precinct worker , elaine l kaplan i got there at 6 30 and the line was around the corner one worker did n't show up i ran two books of voter names at the same time but it was the 6 , 686 ballots with seemingly no vote for president out of 558 , 007 ballots cast that caught the attention of local and state democrats we do n't believe that any people came to vote and did n't vote on the presidential race , said former congressman larry smith , now a lobbyist and a democratic activist there certainly was not much else on the ballot to draw such a large turnout , mr smith said the united states senate race was notable , but a local park referendum handily passed nonsense , said the republican county chairman , ed pozzuoli look , we heard throughout the campaign a lot of people say george w bush does n't thrill me because fill in the blank , al gore does n't thrill because fill in the blank , and ralph nader is n't a serious candidate , mr pozzuoli said so what s the best way for me to say i'm going to vote for 'none of the above \? ' why is that so impossible \?
the chandler family built the los angeles times and times mirror , and in the end they sold the company out from under the manager they had hired to run it while the planned sale to the tribune company will be a windfall for times mirror shareholders , the chandlers would have enjoyed a far bigger gain had they not engaged in three separate transactions with the company over the last five years those transactions , criticized at the time because they gave the family deals not available to ordinary shareholders , were intended to maximize current income for the chandler family while minimizing the family s tax bill and allowing it to diversify its investments in that , they succeeded but the cost to the family was a real one even in the tribune transaction , the chandlers appear to have negotiated a deal that will protect them from paying taxes but will give them a lower price for their stock than will be available to public shareholders all in all , the transactions appear to have provided shortterm benefits to the chandlers at the expense of their longterm financial interests at least in hindsight knowing that the takeover was going to occur none of which is to say the chandlers are going to suffer the chandler family trusts now own 145 million shares of times mirror stock , which will be exchanged under terms of the takeover for 3625 million shares of tribune company stock , worth 11 billion at yesterday s closing market price they also have substantial other investments , thanks to the transactions with times mirror , that are worth hundreds of millions more yesterday s merger agreement was negotiated in large part by chandler family interests , with mark willes , the chief executive of the company , effectively left on the sidelines it appears that he will be out of work after the merger is completed , although he will get a severance package although the chandlers own a minority of the stock , they control the company because their shares have supervoting rights but back in 1994 , before the blizzard of deals began , the chandler family trusts owned 394 million shares had they simply held on to them , they would have received less income in the intervening years but probably would be wealthier now , after the tribune takeover , although times mirror would have had a different capital structure and the price offered by tribune might have been different yesterday , times mirror stock rose 376875 , to 85625 the first deal , announced in 1994 and completed in the spring of 1995 , came when times mirror needed to reduce the generous dividend it had been paying the quarterly dividend was cut from 27 cents a share to 6 cents such a cut was potentially devastating to some members of the extended chandler family , whose dividend income was about 425 million a year the solution was to give the family trust a new issue of preferred stock , paying 33 million a year in dividends their income was preserved ordinary shareholders did not get the preferred but they did get shares in cox communications , which bought the cable operations of times mirror in a related transaction the cox shares they got were then worth about 10 a times mirror share now they are worth about 52 , although they have never paid dividends the value of the preferred stock the chandlers took instead of the cox shares has not risen , although the dividends have continued to be paid the second transaction came in 1997 then the chandler family and times mirror engaged in an unusual transaction in which the family effectively traded part of its common and preferred stock holdings in times mirror for a diversified stock and bond portfolio and a stake in real estate that had been owned by times mirror , and which times mirror then leased back the deal was structured in a way that let the family avoid capital gains taxes on the stock that was traded for the other assets to evaluate that deal completely would require knowledge of how the cash in the deal did when invested information that is not public information times mirror stock had performed poorly since that transaction on friday it closed just below the 1997 level but it soared yesterday on the takeover news although the chandlers had higher current income than they would have if they had not done the transaction , it is probable that they would have done better over all if they had kept the shares to be tendered in the current takeover the third transaction came last september the structure of the deal was similar to the 1997 one , with the chandlers effectively trading another large block of times mirror stock for the income from other assets , in this case securities issued by real estate investment trusts and other investments to be made with cash contributed by times mirror once again , evaluating that deal is impossible without information on the investments made with the cash put in by times mirror some of the money went into a venture capital fund that has made a number of internet investments , whose value will become clear only with time but , once again , times mirror stock is up more than 40 percent since then , thanks entirely to the takeover , and it is unlikely that the other investments have done as well in the transaction announced yesterday , the tribune company agreed to pay up to 95 a share for 41 percent of the outstanding times mirror shares , and to exchange 25 tribune shares for the remaining shares tribune stock fell 6375 , to 308125 yesterday , indicating the value of the stock portion of the deal is 7703 a times mirror share unless tribune stock rallies , most shareholders will opt to take as much cash as they can but the chandlers agreed to exchange their shares for stock that leaves more cash for other shareholders , but assures that the chandlers will not have to pay capital gains taxes on the deal once again , the chandlers have managed to do a deal that will not bring a tax bill to the family but they are doing so in a way that leaves them with less value than they might have received if taxes were not so feared
the 20campus city university of new york was in chaos when the board of trustees hired matthew goldstein as the new chancellor last summer political infighting among the trustees had paralyzed the administration , driven out some of the institution s most talented minds and further demoralized a faculty that was already embittered by hiring freezes and disrespect from a few trustees who put politics ahead of academics the tensions between the faculty and the administration seemed to subside when mr goldstein was installed as chancellor but the faculty and the administration were at loggerheads again last week over proposed curriculum changes that the trustees voted for , including a plan to consider a systemwide core curriculum , in the style of elite institutions like columbia and the university of chicago the board chairman , herman badillo , says the faculty will be consulted on the details of the new curriculum , which he says is aimed at raising standards across the system but the faculty union president , barbara bowen , charged the trustees with conspiring to usurp faculty powers , forcing through a curriculum dictated by conservative groups like change new york and the national association of scholars , two organizations that have long sought , in the faculty s judgment , to commandeer the university both sides will need to proceed rationally and in good faith to avoid yet another destructive round of intramural warfare the master plan put forward by the trustees has many commendable aspects for starters , the plan is aimed at eliminating program duplications , and augmenting each campus s strength in order to produce flagship campuses with higher admissions standards , in the style of the california system the plan also calls for strengthening teacher education and for more systematic relations between cuny and the public schools that provide most of the system s students the trustees realized that none of this can be accomplished unless cuny rebuilds its faculty , which is far too dependent on poorly paid parttimers , who dash from one parttime job to another , leaving little time for student counseling or for other activities that sustain a vibrant university the trustees want at least 70 percent of the fouryear college faculty to be fulltime teachers the faculty applauds the rebuilding effort but fears that conservatives outside the university will have undue influence over the shape of the proposed core curriculum , making for a narrower selection of course offerings at cuny mr goldstein and the trustees dispute this emphatically , saying that the entire program is up for discussion it is incumbent upon both sides to work this through the last thing cuny needs is more of the intramural warfare that ravaged the system for much of the last decade
to the editor whether this is an intentional trend or just lazy filmmaking i'm not sure , but is it possible that american films are learning to speak any language they want european films learn to speak english , jan 30 \? careful viewing of a recent major american film , runaway bride , will reveal that almost none of the actors speak their lines on camera or , if they do , they are far enough away that we cannot see their lips move the moment richard gere is about to deliver a line the camera cuts to julia roberts , showing her reaction when she responds we find ourselves looking over her shoulder at mr gere one wonders if most of the film s dialogue was added in postproduction for all we know , garry marshall , the director , may have shot an almost entirely silent movie this means that runaway bride can be shown in any language , added in postproduction the same way , without the annoying lipsync problems usually associated with dubbing runaway bride in french , german or mandarin would look as though it were shot in that language some european filmmakers have been using this technique for quite a while it makes for inferior cinematic values and is a disservice to the actors several critics have accused ms roberts and mr gere of walking through their movie maybe they did john bilney port hope , ontario
purchase , ny the native new yorker mark jackson , in a lemoncolored suit , was chatting with a knot of people after the game on monday they were standing alongside the madison square garden court about a halfhour after the knicks had beaten jackson s indiana pacers , 9189 , in game 4 of the eastern conference finals jackson was approached by a reporter mark , the reporter said , what did you think of chris dudley \? jackson looked at him with something close to crossed eyes you come here when i'm talking to my family and ask me about chris dudley \? he said then he smiled a wan smile he does what he s asked to do he did a great job indeed a few minutes earlier , in another part of the garden , the coach of the pacers , one larry joe bird , had a like thought one of our main problems was not getting too many secondchance points , he said , especially when dudley was in the game dudley s own coach , jeff van gundy , pointed to a moment in the third period when the knicks , who had enjoyed a big lead , saw it shrink then we missed two straight shots but chris got the offensive rebounds both times , passed out to larry johnson one time and charlie ward the other and turned them both into 3pointers , van gundy said yesterday at the knicks' practice here they were huge plays for us it s unusual for someone to have such an impact when he played only eight minutes of the entire game , taking one shot and sinking none , and when he is given no opportunity to shoot a free throw , which , in general , is a blessing in disguise , for he is the single worst freethrow shooter in national basketball association history , at 46 percent dudley is also less than the most graceful basketball player he is often in foul trouble he is 6 feet 11 inches , with a square jaw as well as a square face , and , perhaps because of back problems and knee problems , his gait is uncommon if you saw him at a curb , you might ask if he needed help to cross the street if he were a trapeze artist , one could imagine him pulling down the the swinging bar and collapsing the rigging chris childs , the knick guard , calls him dr crash because he crashes the boards for rebounds , childs explained he s not one to shy away from contact he 'll knock over a teammate as soon as he would a guy from the other team he goes all out dudley has been the starting center for the knicks since patrick ewing went down with a foot injury in game 2 against indiana , and may be at that post tonight in indianapolis for game 5 , if ewing is still ailing before this , dudley had played in just one game in the last month and a half of the regular season , and just 20 seconds of one game in the toronto playoffs and seventenths of a seconds in his one game in the miami series but he is effective in blocking shots , running the floor , defending , rebounding and hustling for loose balls in an odd way , he is a living metaphor for the spirit of the whole team even though he had n't been playing , van gundy said , chris stayed in shape , worked hard in practice and after practice and did the job when he was called on van gundy also said that most people do n't realize how banged up dudley is like the rest of the knicks , it seems after the miami series , chris came to me and said he wanted to play and believed he could help the team , van gundy said i told him i could n't make promises he could have shut down and just collected his money he did n't he s the ultimate professional this is dudley s 13th season in the league he is 35 years old and is in the second year of a fouryear , 28 million contract he is also that rare nba specimen , an ivy leaguer an economics major and thirdgeneration yalie i 've wondered if some of my shooting problems are because i overanalyze things too much , he said but he s also , now , a little rusty he said i had a wideopen shot in game 3 but passed the ball because i was disoriented i thought i was farther under the basket than i was as for his notorious freethrow shooting , he s been diligent recently at practicing he s much improved , said the knicks assistant coach brendan malone , but it s hard for fans to tell because he does n't go to the line that much in game 3 , when he hit two straight free throws , the cheers shook rafters dudley is unassuming , a generous spirit he has a foundation for helping disadvantaged youngsters to a college education and a family man he and his wife , christine , have an 18monthold boy , charles , who , at games may be the only person in the garden wearing a knicks shirt with dudley 14 on the back it appears he wears it with pride , like his dad photo chris dudley , grabbing a rebound , played sparingly until patrick ewing was injured \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
song remains the same will new jersey listen \? o , new jersey ! not only are you the butt of tedious what exit \? jokes , but you lack what most other states revel in a song of your own this is certainly not because of a lack of lyricism west of the holland tunnel \( just ask any bruce springsteen fan \) , or because of a lack of efforts by red mascara of phillipsburg it is because of , dare we count , six decades of legislative inaction not since the state militia sang jersey blue in 1794 during the whisky rebellion has there been a consensus about a song for the garden state there was a contest for state song in 1939 , but the legislature did n't make the winner official in 1956 the department of education reviewed many options , but found none of sufficient merit in 1972 the legislature cast its votes for the roisterous i'm from new jersey , written in 1960 by mr mascara it goes something like this i'm from new jersey and i'm proud about it , i love the garden state i'm from new jersey and i want to shout it , i think it s simply great but gov william t cahill refused to sign the bill , reportedly saying , if there is one thing worse than the song 'i'm from new jersey , ' it is red mascara singing 'i'm from new jersey' fast forward to 1996 , when a law directed the new jersey state arts council to come up with a list of favorites four years and 215 entries later , nothing rien de rien it s all a little daunting for the tireless mr mascara , 78 , a retired chemical factory worker who for 40 years has lobbied the legislature , schmoozing , passing out gumdrops , all for a song he said the sponsor of one of the three current bills in favor of his song is christopher kip bateman , whose father , raymond , was senate president back in 1972 when governor cahill rejected the legislature s choice but there is a move afoot , mr mascara said , to create four state tunes the top three choices of the 1996 contest , so the state would have a state song , a state anthem , a state pop song , and , be still , beating heart a state march his 'rent' checks go to support artists jonathan larson , creator of the broadway musical rent , died the night of the show s final dress rehearsal but in the four years since , as his rock opera thrived , mr larson , who was 35 when he died of a heart aneurysm , has continued to contribute to the theater world posthumously the jonathan larson performing arts foundation , created by his family using proceeds from the show , gave 55 , 000 in february to composers , lyricists , other artists and nonprofit theater companies he worked for 12 years as a waiter trying to support himself while he was trying to write shows , said mr larson s father , allan , who lives in new mexico we know he was not alone in that nancy kassak diekmann , the foundation s executive director , said eight individuals received grants of 2 , 500 to 10 , 000 this year , and four organizations received aid a 1998 grant winner , bubbly black girl sheds her chameleon skin , a musical by kirsten childs , is about to open at playwright s horizon other winners have included the composerlyricist paul scott goodman , whose bright lights , big city played at the new york theater workshop allan larson will travel to dublin , the netherlands , copenhagen and budapest in coming months to see rent openings he is glad that his son s work can help more artists that s what 'rent' is all about , is community , he said , adding that his son would approve he 'd say , 'where was it when i needed it \?

sydney , australia this is an awesome task for the athletes they must save the olympic movement they must wrest the focus back from the sleaze merchants who connived under the cover of the five rings they must leap over time zones , break down the artificiality of the taped telecasts , get past the greed and the stuffiness of the international olympic committee do n't dwell on the australian big shot who foisted his own child on the torch procession , just because he had the power to do it try not to obsess on the committee that could not find one woman on this planet to nominate for the next generation of ioc delegates the next two weeks belong to the athletes , now arriving in australia from all over the world resurrecting any vestigial dignity of the olympics is particularly important back in the united states , which presumably still exists through the numbing maze of international datelines and jet lag back in dollarland are affluent sponsors who will watch carefully to see if they are besmirched , plus the massive potential television audience , 15 to 18 time zones behind australia the athletes must be compelling enough to get americans into their easy chairs in prime time to watch events that were held hours , days , maybe even weeks earlier over here , the athletes will exist in real time cathy freeman , the aboriginal runner , has so much weight on her shoulders , it will be a miracle if she can push off at the start line but she must freeman s people will be demonstrating against two centuries of overt racial discrimination she can touch millions , remind them there are always men of money and power who try to possess a people or an event , but sometimes you have to take it back the athletes must revalidate the olympic movement all over the world , the olympic games are a biennial apparition , materializing out of the mists like brigadoon meantime , the world gathers in front of the ubiquitous television to watch somebody scoring a goal every minute of every day , and now basketball is the hot sport , bulls shirts everywhere , and cricket and tiger madness and auto racing and hockey and baseball big arenas , big cable , big internet the olympics try to glom onto some of these big sports , inviting them into the big tent , but even the imported superstars cannot hide the odor of scandal lusting for a nobel prize , juan antonio samaranch persistently invokes the aura of the children of the world whenever he opens and closes the games now the children and the adults have seen the spectacle of ioc delegates arriving in utah with gunnysacks , and businessmen from that smug little corner of the world instinctively filling those sacks with goodies the world has seen australian olympic officials instinctively channel the best tickets to their pals , just the way the previous bunch instinctively did in atlanta it is a lot to ask of the athletes , but popov , the swimmer man , and fernandez , the softball pitcher , must remind the world that sport , when it is clean and honest , is one of the world s more compelling sights this is not like a world cup of soccer or even our local phenomenon , the super bowl of american football , where the majority of fans know the inside stories the olympics just drop in our laps , and suddenly we are being asked to care about this stuff in a very short time now the question must be asked what if nobody cares anymore \? the best part of the games is still the athletes who train for little money , who regard these games as their highest athletic calling the dream teams and the tennis stars are imported window dressing it is up to television to convey not only the humanity but also the urgency , to bring back the action to the games this is not an easy task in recent olympic games , even with time zones on their side , the networks have resorted to the feature approach the private glimpse , the families , the injuries , the pain lost in the soap operas and the sonorous narration , however , has been the spontaneity of the games the canned approach may not work anymore because television has spewed forth an inordinate amount of personal stuff exhibitionists bludgeoning each other on the springer show , egomaniacs voting each other off the island on survivor the americans who seem to enjoy the olympics the most live near the canadian border people in buffalo and detroit and seattle rave about the cbc coverage live events , a more worldly view this year nbc will show 161 1 2 hours on the main network , plus another 276 hours on cnbc and msnbc on cable none of it live , mind you , but nevertheless whole swatches of field hockey and kayaking and high jumping and wrestling nbc promises us the youth , the health , the skills , the spirit , the zeal , the impromptu glory of live sport \( with any luck at all , the chemical enhancement of blood and muscle will not overwhelm the games \) after observing the connivers and the freeloaders of the ioc , the world may be ready for some athletic competition or maybe the world is ready for soccer season and football season and the baseball pennant races if the athletes come across as arrogant and corrupt and drug infested or even just insignificant , they fall to the level of the olympic leaders , and maybe the whole pretentious ship goes down
the new york philharmonic has chosen riccardo muti as the candidate to succeed kurt masur as music director when his contract expires in 2002 , friends and colleagues in the music world say but whether mr muti , currently the music director of la scala opera in milan , will accept an offer is still an open question acting on another toplevel position , the orchestra is expected to announce soon that zarin mehta will become its executive director that post was vacated by deborah borda at the end of last year although negotiations with both have been under way for some time , it is not clear how close mr muti is to being hired or the extent to which , in positions where partnership would be crucial , one appointment might affect the other until terms have been set and contracts have been signed , anything could happen , said a highly placed executive in the music business who works with all the parties and insisted on anonymity given the delicacy of the talks and the philharmonic s desire for discretion , none of the friends and colleagues would speak for attribution administrators of the philharmonic did so but revealed little both names are at the pinnacles of their respective professions , said paul b guenther , chairman of the board both have shown a degree of interest in the philharmonic no offers have been made to either mr guenther spoke on his way to the caribbean mr muti and mr mehta were said to be unreachable , on separate trips to the middle east since the new york philharmonic , for all its ups and downs of recent decades , remains at the center of the american orchestral world , the positions are among the most important in classical music in the united states mr muti , 58 , was the music director of the philadelphia orchestra from 1980 to 1992 he has been at la scala since 1986 , and he often conducts the vienna philharmonic and the berlin philharmonic he would insist on continuing these activities on some level , it is said , even though his relations with la scala have not been entirely smooth he has turned down at least two recent offers to succeed lorin maazel as music director of the bavarian radio symphony orchestra in munich if not universally admired for his interpretations in every area of repertory , mr muti is widely respected for his technical abilities and his passionate commitment to certain bodies of music particularly the italianate , a specialty the philharmonic has not had in concentrated form since the days of arturo toscanini , from 1929 to 1936 mr muti s name has been prominent in speculation about the new music director from the early stages of the search , which began in 1997 he has achieved lively results from the orchestra in recent appearances , having evidently commanded ready and abundant responsiveness from the players he is said to have toyed with the notion of directing the philharmonic a year ago after a week of concerts with the orchestra turned into a love feast now , another week of concerts in february having produced similar results , he seems to be taking the idea seriously , his main concern being how he would balance the commitment of time the philharmonic would demand with his continuing involvements abroad mr mehta , 61 , has been the executive director of the ravinia festival in highland park , ill , the summer home of the chicago symphony , since 1990 last fall he renewed his contract for five years he was the managing director of the montreal symphony from 1981 to 1991 he is highly regarded in the field of orchestra management , which , to put it mildly , is not overrun with star talent at the moment he is the younger brother of zubin mehta , who was music director of the new york philharmonic from 1978 to 1991 the situation is especially delicate , because the timing of one appointment could affect the outcome of the other negotiation it s a hard tightrope for the philharmonic to walk , said the music executive mr mehta , it is said , wants to be sure that he will be working with a music director of genuine stature mr muti would surely qualify what mr muti wants only he may know responding to rumors that he has made impossible demands on the philharmonic in terms of salary \( big \) or commitments of time \( small \) , the orchestra s administrators and people close to mr muti deny that terms have even been discussed mr masur s annual salary is about 13 million \( ms borda was making about 400 , 000 \) mr muti told me he loves the players and loves the idea of the philharmonic , the music executive said but he really does n't know if he s ready to go back into that world of jet lag , hassle and pressure it s basically the same thing he said when he left philadelphia in any case , the orchestra may have qualms about presenting mr muti with a fait accompli , choosing mr mehta or anyone else at a sensitive moment without any involvement from him even where matters are not so tricky , orchestras are typically closemouthed about such searches , especially those for music director , for fear that if an offer is refused , the other candidates may end up feeling like afterthoughts i do n't like to speak of candidates , mr guenther said i like to speak of relationships just look at the conductors coming here as guests , and you 'll see who the possibilities are yes and no new possibilities may indeed arise once a process is well along , as seems to have happened at the philadelphia orchestra after a failed courtship or two elsewhere , the frontrunners for music director there , on the strength of recent appearances , appear to be roberto abbado , 45 , and david robertson , 41 , neither of whom would have loomed large when the orchestra began its search in 1997 but in the philharmonic s case , none of the maestros said to be on the short list with mr muti have been frequent or recent guest conductors daniel barenboim , 57 , has , in his function as music director of the chicago symphony , worked closely with mr mehta and is said to be a favorite of his mr barenboim , who is also the music director of the deutsche staatsoper berlin , has not conducted the philharmonic in more than a decade of the others mariss jansons , 57 , the music director of the pittsburgh symphony and the associate principal conductor of the st petersburg philharmonic in russia , is also said to be a favorite of mr mehta s he last appeared at the new york philharmonic in 1996 and christoph eschenbach , 60 , who left the houston symphony last year and is now the chief conductor of the ndr symphony in hamburg , is the music director at ravinia , where he also works closely with mr mehta he last appeared at the philharmonic in 1998 prominent younger guest conductors of recent years , like christian thielemann and daniele gatti , seem not to have made the radar screen yet as for mr muti , no contract has been sent , said welz kauffman , the philharmonic s artistic administrator , in response to rumors conflicting with those about outrageous demands all i can say is that his two weeks with us have been fantastic what it s going to turn into i have no idea so when will a decision on the new music director whether mr muti or someone else be made , if not imminently \? you and i will not be having this discussion after labor day , mr guenther said either that or you 'll be talking to my successor here photo riccardo muti conducting the new york philharmonic in february \( chris lee \)
it s not hard to guess that a company named cyrano might have something to do with noses it s less obvious that the company produces sensors that could smell a sick person s breath , bodily fluids or a wound and diagnose infections or disease from their odor chemical profiles are pretty good markers for disease , explained steven sunshine , chief executive of cyrano sciences in pasadena , calif those chemical profiles or odors are usually lost on the naked nose , but they are nevertheless a byproduct of sickness a hundred years ago , one of the primary tools physicians used was smell , mr sunshine said but through more sophisticated tools and technology , they migrated away from it , and it s not even used at all cyrano has licensed a patent awarded to two researchers at the california institute of technology , nathan lewis and michael freund their invention uses a composite of 32 sensors made of plastic and embedded with particles that can conduct electricity the technology is designed to work like the human nose , mr sunshine said the human nose works by having an array of sensors , none of which are specific to any one vapor or odor but each sensor responds to stimulus or a chemical compound in a different way , sending signals to the brain , and the brain interprets those signals in different ways in the case of the invention , the brain s job is taken over by a microprocessor and a patternrecognition algorithm the nose is replaced by the composite of sensors , which mr sunshine said acts like a sponge when vapors come into our device or pass by the array , each sensor element swells , he said when the plastic swells , it moves the particles farther apart and changes the resistance of the composite , making it less conductive the change in resistance is measured , providing a pattern that identifies the type of microorganism present in the vapors the microprocessor and algorithm handle the analysis the results are displayed on a small screen though the artificial nose has 32 sensors , it can detect a far greater number of odors the number is huge , essentially 2 to the 32nd power , mr sunshine said the limitations are not in the umber of things it can smell , but how close the smells are to each other mr sunshine said handheld devices using the technology would eventually have access to the internet , allowing the sample to be compared with much larger databases his company , cyrano sciences , \( www cyranosciences com \) , is ready to release a detector for quality control inspections in the chemical and food industries but its goal is to adapt the technology for health care the focus of this patent just issued is the use of the array technology to detect infections , mr sunshine said we can actually smell the difference between certain bacteria the company is about to begin clinical trials , using breath samples to detect infections in the upper respiratory tract eventually the same technology is expected to be used to sniff out infection and disease in blood , urine or other body fluids our first target is primary care physicians , mr sunshine said , with the idea that once the technology is proved , the devices will be made available to consumers so one day , parents who wonder whether their child has a simple cold or an ear infection might use the electronic nose to determine whether to see a doctor and the physician who now relies on a visual inspection of the ear to diagnose infection could use the array to help determine whether the child needs an antibiotic the sensor array received patent 6 , 017 , 440 eyeglasses panel lets wearer show colors the presidential campaign trail is lined with people wearing tshirts , hats and buttons to support one candidate or another now an inventor from webster , ny , has patented yet another way that delegates to the party conventions this summer might proclaim their allegiance a small display panel that attaches to a pair of eyeglasses like a flag mark liebenow pictures it like this a candidate s name or a party slogan is emblazoned on the panel , which attaches with a small arm to the temple of a pair of glasses the panel is big enough for labels or stickers , mr liebenow says in his patent , or it can be painted the image or message could be anything the wearer chooses like a motto , a sports team s name , or insignia mr liebenow received patent 6 , 023 , 864 photo the cyrano sciences web site displays the company s scent detection device cyrano plans to test the device for use in diagnosing disease
paris louis schweitzer does not look like a gambler tall and lanky , a kind of gallic abe lincoln , mr schweitzer , 57 , is a grandnephew of albert schweitzer and a distant cousin of jeanpaul sartre like many of the business elite of france , he is a product of l'ecole nationale d'administration he was chief of staff in the 1980 s for prime minister laurent fabius , now the finance minister , and still enjoys good political connections mr schweitzer is , in short , the very model of french establishment probity yet he now finds himself chairman and chief executive of the auto giant renault , which likes to boast that it was built on a bet in company lore , its founder , louis renault , started by winning a wager in 1898 that a renault with an innovative crankshaft could beat a car with a bicyclelike chain drive , common at the time , up a winding road in montmartre renault won so mr schweitzer has become a gambler of sorts , too last year , he flew to japan to sign a 54 billion deal to acquire a controlling stake in nissan motor after daimlerchrysler had rejected the carmaker as unsalvageable mr schweitzer is wagering that a restored nissan will become a solid partner in a globecircling alliance nor is nissan his only highstakes wager in 1996 , he ventured into latin america , building a 1 billion factory in brazil , the first that renault had built anywhere in 20 years , to make its successful megane sedan last year , he paid 50 million for 51 percent of the romanian carmaker dacia , to gain a steppingstone into eastern europe he also struck a deal to manufacture renaults in an idle factory near moscow and this year , he bought a controlling stake in samsung , the bankrupt south korean carmaker in the process , he has focused renault on cars first , he unloaded the company s foundry , busmaking divisions and renault automation , which makes auto factory equipment , to fiat in april , he sold the industrial vehicles division to volvo , while taking a 20 percent stake in that company what is sobering , however , is that renault has often lost on its biggest bets in 1987 , not long after mr schweitzer joined the company , a strategy to enter north america by acquiring american motors went sour six years later , after mr schweitzer had become chairman , a marriage he had arranged with volvo collapsed never before , moreover , has the company had more at stake if mr schweitzer s bets do not pay off , renault risks falling prey to a takeover , or being forced into a humiliating surrender of independence renault was nationalized after world war ii , and while part of it was sold to private investors in the 1990 s , the government retains 44 percent would the government stay neutral if the independence of such a national institution were threatened \? renault once believed that the future belonged to the swift , not to the big today , mr schweitzer says the world auto industry will one day be dominated by a halfdozen giants , like general motors , ford motor , toyota motor , volkswagen and daimlerchrysler he wants renault to be one of them if renault survives , it will be one of the great world carmakers , said elie cohen , a leading french economist if it fails , it will disappear mr cohen , echoing other experts , said renault was , in a sense , condemned to take important risks , if it wanted to have a chance at survival the challenges are enormous in romania , economic progress has been dismal at samsung , renault s reorganization has yet to begin but the biggest test , most experts agree , will be in japan if nissan , a stumbling , debtridden company , fails to revive in japan and in the united states , the burden on renault could prove unsustainable the future of renault is being played out in tokyo , mr cohen said few people would have predicted all this when mr schweitzer took over in 1992 then , renault was struggling with bad quality , a narrow product line and an overreliance on the french market a few years before , without huge infusions of taxpayer money , renault would have gone under or been taken over if anyone had wanted to buy it today , the company is among europe s leaders in building cars cheaply and has largely overcome its quality problems models like the scenic minivan are among europe s most reliable they are looked upon much more seriously today by the german manufacturers , said stephen reitman , who follows renault at merrill lynch in london the changes have meant profits renault s operating profit , before absorbing nissan s losses , is strong , reaching 148 billion euros , about 14 billion , in 1999 it faced a loss of 330 million euros from nissan last year , and that will hit 376 million euros just in the first half this year renault s stock price has gyrated accordingly after soaring in january to a 52week high of 5495 euros , it fell to 3860 in february and recovered to 5180 in late may but it has since slipped to 476 euros most analysts , not surprisingly , have adopted a waitandsee attitude about the company s prospects
as it reaches the end of its twoyear project to renovate the grand central subway station , the metropolitan transportation authority is trying to solve one of the seemingly insurmountable problems of summer in the city searinghot subway platforms the mta , as part of a pilot program , has spent 10 million to place 43 air coolers above the platforms at grand central and 1 million for 32 ceiling fans in the union square subway station the air coolers were turned on at grand central over the last two weeks , and transit officials said they were making at least parts of the platforms cooler the other parts , however , are still quite hot yesterday , as some people stood on the platforms wiping off beads of perspiration , others were quietly inching their way to precisely the right spot underneath one of the coolers the officials said temperatures on the platforms had fallen 5 to 10 degrees , depending on whether the measurement was taken directly underneath the coolers or a few feet away right now what we are seeing is right near the unit , you get a good feeling , said mysore nagaraja , the chief engineer for new york city transit , the unit of the mta that operates subways and buses but we want to check that through the summer and see how we can make it more effective part of the transit authority s problem in the stations stems from its earlier success in airconditioning subway cars when a train pulls into a station , heat from the train and its airconditioning units envelops riders waiting on the platform when several trains are in a station at the same time , the heat can feel exponentially worse still , riders interviewed over the last two days said any relief , no matter how small , was welcome it s a lot better now , said michael dragone , 33 , a sales executive standing underneath a cooler at grand central yesterday afternoon usually , it s miserable it s like walking into a sauna i felt the banister on the way down it s very cool asked whether he thought his comfort was worth the 10 million price tag , mr dragone paused and then laughed it looks like a lot of money , he said , but it s not my money even one of the transit system s harshest critics was happy for a respite from the heat this is the first breeze i ever felt in july at grand central , said gene russianoff , a staff lawyer at the straphangers campaign , an advocacy group for subway and bus riders if you stand exactly at the right spot , you 're cooler i was n't alone in people attempting to discover this breeze and mr russianoff also agreed that some relief was better than none when someone throws you a small lifesaver in the ocean , you do n't go , 'oh , i really want something bigger' you grab the lifesaver , said mr russianoff , standing in the station after the straphangers released a report card on the subway system is it a 10 million lifesaver \? i think that s pretty iffy but it s better transit officials call the cooling system in place at grand central airtempering , not airconditioning the units spew cold air from coils cooled by 40degree water , mr nagaraja said though big at 15 feet by 7 feet by 3 feet and powerful , the black metal units that rumble from the ceilings are still a far cry from airconditioning in order to aircondition , you have to completely close off all the vents , mr nagaraja said you 've got to really make it airtight since that is not feasible in stations linked by tunnels and with stairways to the street , the transit authority continues to search for an answer about six weeks ago , in the other half of the pilot program , giant ceiling fans were installed above the platforms at the union square subway station the fans are intended to draft fresh air from outside the station and blow it onto passengers waiting for a train yesterday , the fans seemed to be doing little more than moving the hot air the theory is that instead of just hot air , to get some fresh air from outside gives you a better feeling than just getting hot air standing on the platform , mr nagaraja said that one has some problems it s very noisy and it stirs up dust even so , the fans had their supporters anything helps , said aaron melick , 33 , standing underneath a fan i usually immediately break into a sweat as soon as i get down here transit officials said they would evaluate the fans and air cooling units at summer s end with the potential of expanding the program to other subway stations photo new cooling units rumble from the ceilings at the grand central subway platforms \( toru morimoto the new york times \) \( pg b1 \) chart rating the subways the straphangers campaign , a rider s advocacy group , released its annual report on the state of the subways yesterday below are two of the seven variables used to rate the lines rankings are based on all seven variables 1 7 trains on schedule 77 clean cars 66 2 q trains on schedule 87 clean cars 58 3 j z trains on schedule 84 clean cars 78 4 4 trains on schedule 69 clean cars 54 4 m trains on schedule 90 clean cars 72 4 d trains on schedule 82 clean cars 76 5 3 trains on schedule 80 clean cars 45 6 8 trains on schedule 79 clean cars 78 6 1 9 trains on schedule 64 clean cars 93 6 l trains on schedule 85 clean cars 69 6 f trains on schedule 70 clean cars 61 6 r trains on schedule 80 clean cars 90 6 5 trains on schedule 64 clean cars 63 6 e trains on schedule 70 clean cars 69 6 a trains on schedule 72 clean cars 88 7 n trains on schedule 80 clean cars 96 8 2 trains on schedule 71 clean cars 70 8 c trains on schedule 88 clean cars 90 9 5 trains on schedule 70 clean cars 87 g trains on schedule 86 clean cars 88 the g line is not ranked because data on crowding is unavailable \( pg b6 \)
in a letter faxed to television news organizations about 10 hours before armed federal agents took elian gonzalez from the home of his miami relatives , the lawyer for the boy s father asked that the organizations refrain from broadcasting coverage from inside the relatives' home the letter from the lawyer , gregory b craig , dated april 20 but faxed after 7 30 pm on april 21 , argued that the extensive television coverage of the boy permitted by his miami relatives only served to increase the damage and deepen the emotional suffering of this 6yearold boy we believe that to broadcast to the public what will doubtless be an extremely difficult and emotional moment in this young boy s life will only add to that damage and increase that suffering , he wrote we appeal to your humanity and to your decency to resist the invitation from lazaro gonzalez and others in miami to further exploit this young boy none of the network executives contacted yesterday said that they had made any plans to curtail their coverage in response to mr craig s request elian s miami relatives , in their effort to retain custody of the boy , gave the media liberal access to the boy , clearly offending his father , juan miguel gonzalez , who was trying to regain custody mr craig s letter said mr gonzalez does not consent to this exploitative television coverage of his child there was no indication in the letter that mr craig knew of the justice department s plans network executives interviewed yesterday said the issues raised in the letter reported earlier by fox news channel and the village voice s web site had been debated and decided days before i do n't want to characterize it as an insincere letter , said fox news channel s chairman and chief executive , roger e ailes maybe the father did feel the kid was exploited and in some sense that could be true but mr ailes added that there were few reasons to suppress journalism he also noted , i think the kid would rather have had a camera pointed at him than an automatic weapon sid bedingfield , executive vice president of cnn usa , said everyone at cnn , i believe , is a little uncomfortable with this story because at the center of it is a 6yearold child however , it has grown into something more than a routine custody case there are legal and political and international issues involved bill wheatley , the vice president of nbc news , said , it is unfortunate that this child found himself in the middle of a highly newsworthy story
khalid khannouchi , the worldrecord holder in the marathon , has still not given up hope of obtaining american citizenship in time to compete in the 2000 summer games in sydney , australia if he does gain citizenship , he is considering the unusual prospect of running both the london marathon on april 16 and the olympic trials three weeks later in pittsburgh , friends said khannouchi , a native of morocco , and his wife , sandra , have been working quietly to have his citizenship expedited under a special provision of the immigration and naturalization act used primarily by spouses of american military personnel and businessmen the provision requires the applicant s spouse to be a united states citizen living abroad and employed by the government , by an american research institution or by an american corporation that promotes foreign trade and commerce in the sports world , the provision was used most notably by the french defender david regis to become an american citizen in time for soccer s 1998 world cup regis' wife was hired by a travel agency that was an official tour provider for the world cup in khannouchi s case , the details are sketchy he and his wife are not speaking publicly about the issue , preferring to work behind the scenes betsy hill , a family friend who has been a spokeswoman for the khannouchis , said she could not discuss what sort of job sandra khannouchi was seeking or even which lawyer the couple had hired to assist them i ca n't say anything more than the prospects look fine , hill said we 're optimistic that she will be able to obtain employment overseas , but the time line is short an overseas job will have to come from someone other than new balance , the bostonbased shoe company whose apparel khannouchi endorses jim davis , the chairman and chief operating officer of new balance , said that although the company wants him to become a citizen quickly and supports his effort , the special job provision seemed sort of contrived i do n't think it s something that s right , davis said kathy shepard , a spokeswoman for new balance , said the company was reluctant because , it may appear to the outside we are trying to put a team new balance person in the running for a gold medal mark coogan , a new balance runner who ran in the marathon at the 1996 atlanta olympics , said he supported khannouchi s effort as long as he was not given any preferential treatment in obtaining his citizenship he did it the american way he came here as a nobody and built himself into a worldrecord holder , coogan said khannouchi , who lives in ossining , ny set the world marathon record of 2 hours 5 minutes 42 seconds last fall at the chicago marathon he came to the united states in 1993 to participate in the world university games believing that he was not receiving sufficient support from the moroccan track federation , he took up residence in brooklyn , married sandra natal , a naturalized american , and applied for american citizenship under normal circumstances , he would have been eligible for citizenship on sept 15 , 2000 , the day the olympics begin and two weeks before its men s marathon on oct 1 however , the immigration and naturalization service agent who interviewed him was accused of taking bribes and left the agency the case fell into a bureaucratic crack and khannouchi had to begin the application process again , which would not give him citizenship in time for sydney sen charles e schumer , the new york democrat , has been assisting the khannouchis with the immigration and naturalization service , but political and track officials say privately that his best chance lies with his wife taking a job overseas another option open to khannouchi is to compete for morocco , but he has said repeatedly that he would not run for a country that did not support him asked if there was any chance that he would change his mind , hill said , none even if he gained american citizenship in time , however , khannouchi would apparently have to receive permission from morocco to compete for the united states an olympic rule requires that an athlete wait three years to compete for a new country in the games unless he has permission from his former country , said franklin servanschreiber , a spokesman for the international olympic committee it remains unclear whether the moroccans would try to block him if they did , juan antonio samaranch , president of the ioc , would most likely attempt to solve the problem , given his stated desire to see the best athletes competing in the olympics a fourth possibility would be to petition the ioc to run without attachment to any nation when the former soviet union disintegrated , for instance , athletes from its republics competed as the unified team in the 1992 olympics and the olympic hymn was played at medal ceremonies in place of any national anthem we are making it stricter to compete if an athlete changes countries , and this would go against that trend , servanschreiber said but the president may be amenable if this person sent a letter saying , 'what can you do to help me \? ' if a highlevel athlete misses the games because of a bureaucratic problem , that is too bad maybe president samaranch would be interested if he did acquire citizenship , khannouchi would be faced with an intriguing , risky proposition , to run the london marathon for a sixfigure payday on april 16 and to run the american olympic trials on may 7 most elite athletes run two marathons in a year , not two in three weeks , given the perils of injury and fatigue but the olympic a qualifying standard is 2 14 , more than eight minutes slower than khannouchi s world record and he is so much faster than any other american marathoner that he could very likely win the trials , or place in the top three , at a pace less demanding than an international race it s not out of the question , hill said of the possibility of running both marathons to qualify for sydney , khannouchi would have to win the trials , or make sure that he did not finish behind three runners who all achieved the a standard only two american men have so far achieved the a standard david morris in 2 09 32 and joe lemay in 2 13 55 the question is , if he wins london in 2 07 and change , three weeks later can he 'jog' to win the trials or be in the top three \? said ryan lamppa , a researcher at the united states track and field federation s road running information center in santa barbara , calif i think a guy at that level could do that five months later is the men s marathon in sydney will there be much carryover \? that s another question he ca n't jog 2 14 at the trials he 'd still be working at 90 percent it s not recommended , but he s a guy good enough to do it photo khalid khannouchi of morocco set the marathon world record in chicago last fall , and he hopes to become a united states citizen in time to run in the olympics in sydney \( associated press \)
it took more than half an hour just to reach the voting booth yesterday they were about the best 35 minutes anyone could spend standing in line no matter how much time it took and the lines outside polling places in new york city were unusually long yesterday the wait on election day was worth it the payoff was the burst of joy that came with flipping the little levers next to the candidates' names , then yanking the large lever that sealed all their fates , at least as far as you were concerned that was democracy s way of reminding you that you counted some overly shrunken soul may read freudian meaning into all this talk about levers there is none \( we are , if anything , jung at heart \) the pleasure began even before getting into the voting booth it came from being able to stand with neighbors , many of them seen for the first time , and to feel the shared experience of citizenship , an act of communality essential for the brief isolation of the voting booth to have meaning what better way to reaffirm that win or lose , we are all in this together \? if that sounds hopelessly corny , sorry frankly , it has always been mystifying how so many new yorkers will think nothing of standing in line for hours outside a concert hall or camping out overnight for world series tickets or spending half an hour in the checkout line at zabar s , but then balk at the idea of waiting a little while to deliver the ultimate political opinion you could argue that people also make their feelings known by staying home and voting for no one that is true there is always the example of the woman who once said that she never voted because it only encourages them but it is hard to see how dropping sullenly out of a process can be as emotionally engaging as joining in enthusiastically not that the polling station lacks for discouraging moments it is nice to think of election day as the gathering at the well by an informed public , collectively wise and eternally thoughtful but it gets a little hard to hold onto that comforting thought when the polling inspector grabs her mz list of registered voters and cannot figure out why she has trouble finding a name that begins with h this observation is not offered to embarrass anyone it is just that lapses in basic literacy seem to occur at the polls with depressing regularity , year after year then , too , the joy of election day lay not only in its celebration of democracy it lay also in finally having the political campaigns behind us this was not so much pleasure as blessed relief from pain , kind of like liberation from a nagging toothache hard though it may be to believe , we were finally done with the race for united states senator , a campaign that felt as if it had dragged on since at least the second eisenhower administration it was assigned historic dimensions for the obvious reason that it marked the first time that a first lady had run for office and won even so , the odds are high that within weeks most of us will be unable to remember a single thing that either hillary rodham clinton or representative rick a lazio said neither candidate showed anything approaching the flair for language that distinguished the senator about to be displaced , daniel patrick moynihan , unless you regard mr lazio s sign it ! or mrs clinton s i will be there for you as examples of fine oratory but a paucity of inspiring campaign moments could not undermine the glories of election day for many new yorkers one firsttime voter , a young woman who recently moved to manhattan from long island , had failed to register with the board of elections from her new address while riding a crosstown bus yesterday , she turned to a middleaged stranger and asked him what he thought could she just walk into the manhattan polling station near her apartment and vote \? probably not , he said , though cautioning that he hardly qualified as an expert in such matters a friend of this woman , also young , broke in to observe that online voting should be permitted with cyberballoting , people can be anywhere , she said an intriguing idea , the middleaged man agreed but then he talked about the polling station as an important physical reminder that voting , while an individual act , is part of a communal exercise you could consider it a secular equivalent to prayer , he said fine when performed alone but enhanced in the collective it pleased him when the young woman agreed this made sense
to the company s adversaries , the very name microsoft suggests menacing power it has been called the death star , an 800pound gorilla and far worse and in the government s sweeping antitrust case , the microsoft corporation was portrayed in convincing detail as a monopolistic bully america online inc , in particular , was bent to microsoft s will , according to court testimony but after america online s move on monday to buy time warner inc , at 165 billion the largest merger in history , microsoft suddenly seems less threatening less the irresistible army of the internet era aol time warner , as the new company is to be called , promises to be a formidable power in its own right , perhaps more powerful in some ways than microsoft microsoft , to be sure , quickly gained the upper hand a few years ago in its first internet battle against the netscape communications corporation , which america online bought last year microsoft saw netscape , the pioneer in web browsing software , as a threat to its dominance of personal computing microsoft s response was swift and aggressive and , according to the justice department and 19 states , against the law america online s deal for time warner changes none of the facts in the microsoft antitrust case , of course and microsoft s business practices , not simply its size , are at issue but antitrust experts say the merger could figure into the calculations the court makes on sanctions against microsoft , if it loses the case , or in any settlement talks if microsoft is an 800pound gorilla , then there is certainly another beefy gorilla out there now , william kovacic , a professor at the george washington university law school , said this deal does underline the possibilities for upheaval and transformation in this industry that could well make it more difficult for a judge to choose a remedy that has dramatic , irreversible effects , like breaking up the company if completed , the america onlinetime warner merger would create a powerhouse for the next phase of internet business that of selling information and entertainment services to consumers who may tap into them using digital cell phones , handheld devices and television settop boxes in addition to personal computers even before the time warner deal , america online had been bulking up to prepare for this socalled postpc era with a multibilliondollar investment campaign in the last couple of years these acquisitions undertaken since the microsoft antitrust suit was filed and made to strengthen aol s network technology and to add services include netscape compuserve moviefone mapquestcom and a 15 billion investment in general motors' hughes electronics unit to promote satellite delivery of internet services microsoft , meanwhile , has gone on its own multibilliondollar investment spree , much of it to secure assured distribution for highspeed internet access over telecommunications and cable television networks , both in the united states and abroad in the last year alone , microsoft invested 5 billion in att , 660 million in nextel , 500 million in ntl and 300 million in united paneuropean communications yet in the online business , microsoft is in the unfamiliar position of playing david to america online s goliath in the online access market , in which subscribers pay fees , microsoft s msn service had nearly two million members in the third quarter last year that compared with 18 million for america online , according to jupiter communications , a research firm america online says it now has 20 million subscribers microsoft did not disclose its current numbers microsoft does have some popular world wide web sites , like its expedia travel and carpoint auto sites , which can be reached by users through any internet access service yet even by the measure of number of visitors to its internet sites , microsoft trails america online badly according to media metrix , which monitors web traffic , america online s web sites had 54 million visitors in november , compared with 38 million for microsoft s sites microsoft has also made some media investments , including a joint venture with nbc in msnbc , the cable and online news service but recently , microsoft has shifted from efforts to become a media company instead , it has tried to build up its web offerings to deliver personalized information online email , news , stock prices , travel advice , even horoscopes that people use to become more productive in their everyday lives , just as microsoft s popular office software makes people more productive at work the new strategy for msn is about taking us back to our roots but twisted and adapted for the internet , brad chase , a microsoft senior vice president explained in a recent interview before the aoltime warner deal was announced there are parts of the media business that we do , selling ads and so forth but our main focus is not going to be on creating content and media , which is what we had been trying to do for a couple of years
annapolis , md for such a small town , annapolis \( pop 33 , 000 \) has an astonishing array of personalities to military types and sports fans , annapolis is the united states naval academy to architecture lovers , it is a charming 18thcentury town built on a late 17thcentury baroque street plan to history buffs , it has been the capital of maryland for 300 years and was briefly the capital of the united states to recreational boaters , it is among the premier sailing centers on the eastern seaboard , its waterfront thronged with pleasure craft and to just about anyone , it is a perfect place to savor maryland s singular contribution to western civilization , the steamed hardshelled crab best of all for weekend visitors , annapolis s numerous attractions are within a 15minute walk of one another like many tourists , i was drawn to annapolis by its 18thcentury buildings and by the naval academy , a fascinating and surprisingly visitorfriendly place because annapolis s colonial homes and gardens are open longer on saturdays than on sundays , i toured them first , then the naval academy , ending my visit at the historic state house the most interesting colonial houses in annapolis are a product of its golden age in the 1760 s and 1770 s , a period whose spirit was neatly captured by jonathan boucher , the rector of st anne s church in town at the time it was the genteelest town in north america , and many of its inhabitants were highly respectable , as to station , fortune and education , he later wrote there was hardly a town in england so desirable to live in as annapolis then was , he added it was the seat of government , and the residence of the governor , and all the great officers of state , as well as of the most eminent lawyers , physicians and families of opulence and note i walked to the intersection of maryland avenue and king george street and was magically transported to boucher s annapolis before me were two of the grandest mansions of that golden age the hammondharwood house and the chaselloyd house both completed in 1774 , they reflect the genius of william buckland \( 173474 \) , who immigrated to virginia from england as an indentured servant in 1755 but ultimately became one of the colonies' most distinguished architects flawless proportions the hammondharwood house is a classic example of the fivepart anglopalladian brick mansion popular in america before the revolution other late colonial houses may be larger or more ornate , but none , i think , is more perfect the maryland avenue facade of the house exemplifies the qualities of anglopalladianism balance , elegance , coolness , understatement and , above all , flawless proportions the exquisite front door , writes g e kidder smith in his source book of american architecture , ranks as one of the finest in us georgian architecture buckland s manifold gifts are equally evident inside the rooms of the hammondharwood house are not only flawlessly proportioned , but also , because buckland had apprenticed in england as a joiner , contain superbly decorated woodwork before the revolutionary war , samuel chase was a young , ambitious annapolis lawyer and land speculator the historian norman k risjord called him an ardent patriot whose political philosophy always seemed to coincide with his own interests chase later signed the declaration of independence and served with great distinction on the supreme court , even though he is best known today as the only member ever to be impeached \( he was readily acquitted of the politically motivated charges against him \) chase began building his annapolis town house in 1769 the towering threestory mansion he planned was intended to proclaim his ascendance from humble origins to maryland s professional elite unfortunately for chase \( but luckily for today s tourists \) , he soon ran out of money remarkably , he married a woman of modest means and sold the unfinished house , then a brick shell , to one of the wealthiest men in maryland , edward lloyd iv in december 1771 , lloyd contracted with buckland to complete it the parts of the chaselloyd house designed by buckland and open to visitors are a stunning progression of essays in anglopalladian design the palladian front door opens into a front entrance hall graced by a screen of ionic columns inspired by one of palladio s drawings of roman baths beyond the screen is a majestic doublecantilevered stair an oversize palladian window looking out on the garden dominates the landing the stair culminates at the secondfloor hall with its finely decorated plaster ceiling and two niches flanking a pedimented door on prince george street , one block south of maryland avenue , is the william paca house and garden paca \( pronounced paycah \) was a contemporary of chase and , like him , a lawyer and patriot leader who signed the declaration of independence unlike chase , paca had the good sense to marry one of the wealthiest women in the colony , mary chew four days later he bought a prime double lot in the center of annapolis , with ample room for a huge house and an expansive garden paca s house , an imposing fivepart brick mansion of 1765 he probably designed himself , is well worth visiting the principal attraction here , however , is the superb twoacre paca garden garden restoration
west palm beach , fla , nov 19 palm beach county s manual recount is occurring in its emergency operations center , the headquarters for public officials during hurricanes and other natural disasters it is a creamcolored warehouse that stands at the corner of military trail and southern boulevard , surrounded by a dairy queen , a cowboy boot shop , a usedboat yard , a liquor store , a pet supermarket and a topless dancer establishment with a sign that says , gogo girls inside the cavernous counting room , which resembles a nasa mission control with gray and aqua paneled walls and giant exposed yellow airconditioning pipes on the ceiling , the ambience most resembles a casino it is quiet , people are deadly serious , the stakes are high and all eyes are on the cards and the chads each republican is armed with a small cellophane bag if a chad falls to the ground , a republican scrambles to get it , elbowing democrats out of the way on saturday night , a republican woman dashed down one of the aisles and plucked a chad off the floor she then carefully placed it in a plastic bag yes , it s a chad , she said and we 're using it as evidence one counting team finished precinct no 004 today shortly before lunch a single chad sat in the box of ballots a republican observer spotted it , reached for it and said , mine but a democratic counter picked up the box and took a step away you have to give it to me , the republican said with a surgeon s precision , the republican used the sticky side of a yellow postit note to lift the chad out of the box and carefully drop it into his evidence bag the chad joined one other chad you 'll get none and like it , the republican said go down to broward , the democrat shot right back there s hundreds down there a dose of humor late saturday night , judge charles e burton , the canvassing board chairman here , was nearing the end of another exhausting 18hour day of dropped ballots and fallen chads , and he appeared in desperate need of a laugh mr burton approached a bank of televisions tuned to the nonstop florida recount coverage , and he asked a security guard to change one of them to saturday night live the television clicked on just in time for mr burton and two republican lawyers to watch a sketch featuring a parody of al gore and george w bush almost immediately , mr burton doubled over in laughter this is funny , the judge said this is really funny the republicans laughed along with him on a television screen next to saturday night live , mr burton momentarily appeared in a video clip on one of the cable networks the judge monetarily watched a video clip of himself holding up a ballot and peering at it quizzically , but the judge s eyes quickly returned to the sketch , and the laughs continued when it was over , mr burton grabbed a folding chair and sat down i'm 42 , he said , but right now i feel 80 mr burton is a former state prosecutor who was born and raised in boston a lifelong democrat , he was appointed to the bench in may by gov jeb bush of florida mr burton explained that the fact that he is a democrat who was appointed by a republican governor should convince people that he is fair but it seems only to have raised doubts among people on both sides about his true motives as he recalled the lobbying efforts of democratic and republican legislators , mr burton rolled his eyes and then he laughed about a threat made by monte friedkin , the democratic party chairman here , that he would never get elected in palm beach county of course i feel pressure , he said in a 30minute interview today this is a democratic county but it has not affected me people know me as fair and as a straight shooter mr burton could not help laughing about his assignment when he joined the bench in may , he inherited the job of canvassing board chairman because he was the new kid on the block , and he said that he had no idea what a canvassing board was they told me nothing ever happens on the canvassing board , judge burton said one week , i'm presiding over a drunk driving case , and the next week , this better timing next time denise m dytrych , the palm beach county attorney , admits that her timing could have been better she was on vacation in the bahamas when her legal counsel was most needed here as the canvassing board met at 2 am on nov 12 and decided to do a countywide recount , ms dytrych watched the proceedings from her hotel , on cnn , and wished she could have been there to give advice to the members at that meeting , judge burton advised the board to seek the advice of secretary of state katherine harris before proceeding with the hand recount but the board refused ms dytrych returned the next day to west palm beach she persuaded theresa lepore , the elections supervisor , to seek the opinion , which turned out to be binding and helped delay the recount for several days ms dytrych , a registered republican , said in an interview that she was angry that some democrats accused her of giving the advice to help gov george w bush i'm a lawyer i'm not a politician , said ms dytrych , who has served as county attorney for nearly five years and worked in the county attorney s office for nearly 14 democrats , including the harvard law professor alan m dershowitz , criticized the canvassing board , saying that their failure to begin the recount on tuesday at 7 am might cost vice president al gore the election there is a lot of tension and a lot of rumors , but i'm unfazable , she said i 'll go to work at the mall , if i have to from the elian case an odd guest made the media rounds today at the emergency operations center donato dalrymple , the fisherman from the elian gonzalez saga i was a victim of this administration , mr dalrymple told a handful of reporters and i just came here to check it out in one of the year s most famous photographs , mr dalrymple clutched elian in a closet in the home of elian s greatuncle , lazaro , while being confronted by an armed federal agent a reporter pointed out that mr dalrymple was in front of the cameras again i'm not here to steal the camera s attention , he said i want to

washington , may 25 judging by the nearly four billion solicitations that flooded american mailboxes last year , the credit card business would seem to be one of the most viciously competitive in how many industries does one business disparage another by name in national television advertisements , as visa has done with its longrunning they do n't take american express campaign \? even so , the federal government strenuously disagrees that consumers have as much choice as they need 19 months ago the justice department sued mastercard and visa , accusing them of violating antitrust laws in recent weeks , debate over this issue has sharply intensified as the suit approaches trial today , in a congressional hearing unusual in its timing so close to judicial proceedings , the largely behindthescenes dueling between two pairs of industry rivals american express and discover espousing the government s side against the defendants , visa and mastercard erupted before a senate subcommittee visa and mastercard , which are associations whose member banks account for about 75 percent of purchase volume , have a great deal to answer for , harvey golub , the american express chairman , contended , complaining , among other things , that their rules bar banks that issue either visa or mastercard from offering american express cards as well they operate a closed , selfserving , selfperpetuating system , mr golub asserted their operation of this system has harmed consumers , limited banks' ability to conduct their business , gouged merchants in the debit market and stifled innovation debit cards are the subject of a separate classaction suit brought by walmart stores and other retailers mastercard s chief counsel , noah j hanft , responded if american express gets its way , neither competition nor the consumer wins because it would undermine a system in which nearuniversal acceptance and guaranteed payment to merchants has brought spectacular growth in credit card popularity the government s suit , he added , is a solution searching for a problem and , if successful , will create a problem where none exists today the trial , scheduled to begin on june 7 in new york , is expected to take up to four months , with perhaps years of appeal to follow judge barbara s jones will hear the case without a jury the legal battle in credit cards comes at a time of swirling industry change advances in technology , consolidation into fewer large hands and shifting allegiances are already at work to make the ultimate effect of any legal outcome impossible to predict but consumers appear to have a big stake , perhaps gaining an even greater choice of products and better terms , although how much better off , if at all , they might become is a matter of fierce dispute as the parties prepare to square off before judge jones after more than a year of deposition and other pretrial factfinding , visa has started a vigorous effort to press its view that the case is little more than a clash of commercial titans in which american express , having blundered in the market , has persuaded the government to help it regain a competitive edge among other moves , visa has helped create a credit card educational group and circulated records of political donations by its rival and the fact that american express has hired robert h bork , a former federal judge , to lobby on credit cards responding in a memorandum to employees this week , mr golub said rather than focusing on the legal issues , visa has undertaken a campaign aimed at discrediting the government s case and indirectly impugning the motives of the justice department the thrust of this campaign has nothing to do with the merits of the charges against visa , but with the false and irrelevant claim that american express is somehow 'behind' the case the justice department s suit specifies two main ways in which it contends that the associations stifle competition in violation of the sherman antitrust act one is the practice of socalled dual governance under which visa and mastercard , which operate the infrastructure for thousands of member banks that are the actual issuers of cards , place representatives on each other s committees and allow a bank with a representative on , say , visa s board to have a big portfolio of mastercard accounts in an echo of the microsoft case , which also involved company rivals urging the government on , the government argues that this relationship discourages innovation that might occur if the two groups operated totally independently the government s second target is the associations' exclusivity rule , which prohibits any visa or mastercard banks from also offering cards regarded as competitive american express cards and discover card , which is owned by a subsidiary of morgan stanley dean witter , are the main alternatives philip j purcell , morgan stanley s chairman , told the senate panel , headed by robert f bennett , a utah republican , that consumers could save 5 billion a year if discover , which he said charges merchants 30 percent lower fees than visa and mastercard , was not hamstrung by their anticompetitive practices the associations respond by pointing to what they see as intense competition among member banks themselves , and by arguing that a restructuring of the industry would tilt the playing field in favor of competitors like american express that both issue cards and process transactions consumers , they contend , would be harmed by the undermining of a popular and efficiently delivered product visa has spent billions of dollars to promote its brand and to create a stateofthe art computer and telecommunications system that enables the use of visa cards worldwide , paul allen , its general counsel , said today at the same time , the mailboxes of consumers have overflowed with competing visa and mastercard solicitations in light of this history , one might have expected that the justice department , rather than filing a lawsuit against visa , would have commended visa for its contributions to consumer welfare , competitive vitality and innovation indeed , according to anita l boomstein , an antitrust specialist at the law firm of hughes hubbard reed in new york , the government is going to have a difficult time proving its case , stifled innovation being a more difficult argument than , say , the assertion that costs to consumers have been artificially raised photo philip j purcell , morgan stanley s chairman , says discover card is hurt by anticompetitive practices \( ruby washington the new york times \)

leaders of a union representing new york city school safety officers and housing authority workers took a tough line yesterday when they met with city officials to kick off a new round of citywide labor negotiations carl haynes , president of teamsters local 237 , demanded that the 18 , 000 city workers he represents receive a wage increase substantially above inflation and a cash bonus to compensate for the twoyear wage freeze the workers accepted in their old contract mr haynes s local was the first of 100 municipal unions to begin bargaining with city officials as part of a new wave of negotiations that will cover teachers , police officers , firefighters , sanitation workers and others close to 300 , 000 workers in all through coordination by the municipal labor coalition , an alliance of municipal unions , each union has agreed to demand a raise substantially higher than inflation for two years , we 've witnessed and heard endless discussions about the economic prosperity the city , state and federal governments are enjoying , mr haynes said , but none of that prosperity has trickled down to city workers we 're saying , 'it is about time' mr haynes s local represents school safety officers , police officers at cityowned hospitals and more than a dozen categories of housing authority workers , including maintenance workers , superintendents and heating technicians the contract for some of those employees expired on dec 31 for others , the contract will expire on march 31 the union s workers make from 20 , 000 to more than 40 , 000 a year a delegation of 100 representatives from the union met for 90 minutes yesterday with james f hanley , the city s labor commissioner mr haynes and mr hanley said the meeting was devoted to the union s presenting its demands we 'll take a look at them , we 'll analyze them and we 'll get back to them with our own proposals , mr hanley said it was an uneventful first session mr hanley said that at the next session , which has not been scheduled , he would present the city s demands , including mayor rudolph w giuliani s demand that all wage increases be based on merit mr haynes denounced that idea , saying managers would award raises based on favoritism and patronage mr giuliani announced yesterday that a newly named deputy mayor , robert m harding , would oversee the city s collective bargaining one of mr haynes s key demands was for no layoffs in any new contract he also called for reducing employees' pension contributions , having a costofliving adjustment for pension benefits and having a 401 \( k \) retirement plan with an employer match he also demanded onsite child care and expanded vacations and sick leave the giuliani administration has often said that it will not grant raises unless unions agree to productivity increases that finance the raises but mr haynes proposed that the city and union share any savings from past and future productivity increases city workers have had no real wage increases in the last 20 years , mr haynes said we have answered the city s call time and again for cooperation , taken benefit reductions , deferred funds owed to us , and now it s time for the pendulum to swing the other way we want our fair share of the pie we 've earned it

revisiting rent in its maturity more than four years after it opened at the nederlander theater on broadway , four and a half since its premiere downtown is a little like meeting a cousin for the first time since he or she was an infant and seeing a human being , not just the promising future mostly this has to do with reality in the interim not too many kids change the world , no matter what we envision for them and rent , alas , a rock opera so startlingly fresh and original when it first splashed down at the new york theater workshop in february 1996 , has n't altered the broadway landscape as many of us thought it might you may remember that rent followed close on the heels of george c wolfe and savion glover s bring in da noise , bring in da funk , another show that , fusing contemporary sound with the tradition of the musical theater , began life in a nonprofit off broadway house \( at the joseph papp public theater \) and moved to the commercial spotlight uptown and together they seemed to herald an exciting chapter in the american musical , one in which the sounds and ideas informing a younger generation would lure new audiences to the theater so how many like shows have followed successfully in their wake \? well , the bubbly black girl sheds her chameleon skin , by kristen childs , was well received at playwright s horizons this summer but on broadway \? exactly none bring in da noise , an unqualified success , lasted more than two years on broadway , but it is now long gone , and at the nederlander , the only broadway house below times square , rent has a tenacious , clingingtoprinciple feel it is showing its age in some conventional ways the current cast is talented , athletic and goodlooking , but reminiscent of the stirring originals in fainter colors , and the sound has become a little sloppy particularly in the raucous ensemble numbers , the lyrics by the gifted young composer jonathan larson who , dreadfully , died on the eve of his first show s first public performance are often unintelligible that robs the show , not just because the words are often clever and touching but because the story moves rapidly it s an east village rendition of la boheme , remember \? and like all good stories it deepens when the details are sharp still , rent remains a vibrant and visceral experience tuesday night s audience was pleasingly young and freshfaced , suburban , i think , rather than out of town , hopefully hip , with a collective archieandveronica mien , and if not exactly rainbowcolored , then not uniform either and even if they were n't following every plot line , they obviously thrilled to the romanticism of mr larson s wonderfully varied score you can tell when an audience is not merely being entertained by a show but has bonded with it , and this one did that s not surprising even for someone maybe twice the median age of the crowd it was evident that for all the avid show business on display , rent is the most realistic musical on broadway i had n't seen rent since its new york theater workshop days , and that s what i had forgotten about it it feels like a revelatory visit to a genuine place , poor but agurgle with energy , a circumscribed world , to be sure , but one that brushes against my neighborhood \( this is literally true i live only blocks away from the corner of 11th street and avenue b , where the show is set in an unheated loft \) the motley costumes \( by angela wendt \) , replete with imaginative lowbudget sex appeal the darkly dramatic lighting \( by blake burba \) that underscores an aftermidnight society the intermittent appearance of a squeegee man , with his mantra , honest living ! honest living ! the easy intercourse \( social even more than sexual \) among characters with variegated and flamboyant predilections the casual resignation to the lure of insidious drugs , the hormonal yearning worn on every sleeve , and , of course , the gruesomely poised scepter of aids all of these ground the show in a neighborhood as tangible as times square , and it s a foundation upon which the highly pitched emotions and ultimate tragedies of the musical s melodrama are , in a word , believable not to sound old and chastened , but it s easy to forget , i think , what it s like to be young , ambitious , frustrated , lovestarved , randy and broke , and even though our popular culture is overstuffed with paeans to the exuberance and pain of youth , it is rare when any work makes older people take younger people seriously we 've all been there , right \? what can we learn \? rent , for all its joyousness and generosity , is a terribly sad work two very lovable characters die and another is ill , and seeing the show this time i felt that sadness acutely maybe more than my fellow theatergoers , i found myself thinking of jonathan larson , whose death at 35 from an aortic aneurysm movingly , if cruelly , underscores the show s carpe diem theme i knew him , in a small way , long before i ever heard of rent , when he was living , i imagine , among the kinds of people his show brings to life a sweettempered young man with an easy , respectful manner , he worked behind the counter at a diner i frequented he told me he was a theater composer and occasionally filled me in on his works in progress he made a great milkshake , something i remembered in a powerful rush this week , when , in the opening moments of rent , the phone machine beeps in the loft that belongs to mark , the show s narrator \( trey ellett \) , and his hivpositive roommate roger \( manley pope \) on the line is mark s mother \( maggie benjamin \) , who delivers a cheery recitative it s mom we wanted to call and say we love you and we 'll miss you tomorrow cindy and the kids send their love oh , i hope you like the hot plate we tend to dismiss corrupted innocence as merely corrupt , when what rent gets across , persuasively and intelligently , is how wrong that is innocence fouled is still , at heart , innocence that s a message that has to come from the young , and in the musical theater at least , the subsequent silence has been profound jonathan larson would undoubtedly have had more to say now it s up to others photo manley pope and loraine velez appear in rent , with book , music and lyrics by jonathan larson the broadway musical is in its fifth year \( joan marcus rent \)
tel aviv , may 29 a court here delayed a decision today on whether to release two abducted lebanese guerrilla leaders whose freedom has been demanded by hezbollah as a condition for halting antiisraeli hostilities judge uri goren of the tel aviv district court said he would rule on july 12 on the cases of sheik abdel karim obeid of hezbollah , or party of god , and mustafa dirani of the amal movement , who have been held without trial since they were forcibly taken from lebanon sheik obeid , 43 , was seized in 1989 , and mr dirani , 49 , was taken in 1994 both as bargaining chips for the release of capt ron arad , an israeli airman whose plane went down over lebanon in 1986 the court hearing was the first time the men had appeared in public since their abduction earlier hearings were behind closed doors wearing a full gray beard and a large white skullcap , sheik obeid sat next to the bearded mr dirani as both men followed the proceedings through an interpreter hezbollah leaders have asserted that they will continue fighting israel until it releases the two guerrillas and other lebanese prisoners the united nations special envoy to the middle east , terje roed larsen , who is verifying the israeli withdrawal from lebanon , said on sunday that israel s release of the lebanese prisoners would give an additional impetus to the restoration of international peace and security in the area aside from sheik obeid and mr dirani , the israeli authorities say they are holding 15 other lebanese prisoners , who have been convicted of attacks in the former israeliheld zone in southern lebanon foreign minister david levy said today that none of the prisoners could be released at this time and that everything depended on whether quiet would prevail along the israelilebanese border the court hearing centered on the question of whether sheik obeid and mr dirani posed a danger to israeli security following a supreme court ruling last month that barred holding lebanese prisoners as bargaining chips , the government has argued that sheik obeid and mr dirani should stay in jail because they pose a security risk they 've become a symbol for the struggle of the terrorist organizations against israel , said devora chen , the government attorney if they are released , they will continue to play an active role in the terrorist organizations and go back to very senior positions there zvi rish , the lawyer for the guerrillas , responded that now that israel has withdrawn from lebanon , his clients no longer pose a risk , because they had vowed to fight israel until it pulled out when they leave lebanon , that s the end , he quoted sheik obeid as saying if we 're talking about state security , it could be that the danger lies in the very continuation of their imprisonment , mr rish told the judge , alluding to the hezbollah threats to fight on if the prisoners are not freed sheik obeid and mr dirani , in remarks reported by their lawyer and translator , sounded a similar warning , saying their continued imprisonment could lead to increased tension and antiisraeli attacks at the conclusion of the hearing , mr dirani asked to give his version of the disappearance of captain arad , whom he held prisoner before the airman vanished speaking briefly before he was cut off by the judge , mr dirani said the airman was stolen by iranian revolutionary guards in the bekaa region in april 1988 when his captors left him in a rush to identify bodies of guerrillas killed in an israeli attack on the village of maidun mr dirani said he had made a great effort to recover the airman , but israel complicated the situation and assassinated the hezbollah leader sheik abbas musawi judge goren ruled that given the newness of the issue and in order to examine further arguments made today , he would decide the case on july 12 until then , he said , the guerrilla leaders will remain in jail
the violent clashes between israeli forces and palestinians in the center of jerusalem s old city yesterday were disheartening just when prime minister ehud barak and yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , need to make another attempt to conclude a peace agreement , renewed tensions prevail ariel sharon , the likud leader , did israel no favor by provocatively leading his supporters to the temple mount on thursday , asserting jewish claims to the muslim holy site at a moment when authority over the area is the most sensitive remaining issue in the peace talks the sharon visit led to a series of confrontations that culminated in bloodshed hours before the beginning of the jewish high holy days the israeli political calendar leaves little time for further delay in negotiations with the palestinians four weeks from tomorrow israel s parliament will return from its recess , bringing renewed pressure on mr barak s minority government for new elections or a more rightleaning coalition cabinet israeli , palestinian and american negotiators must try to use the weeks ahead to resolve the relatively few but highly charged issues blocking a final peace agreement the camp david meeting in july pointed toward progress on a number of previously intractable issues but it broke down over questions of political authority in jerusalem , particularly sovereignty over the old city s principal religious sites the temple mount contains two of islam s holiest mosques , the dome of the rock and alaksa along one side of the mount is the western wall , a remnant of the ancient second temple and judaism s most sacred place of worship finding a creative formula for international sovereignty over the temple mount is the key to a final settlement at camp david , for the first time , mr barak signaled that israel would consider giving up some of the sovereignty it now exercises over all jerusalem for the sake of a comprehensive peace he is willing to let some of the city s arab residential areas be transferred to palestinian control for the old city and its religious sites , israel rejects palestinian sovereignty but is prepared to consider more flexible formulas one idea currently being considered is to let the united nations security council exercise sovereignty over the temple mount none of israel s proposed compromises have drawn a positive response from mr arafat , who declares that the entire arab and islamic world supports his demand for full palestinian sovereignty over the temple mount if mr arafat maintains this unhelpful rigidity there will be no agreement if israeli politics then shifts in a more hawkish direction , the palestinians will have lost a historic chance for an internationally recognized state with substantial american and international financial assistance although most of the burden for compromise now lies with mr arafat , mr barak can help the personal relationship between the two leaders has been chilly mr barak is making efforts to establish a better rapport , including a cordial meeting the two men held in israel this week american diplomacy can also help but in the end , if negotiations are not undermined by a new round of unrest , mr arafat must decide if he is ready to make a deal with an israeli government willing to offer the most generous compromise terms possible under current political circumstances if he passes up this opportunity , the result could be many more years of stalemate and conflict
thanks go to gov christine todd whitman of new jersey for this week s lesson on the sorry state of being sorry in america your typical runforcover politician might have blushed after being caught on camera in an embarrassing pose while running around with the police a photo from 1996 showed the white governor patting down a black man and flashing a delighted lookee , i'm tossing a perp grin this after her state troopers had already frisked the man and found nothing blushing is not the whitman style , though asked whether she would apologize to the man , she said , an apology would be too easy easy for whom \? one had to wonder all too often , politicians and other public figures cling to the notion that prominence means never having to say you 're sorry as fate and soundbite imperatives would have it , who do you think was on the spot huffing and puffing over mrs whitman s frisky ways \? none other than the rev al sharpton , himself a worldclass nonapologizer he has been urged many times to express regret for falsely accusing a former dutchess county prosecutor of kidnapping and rape in the tawana brawley mess time and again , mr sharpton s response has been , what , me sorry \? then again , maybe it is just as well that the political types say nothing when they do offer apologies , they tend to mummify them with phrases like , if i 've offended anyone , then i'm sorry that if tells you they are simply annoyed to be stuck in a bad spot add now another wrinkle that is turning up with some regularity this is the apology that is earnestly offered , only to be unceremoniously rejected john rocker , the fatuous pitcher , came to town with the atlanta braves two weeks ago for the first time since the notorious magazine interview in which he insulted immigrants , gays and nearly everyone else in new york he also came hat in hand his remarks offended many people , he acknowledged , and for that , i sincerely apologize let no one accuse the mets' more selfrighteous fans of responding to contrition with charity they booed mr rocker relentlessly at shea stadium , and threw back a baseball he had tossed into the stands as a peace offering last week , city councilwoman annette m robinson of brooklyn suffered a nasty bout of footinmouth disease , saying that police officers looked like men who , had they been out of uniform , would have taken part in last month s sexual assaults in central park she quickly apologized did police commissioner howard safir magnanimously say , here s to you , ms robinson \? not a chance if she is truly interested in apologizing , he sniffed , she should resign from a council committee that studies police performance mr safir , mind you , is another champion nonapologizer , who finds it hard to say even oops when his officers smash down the wrong doors on drug raids the apology rejections are piling up jane fonda tried yet again last month to ask forgiveness make that beg forgiveness for her hanoi jane ways during the vietnam war referring to a famous photo of her behind an antiaircraft gun aimed at american planes , she told o , the oprah winfrey magazine , it was the most horrible thing i could possibly have done veterans' groups told her to take a hike some people said the same to the hartford courant after it apologized last week for having run slave advertisements two centuries ago herman badillo , chairman of the city university of new york , had an apology thrown back in his face by students after he made offkilter remarks last year about mexicans and dominicans the rev jesse jackson has expressed contrition many times for his 1984 hymietown crack still , many jews wo n't forgive him certain people simply will not let go of others' stupid remarks , said dr laura lamontanaro , a clinical psychologist at nassau county medical center in east meadow , ny if you do n't like someone to start with , and you hear a comment like that , it s enough for you to bury him , she said dr harold s koplewicz , vice chairman of the psychiatry department at nyu medical center , added that celebrities were often not given the same break most of us get in our dopier moments we think we know john rocker or jane fonda , he said , and we hold them to a standard that s quite unfair with mrs whitman , one thing is sure when it comes to apologies , she considers herself mirandized she seems to be saying that she has the right to remain silent
richard coate arrived in korea on his 25th birthday , in early february 1951 , as a rifleman for the united states army later he worked as the company clerk , in charge of tasks that still haunt him identifying the bodies of soldiers who fought alongside him in the war , writing the casualty reports that tallied the wounded and the dead and sending out letters of condolence to the families of those killed in combat corporal coate moved to brooklyn after the war and became an actor but as much as he tried to forget the wrenching moments of his service , he said , it has been more painful over the years to realize that his war seems to exist only in history s margins yesterday , thousands of veterans , military officers , politicians and others marched up fifth avenue in the nation s first major parade commemorating the korean war s 50th anniversary and honoring those who served 200 , 000 new yorkers and 16 million other americans mr coate said he was overwhelmed by all the attention marching bands , flag and bannerwaving veterans from along the east coast , rough riders and floats carrying marines and dancers in traditional korean dress crept up fifth avenue , from 42nd to 77th street , as spectators and shoppers pausing between stores lined the parade route , clapping , waving and shouting , thank you ! at one point i had to steel myself , because it s a very moving experience to pass by and have all these people applaud and express their gratitude , mr coate said i really had to check myself it came over you like a flood the parade in new york , called the nation s parade , was one of several events scheduled over the next three years to mark the 50th anniversary of the conflict that began on june 25 , 1950 , when north korea , backed by the soviet union , invaded south korea , a united states ally the parade officially began at 11 01 am , a minute after church bells had marked the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month , the anniversary of the signing of the armistice in 1918 , which ended world war i while the parade mostly featured korean war veterans , men and women who served in world war ii , vietnam , bosnia , the persian gulf and on united states military bases mingled together on the sidelines , saluting as clusters of korean war veterans passed by gen harry mott , 72 , who served in korea as a lieutenant in the 27th infantry , an outfit called the wolfhounds , and later as deputy chief of the army reserve , marched in uniform along with his son jeffrey mott , 41 , a master sergeant who is the chief instructor for the army s military police school in the bronx and who served in the persian gulf and in bosnia describing his reaction to the fanfare yesterday , general mott was initially speechless , pointing to his throat to indicate that he was all choked up i lost a lot of good friends over there , he said more than 33 , 000 american soldiers died in the war mr coate also spoke of friends he lost during the war , but in recent years he has found others who survived , because of a photograph taken of him in korea on march 4 , 1951 , after mr coate had spent the night at a lookout spot inside a crater hole across the han river from seoul , south korea , he ran across a frozen flood plain to a lone farmhouse that had been gutted by fire and was being used as an assembly point a photographer for the associated press asked mr coate if he could photograph him standing in the doorway mr coate agreed , and the photograph , a silhouette of the soldier leaning against the doorway holding his rifle , was published over the next few weeks in several newspapers in the united states along with dispatches from the korean war mr coate left korea on jan 1 , 1952 , he said , and served on a united states military base until june of that year then , 13 years later , the same photograph appeared in public service announcements , used in 1964 and 1965 for the united service organizations , posted on subways and in magazines mr coate recognized himself but he did not do anything with the photograph until 1989 , when he saw an advertisement seeking help to raise money for a korean veterans memorial fund because he believed that the photograph would be useful for that effort , he and the photographer , james e martenhoff , distributed it , and it has appeared in several books and articles the image was also etched into the korean war veterans memorial in troy , ny since then , mr coate has become heavily involved in documenting and publicizing the history of the korean war yesterday , mr coate walked alone , holding a poster of that 1951 photograph high above his head it also included information about the korean war veterans national museum and library , under construction in tuscola , ill , and its web site , www theforgottenvictory org there s been so much hype among korean war veterans about this parade , mr coate said yesterday after he returned to his home in brooklyn heights asked if yesterday s parade lived up to the hype , he said it was a day that none of us will ever forget as far as we 're concerned , we 've begun to write ourselves back into history photo louis wasoff , a veteran of the united states navy from queens , saluted as troops passed him on fifth avenue in the veterans day parade yesterday mr wasoff marched down the avenue offering his salutes as the troops marched up it past him \( suzanne dechillo the new york times \)
yekaterinburg , russia igor g varov , wearing a pistol on his hip , opens the sun roof of his big mercedes 600 to remove the illegal flashing light he uses to maneuver through traffic on the icy streets of this industrial city in the ural mountains he and his colleague , andrei v kabanov , are on the prowl in a poor neighborhood where the heroin addicts are out at dusk searching for dealers in the snowy courtyards and darkened stairwells look , there s some addicts , he says , as the silver sedan careered into the alley next to a dilapidated apartment block two teenage boys eye their arrival warily mr varov and mr kabanov jump out and start barking orders in almost one voice get over here ! show me your arms tell me where they are selling drugs , and do n't lie mr varov is unfazed by protests from the teenagers one is visibly shaking that they are not addicts and do not know where drugs are being sold two other young men approach , believing that they have also been summoned by mr kabonov s repeated shouts to get over here ! but now mr varov wheels toward them what are you doing here \? get out of here or i will break your legs here at the crossroads of asia and europe , where the supply lines of opium and heroin out of central and south asia run into big population centers near the frontier of the drug trade , a group of tough guys have organized themselves as a foundation called city without drugs they are leading a brutal civic campaign to take the streets of yekaterinburg back from the drug dealers and the corrupt policemen who are widely believed to be protecting them we call ourselves the angered public , said mr varov , 36 , who runs a construction materials company and we are doing this for people who want to be rid of these drug dealers we go to these drug selling sites with baseball bats and flashlights and find out where the drug dealers are and beat them like wild dogs in the lawless vacuum that afflicts much of russia today , mr varov and mr kabanov regularly incite acts of vigilante violence against drug dealers they have also founded a drug treatment center where addicts are forced to withdraw from heroin use cold turkey while handcuffed to their beds or sometimes just to the nearest radiator they , and a loose knit band of business associates , are a sign of the jarring social transition under way in many parts of the country where vigilante violence and paramilitary organizations have assumed a greater role in policing and guarding russian business people and ordinary citizens but sometimes they turn on these people and extort money from them not long ago , mr varov went on television and said that if the drug idemic raging here ever touched his own family , the top law enforcement officer in the region , gen aleksei a krasnikov , would not live beyond that day they are upfromnowhere street toughs , gang leaders or sportsmen who in the last decade have muscled their way into one business or another as their power and wealth have grown , they have embraced religion or taken up public causes in some cases this was genuine , but in others it was a means to clean up their image and wrap themselves in the mantle of publicspiritedness while staving off prosecutions we are all for killing drug dealers on the spot without trial because they are poisoning our children , says mr kabanov , 40 , a onetime professional card player and former heroin addict himself , who built a yacht club for the region s nouveaux riches he dresses in a natty black outfit under a stubble of red beard that enhances his roguish presentation he and mr varov have determined that the heroin plague that is sweeping across russia is a conspiracy by muslim nations and chechen warlords to lay low their motherland no one wants a strong russia , mr varov contends , including america there is no dispute about the problem they confront the opening of borders and of formerly closed cities in russia , along with the collapse of the sovietera economy , ignited a wave of illicit trade in everything for which there is a market in the world arms , drugs and prostitution in the space of less than a decade , the number of heroin addicts here rose to an estimated 60 , 000 to 80 , 000 from a few dozen the number of drug addicts across the country is expected to reach three million in russia this year that is well behind the united states , where there are an estimated 12 million drug users , but the rate of growth in russia is phenomenal in the first half of 1999 , heroin use in russia was up 45 times compared with the same period in 1998 and the number of hiv infections , many of them from shared needles , doubled in 1999 , according to an interior ministry report issued in november in a country where alcoholism already is rampant , a culture of soaring drug addiction is gaining ground , further undermining the basic health of the nation russia is suffering such a sharp rise in overall mortality and declining birth rates that the average life expectancy for russian men has declined to 613 years for women it is 729 years
washington , july 14 whizzing around camp david in golf carts and on bicycles , as if they were resort guests and not confined like prisoners of diplomacy in a pressurecooker summit meeting , israeli and palestinian leaders spent their fourth day in secluded negotiations today they divided into groups to tackle issues separately , and a senior palestinian official who is not inside camp david said the americans had begun to offer proposals to bridge the gaps with the information lid still tightly secured on the presidential retreat in maryland , it was unknown how far the parties had progressed toward an actual agreement or whether , as some american officials believe , they had not progressed much at all so far , they have averted a crisis , a showy packing of the bags or a deliberate leak to the news media but reuters cited unidentified palestinian officials as saying they had come close , and claiming that yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , was ready to storm out in anger after seeing the american proposals officials on all sides expect that the serious decisionmaking will begin only this weekend , despite a slowdown for the jewish sabbath on saturday , and will build toward some kind of peak early next week before an unofficial deadline of wednesday , when president clinton is scheduled to depart for a group of 8 meeting in okinawa the informal atmosphere including one fenderbender between negotiators' golf carts belies the seriousness of the mood , said joe lockhart , mr clinton s spokesman these are intractable issues , he said these are issues that go to the vital interests of both of the parties , so this is very serious you know , at times discussions are tense , but that should come as no surprise to you a senior israeli official said that prime minister ehud barak s spirits remained as high as they were on the flight to the united states at that time , the official said , mr barak believed that both sides were primed to compromise because they saw only negative alternatives renewed violence and unilateral steps that would complicate each party s carefully nurtured international standing israeli and american officials are stressing to the palestinians that mr barak , whom they had soured on long before the summit talks , represented their best hope for a conciliatory peace partner this is the picture they are painting despite the fragility of his new minority government , mr barak , as a former general committed to forging an agreement , has the authority to sell serious concessions to an israeli public hungry for an end to the conflict if no agreement is reached and the relationship disintegrates into violence , mr barak could end up forging a unity government with the rightist likud party or he could go to new elections , in which case either a rightist leader or a centrist with less clout as a security expert than mr barak would be elected in israel , some cabinet ministers have been priming israelis for possible concessions by publicly discussing some of the compromises that may be on the table at camp david some israeliarab lawmakers have been leaking ideas , too none are new thoughts , but they are being aired in what seems to be an effort to ease them into the realm of the possible for instance , yossi beilin , the justice minister , whose draft agreement in 1995 with abu mazen , the secretary general of the palestine liberation organization , is providing a template , said on thursday that israel would consider swapping land with the palestinians that is , in order to retain some of the west bank and annex the jewish settlement abutting jerusalem , it might be willing to turn over land adjacent to gaza and avraham burg , the parliament speaker , who has served as an unofficial israeli spokesman in washington and new york this week , hinted that land swaps might work in jerusalem too jerusalem could expand and shrink , he suggested that is , it could gain some neighborhoods the jewish ones outside its limits and lose others , the arab ones within it is an idea that would provoke volatile emotions in israel but could help broker a solution to the thorniest issue , jerusalem further , an israeliarab legislator , ahmed tibi , who used to advise mr arafat , said he had learned that both sides had agreed that israel would relinquish the few remaining settlements in the gaza strip the periphery of camp david drew both israeli and palestinian opposition leaders today limor livnat , a lawmaker from the likud party , showed up at the thurmont elementary school to give a piece of her mind to the hundreds of reporters awaiting any information she opposes the summit meeting but she was ushered out by american officials , into the parking lot , where a ragtag collection of protesters gather every day nabil amr , a palestinian cabinet minister , was similarly exiled earlier in the week american officials are trying to keep the parts of the camp david area that they control a propagandafree zone in order , as one said , to give peace a chance also on the outskirts of the summit zone , secretary of state madeleine k albright met with palestinian opposition leaders who were barred from entering camp david to consult with mr arafat she spoke with them in emmitsburg , md , where side conferences on issues like the environment and the regulation of the electromagnetic space shared by the two sides are supposed to be discussed they are not being allowed to see mr arafat inside the retreat because it is restricted to official delegates , american officials said given the spirit of the ground rules we 've put down , we indicated that we would prefer that that meeting not happen up at camp david , mr lockhart said
a casino in bridgeport would create 7 , 500 fulltime and temporary construction jobs , pump 650 million of revenue a year into the fairfield county region s already vibrant economy , and would create a demand in ancillary industries of 350 million if run by a native american tribe , as at foxwoods and the mohegan sun , a 150 , 000 squarefoot casino in bridgeport with 5 , 000 gaming positions , 125 table games and 3 , 500 slot machines would also generate nearly 100 million for the state of connecticut but it would also result in an additional 29 , 700 vehicle trips traveling along the already congested i95 on a typical friday during the worst time period possible the 48 pm evening rush hour and extend that heavy traffic by several more hours a bridgeport casino would also have a devastating impact on air quality with pollution becoming so bad it would be tough to comply with acceptable levels of pollution under the federal clean air act those were the two conflicting views presented to about 75 realtors , bankers and businesses executives at a seminar last week in stamford by the local branch of the real estate finance association on how a bridgeport casino would help fairfield county s economy , but hurt its overburdened infrastructure and surrounding environment along the coast over the years , there have been a handful of proposals to build a casino in the city , none of which have been approved entitled native americans , gaming and fairfield county , the breakfast seminar brought together a panel of casino supporters and detractors , as well as a native american chief from kent who explained his tribe s quest for federal recognition and what that could mean to its chances to someday operate a casino the decade of the 90 s saw native american gaming come full circle during that 10year period , native american casinos evolved from high stakes bingo with pull tabs , some card rooms and some slot machines legal or illegal to the successful development of some of the largest casino resorts in the united states , said mickey brown , former president and chief executive of foxwood resorts casino in ledyard and now a lawyer in atlantic city the distinction between indian casinos and the commercial casino industry is fading and becoming less and less obvious , mr brown said but i want to tell you how the development of another native american casino in connecticut would impact the present economy and its overall affect upon western connecticut mr brown said a casino in bridgeport would likely result in annual gross revenues of 660 million for the casino , and stimulate the region s economy with sales of items such as food and beverage purchases , marketing , utilities , entertainment , repair and maintenance and administration he said all costs excluding wages would be in the range of about 170 million he said employees would be paid more than 136 million in annual wages and benefits casino jobs are new jobs created where none previously existed , said mr brown because the business is highly labor intense and operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , the casino business becomes a substantial employer immediately to sum up , casinos import money at foxwoods we did over 1 billion in revenue during my last year there joseph mcgee , vice president of the south western regional planning agency , said he told the group that a casino in bridgeport would greatly worsen an already existing daily traffic nightmare along interstate 95 and the merritt parkway in just 10 years the number of vehicle miles per day on i95 has increased 30 , 000 miles to 128 , 000 vehicle miles per day , mr mcgee said and even without a casino those numbers are going to keep increasing by nearly 2 percent a year with a casino , all of these problems traffic , air pollution , the deteriorating infrastructure will be greatly exacerbated richard l velkey , chief of the schaghticoke tribal nation in kent , said just as the more wellknown golden hill paugussetts , his tribe continues its long quest for federal recognition so that it may one day operate a casino in bridgeport but mr velkey said because of a complex system regarding the federal tribal recognition process , he is not sure the region or state is ready for another casino here in fairfield county and across connecticut municipalities have no way of properly planning for future development , mr velkey said this broken process is not only a source of frustration for the schaghticoke , but it raises serious questions as to how many tribes will win federal recognition , when it will happen , and how state local federal and tribal leaders can work together to assure that the end result will benefit citizens and not create a situation that will negatively impact our community

the rough stone emerges from the african soil at fortresslike mines in the war zones of angola or straight from the muck of a dammedup river in congo after journeying across continents and oceans , after being graded , cut , polished and set in gold along the way , a diamond lands in a display window in manhattan , transformed into a pricey symbol of eternal love and beckoning to bridestobe the journey can take months or even years to enforce the myth that diamonds are rare and valuable , most of the world s rough stones are hoarded in london and then carefully fed back into the world market de beers , the south african conglomerate that controls twothirds of the world s rough diamonds , decides how many will be sold , when , to whom and at what price where they are mined responsibly , as in botswana , south africa or namibia , diamonds can contribute to development and stability but where governments are corrupt , rebels are pitiless and borders are porous , as in angola , congo or sierra leone , the glittering stones have become agents of slave labor , murder , dismemberment , mass homelessness and wholesale economic collapse while market manipulation guarantees the price in world markets , the portability and anonymity of diamonds millions of dollars' worth can be smuggled in a sock , and identifying where they came out of the ground is often impossible have made them the currency of choice for predators with guns in modern africa you ca n't wage war without money , and diamonds are money , said willy kingombe idi , who buys diamonds from diggers in congo people are fighting for money everything that happens , it s about money de beers estimates that only 3 percent of global rough diamonds now come from conflict areas in africa , according to andrew lamont , a company spokesman who repeatedly said it was difficult to define a conflict area but christine gordon , a londonbased journalist and independent diamond expert who has been critical of de beers , said that as recently as the mid1990 s , diamonds from african war zones accounted for 10 to 15 percent of world supply in any case , violent goingson in diamondrich africa have done nothing , thus far , to change the consuming habits of americans , who buy more than half the world s diamond jewelry sales jumped about 11 percent last year diamond sales are also booming around the world , with de beers showing record sales last year of more than 5 billion digging in the mud at the bottom rung of the international diamond trade , the need to scrape up enough money to eat sends africans like mati balemo clawing through the mud of a congolese stream bed mr balemo is a digger on a recent morning , he and six other diggers set off from kisangani , in northcentral congo , traveling first by bicycle taxi and then on foot along the way , a soldier armed with a stubby machine gun demanded to come along but he hired another bicycle taxi , which took a spill on a hill , pleasing the diggers they arrived after three hours at a small stream where the thick canopy of bamboo and vines made the early afternoon as dark as twilight the diggers had been working this site for a month and had found only a few diamonds they used shovels to dam off small sections of the stream then they heaped mounds of mud onto the bank they picked out big rocks from the mud and sifted through what was left with metal screens nailed to wooden frames diggers like mr balemo are driven by the dream of one stone that will change their lives for weeks or months they work bent over in shallow rivers or in pits in three years as a digger , the biggest diamond mr balemo ever found was a stone of 216 carats worth 800 that diamond , if it were of flawless color and clarity , could retail for as much as 10 , 000 in new york , experts say mr balemo split his 800 with five fellow diggers miki galedem , 30 , another digger who started when he was 16 , once found a monstrous stone of nine carats he was paid 4 , 800 but he was young then , in 1993 , and the money disappeared , he said , on beer and women standing in a pool of water stilled by mounds of mud , the diggers professed not to think much about their business where the diamonds go , who wears them and at what price diamonds are beautiful , mr balemo said everyone wants to be beautiful that is normal he was kneedeep in the stream , and had been sifting mud a brown stew with pebbles and quartz for an hour suddenly , he found a diamond he popped it in his mouth to clean it and then showed off a shiny white stone half the size of a raisin his friends clapped , and one digger guessed that traders back in kisangani would pay 20 at most for the stone i'm very glad , mr balemo said , not smiling much , for this was the first diamond in nearly a week it s not much money for all that work the soldier with the stubby machine gun , who had been watching closely from the river bank , then came over and took the diamond he folded it into a scrap of paper backed with gold foil and stuffed the packet into his chest pocket by the rules of congo , the guy with the gun got the diamond even when the stones are taken from the ground using the most sophisticated equipment , the game is roughly the same financing the arms
in the movie bowfinger , a downonhisluck filmmaker played by steve martin says of hollywood s obsession with youth , they can smell 50 it appears that such olfactory acuity is also working its way into book publishing certainly when it comes to new authors , and sometimes established writers , too if you have ever dreamed of writing a book during your retirement the only stage of life when many people would have the time to achieve such a goal your age may work against you often insidiously disguised , but sometimes blatant , ageism in book publishing is almost impossible to quantify the business , after all , is noted for its quirks and exceptions but from finding a literary agent to marketing a book that has been published , an author may find that age raises the bar at every step that conclusion is easily drawn from discussions with a number of writers , agents and others in the business first , the disguised part if you are 67 and have written your first book , you will have a harder time finding a publisher than you will , say , if you are 27 that is because agents and publishers are looking for authors with the potential , and time , for multiple books that can build a brand , as one agent put it on the other hand , if you are an older , published author with a track record of modest or declining sales , you may also have trouble because you are viewed as not having enough time left to turn around your career of course , there are spectacular exceptions the one most often mentioned is having our say the delany sisters' first 100 years , by sarah and a elizabeth delany , both more than 100 years old when they published their best seller in 1993 but a more typical case might be that of nicholas wollaston , 74 , of britain , who can be designated a midlist writer , one whose books have sold respectably but not in huge numbers none of his 13 fiction and nonfiction books have hit the jackpot , as he put it in a telephone interview late last month from his home in colchester , england i 've had better reviews than sales , he said mr wollaston s 14th book , a novel titled man in the net , was rejected last summer by chatto windus , a british publisher owned by random house what made the rejection particularly difficult for him to accept was the praise that the book received from a chatto windus editor in a letter to mr wollaston s agent , the editor called the book one of unusual and exceptional quality but the editor went on to reject the book because it came late in the author s career mr wollaston chronicled his rejection in an article in august for the observer of london the 'man in the net , ' he quipped on the phone maybe that s me a spokesman for random house in new york said an author s chronological age is not a factor in how it selects books to publish more blatant ageism is illustrated by the experience of a 54yearold american writer who has written six books , both fiction and nonfiction , and who spoke on the condition that his name not be used five years ago , the writer was shopping for a new agent he called a woman at a wellknown agency who had been recommended by friends when i talked to her , she was very tentative , and i wondered why , he said i sent her some stuff that included one of my books with my picture on the jacket the next time we talked , she said , 'i do n't like to handle men of your age' i was stunned we had never discussed age a few months later , i sold the film rights to a novel for 500 , 000 this agent called me back and said , 'let s talk' i simply told her i had found another agent the writer said he had also seen ageism in the marketing of his books the clear message has been that i'm not good looking and young enough to sell a book , he said there is a sense that young authors drive sales in bookstores it does n't happen to be true , but marketing departments seem to think it is the promotion people i have dealt with have all been young and into glitz and appearance he said he was considering using a pen name and forgoing the traditional author s photograph on the jacket one book i did like this was very successful , he said it got marketed on its merits , not on whether there s a hot young author involved jay mandel , 28 , an agent with the writers shop in new york , said he seeks out young writers and jokes that he may be part of the problem rather than the solution but one of his clients , marian fowler , 71 , a midlist nonfiction history writer , recently received the biggest advance of her career for a book she is writing on the history of the hope diamond mr mandel said the easiest way to overcome the age barrier was with a nonfiction book with nonfiction , you can hold out hope with what is a remarkable and appealing and commercial idea , he said this can effectively level the playing field he finds it odd that while publishers have a large audience of older readers , the bar for an older writer is higher it s hard to calculate how much higher , but it s foolish to say it does n't exist , he said it does drawing \( nancy carpenter \)
istanbul , feb 14 a growing scandal stemming from a crackdown on a religious terror group has led to accusations that the group may have received weapons from the turkish government in a series of raids that began last month , the police have found 56 gruesomely tortured bodies buried at hideouts used by the group , called hizbullah there was another raid today in the eastern provincial capital of van , resulting in a shootout in which five police officers and two suspected militants were killed soon after the first bodies were discovered , several leading politicians and news commentators charged that hizbullah had worked with the military in its war against rebels among the kurdish ethnic group in eastern turkey military commanders denied the charges new evidence has emerged in recent days suggesting that hizbullah used weapons that were imported by the governor of a province in the heart of the war zone since there are weapons missing , they could have ended up anywhere , prime minister bulent ecevit said this is an extremely serious situation , and it is being investigated with the seriousness it deserves civil service investigators said the man who was governor of the mostly kurdish province of batman in the mid1990 s , salih sarman , might be charged with establishing an armed unit without permission governors in turkey are appointed by the central government according to press reports , a cache of weapons including at least 443 automatic rifles , 115 rockets and 1 , 450 hand grenades that was sent to batman by the turkish government is missing newspapers have reported that many of those weapons were given to hizbullah during the 1990 s , hizbullah militants were believed to have killed many suspected members of the rebel kurdistan workers party , known as the pkk , the initials of its name in kurdish the government was then involved in a noholdsbarred war against the rebels military commanders have denied that they gave weapons to hizbullah the turkish armed forces have never had a relationship with any terrorist organization and will never have such a relationship , gen atila isik asserted thousands of suspected political killings were committed in kurdish provinces during the war in batman province alone , there were at least 363 such mystery killings , none of which have been solved another 43 people are listed as missing newspapers have charged that tansu ciller , who was turkey s prime minister in 1995 and 1996 , authorized local officials in the kurdish region to distribute weapons to terror groups that opposed the rebels mrs ciller has admitted that she ordered weapons delivered to the batman governor , which was an unusual step , since weapons are normally sent only to military units she said that her order had been approved by the military chief of staff and senior police officials , and that she was glad today that we took those actions then we met and made a decision , mrs ciller said we agreed that terror was the top issue , and that we had to do whatever was necessary it was not possible to act otherwise we had to do everything possible , and we did president suleyman demirel said military commanders had assured him that all weapons in batman could be been accounted for but he said that some of the weapons might have been given to paramilitary village guards , and that from there they may have found their way to other places the state is not always obliged to follow routine , mr demirel said it can deviate from routine when higher interests require it , if the government approves those statements provoked strong protests from several politicians one of them , salih yildirim , a prominent member of parliament , said the constitution specifies what the state may and may not do anyone who acts outside these limits is committing a crime a retired general , nevzat bolugiray , told an istanbul magazine that he believed that hizbullah might have received government weapons , but that the transfer had not been approved by military commanders some people who see themselves as patriots formed what amounts to a terrorist group , general bolugiray said i believe there may have been government officials who used hizbullah against the pkk this creates the appearance that it was official state policy , but in my opinion it was actually an action taken by certain individuals reports of how the government fought kurdish rebels in batman have led to a series of revelations about actions taken in other kurdish provinces newspapers have reported that in 1994 the governor of van , a province where rebels were also active , approved formation of a secret unit made up of 18 kurdishspeaking soldiers the soldiers posed as rebels , apparently seeking to find out which families or villages would sympathize with them they also harassed local peasants , demanding money , weapons and volunteers the unit s roughness was apparently too persuasive it was ambushed outside the village of diyadin by a squad of village guards loyal to the government eight of its members were killed and another nine were wounded photo turkish policemen carried an officer on a stretcher yesterday after he was wounded in a shootout with hizbullah guerrillas in the city of van \( reuters \)
it was his turn in the batting cage , so edgardo alfonzo politely removed himself from a conversation with reporters before the fourth game of the national league championship series last night excuse me , alfonzo said i 've got to go kill somebody here alfonzo , the mets second baseman , has become more than an onfield warrior he is a team leader , and he did not like the relaxed atmosphere around the mets in game 3 , a blowout loss to the cardinals our attitude should be more aggressive , from the dugout to the field , he said after game 3 , alfonzo told todd pratt , the reserve catcher , that the mets were playing as if they were down in the series , not up to pratt , the message was clear the mets' bench players had to show more energy , and they gathered last night and decided to do so the mets got it right this time , playing with passion from the start they beat the cardinals , 106 , at shea stadium and now stand one victory from their first national league pennant since 1986 the mets' no 1 starter , mike hampton , can pitch them to the world series tonight in game 5 the mets were alive on the bench and the diamond they fell behind , 20 , in the top of the first inning but stormed back , hammering away at the cardinals' best pitcher , darryl kile , as the players on the bench whooped it up it s a team thing , and they keep things lively , said third baseman robin ventura , who hit the fourth of five met doubles in the first inning when stuff starts happening , they react to it that s how big innings happen when ventura s double knocked in alfonzo and mike piazza , 10 mets burst from the dugout to greet them on the field , embracing the players and the 32 lead the mets had claimed they would never trail again the cardinals outhit the mets , 119 , but the mets bunched their runs in the early innings to overwhelm st louis the mets led , 72 , after two innings , and when starter bobby j jones faltered in the fifth , glendon rusch came on to earn the victory by pitching three scoreless innings piazza had a home run , a double and three runs scored , ventura knocked in three runs and timo perez scored three times in this game , the mets were unfazed by a situation that had doomed them on saturday three batters into the game , the cardinals were ahead by two runs if there was ever a herewegoagain moment , it was this , because the mets had experienced it in their 82 loss saturday that day , fernando vina led off with a single , edgar renteria reached on a bunt and jim edmonds doubled in two runs last night , vina doubled , renteria bunted him to second and edmonds hit a tworun homer the mets' situation could not have been much worse they were down by two runs and knew they would have to get to kile early , because he tends to improve as the game goes on but kile was working on three days' rest , a situation in which he has been awful in his career mets first baseman todd zeile noticed a difference of about four miles an hour off kile s fastball , and kile had to use it , because he was not getting called strikes on his curveball the mets went to work on kile early in the count perez whacked a groundrule double that bounced over the rightfield wall , extending his postseason hitting streak to seven games alfonzo ripped the next pitch down the rightfield line for another double the mets had closed the gap to 21 , with piazza up next that was especially bad news for kile , whom piazza devours in 35 career atbats off kile \( including a 2for3 performance in game 1 \) , piazza had 13 hits , for a 371 average he got ahead in the count , 20 , then extended his arms and did what he does best , stroking a sizzling liner that kept carrying over right fielder jd drew s head alfonzo , who thought drew might make the catch , had to hold up at third no matter two pitches later , ventura doubled both runners in after zeile grounded out , benny agbayani swung on a 30 pitch and blasted a double off the wall in leftcenter the mets had a 42 lead , and their five doubles were the most in one inning in nlcs history zeile , the only met without a double among the first six hitters , got his in the next inning , when he thumped a hanging curveball into the leftfield corner , scoring two runs agbayani singled in another run to put the mets in front , 72 after home runs by will clark and piazza , the mets had an 83 lead when jones , who tossed a onehit shutout in his last start to clinch the division series against the giants , unraveled in the fifth he gave up three hits to start the inning , and manager bobby valentine called for rusch i 've said all along that one of the keys to this series was to keep me out of the games , rusch said if i'm coming in , one of our starters is in trouble fortunately tonight , i guess , i came in at the right time rusch allowed two of the runners he inherited to score in the fifth , but he worked a scoreless sixth and seventh to turn the game over to the mets' lateinning tandem of john franco and armando benitez the game could have gotten more interesting in the sixth with ray lankford on first and two outs , zeile dived to his right to snare a hard grounder by carlos hernandez and then beat the cardinals' catcher to the bag with the score 86 at the time , the injured slugger mark mcgwire would have pinch hit that was the place to take a shot , cardinals manager tony la russa said he was on deck strong defense continued to aid the mets in the seventh , perez ran down a fly ball in the rightfield corner and fired in to second to catch shawon dunston , who was trying to tag up that play ended the inning besides the mental lapses , poor defense also hampered the cardinals , who allowed two unearned runs on two errors by fernando tatis in the sixth the mets hit well , fielded well and capitalized on the cardinals' mistakes one more game like this , and they can hold up their end of the subway series date they know their attitude will not impede them the key for us is to come in tomorrow and want to put these guys away , and not have that same mentality we had when we were up 20 , center fielder jay payton said i do n't think that 'll be the case we 're up 31 now , and none of the guys in here want to go back to st louis i think we 'll come in tomorrow with the same mentality we had today , and hopefully that 'll carry over inside pitch mets catcher mike piazza has patellar tendinitis in his right knee , the same ailment afflicting the cardinals' mark mcgwire , manager bobby valentine said piazza apparently was injured on saturday , said valentine we 'll keep watching it , he said valentine said he still intends to start rick reed in a potential game 7 of the nlcs despite reed s performance on saturday , when he allowed five runs and eight hits photos placido polanco of the cardinals looked for a safe call as edgardo alfonzo stretched to keep his foot on second base for a forceout in the ninth inning \( chang

washington , may 5 a maryland judge ruled today that the state could go ahead with its prosecution of linda r tripp on charges that she broke the law when she secretly taperecorded conversations with monica s lewinsky about ms lewinsky s relationship with president clinton but the judge , diane o leasure of howard county circuit court , also dealt a severe blow to the case by suppressing the testimony of ms lewinsky and another witness that may be crucial in obtaining a conviction judge leasure ruled that the testimony of ms lewinsky on one critical point was not credible the judge dismissed as implausible ms lewinsky s statements to the court in december about why she was certain that a specific conversation secretly taperecorded by mrs tripp had occurred on dec 22 , 1997 the date of the conversation is pivotal because the maryland law under which mrs tripp is charged specifies that a person is guilty only if it can be shown that she knew at the time of the taping that it was illegal although mrs tripp recorded more than 20 hours of her telephone conversations with ms lewinsky , the one that occurred on dec 22 was the only one that took place after prosecutors believe mrs tripp was definitively informed by her lawyer that it was illegal to tape phone conversations in maryland without the consent of the other party the fact that ms lewinsky has admitted that she lied under oath in a federal proceeding and has stated that lying has been a part of her life does not enhance her credibility as a witness , judge leasure wrote in her 41page opinion in addition , judge leasure ruled that prosecutors could not use the testimony of another witness , mary catherine friedrich , the only other person who might have been able to identify the time period in which mrs tripp secretly taperecorded her conversations with ms lewinsky the chief state prosecutor in the case , stephen f montanarelli , acknowledged in an interview that while the ruling allowed him to go forward , we now have a very serious problem mr montanarelli said he would review the ruling and make a decision whether to pursue the prosecution without the testimony that judge leasure barred in her ruling today he said he would decide before the scheduled trial date of july 10 mrs tripp said today that she believed a decision by mr montanarelli to go forward after today s ruling would be especially vindictive and malicious the decision to indict me was politically motivated and wrong , she said in a statement this case is being prosecuted solely because i blew the whistle on president clinton s attempt to fix a court case she was referring to paula corbin jones s sexual misconduct lawsuit in which mr clinton and ms lewinsky both denied having had a sexual relationship the issue decided today involved whether the maryland prosecutors could demonstrate that their evidence against mrs tripp was developed independently of and did not rely on the work of kenneth w starr , the independent counsel who investigated mr clinton on whitewater and other matters that is because when mrs tripp became an informer for mr starr , telling him of the president s relationship with ms lewinsky , she was given a grant of immunity although judge leasure sharply limited the scope of the immunity agreement earlier , prosecutors still had to demonstrate that their witnesses and evidence were not derived from or tainted by knowledge of mr starr s findings in the dec 22 conversation , mrs tripp and ms lewinsky discussed the subpoenas they had just received in the paula jones lawsuit ms lewinsky talked about whether she could lie for mr clinton , and they discussed gifts he had given her ms lewinsky testified that she did not rely on her association with mr starr s investigators to identify the tape recording as having occurred on dec 22 , 1997 , as the investigators had concluded she said she recognized the conversation as having occurred a few days before christmas of that year because it coincided with other memorable events but judge leasure said there was no question that ms lewinsky had been exposed greatly to mr starr s investigation , even seeing testimony as to the date of the conversation the defense argues that ms lewinsky is 'bathed in impermissible taint , ' judge leasure wrote the court agrees joseph murtha , mrs tripp s lawyer , said that while he had hoped judge leasure would have dismissed the case , he believed her ruling significantly hobbled the state s ability to prosecute judge leasure ruled that prosecutors could not use ms friedrich s testimony because they only learned of her through the starr investigation ms friedrich said mrs tripp played some of the tapes for her and she knew that one occurred around christmastime because it had mrs tripp yelling at her daughter for knocking down the christmas tree if mr montanarelli decides to go forward , judge leasure ruled , ms lewinsky s testimony will be limited to her assertions that she never gave consent to have her conversations with mrs tripp recorded the ruling appears to leave the prosecutors with only the testimony of some of mrs tripp s partners in a weekly bridge game and a neighbor , all of whom seemed aware that she was secretly taping conversations with a woman named monica who was having an intimate relationship with mr clinton the women testified that mrs tripp sometimes boasted of secretly taping the other woman and even invited ms lewinsky to a christmas party at her columbia , md , home so the others could gaze upon the woman she had told them about judge leasure ruled today that the testimony of those women could be used by the prosecution but none of them seemed able to recollect exactly when they learned of the taping , and none are able to identify the date of the crucial dec 22 , 1997 , conversation

chicago , june 13 gasoline is so expensive in the midwest that a retired railroad worker in cleveland says he had to cancel his annual summer drive to visit his daughter in san francisco a volunteer agency that delivers meals to shutins in milwaukee cannot afford to pay its drivers enough to fill their tanks a florist in urbana , ill , is talking about raising what he charges to deliver his roses and carnations and in suburban chicago , kathy stachnik says she now considers putting gas in her blue 1997 honda accord an evil necessity whenever i stand at the pumps these days , i'm just furious , said ms stachnik , 38 , as she bought 10 gallons of gas at an amoco in arlington heights for 225 a gallon i know that something fishy is going on with these prices gasoline prices in the midwest have risen sharply in recent weeks , jumping as much as 50 cents a gallon and far outstripping increases in the rest of the country in chicago and milwaukee , drivers are paying more than 2 a gallon , the first time prices have ever soared that high in the united states , analysts say in recent days , the federal government has been trying to determine why the prices in the midwest have risen so steeply the environmental protection agency and the energy department met with oil refiners on monday in washington and the clinton administration and the house judiciary committee have asked the federal trade commission to look into whether the increases involve price gouging or collusion we do n't have good explanations , said robert perciasepe , the environmental agency s assistant administrator for air and pollution programs we 're not seeing this anywhere else in the country gas prices increased across the country in the last few weeks as the summer driving season began gasoline inventories are being depleted , and new requirements for cleanerburning gasoline became effective on june 1 but the spikes in the midwest are especially steep on friday , the most recent day for which figures are available , the average price of selfserve regular gasoline in chicago was 213 a gallon , up from 137 a gallon in january , according to trilby lundberg , an analyst who compiles the lundberg survey of gas station prices by comparison , prices on long island averaged 167 a gallon last week , up from 139 in january and prices in los angeles averaged 156 a gallon in june , up from 129 in january industry representatives say the price increases in the midwest are a result of several factors the most significant , they say , is the new federal requirement for cleanerburning gasoline , known as rfg2 in the midwest , unlike in other regions , the additive oil refiners use to make their gasoline comply with the regulations is ethanol because ethanol evaporates quickly , it requires a special formulation of gasoline , said edward h murphy , general manager for downstream operations at the american petroleum institute , an industry group it s more difficult to produce that gasoline , mr murphy said as a result , production is significantly lower another factor , industry officials say , was the rupture in march of a texas pipeline that midwest refineries depended on for their supply the pipeline was repaired two weeks later , but it is still operating at only 80 percent capacity a third factor is a court ruling that the unocal corporation can collect royalties on a particular type of cleanerburning fuel that has prompted smaller refineries to curtail rfg2 production to avoid paying royalties to unocal , industry analysts say in a situation where supplies are tight , and you have relatively inelastic demand for gasoline , the price increase you need that occurs in the market is disproportionately large , said mr murphy , who said some refineries are carting in the fuel they need by barge from nova scotia or the gulf states if the price of lemons goes up , you move to limes if the price of coffee goes up , you move to tea but with gasoline , consumers do n't adjust very quickly in a very short term obviously you do n't go out and trade in your brand new ford excursion for a toyota camry officials at the environmental protection agency and the energy department acknowledge that all these factors play a role in increasing gas prices somewhat but they say none is sufficient to account for the precipitous price jumps in cities like chicago and milwaukee all of these may have some impact but they do n't seem to explain the size of the disparity , mr perciasepe said for example , he said the cost of producing cleaner gasoline with ethanol should lead to only about a 5 cent to 8 cent increase in gas prices whether people are taking advantage of some of these situations is something that we hope to be able to understand better a senior official at the energy department said that although the supply of oil was tight in the midwest , we were n't persuaded by the arguments of the refiners generally speaking , all of the large suppliers say they have adequate supplies to serve the demand the official added , it has the administration very concerned , obviously sam stratman , a spokesman for the house judiciary committee and its chairman , representative henry j hyde , republican of illinois , said that oil companies had years to prepare for the increased costs of the rfg2 regulations this is a complicated issue , mr stratman said it deals with issues of supply and demand and regulatory changes mandated by epa , and you wonder , have these changes given oil companies a chance to gouge consumers \? of course , americans still have the lowest gas prices in the world the organization of petroleum exporting countries , which controls nearly half of the global oil supply , will meet next week to decide on whether to increase production although the prices in chicago and milwaukee are the highest on record , they are still lower than gas prices were at their peak in march 1981 , when the national average price of a gallon of gasoline was 267 , if adjusted for inflation , ms lundberg said that is hardly comforting to beleaguered drivers across the midwest these days it s outrageous , said colleen posinger , 44 , of streamwood , ill i'm really upset about the gas prices , because we told our 10yearold daughter that we 'd drive to south dakota this summer the vacation was already planned , so i guess we 'll just have to take the crunch others , like adam matavovszky , the retired railroad worker in cleveland , decided they could not afford their vacations in milwaukee , goodwill industries , which delivers meals to the elderly and also takes disabled people to workshops and training programs , has been hit by 23 , 000 in extra fuel costs this year , said roger sherman , vice president for human services he said the organization had asked for emergency assistance from the milwaukee county department of aging and might have to cut back on transportation we are running 150 percent over budget ,

yehuda amichai , the israeli poet who distilled his experience and his nation s into highly metaphorical verse written in hebrew and translated into more than 25 languages , died yesterday in jerusalem he was 76 he died of a rare form of lymphoma , said stanley moss , a poet and close friend in his poetry mr amichai often wrote about love and loss and , in recent years , about aging and mortality , all of it linked by his gift for poeticizing the particular the localized object or image in everyday life from his point of view , the role of a poet was to name each thing , each feeling , each experience , plainly and accurately , without pretense in mr amichai s verse , said the critic robert alter , there is a tension between personal experience and the violent pressures of history mr alter continued writing about himself , he is also writing about everyman mr amichai s work derived from his own background as a young man fleeing from nazi germany to palestine in the 1930 s , as a soldier who fought in the british army in 1948 and in the israeli forces , and as a husband and father and lover articulating his feelings and dreams he was firmly rooted in contemporary israel and fully aware of the politics that surrounded him , but he often treated it by indirection and had been known to write love poetry in time of war reviewing the selected poetry of yehuda amichai in the new york times book review in 1986 , edward hirsch said , mr amichai is an essentially autobiographical poet with the rare ability to characterize the complex fate of the modern israeli , the private individual inevitably affected by the public realm of war , politics and religion he said that mr amichai was like one of emerson s representative men , updated and living in jerusalem , a prophet who speaks in the guise of an ordinary jewish citizen concerned with his people and his place in hebrew and in translation , mr amichai s work is remarkably accessible , imaginative , unburdened by artificiality and often almost conversational as a result , he was that exception a poet who is read by a wide public and not just by academics and other poets his books sold about 15 , 000 copies on average in israel , comparable to bestseller status in larger countries still , in the manner of a poet , for many years he had to support himself by teaching his celebrity in israel followed him down the street walking in jerusalem , his home for many years , he would be recognized and accorded the attention that in the united states might be reserved for a movie star or athlete none of the public attention seemed to turn his head in person , he seemed as unpretentious as his poetry the reason a poet is a poet is to write poems , not to advertise himself as a poet , he said in a profile of mr amichai in the new york times magazine in 1986 , mr alter said about his work , his hebrew is often rich in soundplay , wordplay , allusion and other traits of virtuosity that are not readily evident in translation , and his language is a shifting mixture of colloquial and literary but because he was popular in so many countries eastern and western , intellectuals in his own land sometimes regarded him with skepticism , as if his popularity negated his authenticity as an artist in the larger world of poetry , his position is secure mr alter said that mr amichai saw no contradiction in a poet s also being a man of action and that a symbolic tie between the two can be discovered in his use of poetic metaphor as a weapon in the handtohand struggle with reality mr amichai said he believed that metaphor is the great human revolution , at least on a par with the invention of the wheel words were his arsenal , as in his poem of my time is there in this land a stone that was never thrown and never built and never overturned and never uncovered and never discovered and never screamed from a wall and never discarded by the builders and never closed on top of a grave and never lay under lovers and never turned into a cornerstone \? in an interview with lawrence joseph published in the paris review , mr amichai said , a poet s state of mind is seeing the world with a kind of double exposure , seeing undertones and overtones , seeing the world as it is irony was an essential element in his poetry , a way , he said , of always trying to see another side' that was how he lived , he said , focusing , refocusing and juxtaposing different shifting and changing perspectives describing his process , he said he combined different , sometimes competing , language and forms before he began writing , he said he thought about the shape the poem would take almost visually , like a piece of sculpture i can touch it then he would fill it in with my subjects , from the entire world of my subjects freely mixing techniques and forms , he wrote poetry that ranged from terse fourline images to sonnets to the epic travels of a latter day benjamin of tudela
there were two people derek bell had to acknowledge after he crossed home plate yesterday one was his mother , who was in the stands , and the other was his pitcher , who was at the front of a pack of mets swarming to greet him bell had just ripped donne wall s first pitch over the wall in leftcenter field , breaking a tie in the bottom of the eighth inning and sending the mets to a 21 victory over the san diego padres in their shea stadium opener his home run made the starter al leiter the winner i told him that was for him , for keeping us close , bell said the other new addition to the mets' starting lineup , first baseman todd zeile , drove in the mets' other run with a sacrifice fly in the seventh inning armando benitez , who opens the season as the mets' closer after beginning last year as a setup man , pitched a 123 ninth for his first save , delighting the soldout crowd of 52 , 308 facing the padres lefthander sterling hitchcock , the mets were able to get only one runner past first base through the first six innings zeile , who was stranded after a leadoff double in the second leiter , who stayed behind during the mets' seasonopening twogame split with the chicago cubs in japan last week , thought his teammates might have been sluggish i kept hearing a little grumbling that i 'd better do good , because a lot of our guys were tired , leiter said , smiling especially with the way sterling was throwing i know our guys have that jetlag thing , and he was throwing the ball well hitchcock spotted his fastball well and used his changeup effectively , coming inside with it and surprising the mets by using it with a full count wall relieved him in the seventh inning , striking out darryl hamilton and rey ordonez to snuff a mets rally , and he got two quick outs in the eighth then bell connected , and leiter was rewarded few players on the mets draw as much attention to themselves off the field as bell , whose garish clothes and jewelry suggest selfpromotion but the mets are finding that bell , who was acquired from houston in the mike hampton trade in december , is much more aware of his teammates than it seems pointing at leiter as he celebrated his home run emphasized that derek can come across as a little goofy and not always thinking at times , said leiter , who allowed five hits in eight innings , but believe it or not , having talked to him about baseball and pitching , and what he thinks about hitting , he s a very knowledgeable player just for him to make reference to that , he knew what was going through my mind at the time , and i appreciated it leiter stood to be the losing pitcher for much of the game , having given up a solo home run in the second inning to third baseman phil nevin , who had three of the padres' five hits but he was masterful otherwise , allowing only one hit in 10 atbats with runners on base , striking out seven and walking none his outing was similar to rick reed s in the second game in tokyo reed allowed four hits and one run in eight innings that game , but left with a nodecision as the mets won in 11 innings on benny agbayani s pinchhit grand slam the mets are hitting only 177 through three games , but it has not mattered much we 're not scoring bunches of runs right now , catcher mike piazza said but if we 're able to get that pitching , we 're going to win games piazza , who flied out to the warning track in his first atbat , singled to deep left field in the seventh , allowing edgardo alfonzo to go from first to third alfonzo had led off the inning with a walk , only the second surrendered by hitchcock , and when zeile followed piazza to the plate with runners at the corners and no one out , he got ahead in the count , 21 after the mets lost john olerud as a free agent last winter , they turned to zeile , who played third base for texas last year one thing that appeals to the mets is that , while zeile sees a lot of pitches , he is more inclined to swing when he is ahead in the count , rather than wait for a walk , and the mets believe he can drive in 100 runs so it was yesterday zeile said he was anxious at the plate in japan , where he was 1 for 7 , but he relaxed yesterday , letting hitchcock fall behind in the seventh before taking an aggressive approach and driving the sacrifice fly to right field zeile was sitting on the bench next to piazza when bell hit his home run in the eighth moments before , piazza predicted that bell would hit one out piazza and zeile looked at each other , and piazza joked that he deserved all the credit i'm not really clairvoyant or anything , said piazza , who nevertheless added that 8 of his 10 predictions last year came true i just had a feeling it s just one of those things you have to have that feeling the mets are feeling good about themselves now , thanks in part to the heroics of bell , who entered this season as the leastknown quantity in the regular lineup bell hit 236 last year , lowest in the national league among those who qualified for the batting title , but he has been productive in the past the productive derek bell the one who batted 314 in 1998 is the hitter mets manager bobby valentine is counting on i think he s a good player , valentine said i 've had really good images of him in my mind for many years yesterday s image was the most memorable of all inside pitch edgardo alfonzo , who did not make an error on a ground ball all last season , was charged with one in the second inning when he misplayed ruben rivera s grounder alfonzo made only five errors last season mike piazza , who has been working to improve his defense , threw out carlos hernandez trying to steal second base in the seventh inning the mets improved to 2415 in home openers photos the mets

move over , thomas edison george mueller and ihor lys have seen the future of lighting , and it has nothing to do with light bulbs mr mueller , who is 29 , and mr lys , who is 30 , received a patent this month for a digital lighting technology that they contend may ultimately replace the conventional lighting that has been around in one form or another from incandescent to halogen for more than a century their fledgling bostonbased company , color kinetics , which just received 13 million in financing from investors that include deutsche bank , imagines that one day ordinary houses will be equipped with digital lighting such illumination might instantly change the hue of a wall from muted eggshell to splashy pigments throbbing chromatically to the beat of beck or bach or whatever music happens to be playing the technology is based on lightemitting diodes or led s , those tiny little lights that have been around since the 1960 s as indicators on electronic circuits and stereos essentially , the inventors have bunched many diodes together for a new type of color lighting the led s are very , very small and you can package them into any conceivable twodimensional shape , said kevin dowling , the director of engineering at color kinetics led s are semiconductor devices that light up when an electrical current passes through them they have become increasingly brighter in the last 10 years , mr dowling said and even more important for mr mueller and mr lys , in the mid1990 s , a japanese inventor figured out how to make a blue led thus completing the elemental light palette of reds , greens and blues that , when mixed together in different intensities , yields nearly any color of light that the human eye can detect the patent covers microprocessorcontrolled led s used for lighting and display purposes examples can be seen at the company s web site , www colorkinetics com the approach is very different from the traditional method of creating colored light , which is to put a filter or gel in front of a whitelight source so that only certain colors of the spectrum shine through while the patent was pending , color kinetics had already been selling products its lighting is used primarily for large displays in departments stores and other commercial uses but , mr mueller , who is the company s chief executive , contends that the technology enables virtually unlimited applications far beyond the products that the company now sells the company cites other advantages to its led lights for one thing , they emit no ultraviolet light , so they will not fade fabrics or artwork and led s are a very lowtemperature light source , so they will not burn the skin if touched how many people does it take to change a color kinetics light fixture \? none , according to the company at least for 11 years that is how long color kinetics contends it takes the led s to burn out and then only if they have been running continuously 24 hours a day mr mueller and mr lys received patent 6 , 016 , 038 , which was assigned to color kinetics a lightemitting chip for small computers martin lepselter has patented a selfilluminating semiconductor chip a breakthrough that he contends could be used to manufacture laptop computers that sell for as little as 100 people forever having been trying to get light out of silicon , but they 've only been able to get minuscule amounts , said mr lepselter , who holds 55 patents and is a former director of the semiconductor division at att bell labs he managed to do so , he said , by inserting more than a million miniature fluorescent tubes , each grouped into triads of red and green and blue , with each triad acting like a tiny color pixel it s like a myriad of microscopic fluorescent bulbs that shine out through the cover of a chip s package , mr lepselter said unlike a liquid crystal display , or lcd , mr lepselter s invention is a plasma display albeit a miniature one that relies on a technology very different from the plasma displays already found in large flatpanel screens plasma displays require no independent source of lighting as a result , according to mr lepselter , his technology could be used to build a laptop computer that consists of little more than a keyboard and an eye piece that resembles those found on stereopticons those oldfashioned viewers that create a threedimensional illusion with stereo images of a photograph when the computer user leans into the eye piece , he will see the equivalent of a large screen because the eye becomes part of the optical circuit , mr lepselter said there are other tiny little displays in existence , most of them using lcd s , mr lepselter said but nobody has made a small plasma display the same technology could be used for many inexpensive electronic devices , from video conferencing devices to virtual reality eyepieces , according to mr lepselter he received patent 5 , 990 , 620 , which he plans to license through his company , btl fellows inc , based in summit , nj patents may be viewed on the world wide web at www uspto gov or may be ordered through the mail , by patent number , for 3 from the patent and trademark office , washington , dc 20231
willingboro close your eyes , and on a bright spring afternoon you can envision the rapidly pounding feet of one the country s greatest track stars coming up the straightaway as a teenager in the late 1970 s , when willingboro high school was new , carl lewis ran sprint after sprint around the very track that now bears his name even now , the legacy of mr lewis and his championship teammates lingers just last weekend , the willingboro boys track team won the burlington county open meet the sectional and state track meets which they regularly win are coming up but you wo n't hear the pounding feet of boys practicing on their home turf at carl lewis stadium the track is considered unsafe and has been closed i'm sad that this is happening , but i am in complete agreement that we should n't be running on this , said the boys' track coach , gerald richardson , as he bent down and pointed out a twoinchwide crack that ran across six lanes i ca n't let my kids get hurt for now , there is nothing in the school budget for a new track , which would cost 300 , 000 , or even a good resurfacing , which would run about 90 , 000 the last school district budget was defeated by residents in april , and it is unlikely that any extra money will be found to repair the track the stadium track stands in stark contrast to the wellmanicured football and baseball fields adjacent to it it is on those grassy expanses where the boys' team and the girls' track team which itself has won eight county championships since 1980 sometime practice i tell the kids that they will see adversity in life and that this is just one of the things that will happen that you ca n't let get you down , said mr richardson still , it seems clear that he is upset what is a shame is that track may be the town s biggest legacy , and we 're risking losing it , he said willingboro has a distinctive history it was founded as a quaker community in 1682 as wellingborrow and stayed fairly rural for the next 275 years , its main distinction coming as the summer home of sir william franklin , the last colonial governor of new jersey and benjamin franklin s illegitimate son by 1950 , the population was 852 but william levitt saw a different future for the borough the builder of huge landmark housing developments in new york and pennsylvania started to acquire land in the borough and by 1956 owned 90 percent of it levitt started building a planned community there soon after , one that the sociologist herbert j gans moved into in 1958 to study the town s dynamics the result was the levittowners ways of life and politics in a new suburban community , \( columbia university press , 22 \) i bought house no 25 , so i was there from the beginning , mr gans , now a professor of sociology at columbia , said in an interview last week the farmers sold out and everyone made money it was not an agricultural hot spot , an azalea growing area , maybe corn , but not much farming the residents were all white that changed within a few years , mrs gans said , after the new jersey supreme court ruled that communities receiving federal funds were required to integrate levitt made quick steps to comply , mr gans said he wanted to be remembered for a model community at first , mr gans said , most of the few dozen blacks to move here were the families of officers at nearby fort dix by 1959 , residents changed the name of the borough to levittown , and by the following year , the population had grown to about 11 , 000 in 1963 , when the population reached about 18 , 000 , the town again voted to change its name , this time to a corruption of the old one willingboro whatever its name , the town thrived the next few years brought the first hospital , the first traffic light , a model shopping center , new schools , an industrial park , a golf course by the 1980 s , the town fluctuated between 36 , 000 and 40 , 000 residents , becoming more heavily populated with middleclass black families like the lewises today it is one of the few predominantly black middleclass towns in the state at a school board meeting this month , residents and administrators alike agreed that a committee should be formed to find a corporate sponsor to help refurbish the track to that end , some residents have tried to reach mr lewis , who after graduation went on to win nine olympic gold medals in sprints and the long jump though mr lewis now lives in houston , the stadium was named in his honor in 1984 on the football scoreboard looking down on the vacant track is a small logo a swoosh the trademark of nike , mr lewis s athletic shoe sponsor the athletic director at willingboro high school , david riley , said the administration has not talked to mr lewis , but nike is among the companies they have contacted to help out in a telephone interview last week , a spokesman for nike s track program said the company might well interested in helping out the school for their part , supporters of the track team said they would be happy to change the nike logo for any other if a company would ante up and help rebuild the track all i can say is people are looking into it , ' said mr richardson , who teaches special education at nearby lenape high school he was an assistant track coach at willingboro from 1993 until 1998 , when he was promoted to head coach this is an interesting town with lots of pride the track team is definitely part of that at some point , the long cracks that snake through the asphalt track were shored up with tar but the sun and heat make that tar gummy , and on a really warm spring day you can push your finger down at least a halfinch into it you can imagine what that would be like if a kid got his spike stuck in that , said mr richardson that s asking for injury so while the track sits vacant , the athletes practice on the nearby grass and in the carpeted halls of the school i ca n't say that s optimum , but we get by , said mr richardson this year , i 've seen more taped shins and ankles than ever before you ca n't have young kids pounding and pounding and getting shin splints so we have to rest more it s a difficult thing right now while the many of the school s athletic teams have been successful , none have matched the track teams the boys' team has won nine state championships since the 1979 , the year carl lewis won the group 4 title he still holds the south jersey long jump record with a 26foot , 6inch jump in 1979 willingboro athletes also hold south jersey records in the 800meter run and four different relay events despite its lack of proper practice fields and tracks , willingboro is undefeated this season , going into the sectional championships next week and the state meet after that mr richardson is hopeful on many counts i think the people now know how important the track team has been in the community , he said i have sixth graders looking through the fences they know about carl lewis and they know how long this has been a good thing in the community it has brought us together in good and bad times companies spend money on so many things , he observed i just hope

the exxon mobil corporation , the nation s largest oil company , was ordered by an alabama jury to pay 35 billion in damages after it found the company guilty of defrauding the state of royalty payments from natural gas wells situated in state waters the verdict is one of the largest ever against a company in a case based solely on accusations of financial harm , and it rivals the 5 billion awarded by a jury in alaska in 1994 against the company for environmental damage caused by the exxonvaldez tanker oil spill the case against exxon mobil was brought last year by the state s department of conservation and natural resources , which contended that the company had illegally deducted certain expenses from natural gas production royalties paid to the state the amount of underpayment , the state says , varied from 87 million to 132 million , depending on the accounting the award , which came after two hours of deliberation and 11 days of testimony , was immediately denounced as meritless by the company , which said it would appeal but it won praise from gov donald siegelman of alabama the verdict is appropriate because it is against a company that attempted to cheat the people of alabama , he said what is even more appalling is that this company stated they believed they could get away with their scheme because the people of alabama were too inexperienced to understand they were being cheated exxon mobil said in a statement that it strongly disagrees with the verdict we have always endeavored to fully comply with the requirements of our leases , it said no evidence of fraud was offered at the trial and none was considered by the jury analysts say they expect the verdict to be reduced on appeal they also say exxon mobil , which had revenues of 166 billion last year and has operations throughout the world , has the economic resources to pay a scaleddown award without much financial strain it s a huge , huge verdict , said thomas harrison , publisher of lawyers weekly usa , a legal industry trade publication will it stand up \? no verdicts like this are almost always reduced on appeal mr harrison , however , said that what was striking about the verdict was that it came over a purely financial issue whether the state had been adequately compensated for natural gas taken from 13 wells along the alabama coast typically , large jury verdicts over accusations of corporate wrongdoing come over issues of health , as in cases brought against tobacco makers or consumer safety , as in many cases brought against automakers , rather than over what is essentially a contract dispute from a public relations standpoint , this is obviously not good , mr harrison said but it s a whole lot better than if they had hurt someone if you have a huge verdict because some poor people have gotten burned , that has a much more vivid effect than a picture of a gas well mark flannery , an analyst with credit suisse first boston , a brokerage firm , said that if the 35 billion verdict was upheld , it would be a significant event , even for a company like exxon but if the verdict is reduced to an amount in the hundreds of millions of dollars , he said , at exxon , no one would notice the company is that big mr flannery said that from a market standpoint the verdict should have little effect on exxon mobil s stock price because the court appeals will have a long way to run and exxon will fight this hard exxon s stock in afterhours trading barely moved when the verdict was announced , which came a few minutes after the 4 pm closing of the new york stock exchange the jury determined , in siding with the state , that the company owed alabama 877 million in compensatory damages to come up with the 34 billion in punitive damages , the jury accepted the argument of the state that exxon mobil s decision to underpay the state could have brought 1 billion to the oil company over the next 30 years and awarded punitive damages at least triple that amount

there are many yacht races which can stake a claim as the world s toughest , but when it comes to longterm hardship , breakneck sailing and an honest chance for disaster , it is difficult to oneup the singlehanded vendee globe race today s start of the fourth running of the nonstop roundtheworld event was postponed until tuesday , because of unsettled weather off les sables d'olonne , france twentyfour sailors from six nations none from the united states are scheduled to start the first is expected back after more than three months at sea the race record is 105 days the vendee is one of a slew of roundtheworld races on the calendar the bt global challenge , a crewed event for amateurs that started in england , is en route to argentina on its second leg the race , a nonstop contest for unlimited catamarans , begins from barcelona , spain , on dec 31 and the professional volvo ocean race \( formerly called the whitbread \) is scheduled to get underway next september but to the vendee goes the mantle for mayhem four years ago , the vendee started badly and then went completely haywire of the 16 sailors who set out , only 6 finished one , the canadian gerry roufs , was lost at sea three more were plucked from foundering boats in the cold , wet wilderness south of australia yet in france , where the soloists are national heroes , the vendee docks have been overrun by tens of thousands of fans over 100 , 000 spectators are expected to line the shore to view the start , which will be carried live on french television for more than three decades , french skippers have dominated longrange solo yacht racing interestingly , it is a pursuit the english invented the aviatorturned sailor , sir francis chichester , won the first organized singlehanded transatlantic race , in 1960 , and another briton , sir robin knoxjohnston , was the victor of the first solo roundtheworld event , in 1968 then the french won the next seven roundtheworld races , including all three previous vendee globes but , recently , the french have experienced some uncharacteristic setbacks last summer , 24yearold ellen macarthur became the first briton in three decades to win a solo transatlantic race from england to newport , ri moreover , of the four british sailors entered in this year s vendee event , three of them macarthur , the fleet s youngest skipper , and the veteran campaigners mike golding , 38 , and josh hall , 40 are sailing welltuned 60footers with full corporate backing macarthur and golding are on most insiders' lists of prerace favorites there are clearly some firm dents in the french armor , golding said in a phone interview last week after a long drought , these are heady times for british sailors in the sydney olympics , the english team won five medals , three of them gold and there is much conjecture that in 2003 england will field its first america s cup challenge in 20 years we 've always had talented people who wanted to do these things , but it s been a funding issue , hall said there s a big national lottery now and many of the profits are put back into sports , so our olympic sailors were able to train full time that was certainly reflected in the medal count as for professional campaigns like his , hall , who is partially backed by the investment management company gartmore , said sailing sponsorship is getting more mature corporate sailing , where companies take their employees out for teambuilding exercises , has become very big business the whole thing has mushroomed funding and support are important elements , but so too is the injection of fresh personality , which macarthur s transatlantic victory has also brought there s been some momentum building , golding said josh and i had the first new boats to come out of the uk , which i think helped ellen s campaign get up and running once it was , of course , macarthur s success further illuminated the spotlight being young and female , it added another dimension of interest to the public , hall said that s sort of mirrored by mike and i being old and gray and hobbling around our boats it s important to note that macarthur , through her youthful eyes , sees none of this in such a highminded way i 've been sailing in france for three years now , so i do n't think of myself as an english person out here to beat the french solo sailing is just so massive here in france , she said , partly because it s been supported to such an extent by the public attitudes are changing in england , but it wo n't happen overnight that evolution of thought may take an accelerated step if one of the british skippers leads the french fleet home in the long , hard vendee globe they are going it alone , of course but collectively , they harbor the hopes of a nation that once , as they say , ruled the waves making waves the offshore powerboat circuit returns to the florida keys this week for the key west world superboat championship , which begins today and continues through saturday over 75 boats in 12 classes are scheduled to compete photo josh hall , shown during the 1998 around alone race , is one of three british contenders in the vendee globe

consider it a classic bill schrader moment at a big telecommunications convention in geneva last october , william l schrader , chairman of psinet inc , the biggest independent internet service provider , announced that psinet had just struck a deal to offer highspeed internet access in europe the partner , he said , was winstar communications inc , an american wireless carrier , allowing psinet to bypass the continent s traditional phone systems trouble was , winstar s top executives in new york knew nothing about a deal with psinet maybe bill was predicting the future , william l rouhana jr , winstar s chairman , said lightheartedly in an interview last week , noting that his company had never announced such an agreement all mr schrader would say , by way of explanation , was that psinet had indeed negotiated a european deal with winstar the fact that rouhana did n't know is n't my problem , he said odd \? bizarre even \? from another chairman at another company , perhaps but for mr schrader , it was simply business as usual in building psinet from its modest roots in upstate new york to an international internet powerhouse with a market value of 73 billion , he has never been afraid to be a bit ahead of himself or to risk alienating a potential partner in fact , psinet and winstar are in preliminary discussions about working together , according to executives close to those talks mr schrader , whose hobbies include target shooting , is an executive who often fires from the hip , so to speak , aiming verbal shots at allies and enemies alike and establishing a reputation as perhaps the most iconoclastic executive of his stature in the communications industry psinet , with fiber optic lines around the globe , some of the world s most advanced internet systems and a fastgrowing customer base , looms as a highly attractive acquisition candidate one whose shares are up nearly 300 percent since october , as investors have noted its potential takeover value it is the biggest of the internet access providers not already snatched up by telephone companies looking to expand into cyberspace but psinet has been valuable for years and mr schrader , who owns 745 percent of the company , has always refused to sell , sometimes leaving prospective buyers to walk away wondering if he is shrewd or headstrong or both i think the real reason psinet is still independent is bill schrader , said richard g ellenberger , chief executive of broadwing inc , the former cincinnati bell broadwing recently filed to reduce its stake in psinet to about 11 percent but would still be its largest shareholder he has built it from the ground up , and he s not through he believes he s one of the new age of executive leaders , and he s not ready to quit mr schrader , 48 , may not be ready to quit because he has already come so far a biologist by training , he was a cofounder in 1985 of one of the first internet operations , called nysernet , which initially linked academic computing centers in the cold reaches of upstate new york in 1989 , when forprofit activity was still ostensibly banned from the governmentfinanced internet , he founded what was then called performance systems international , moving it to northern virginia to be closer to the federal agencies then overseeing the internet psinet was not only one of the first providers of internet access service but one of the most innovative in 1995 , for instance , psinet was a pioneer in offering unlimited internet service at a fixed monthly fee to consumers across the nation the pricing was set in typical schrader fashion i remember when i asked him how they chose what to charge for the flat fee , mr ellenberger said and he said , 'well , it was 1995 so we chose 1995 , and 1995 sounded good to us' and i asked him , 'you did n't do any economic modeling \? ' and he said , 'nope' since then , psinet s tactical focus has changed the company got out of the consumer internet business in 1996 , selling its consumer unit to mindspring enterprises so it could focus on serving business customers and acting as a carrier s carrier for smaller internet service providers more recently , instead of merely providing raw internet links , psinet has begun to add more advanced and lucrative services by managing web servers and computer systems that deliver corporate software applications across networks but the company s ultimate goal has remained constant i would like to build a system , mr schrader said , that can deliver all the media to all the customers on earth harold s wills , psinet s president and chief operating officer and a former executive at ibm and xerox , first met mr schrader in the spring of 1996 i thought he was crazy , mr wills said , recalling his job interview bill said , 'we 're going to kill the phone companies , and we 're going to be bigger than att , and it will be a lot of fun' and i said , 'how much revenue have you got \? ' and he said , 'well , last year we had 35 million' and i said , 'well , how are you going to do what you want to do \? ' and he began to explain in ways that i had n't understood before the power of the internet

i 've swept the plate , said eileen heckart during a telephone conversation from her home in norwalk the most honored actress of the new york theater season was reeling off the names of the awards lavished on her performance in the waverly gallery , though in truth two of them pay homage to her life in the theater at no 7 , she stopped counting that one , to be bestowed at radio city music hall tonight , is the tony , commonly known as broadway s equivalent to the oscar but wait ms heckart s indelible performance was given off broadway , and the tony award eligibility rules amazingly go on disallowing that designation \( which is based on seating capacity , not location \) yet , inarguably , most of the brainiest and innovative plays and musicals in new york are produced in just those unacknowledged theaters while all visionary directors proclaim a theater of inclusion , the tonys go on signifying theater of exclusion broadway used to be the originator of american theater , said arthur miller , in a telephone conversation from his home in roxbury it s lost that , he said thriving serious theater on broadway is a contradiction in terms , mr miller added none of tonight s nominations for best play originated on broadway and two of them are not new mr miller is twice nominated for tonys tonight , in the best play and best revival categories yet the ride down mt morgan , which is being promoted as a new play , opened in london 10 years ago , and it was produced by the williamstown theater festival in massachusetts and by the public theater in downtown manhattan in revised versions mr miller said his rewrites for the broadway production were not inconsiderable soon , a third version of the play is to be published and last summer s williamstown production of mr miller s 1968 play , the price , went directly to broadway now nominated for best revival , it was playing on the theater festival s main stage while the waverly gallery was on the nikos stage next door the waverly gallery closed after 10 weeks the price , after 14 mr miller would correct that sentence it did n't close , he said it was closed he was referring to one losing week practically speaking , that amounts to an eviction notice , especially during a theater shortage the off broadway theater movement , with its groundbreaking productions and introductions of great new stars had not yet emerged when the tonys were first presented 54 years ago the awards have changed for the bigger , but not for the better now the centerpiece of a stardriven nationally televised program , the awards accentuate the business of show business for serious theatergoers , that is not accentuating the positive oddly , through such additional categories as excellence in theater \( ms heckart \) and a special tony \( sylvia herscher , a trustee on the board of goodspeed opera house in east haddam for 24 years \) , this year s tonys are indirectly paying tribute to exemplars of a vanished broadway theater , many with significant connections to connecticut add mr miller s two nominations in the oldest categories and it is impossible to ignore a reverence for sheer resilience in a youthobsessed dumbeddown culture where going to the broadway theater has taken on in mr miller s words an element of partygoing that involves a remote part of the brain octogenarians all , ms heckart , at 81 , is the youngest mr miller turns 85 in october and ms herscher said she s pushing 87 given rich memories of what she called once upon a time theater , ms herscher s responses are often preceded with the command , do n't get me started , when asked about the state of broadway , especially musicals i'm sad about what s happening in musical theater today , bemoaned ms herscher , who has been living in manhattan throughout her 51year career in music publishing , publicity , theater management and artists' representative i just schlepped up there , said ms herscher of her involvement with goodspeed opera in east haddam , which has won two special tonys over the years and goodspeed first produced 10 fully staged musical revivals of the 21 that have been performed in concert during seven years of the terrific encores series at city center in manhattan generally regarded as off broadway , encores is being awarded a special tony tonight musicals have become a corporate enterprise , ms herscher went on they have n't been able to define themselves there is no passion mr miller who wrote death of a salesman in the first roxbury house he bought in 1947 , and goes on writing in the converted farmhouse where he has been living since 1955 talked about the difference between regional theater and broadway audiences there is a communal feeling outside of new york , he said the audiences are less aggressive regional theater feeds the new york theater , mr miller agreed it used to be the other way around , he said on broadway , mr miller said , to be blunt , it s all about money it was always about money , more or less , but the balance is gone there used to be all those crazy people who risked everything to put on something they loved , plays that were not likely to make money now it s the regional theater that s keeping theater alive still wondering about the shows that sell , ms heckert agreed , it all comes down to money the connotation of broadway was that it must be the best now who can afford it \? said ms heckart , who lived in new canaan for 34 years before moving to norwalk six years ago and people do n't want to think , she continued , but in williamstown , the audiences were stunned , amazed in new york , people are no longer conditioned to going to the theater you never used to hear them talk during a performance now they talk but plays will somehow survive , the three illustrious theater veterans agree things will turn around again , ms heckart said greed is a phase it s cyclical , ms herscher said it 'll come back and i have a wonderful new musical to tell you about the working title is haunted that 'll do for a teaser and mr miller is working on a new play it s basically a comedy , maybe a tragicomedy there is always something to despair of , he said but there is a next step on the agenda of how to support the theater on more than sheer commercial values lost causes get formed again i just do n't expect it to happen in my lifetime
amid a host of financial problems and repeated citations for unsanitary conditions and inadequate care , pacific house , a nonprofit home for the mentally ill in brooklyn , is closing its doors after nine years its residents , highfunctioning individuals who live with a measure of independence , say the home s director has told them to leave by today , nearly two months before they are scheduled to move to new homes aramis suarez , 42 , one of about 30 residents who have yet to leave , has lived in pacific house , at 1140 pacific street in bedfordstuyvesant , for four years he said he had no place to go them doing this , it s torturing the residents , he said with its less than ideal conditions , pacific house may not seem like such a difficult place to leave in the recreation room , the pool and pingpong tables have no balls , paddles or cues on the floor lies a puddle of coffee so old its edges have dried into a ring of scum there are no cups for the water dispenser , but it is probably just as well cockroaches have been found floating in the water tank but lawyers for the residents say their clients are being intimidated and forced to move to more restrictive group homes that serve lowerfunctioning patients a handful of the 40 residents who have left have already found their way to the streets , said jeanette zelhof , a lawyer with mfy legal services inc , a nonprofit legal aid organization legally , they should n't be closing by tomorrow , said robert kenny , a state health department spokesman he said the home had not submitted a closure plan for approval in mid1999 , the state , citing concerns about patient safety , began the process of closing pacific house in march , according to court documents , james frederick , the center s director , told residents they had to leave within 90 days mfy objected , saying that it was not clear that family members and caseworkers would be consulted in the relocation process , and that the haste of the closing threatened residents' legal rights to treatment and shelter in a letter , the state department of health assured mfy that the wishes and needs of the residents would be met the health department ordered pacific house to find appropriate homes for residents and to surrender its operating certificate by aug 25 , mr kenny said after a meeting last week in which residents said they were told to be out by today , the legal aid group obtained a temporary restraining order to keep the house open until july 7 , but last night , residents said they were afraid of what the morning would bring ms zelhof said that many had been given garbage bags for packing their things and were told that the electricity and food service would be cut off today gwen jones , a supervisor at the center , confirmed that pacific house would close on july 7 , but referred all other questions to mr frederick he did not return a call to pacific house yesterday afternoon as health department officials and pacific house caseworkers scrambled to find beds for their clients , ms zelhof said that there would still not be enough time for a thorough evaluation of patients' needs these kinds of haphazard , perfunctory assessments of people with complicated disabilities result in the andrew goldsteins , she said , referring to the schizophrenic man convicted of pushing a woman off a subway platform to her death ms zelhof was in the pacific house lobby yesterday to ensure that none of her 18 clients were removed against their will visiting representatives from group homes tried to recruit the residents , she said there are only two or three other residence homes like pacific house , created for highfunctioning patients , in the new york city area , ms zelhof said mr kenny said that pacific house was supposed to submit a written plan to the health department before moving any residents from the 80bed home , but that it had not done so pacific house was founded by the rev clarence norman sr , the father of the brooklyn democratic chairman , to help alleviate the problem of homelessness among the mentally ill it opened in 1991 with the help of 46 million in state and city loans its revenues came in the form of residents' public assistance checks , said lisa r green , an mfy lawyer at capacity , the residence could take in more than 65 , 000 a month but there never seemed to be enough money to pay off loans or correct serious problems , which were first reported in the village voice on tuesday the center was repeatedly cited for those problems beginning in 1993 the voice also reported that two deaths that occurred at the residence were being investigated by the state s commission on quality of care for the mentally disabled photo pacific house , a home for the mentally ill , is being kept open by a court order until july 7 , but residents say they were told to leave by today \( nicole bengiveno the new york times \)

get more of a balance between opera , concerts , recitals and chamber music , ms mentzer said , in order to be at home more with my son the two will spend most of this summer at the aspen music festival , where she will teach and perform it has a totally different atmosphere from any other festival , said ms mentzer , who studied there in 1976 it s very real , without the usual fakey aspects of this business manuela hoelterhoff , in cinderella company , her bestselling , gossipy backstage chronicle of the usually fakey business of opera , painted an affectionate but less than charitable portrait of ms mentzer , suggesting that she was prone to depression i'm not a bubbly , outgoing person , and i think i often get misunderstood because i'm not , said ms mentzer , noting that she had not read the book i love my job , i love to make great music , but i'm not a great schmoozer , and that gives people the wrong impression a lot of times , i'm just saving energy i'm saving it for mothering i'm saving it for the stage a lot of people are 'on' all the time i'm not but i feel like a different person when i walk out on stage it s very therapeutic a selfdescribed singing actress , ms mentzer said that she worked instinctively and enjoyed getting lost in roles i like to be part of an ensemble , she added i like to blend i think that s how i do my best work but she does not get lost in the blend she holds her own even with a force of nature like bryn terfel , the recent figaro and the villain , lindorf , in hoffmann this week ms mentzer , who was born in philadelphia , moved with her family to santa fe during high school , and it was there that she developed an interest in opera , while working as an usher at the celebrated summer festival although she had planned a career in music therapy , after her successful apprenticeship at aspen \( where she was chosen to play nicklausse in hoffmann \) she enrolled in the juilliard school as a voice major she made her european debut in 1983 , as cherubino at the cologne opera , and has performed steadily ever since those who have worked with her are quick to praise her abilities , drive and sense of humor onstage she s fantastic , said the soprano renee fleming , who has sung with her on many occasions , as love object or sister i'm one of her biggest fans , because i adore her sound , the vibrato and shimmer of it , and her musicality she s a terrific actress , and she s really fun to work with as a new mother , ms fleming said , she went to ms mentzer for help and advice i had a 2monthold baby i had n't traveled with an infant before , and it was a little frightening i called susanne and asked , 'what do i bring to italy \? ' she was a wonderful mentor the conductor christoph eschenbach , who has often worked with ms mentzer in opera and concert , is also a fan she sings with so much poetry , so much beauty and depth of expression , he said she is such a sincere artist she always wants to see the profound side of music and has nothing of superficiality in her and she has such a beautiful voice they are not alone in those sentiments , to judge from the caliber of musicians who take part in annual jubilate concerts that ms mentzer helps organize in chicago to benefit bonaventure house , a residence for people with aids she asks colleagues to perform free and finds only generosity , she said if you just ask them , they 'll show up the 1999 concert raised nearly a million dollars , drawing on the talents of the bass samuel ramey , the rising tenor gregory turay , the soprano catherine malfitano , the guitarist sharon isbin and others ms isbin figured in one of ms mentzer s early steps toward musical diversity , in 1998 , when the two made an erato recording , wayfaring stranger ms mentzer has been featured in many recordings , mostly of complete operas , but this one was different it was the first time i 've been able to decide what i wanted to sing and stand by it , she said we just made music for five days it was wonderful photos susanne mentzer has a fondness for jeans and a gift for playing trouser roles , as now at the met \( stuart o shields \) \( pg 48 \) cecilia bartoli , left , as susanna and susanne mentzer as cherubino in le nozze di figaro at the met \( sara krulwich the new york times \) \( pg 48 \)

catonsville , md , oct 11 as elton holmes sprinted through public school by the wheat fields of maryland s eastern shore , collecting top honors in science and math , smart money would have bet that the most selective universities would come courting , eager to sign up a star minority student like mr holmes they did among others , johns hopkins university wanted him but so did freeman a hrabowski iii , president of the university of maryland at baltimore county , and dr hrabowski won with the country facing a chronic scarcity of africanamericans in math and science , dr hrabowski , a 50yearold black mathematician , has turned this once unremarkable and still predominantly white state university outpost into a magnet for blacks pursuing careers in those fields more blacks earn undergraduate degrees in biochemistry here than at any other university in the country , and nearly all the minority students in its elite scholarship program go on to medical or graduate school the university s diverse chess team has won panamerican tournaments three of the last four years if you see a group of black students walking together on a college campus , your first thought might be , 'oh , there goes the basketball team , ' said dr michael summers , an aids researcher here you think , 'there goes the chemistry honors club or the chess team' it s just a different attitude on campus dr hrabowski s magic lies partly in a scholarship program he created a dozen years ago , which not only finances , but also trains and encourages 50 students a year who show promise in math or science the meyerhoff program , named for the baltimore couple who first financed it , lures black high school students sought by the best colleges but also seeks out those with promise but who are less obviously headed for success by combining them , it creates a critical mass of minority high achievers who become role models and mentors for younger students there are institutions that stress the achievement of excellence , but there s very little nurturing or encouragement to help students achieve that level of excellence , said dr william massey , a research mathematician at bell labs who has worked with many meyerhoff interns and there are programs that have nurturing , but they do n't stress achievement of excellence this is one of the rare programs that stresses both sometimes described as the pied piper of smart students , dr hrabowski said he created the program to help counter statistics showing that more black men were in prisons than in universities other figures , if less grim , were hardly more encouraging a 1999 report by the college board found that only one in 10 students demonstrating proficiency in math and science are hispanic or black and by 1997 , three decades after a national study found that only 11 percent of doctorates in science , engineering and mathematics went to africanamericans , the number had reached only 2 percent to understand why , beatriz chu clewell , a researcher at the urban institute , studied 125 minority undergraduates majoring in math or science at three unidentified universities , as well as those who had the credentials to major in those fields but did not she found minorities discouraged by grueling course work they felt that by going into math or science , they were becoming below average , she said it scared them off many described their professors in the humanities as engaging , while math teachers typically faced the blackboard , working out equations several remembered professors telling them to look around at other students fifty percent of you wo n't make it to the end , they would say and they were usually right though the same was true for white students , who also dropped out of math and science , the smaller numbers of blacks in these classes to begin with meant few or none were left after attrition dr hrabowski aimed to reverse these trends by blending pieces of successful efforts at other schools though most college programs for minorities emphasized remediation , dr hrabowski focused on those that helped good students become better he s been able to take kids who could go to places like mit and convince them they could get a better education with a more constructive environment , said dr harold varmus , president of memorial sloankettering cancer center in new york he s taken these kids and made them enthusiastic about science , high achieving and acceptable for admission to all the best graduate schools in formulating the program , dr hrabowski realized popular culture had changed dramatically since he was a student in the 1950 s and 60 s then , expectations that advances in civil rights were opening doors made many blacks feel they had to prepare twice as well to compete with whites , dr hrabowski said the soviet launching of sputnik in 1957 also made a national priority of cultivating future scientists , mathematicians and engineers today , he said , society seems to prize everything but brain power to counter the current mood , he makes stars of smart kids the campus has no football team , but the chess team gets jackets , and comes home to victory rallies it s not enough to be passionate about science , experienced in science and good , dr hrabowski said , but one has to have the confidence to believe she or he can succeed dr hrabowski also told the meyerhoff students to look around at their peers but his punch line was different if they 're not here in four years , he said , we 're doing something wrong
to the editor while i am second to none in my admiration for louis armstrong and duke ellington , i am becoming increasingly weary of wynton marsalis and stanley crouch s politicization of the blues in their hands \( as with their fellow lincoln center advisor albert murray \) the blues has become something of an ideology , a club with which to beat all who do not share their aesthetic leanings last year , mr marsalis told us what a bluesdependent art ellington s was ellington at 100 reveling in life s majesty , jan 17 , 1999 , when in truth duke used the blues so effectively because he was not dependent on them , but rather came to them , in terms of class and background , as something of an outsider now stanley crouch comes to tell us that armstrong figured out how to articulate the sound of the blues through tin pan alley tunes without abandoning their harmonic underpinnings , and quotes mr marsalis as saying that not even art tatum , charlie parker , monk and coltrane did anything that sophisticated wherever he went , joy was sure to follow , march 12 once again , this is a case of fitting facts to ideology armstrong was truly a great blues player , but what he did most effectively was to expand the expressive possibilities of jazz in a way that made the blues only one element of many , in a manner that actually reduced their relative importance certainly armstrong continued to play with the kind of tonal and rhythmic nuances that reflected the powerful dominance of the africanamerican performance tradition , but these were not necessarily related strictly to the blues they reflected the larger picture of africanamerican performance styles and monk , coltrane and , indeed , charlie parker devised musical systems that were every bit as sophisticated as armstrong s allen lowe south portland , me photo louis armstrong in 1932 \( associated press \)
seoul , south korea , july 5 foreign business optimism over the thaw between north and south korea has waned considerably in the few weeks since their leaders met and a symbolic truckload of cocacola crossed into the north , one of orthodox communism s last redoubts the precedentsetting discussions in pyongyang , the northern capital , between president kim dae jung of south korea and his communist counterpart , kim jong il , generated a kind of euphoria , and talk was heard of an opening of north korea , a reclusive nation of 22 million but now , major american and european businesses are again expressing deep caution and the cocacola company , often seen as an icon of western capitalism that helped lead the way into communist countries like china and vietnam , is vague about what it envisions doing in north korea it is our intention to continue supplying our product to the north korean market , said john gustaveson , a spokesman for cocacola in south korea but at this point of time , we do n't know yet while it will continue to watch the situation in the north , coke said , it currently has no plans to build a bottling plant there cocacola would not comment on the identity of its customers in north korea , the people who were presumably able to taste that first batch of coke , and this raised suspicions as to whether the drinks had reached ordinary north koreans but cocacola acknowledged that it was paid for its products it was a business transaction and not just a goodwill gesture , mr gustaveson said regardless of recent overtures by seoul and washington , officials in pyongyang may still consider the eagerness of western companies to do business there as a threat as a result , some south korean experts said , north korea might limit the pace of change , remaining highly selective and uncompromising about the investments it accepts they perceive any hint of economic integration as a trojan horse , said cho sung ryoul , a researcher at the institute for national security policy in seoul last year , after washington partly lifted trade sanctions against the north , the american chamber of commerce in south korea sought to send a delegation of american business representatives to pyongyang a year later , despite the lifting of more sanctions by washington , the business group is still waiting for permission to visit we have plenty of companies that are interested , said jeffrey jones , the chamber s president but it all depends on the government there others said it would take more than tempting products or alluring business plans to get the pyongyang authorities to grant access to foreign businesses hungry for cash to rebuild its battered economy , north korean officials are still impressed most by hard currency up front they tend to believe that when you want to start a business , you come with a bag full of cash , said jeanjacques grauhar , head of the north korea business committee at the european union chamber of commerce in south korea another obstacle to investment in the north is that foreigners do not know whom to deal with groups from the north seeking deals with foreign investors include companies that are fronts for the communist party , the commerce ministry and the north korean army there s no single controlling entity , mr grauhar said it s so confusing for foreign companies that the business becomes more limited as a representative of a french trading company , mr grauhar lived in pyongyang for seven years , where he also served as a consultant for other foreign companies wanting to enter the north korean market he cautioned that even those companies that gain access to northern business representatives will face surprises some business practices common in north korea are likely to bedevil foreign executives for instance , the north koreans prefer to meet in hotels and not in their offices , making it difficult to gauge the size of the companies they say they represent the background and the role of these representatives may also be hard to ascertain it s very important to crosscheck everything , that you speak to the right person who has the decisionmaking powers that he says he has , mr grauhar said it takes time , and you have to meet them again and again yoon sang ryul , a deputy manager at the hyundai asan company , which oversees the north korean business interests of the hyundai group , south korea s largest conglomerate , said decisionmaking in the north is cumbersome and often difficult for outsiders to understand everything progresses from bottom to top by reaching a consensus at each level , he said , and outsiders are not allowed into the consensusforming group initially , it is important to build relationships rather than focusing on profitdriven models mr cho at the institute for national security policy said foreign businesses considering investments in north korea would do well to remember what south korea was like in the late 1960 s , when its relatively backward economy was being developed under the military dictatorship of gen park chung hee the north koreans seem to have studied park chung hee s economic plan very carefully , mr cho said the core of his leadership was introducing a marketbased economy while maintaining an authoritarian rule general park used his powers to ensure that concentrating investment in a handful of industries and companies most likely to encourage fast economic growth did not lead to social and political unrest and mr cho said that foreigners looking to do business in the north should expect to operate within the parameters established by a totalitarian government beyond those considerations , the north while it has a large , welltrained work force has none of the infrastructure that modern business relies on the south korean central bank estimates that it will cost more than 50 billion over the next decade to create the modern manufacturing base , telecommunications and other infrastructure needed to make foreign investment a success
considering how valuable real estate has become in this state , it s a wonder that bethlehem did n't have to put out a few more chairs for the crowd when it held a tax auction of a few lots , around a huge pond , no less , about a week ago but when the auction ended , only 16 people had turned out actually , this auction went a lot better than the last one in 1996 , none of the waterfront properties drew a single bid because no one showed up for the auction lakefront property along candlewood and woodridge lakes is one thing , but land along long meadow pond in a neighborhood called kasson grove is another formed in 1935 on what was once a cow pasture , kasson grove was intended as part of a waterfront summer community purchasing one lot , for about 100 , gave buyers pond rights the problem is that the pasture was divided into hundreds of 40by80foot lots , meant for summeronly cottages , not yearround residences single lots were too small on which to build real houses and way too small for septic systems and wells but some owners who bought several adjacent lots built small summer cottages that were later winterized and have become permanent homes today , with much more stringent requirements for building , there is not a single parcel in the whole grove that would be considered appropriate for a home james rokos , director of health for torrington area health district , said because of the nature of the soil there and the seasonal water table , a property owner would need about 15 of these small lots to build a home today on kasson grove property if someone wants one lot to pitch a tent , that s ok , mr rokos said at the auction on june 17 , two of the lots available were the tentsized ones a third one was larger and just across the pond from kasson grove the town had gotten stuck with the lots because the owners owed back taxes some owners inherited the land and had no use for it a few weeks ago , gregory leigland of lutz , fla , visited his two lots for the first time since he was a child and was shocked by what he found he said residents of the grove were using his lots as a dump my greatgrandmother bought two tiny lots in 1969 , mr leigland said my mother inherited it , and then i got it in 1992 i came up to look at it and it s a disgrace mr leigland s lot is valued at perhaps 2 , 000 and he owed about 800 in taxes on it it s not worth paying , to be stuck with it while someone else dumps garbage on it , he said i told the tax collector i was going to go look and then i 'd be back to pay , but now i 'd like to just sign it over to the town a total of eight lots were scheduled for saturday s auction , but one property owner contacted another who was losing four lots due to back taxes , struck a deal , and saved himself the risk of bidding at a public auction another property owner , contacted in colorado , had second thoughts , edie rupe , the tax collector , said , and at the last moment paid her taxes even though she has no plans for using the lot so that left three two near the pond were won for 1 , 300 by douglas england of waterbury , who was building a house adjacent to the lots , but just out of kasson grove by buying the two lots , he said , he becomes a member of the kasson grove association and is given access to the pond and the beach bidding lasted a few minutes , and only one other person competed against mr england when he went to explore kasson grove after the auction , he discovered that the road stopped just about where his two lots began and they were a tangle of dense forest leading up to his backyard i wanted the border to my yard , he said i wanted to know exactly where my land ends i 'll make a path down to spring street , in kasson grove , bring my canoe down here and have it available , and we can walk to the lake tiny houses , some in disrepair , led the way up to mr england s backyard dog pens , laundry lines and some wrecked cars dotted the area these are not welltodo places , he noted people have just turned cottages into houses , and some of them are pretty tough , with little space heaters for the winter still , it seems better for people to raise their kids here than in a hot apartment in the city the town said it is going to pursue blight ordinances to order other property owners to clean up their land or houses with the sale of delinquent tax properties and enforced clean up , ms rupe said , kasson grove could become a more pleasant place ms rupe said her position is a difficult one auctions are held to clean up the tax record , but no one showed up for the last one even when the town sells property , they only get back taxes any additional money goes to the state adjacent property owners did buy parcels at the first auction the original intention was to make it a recreational area with no thought for zoning , ms rupe said other lakeside communities around the state are faced with similar problems , such as zoning and wetlands , and public health laws have grown more stringent although bethlehem requires only 1 1 2 acres and 200 hundred feet of road frontage for a home , no lots in kasson grove meet this requirement , not to mention torrington area health district specifications unless there is a viable structure on the land , many people who inherit lots do n't know quite what to do with them ms rupe said she had spent a lot of time on the internet , looking up people whose names were on the tax rolls and who had stopped paying sometimes , she added , she finds them other times there is n't even a trace we 've had to turn a lot of people down for building , mr rokos said some places are grandfathered in and we give them an idea of the limitations and how to conserve water to save their septic systems a lot are n't suitable year round , especially not for families we have two concerns , the public health of the community and the quality of the lake if the lake deteriorates , they 've lost any property value they had the third lot auctioned this month was on the opposite side of the pond from kasson grove , near bethlehem s town beach there was considerably more competition for this piece of waterfront property , which was finally bought for 18 , 000 by an adjacentproperty owner other bidders wanted the parcel for a boat dock , driving the price up considerably from its assessed value of 2 , 970 delinquent taxes totaled 3 , 56063 ms rupe was never able to find the original property owner there s another three to four properties coming up , she said after three years with no payment on taxes , we 're really going to start going after them once the property has been sold at auction , the original owners still have six months to pay the taxes and have the property returned to them the ones we end up selling tend to belong to elderly people who are no longer interested in the property , or they inherited it and did n't want it in the first place , and now want to unload it , ms rupe said the best solution for kasson grove , said mr rokos of the torrington area health district , was for individual owners to acquire every available adjacent property and give themselves more room to meet the requirements for septic and wells that would gradually improve the entire neighborhood it definitely benefits the lake and reduces the chance of groundwater contamination , he said those two things ultimately improve property values photos douglas england at kasson grove , where he bought two lots at an auction this month he said he got the land to obtain rights to use long

optimists expected george w bush to take three objectives into account in choosing his secretary of the treasury first , most people expected him to choose someone with extensive experience of financial markets there is every reason to believe that the series of financial upheavals that convulsed the world in the 1990 s will continue robert rubin and lawrence summers did a yeoman job of containing those crises until a few days ago most people expected mr bush to choose someone who looked like a republican bob rubin , someone like painewebber s donald marron second , some thought that mr bush might choose a treasury secretary who could be a symbol of bipartisanship one name floated was william mcdonough , the president of the federal reserve bank of new york finally , given the troubling impression during the florida fight that mr bush was abdicating responsibility to dick cheney , and more broadly to his father s men , most people thought that treasury would offer a good opportunity to show that the new administration would not be filled with mr cheney s cronies paul o'neill , the former office of management and budget official who became alcoa s chairman , was n't exactly what the optimists had in mind indeed , mr bush himself seemed oddly uneasy during the press conference at which he announced the selection i'm not big on interpreting facial expressions but anyone who watched mr bush as mr o'neill spoke can tell you that he was , well , shiftyeyed his gaze darting frantically from side to side unless this is a characteristic nervous tic that mr bush successfully concealed throughout the campaign , it was an indication that something was wrong what s wrong with mr o'neill \? he built his business reputation by reversing efforts to transform alcoa into something more than an aluminum company , instead refocusing on the core business and engaging in ruthless costcutting this is all very well but overseeing world financial markets is nothing at all like running a large , very oldeconomy , commandandcontrol corporation \( or , for that matter , working the details of the federal budget \) mr rubin excelled at the deft strategic intervention persuading investors , when the situation was on a knife edge , not to pull their money out and turn a temporary loss of confidence into a selffulfilling prophecy of collapse perhaps mr o'neill will reveal a comparable talent , but nothing in his career to date suggests that this is his sort of thing and by the way his long friendship with alan greenspan does not constitute a qualification for all his qualities , mr greenspan is not god the treasury department does n't need a greenspan acolyte to second the great man s views it needs a secretary who , like mr rubin , has enough independent knowledge and gravitas to supplement mr greenspan s judgment , and if necessary challenge it despite mr o'neill s long association with conservative causes , his appointment does not please the hard right but given mr bush s decision to cave in to the hard right on the crucial matter of the justice department , simply appointing a treasury secretary who is n't rabid is n't much of a bipartisan gesture and last but not negligibly , mr o'neill is surprise ! an old colleague of mr cheney s and one suspects they are kindred spirits like mr cheney before his own reentry into politics , mr o'neill belongs to the class of businessmen the japanese call amakudari , descended from heaven former government officials who later in life enter the business world at the top , not the bottom none of this says that mr o'neill will necessarily fail but it does raise questions about what is going on in the bush transition why did the candidate who was supposed to represent the aspirations of the investor class reject all the candidates proposed from the investment community \? here s a guess despite all the talk of being forward looking , mr bush s people are fundamentally uncomfortable with the modern world as my colleague tom friedman has pointed out , they seem to hanker for the lost certainties of coldwar diplomacy perhaps they also hanker for the lost certainties of the old economy , where big companies were comfortably settled in stable oligopolies , and did n't have to worry about the shifting tides of financial markets in short , they want to pretend the world is still the way it was when some other guy was president ca n't remember his name , began with a b
san francisco until last week , it seemed likely that the san francisco examiner would be an orphan of the information age the hearst corporation no longer had any use for the examiner , its first property and onetime flagship , once the company bought the paper s thriving rival , the san francisco chronicle , for 660 million last year dwindling circulation , red ink and potential antitrust concerns more or less forced hearst to sell , and the examiner had been on the block since last summer in theory , there should have been a host of bidders salivating over such a wellknown if struggling title serving a city full of the wealthy , welleducated readers whom advertisers covet for one thing , the city is awash in venture capital , no small amount of it pouring into newmedia ventures meant to reach that very audience and major newspaper chains like knight ridder own papers in suburbs and nearby cities that might fit well with the examiner , whose readership is concentrated in san francisco proper yet the examiner was shunned like a silver dollar in the middle of market street traffic several of the big newspaper companies looked at its books , but none were among the final bidders to get the examiner off its hands , hearst agreed to pay expenses as much as 16 million this year and 25 million in 2001 and 2002 , according to court filings to ted fang , whose family publishes 12 free local newspapers the examiner s neardeath experience illuminates the kinds of risks that newspaper companies are willing and unwilling to take today knight ridder , tribune , the new york times , belo and mcclatchy have recently tolerated losses of 8 million to 20 million a year on internet ventures with unproven business models , according to company filings and presentations to analysts these companies have all bought newspapers in metropolitan markets in the last six years , but all passed on the examiner jim moroney , president of belo interactive , and ross jones , chief financial officer of knight ridder , say that building web sites is research and development people are increasingly going to be going to the internet for a local content experience , mr moroney said we need to be there for mr jones , the examiner , cut off from its joint operating agreement with the chronicle , is not a complete newspaper it s something between a newspaper and a startup , mr jones said does his willingness to go where giants feared to tread make mr fang a visionary , or a fool \? in some measure , he is whistling past the graveyard full of mastheads , as the newspaper analyst john morton put it local business interests bought , but could not sustain , the cleveland press \( it closed its doors in 1982 \) and the st louis globedemocrat \( it folded in 1985 \) judging by circulation figures , the odds this time are just as steep the examiner sells an average of 107 , 100 copies daily , less than onequarter of the chronicle s 457 , 000 i am aware of the pressure of history on this project , mr fang said last week that made the examiner so unappealing to the industry titans with the experience and resources to better the odds \? mr morton offers the old newspaper math as an answer the two biggest costs of producing a daily are labor and newsprint publishing the examiner at roughly its current size , 110 , 000 copies of 70 broadsheet pages , six days a week , would consume some 20 million in paper annually at today s newsprint prices even at half the size , it would take 12 million of paper , mr morton estimated as for labor , by the industry rule of thumb of one journalist for each 1 , 000 copies sold , the paper s newsroom needs 100 people , half the size of the current staff to get and keep them , a new owner must pay enough to overcome the region s high cost of living and compete with new media fishing in the same talent pool , like saloncom , quokka sports , the industry standard or marketwatchcom with salary and benefits , figure 75 , 000 to 100 , 000 a head , or 75 million to 10 million annually , mr morton said there are computers to buy , presses to run , trucks to drive in those areas , a buyer s existing resources can help hold down costs still , several million dollars a year would be needed , mr morton estimated add it up and the cost of getting out the paper starts at 25 million a year the maximum size of the hearst subsidy since 1965 , the chronicle and the examiner have combined their circulation and advertising departments in a joint operating agreement and split the income , which , after they paid their newsrooms , could be taken as profit it is unclear how the examiner can independently match that income , estimated at 50 million advertising brings in 75 to 80 percent of revenue at most newspapers but highmargin classified ad volume has come under pressure in recent years from internet competitors like monstercom and how many display advertisers will want to sell their wares through the smaller of two generalinterest metropolitan dailies \? neither is there much room to increase circulation revenue the san francisco bay area , with 54 million people , is home to 19 daily newspapers , many of which dominate their chosen slices of the region given these cloudy prospects , some critics say hearst s deal with mr fang is a sham , meant to stave off antitrust action by the justice department while limiting hearst s costs and shielding the chronicle from serious competition others say the old math may not apply i am one of those weirdos who happen to believe that if the examiner is spun off it has a chance , said tim redmond , executive editor of the bay guardian , an alternative newspaper that has railed editorially for three decades against the joint operating agreement i 'd make it a tabloid , focus tightly on the city , create flashy front pages , he said pan asia venture capital , the fang family company , has a history of buying failing local newspapers and reviving them by cutting costs and emphasizing community news it took the local touch my family brought to these newspapers to make them work , mr fang said dailies are not weeklies , of course still , the examiner need not go toe to toe with the chronicle to survive as a daily , judging by the experience of the the palo alto daily news , which lives profitably in the shadow of the san jose mercury news by giving away 26 , 500 copies and keeping its operations lean just 30 employees in all or mr fang could find a deeppockets patron that would subsidize a newspaper that reflects its views , as the unification church does with the washington times mr fang s father , john , came to san francisco from taiwan to be editor of the young china daily , backed by chiang kaishek s nationalist party he later struck out on his own the family s alternative weeklies , known for fiercely partisan coverage , have been credited with tipping tight city elections toward candidates they favored but mr fang rejects the mouthpiece model for the examiner i do n't want to be funded by someone with an agenda , he said and he said he had no plans to convert to free distribution we 're going to think outside of the box , but we intend to run the examiner as a paid , subscriberbased morning newspaper , he said , seizing a chance that none of the giant chains was willing to take photos ted fang , above , whose family publishes free community newspapers , has agreed to take over the san francisco examiner , once the pride of hearst s empire so the line of newspaper boxes on market street will not shrink by one \( agence francepresse \) \( peter dasilva for the new york times \) chart hemmed in analysts say the san francisco examiner was unattractive to buyers in part because it is surrounded by strong regional and suburban papers that leave it little room to grow here are some leading bay area papers and their penetration of their market areas chart shows leading bay area papers and their market areas \( sources listed papers audit bureau of circulations \)

washington , july 6 amtrak said today that it would offer every dissatisfied customer a free repeat trip , even if the problem was not its fault the program is part of a campaign to build ridership and revenue by reducing the number of disgruntled passengers before congress ends operating subsidies in 2003 this grabs people s attention in the marketplace , said george warrington , president of amtrak , who added that none of amtrak s competitors , including the airlines , had offered a similar program the new program is retroactive to july 4 amtrak s reputation among potential passengers has historically been poor , mr warrington acknowledged , because of trains that are late or in poor condition he said the program was intended to demonstrate amtrak s ability , desire and fixation about putting guests at the center of everything we do the company , formally the national railroad passenger corporation , also revealed a new logo to replace the pointless arrow , as it is known , that has served for the last 29 years the company plans to redesign waiting rooms , ticket booths , platform displays and printed material to match to exercise the new guarantee , amtrak is asking its customers to call their complaints to the attention of any employee if the employee cannot solve the problem , amtrak will issue coupons for repeat travel the company anticipates , for example , issuing coupons to people for a problem with a seat or a sleeping compartment or to entire train loads of passengers if a train is extremely late amtrak promises to provide the freeride coupon even if the problem is beyond its control , like an ice storm or derailment of another train on the route regardless of fault , in the end , it s amtrak that s responsible , mr warrington told reporters today amtrak estimates that for every 100 people who try the railroad for the first time , 15 percent never ride again if amtrak can reduce that rate by one percentage point , its revenue would rise by 13 million a year the railroad has also trained workers to help passengers when a train is late by calling ahead to notify relatives who were planning to pick up passengers at the station , for example , or by rescheduling travel connections and hotel accommodations company officials said they were taking cues from what travelers expect from airlines in similar circumstances for the last three years amtrak has been offering a similar satisfaction guarantee on a single train , the coast starlight , which runs daily in each direction between seattle and los angeles , and has issued a free trip at a rate of one for every 107 , 000 passengers , mr warrington said but the railroad expects a much higher rate of complaints and refunds on other trains it has told its 25 , 000 employees that if the rate of free tickets is held below one in 1 , 000 trips in any month , each of them will get a bonus for that month equal to the average price of an amtrak ticket , which is now 50 the railroad said that ridership was up 7 percent in the last four months compared with the previous year and that in june , for the first time , it had revenue of 100 million
cape town paul bell knows that where he is today 19 years old , starting at shortstop for south africa in the olympics and playing professional baseball in montana , nearly 10 , 000 miles from home has as much to do with timing as talent had bell been born two or three decades earlier , his dream would have been unthinkable for a south african , let alone for someone who , like bell , is not white baseball has never approached the popularity here of rugby , cricket or soccer that it is played here at all comes as a surprise to many south africans but like every sport and every element of life in south africa , baseball s evolution was shaped by race , from who was permitted to play on amateur teams to the international isolation that kept talented south africans from playing abroad now , several years into the new south africa , the oncesegregated sport is adapting to new realities and seizing new chances for the first time , south african baseball is attracting serious attention from major league scouts in search of prospects like bell and his national squad teammate wesley botha , an 18yearold white pitcher from johannesburg , who signed a minor league contract with the atlanta braves this year around the country , thousands of south african children who had never picked up a baseball bat or glove have begun playing the sport as part of an initiative by major league baseball that has brought baseball into hundreds of schools over the last three years in september , botha , bell and the rest of the national baseball team will compete in the sydney olympics after becoming the first south african baseball squad to qualify for the summer games bell is already trying to prove that he belongs in professional ball flown over by the yankees in february for a tryout , bell , who is colored , as mixedrace people are known here , did not catch on with the shortstopstocked yankees but he auditioned with several other teams , including the milwaukee brewers , who signed him to a minor league contract bell participated in the brewers' extended spring training in phoenix , and then he was sent to helena , mont , where the brewers' rookie league team began play two weeks ago he knows that if helena is to be only a first stop in his american baseball career , he will have to take his game higher than he ever did back home it s much more a part of the culture here , bell said by telephone no matter how good you are , you have to work at it , and that s what i'm striving to do for his father , michael , once a promising player himself , for whom the end of white minority rule and its repressive segregation came too late , the joy of his son s success is almost indescribable it greatly pleases me , he said , chuckling at his own understatement , during an interview in the study of his home here in cape town , surrounded by team photographs , game balls and other mementos of his days playing for the varsity old boys club i do n't know what words to use a game s quiet beginnings bell and botha are neither the first nor the only south africans to traverse the atlantic looking to make a name on the baseball diamond the slugger nick dempsey spent a couple of seasons in the dodgers organization before returning to south africa two years ago , and pitcher tim harrell is in his second year with the dodgers , playing this season for the club s class a team in vero beach , fla but bell and botha are arguably the most promising prospects so far , and their emergence could not have come at a better time major league baseball is a decade into an effort to make the sport truly international , and a few years ago , the league trained its sights on south africa , where sports were emerging from the enforced isolation of the apartheid era south africa could claim a long , if limited , tradition of playing baseball , dating to 1898 when a group of american gold miners started a team near johannesburg more than a century later , the game is still not widely played here , but where it is , the leagues are well organized and the players enthusiastic we want the game to be everywhere , paul archey , major league baseball s vice president for international business operations , said in a telephone interview africa being one part of the world where it s not widely played , south africa was a natural place for us to go to develop the game nearly 100 amateur clubs are active in the country , some fielding two or three teams , others six or seven the clubs , which are strongest in and around cape town , include about 30 , 000 players the modest total and the predominance of whites among the sport s oldest and best players underscore how limited baseball s reach has been on the club teams , especially

the republican national committee has canceled plans to use a television commercial showing vice president al gore saying in a 1994 interview with nbc that neither he nor president clinton had lied in their political careers the commercial was pulled , republican officials said , because it did not make clear the date of the interview , nor did it explain that mr gore was responding to questions about the united states senate campaign of oliver l north in virginia there was also fear , they said , that swing voters would see the commercial as an unfair effort to saddle mr gore with responsibility for mr clinton s deceptive remarks about his affair with a white house intern if there was confusion about when the interview was made , that would be a reason not to run the ad , a spokesman for the republican national committee , clifford may , said yesterday we want to make things clearer for viewers and voters the republican national committee declined to release a tape or transcript of the advertisement or to say how many copies had been sent to television stations but other republicans said the commercial , produced by national media , showed a television set on a kitchen table the television is on , and the screen shows an excerpt from the 1994 interview by lisa meyers , who was asking mr gore about his description of mr north as a pathological liar can you say that neither you nor president clinton has told a lie in your political career \? she asked uh , none spring to mind , i 'll tell you that , mr gore replied and president clinton has not uttered a single untruth in the last two years \? she continued not that i have heard absolutely not , mr gore answered at mr gore s campaign headquarters in nashville yesterday , some advisers professed disappointment that the advertisement was not shown as scheduled they said they were certain that the advertisement would have backfired on the bush campaign , angering voters because it did not make clear the time or context of the interview this is just the latest indication of disarray in the bush campaign , said mr gore s communications director , mark fabiani 'yesterday bush failed to coherently defend his tax plan today bush is mired in an indefensible ad debacle mr may said there had never been a decision to use the commercial , adding , if the democrats want to make a big thing about an ad that did n't run , they can do so he and other republicans also emphasized that mr gore s character and integrity were likely to be the subject of future advertisements paid for by the republican national committee the issue of al gore s credibility remains to be discussed in this campaign , mr may said but clearly we do n't want to have an ad out that would confuse people in any way one adviser to the bush campaign said yesterday that senior officials at the republican national committee first approached the bush campaign on wednesday with concerns about the advertisement we believe al gore s credibility is an issue , but to raise that issue , it has to be done in a credible way , the adviser said and this particular ad , with the date , might have been taken out of context asked if there was concern that the ad could undercut mr bush s pledge to raise the tenor of campaigning , the adviser replied we think the tenor of the campaign is important , but it s also important to set the record straight they 've run 30 million worth of ads , the bulk of them being attack ads on governor bush s leadership in texas
edward craven walker , royal air force squadron leader , champion of what the british call the naturist way of life and designer of the lava lamp , a quintessential accessory of the 1960 s and 1970 s , died on aug 15 at his home in ringwood , england he was 82 mr walker was a man of many grooves who made his first fortune on the nudist movie traveling light \( 1960 \) , filmed off corsica and featuring a nude woman performing underwater ballet to rimskykorsakov s song of india \( another nudist film , eves on skis in 1958 , was less of a hit \) profits from his films went toward promoting naturism and founding the bournemouth and district outdoor club , a nudist club in dorset , england wider acclaim followed with his serendipitous transformation of an unusual egg timer that he saw at a pub into an icon of the 1970 s the mesmerizing multicolored ooze , sloshing up and down in slow motion inside a hurricane lamp with a spaceage glow , perfectly embodied the spirit of the psychedelic age by the mid70 s the astro lamp , as mr walker named it , was selling around the world at the rate of seven million a year murray moss , an entrepreneur and design critic in new york , said of the musthave for dormitory students it was devoid of function but rich in emotional fulfillment it could momentarily free your mind like a warm bath the lamp , introduced in 1963 , lost its cachet in the late 70 s as the culture moved on to blackmatte minimalism , but it has recently made a comeback mr walker was born on july 4 , 1918 , in singapore , where his father was a shipping agent at the age of 3 he was sent to england , where he attended charterhouse , a boarding school in the 1930 s he went to work for britishamerican tobacco during world war ii he served in the royal air force , flying photographic reconnaissance missions according to recent interviews in the british press , he maintained the trim fighting figure and brisk demeanor of an raf officer throughout his life after the war , while living in a trailer behind a pub , he established a successful travel agency and homeexchange program in london it was called en famille , and mr walker hoped it would foster better relations between people from different lands his lifelong interest in nudism was inspired by a trip to the ile du levant off the southern coast of france , where , under the pseudonym michael keatering , he made one of his three films promoting the cause eventually he founded the nudist club at bournemouth and helped to establish other nudist colonies throughout england mr walker , who was married four times and had four children , was never joined by family members in his naturist enthusiasms he is survived by his fourth wife , sue craven walker of ringwood two daughters , gail kincaid of wales and debora storch of boston and two sons , antony , of brussels , and christopher , of ringwood it was a casual visit to the queen s head pub in the new forest , southwest of london , that sent mr walker in a new direction on the bar he noticed a glass cocktail shaker filled with oil globules when heated , they rose through a column of water in just the time it took to hardboil an egg he bought the patent from the inventor s widow over the next 10 years , mr walker worked in his backyard , making improvements on the lamp his recipe for a mix of oil , wax and water that does not emulsify in shipping is still closely held by mathmos , the company that now makes the lamp in england mr walker s astro lamp quickly caught on and was sold through leading british stores like selfridge s , fortnum mason and habitat \( a buyer from harrods said it was disgusting and refused to carry it \) mr walker s slogan at the time was , if you buy my lamp , you wo n't need drugs , and the lamp soon became a fixture on the psychedelic scene it was featured on styleminded television shows like the avengers and the prisoner mr walker himself consulted on a james bond film that showed gigantic lava lamps as the four posters of a bed as the fad passed , mr walker continued making other light fixtures , none as popular as his astro lamp \( the lava brand name was coined in the united states and is now a trademark of haggerty enterprises of chicago \) he also continued to operate the bournemouth club , causing a stir in the late 1970 s when he tried to bar overweight customers he called them fat fogies from coming to his camp , a place , in his mind , of health and beauty in 1989 , mr walker was approached by a young entrepreneur who wanted to revive interest in his lamp , which never went out of production it was reintroduced in england and is selling briskly again in a 1997 interview with the daily telegraph , mr walker listed two reasons for his lamp s enduring appeal it s like the cycle of life it grows , breaks up , falls down and then starts all over again and besides , the shapes are sexy photos the lava lamp was inspired by an egg timer in a british pub \( mathmos \) edward

auckland , new zealand , sunday , feb 27 after an america s cup week in which the lasting images will be those of an italian crewman laid low by a blow to the head , and the prada challenge s silver boat luna rossa in relentless and fruitless pursuit of team new zealand s powerful nzl 60 , perhaps only one more symbolic picture is necessary that would be the sight of a broom lashed to the masthead of the kiwi yacht , for with three races down in the fiveofnine finals a trio of victories for the crew of nzl 60 , who have been dominant in every aspect of the game the italians are in serious danger of being swept the prada crew was granted a temporary stay of execution today when racing was canceled , for the third time since the cup match began , because of a lack of breeze on the hauraki gulf but races are still scheduled for tuesday and thursday of this week , and if they go off as scheduled , and the italians cannot reverse their fortunes , they will not last to see the weekend when the finals started last sunday , after prada had earned the right to tangle with the kiwis after a fourmonthlong challenger s regatta in which they posted a 318 record , including a dramatic triumph over paul cayard s america one in the series final a sweep by either team seemed impossible now , unless prada can demonstrate the speed and skills that brought them face to face with the new zealanders , it appears unavoidable tactically , the kiwis have been superb , winning all three starts thus far and taking command of the day s events at the outset of each contest in all yacht racing , but especially in boattoboat match racing , controlling the start is critical it is something the new zealanders have spent countless hours on in the leadup to the cup , and it shows we 've put a lot of effort into prestarts because we do think they 're important , said russell coutts , the team new zealand helmsman and skipper before the cup finals , much was made of the lack of a kiwi defense leadup with outside competition , and how it might prove detrimental such talk , clearly , was unfounded in fact , the kiwi sailor tom dodson said , the new zealander s second boat , with the backup helmsman dean barker in control , has given coutts a more difficult time in practice than anything presented by the italians the kiwis have parlayed their early leads into insurmountable advantages by showing an uncanny ability to sniff out the first wind shift on the inaugural leg , and pulling away from there in the first three races , they have led around every mark on every leg of every race the tactician brad butterworth , who was the brains aboard the winning kiwi boat in san diego in 1995 and has resumed his role with this edition of team new zealand , is now 80 in cup finals in saturday s race 3 , as usual , butterworth was nonchalant about the move that put nzl 60 ahead for good , his call to head to the left of the course at the outset of leg 3 we were 19 seconds ahead but the left was quite favored , he said as soon as the boats tacked , the breeze came in from the left and the lead turned into 30 seconds it would 've been really difficult to pass if you were behind and that s the way we read it with good starts and sound tactics , the kiwis would already be hugely favored to keep prada without a victory but combine those with a fast , maneuverable boat , and the deal is nearly sealed they 've tried a lot of different things , and a lot of them are on the boat , america one s paul cayard said about the new zealanders' yacht it s a bit longer than prada and well suited to match racing it s fast upwind and quick to tack they 've given coutts a good tool there s innovation all over it that none of us picked up on , the nippon challenge skipper peter gilmour added , referring to the kiwis' socalled millennium rig , longer waterline and knuckle bow , among other subtle workings it s amazing the consensus now is that the kiwis are the total package , and that the 30th running of the america s cup has joined the realm of foregone conclusions if that is so , the greater question is not whether the italians are on the verge of being swept to sea , but how long it will take the collective challengers to raise a campaign that might truly test the defender s allaround prowess

it might take weeks to figure out how the insectkilling trait in genetically altered starlink corn migrated into a variety of corn that was not supposed to be genetically modified , according to the garst seed company , the producer of the corn garst , which announced on tuesday that it had encountered the biological mystery while testing samples of corn seed marketed as early as 1998 , said it might also take weeks to sort out how widespread the problem was and whether any of the corn had made it into the food chain garst s announcement was just the latest twist in a biotechnology controversy that began in september with the discovery that small amounts of corn from starlink crops , which were supposed to be sold only for animal feed or industrial use , had shown up in taco shells and other food products starlink corn , which was invented by aventis cropscience , the agricultural division of the aventis corporation , contains a gene that produces a protein called cry9c , which is toxic to corn borers and related insects starlink has no known health effects on humans , and similar toxins are widely used in agriculture but the environmental protection agency decided in 1997 that aventis s technology should be kept out of human food because laboratory tests indicated that the protein might cause food allergies biotechnology critics jumped on the unauthorized spread this year of starlink into the food chain as proof of how hard genetically engineered traits are to segregate once they are in the agricultural marketplace many critics argue that much of the technology should be banned until stricter controls and better assessments of any potential longrange effects are in place garst s announcement this week opened up a new front in the battle by suggesting that breakdowns in segregation can come even before the seed reaches the farmer this blows a lot of assumptions out of the water , said margaret mellon , senior scientist with the union of concerned scientists in washington how do you regulate risks that manifest themselves even before the product is out there \? the new controversy involves a strain of corn called 8481 that garst bred for growing conditions in the heart of the midwest one version of the corn sold in 1998 had the starlink trait but the other , known as 8481it , did not or so garst thought after a few farmers complained that tests showed their supposedly unmodified 8481 carried the starlink gene , garst began investigating and concluded that small amounts of starlink had apparently made their way into 8481it seed grown in 1997 for the 1998 market garst said it did not know whether the transfer came during pollination as the seed was being grown or through mixing of seeds after harvest garst said there was no sign of a similar problem in 8481it it raised in 1999 or 2000 but that some of the 1998 supply had been stored and sold in those years a bit of the 1998 supply might be on the market this year , as well , said jeffrey w lacina , a spokesman for garst , which is based in slater , iowa but garst is carefully screening all seed it is selling for the 2001 planting season to make sure that none of it contains the starlink gene , mr lacina said on wednesday indeed , garst said its push to make sure that this year s products are pure and to contact anyone who bought 8481 in the past is keeping it from tracking down what happened in 1997 as rapidly as it would like the agriculture department responded swiftly to garst s announcement by calling for a meeting on monday of industry representatives , researchers , policy experts and economists to discuss garst s findings and the appropriate response but garst s timeline for gathering crucial data on the cause and scope of the problem suggests it may be hard to reach any conclusions the new controversy is also certain to be felt on tuesday in washington when the environmental protection agency holds a meeting on aventis s petition for an agency ruling that starlink corn can be accepted in food for the next four years one of the arguments is that so much of the starlink corn has been accounted for and directed to permitted uses since the controversy erupted that whatever is left will not be enough to present a foodallergy threat the entire 2000 starlink crop amounted to less than onehalf of 1 percent of the nation s corn harvest aventis has withdrawn its registration for starlink , and no new starlink crops are to be planted in 2001 a ruling allowing whatever starlink is in the food chain to simply pass through might save millions of dollars in testing and food recalls but critics say the 8481 developments this week raise new questions about how far beyond the starlink crops themselves the potential risks run
one time i had to kill this guy it was in a novel , but that did n't make it easy my books are supposed to be funny , so even death should be carried out with a twist of wit the pressure is wicked the bad guy in question , pedro by name , was a sadistic security guard at a lowbudget amusement park in the florida keys pedro was so addicted to anabolic steroids that he hooked himself to a rolling intravenous rig , which he dragged behind him on his rounds twothirds of the way through the novel , which was called native tongue , i decided it was time to get rid of pedro he was growing nastier by the page and , worse , beginning to distract from the heroics of my protagonist so pedro had to go but how to do the deed \? shooting him would be simple enough overdosing him , tidy and quick but i feared that readers would n't be satisfied heck , i would n't be satisfied that s how detestable pedro was his demise had to be something special in the end i did what satirists throughout the ages have done i poached from current events and embellished to suit my plot at the time i was doing the book , a peculiar controversy was brewing about captive bottlenose dolphins in florida , where i live local theme parks had begun charging tourists 50 or more to frolic in the tanks with the sleek , acrobatic sea mammals some of the dolphins , it turned out , had their own ideas of fun they greeted the splashy human intruders with what marine biologists discreetly termed highrisk activity often that activity was aggressively sexual , leaving the tourists with a truly unforgettable vacation experience i had written of this phenomenon in my day job as a columnist for the miami herald like so many true florida stories , this one had been worth clipping for future reference it proved bad news for pedro , my fictional villain as luck would have it , the sleazy amusement park in my novel featured a rogue , untrainable cousin of flipper how could i resist \? a dark night , a frantic struggle on the catwalk , the dopeaddled thug tumbles into the tank and is promptly romanced to death by dickie the dolphin so that s how i bumped off the evil security guard readers seemed to agree that justice was well served , though many of them thought i made up the bit about the randy cetacean \( i did n't for proof , see quantitative behavioral study of bottlenose dolphins in swimwiththedolphins programs in the united states , published in the october 1995 issue of marine mammal science \) every writer scrounges for inspiration in different places , and there s no shame in raiding the headlines it s necessary , in fact , when attempting contemporary satire sharpedged humor relies on topical reference points unfortunately for novelists , real life is getting way too funny and farfetched it s especially true in miami , where the daily news seems to be scripted by david lynch fact is routinely more fantastic than fiction consider the fellow who was found with an adult alligator in his bed , and numerous toothsized wounds on his torso over the punctured man s protests , game wardens whisked the befuddled reptile to safety naturally a lawsuit and protracted custody battle followed after two years an appellate court finally decided in favor of the gator and against his smitten captor although i 've saved the newspaper clipping \( court gators in bed is bad idea \) , i doubt i 'll ever use the story in a novel it cannot be improved upon these days writers of satire must be exceptionally choosy about their material , and their targets even then , true life is inclined to trump you once i wrote a book called strip tease , in which a united states congressman becomes droolingly infatuated with an exotic dancer the premise had been inspired partly by my own congressman , j herbert burke , who was arrested in 1978 for behaving badly at a topless club in fort lauderdale in real life mr burke , a republican , simply had gotten drunk and grabby with the dancers in the novel my fictional congressman , a democrat , is deranged with lust \( the movie role was given to burt reynolds , a choice that surely would have delighted the late and notsodashing mr burke \) one night in 1996 , shortly before the film version of strip tease was released , a man named kendall b coffey purchased a 900 bottle of champagne and led a dancer to a private salon in a south dade adult club called lipstik the dancer , whose stage name was tiffany , said mr coffey drank too much bubbly and , after a struggle , chomped down on her arm the incident would n't have made the news but for the fact that mr coffey was the united states attorney for the southern district of florida , one of the nation s most powerful prosecutors he made no secret of his importance as bouncers firmly escorted him from the strip joint mr coffey declined to discuss what had happened but abruptly resigned as united states attorney and went into private practice the dancer went on national television to display the bite marks later her husband called to see if i wanted to write a book about her shocking experience i told him i already had it was n't the first time i felt plagiarized by real life , and it is n't likely to be the last some novelists say they envy those of us who live in south florida because our source material is so wondrously weird true enough , but the toll on our imaginations is draining on many days fiction seems like a futile mission pilfering from the news is no longer enough now we must compete with it a prime example is the strange saga of little elian gonzalez , which rips off elements of tom wolfe , kurt vonnegut , even gabriel garcia marquez a young cuban boy sets off for the united states in a small boat with his mother and other refugees the boat sinks , his mother perishes , and the child is found adrift protected , relatives would later claim , by friendly \( but not overly friendly \) dolphins the boy is embraced by miami s exile community as a sort of anticastro messiah , graced by mystical apparitions of the virgin mary and even diane sawyer , standing on her head meanwhile back in havana the child is hailed as a lost soldier of the revolution , a miniche guevara beaming at the throngs from tshirts and highway billboards elian s father wants him back in cuba the relatives in miami wo n't let him go demonstrators surround the house and vow to block any attempt to retrieve the child , though he is accepting visits from gloria estefan , andy garcia and other celebrities as the tense city sleeps , the boy is snatched by federal agents and flown to his father the next day from the miami camp second elian theory i ca n't tell you how often i get asked if elian will turn up in my next book the challenge is too daunting , and not because the reallife drama defies satire it is satire just look who s railing at the press conference one of the dozen highpriced lawyers hired to prevent elian s father from regaining custody why , it s none other than kendall b coffey , the aforementioned exunited states attorney and alleged stripper biter ! how deliciously twisted and surreal once it might have made a grand scene in a funny novel , but not now writers on writing this article is part of a series in which writers explore literary themes previous contributions , including essays by john updike , e l doctorow , ed mcbain , annie proulx , jamaica kincaid , saul bellow and others , can be found with this article at the new york times on the web www nytimes com arts photo carl hiaasen ,

the euro is a grand experiment , a paper currency without a government and that lack is one reason the euro has sunk far below any reasonable level early this week , romano prodi , the president of the european commission and , as such , the closest thing europe has to a president , called for intervention in the foreign exchange markets to support the euro the markets yawned traders know that mr prodi has little power nor does anyone else europe has a central bank , but the euro has 11 national governments none of them can set policy for the area as a whole , and each of them can disclaim responsibility for what happens to the currency when the euro was being planned , advocates expected the currency to be strong no longer would an italy , say , be able to just let its currency weaken to stay competitive , it and the other governments would have to adopt structural reforms rigid labor markets and highcost government pension plans would inevitably wither away just the opposite seems to be happening taxes are being cut , but other reforms are coming slowly , if at all the currency markets can no longer cast a vote on any one government s policies , so the easy way out is not directly punished , and the hard way is not going to be directly rewarded it should come as no surprise that governments under pressure tend to choose the easy way , as france did to buy off protesters who wanted lower fuel taxes one way to fight a falling currency is to intervene in the currency markets that can be a good tactic when , as now , currency values are clearly out of line but for intervention to work , it should be large , internationally supported , backed by a government making credible policy changes and seen as likely to continue if necessary yesterday s european central bank announcement that it was buying 22 billion worth of euros fails on all counts page c3 raising interest rates is another method to support a currency , and one that poor wim duisenberg , the president of the european central bank , has tried unfortunately , it is equity capital flows that now dominate the global investment scene , not bonds europe needs to find a way to persuade investors to buy stocks and businesses higher interest rates would slow the economy without helping the euro mr duisenberg never expected anything like the current situation , in which the united states can run an unprecedented current account deficit now at 43 percent of gross domestic product , or more than 1 billion a day while the dollar rises in the long run , such a deficit is unsustainable , he told a european parliamentary hearing but for now , he added , the americans have no difficulty in having that deficit financed , basically by us , europe that current account deficit is being exacerbated by high oil prices , which may yet slow the entire western world and make american investments look less attractive eventually , mr duisenberg will be proved right the dollar is overvalued , and will decline someday but the euro may not have that much time to wait already the euro disarray is damaging hopes that denmark will vote to join the currency union such a vote would damage the euro even further , and strengthen british opposition in that environment , a european recession might stir nostalgia for good old marks and francs but europe s rules bar any country from abandoning the euro a strong government for the euro region could fight those trends but this currency has 11 governments , which for some purposes is the same as having none graph tracks euro in dollars since 1999

western forum sampras had five days off after steamrolling the draw at the ericsson open andre agassi , in recent weeks paying the physical price for his grueling trip to zimbabwe for the first davis cup round , followed sampras s dismal showing by toying with slava dosedel , 63 , 63 , 63 , in the second singles , getting the united states even going into saturday s doubles mcenroe has always said that some players are just more mentally attuned to davis cup conditions than others sampras , who had pulled out of zimbabwe after pulling a muscle in the australian open , should have been in a comfort zone here in his hometown but nothing roused him from a sleepwalk that would take him to the worst davis cup defeat of his career not an earsplitting introduction ceremony that was borrowed from a dusty rocky script , not the laker girls wiggling to lenny kravitz s american woman , and not even mcenroe , getting grayer and more helpless with every passing shot by novak that kissed a line there was nothing john could do , said sampras , as baffled by himself as he has ever been for his part , mcenroe said he would have to have a chat with sampras about improving his energy none of this could have improved sampras s taste for the total davis cup experience , particularly having to stay around and root for agassi to bail him out agassi watched sampras play on television in the locker room until he could n't take it anymore and switched to golf agreeing to join mcenroe s dream team had turned into sampras s personal nightmare , as he was run off the hardcourt in 1 hour 48 minutes and even left to a smattering of boos he endured the worst davis cup defeat of his career against a player whose highest career ranking was 30th , whose best grand slam run ended in the fourth round of the 1999 united states open that it took sampras five sets to subdue the very same novak four years ago in flushing hardly began to explain what occurred today maybe the greatest player ever , novak called sampras amazing for me to beat him i was amazed , sampras said everybody was amazed as much by sampras s inability to convert so much as one of 11 breakpoint chances in the first and second sets as by novak s entrance into the kind of baseline zone no czech has visited since ivan lendl there was every reason to believe that the latter development had much to do with the former , or at least that was the story sampras was sticking with the start of the match , i had a lot of chances to break and really set the tone of the match , sampras said there were two in novak s first service game of the match , and five more in his second , when novak managed to hold serve from love40 novak hung in , gamely , to reach a tie breaker sampras doublefaulted for 13 novak hit a forehand winner down the line off a second serve just like that , the first set was gone on serve in the second set , sampras had another break point in the third game but could n't return a first serve in the fifth game , he again had triple break point , but lost the next five points i kept thinking , 'wow , this guy ca n't keep it up , ' and he did , sampras said this guy , novak , was treating sampras like some escapee from the satellite tour at 6 foot 3 inches , the 25yearold novak played a smart , conservative , tactical match , attacking sampras s backhand and keeping on his toes with a compact approach to the rallies he ran down sampras s volleys and hit angled passes that sampras said he did n't think novak was capable of any thoughts of an inspirational comeback by sampras were dashed when he lost his serve in the first and third games of the third set i do n't know what to do , he told mcenroe during one changeover the only option for sampras , for mcenroe and all the americans was an immediate reevaluation of the weekend mcenroe had said he expected to win every match , and that the biggest threat posed by the czechs was a lazy style that could lull an opponent to sleep novak , quite the contrary , woke everyone up and redirected an event that began with a scripted , upwithamerica theme the organizers did n't even bother to locate an updated czech republic anthem , playing an old recording from the czechoslovakia days instead next time the us plays in the czech republic , we 'll play the mexican anthem , dosedel said mcenroe can only hope that the next time sampras is scheduled to play , in the second reserve singles sunday , the match wo n't be decisive here we are in a dogfight when we expected to be up , 20 , mcenroe said but that s why sports is so

an obvious enchantment by tucker malarkey 407 pages random house 2395 the enchantment in the title of this entertainingly piquant first novel by tucker malarkey comes from a line in the koran and seems to refer to an attitude of nonbelief , an erroneous conviction that the faith of the ancestors is a sort of bedazzlement , a falsehood but the phrase an obvious enchantment is also mysterious , elusive , suggestive of the world of uncertainty in which ms malarkey places her likable heroine , an archaeologistanthropologist named ingrid holtz who is a flickering column of light trying to penetrate the shadows of a world of exotic intrigue ingrid has garnered an academic grant allowing her to travel to the island of pelat off the indian ocean coast of kenya , where her academic mentor and adviser , nick templeton , has disappeared while doing research templeton is a rebel in the world of scholarship , a man who suspects that we have gotten the history of monotheism all wrong he wants to answer the question of how cultures all around the world had all , in their own time and way , come to decide on one god and he believes that part of the answer lies in rediscovering a longago native king who brought islam to africa three centuries before that event is believed to have occurred ingrid , too , is absorbed by the history of monotheism , and she is a believer in templeton , who is mocked and despised by his colleagues at the university in michigan , where he and ingrid both work never mind that the academic questions seem a bit contrived , a bit airy , unconvincingly portentous never mind also that some of what happens in an obvious enchantment , including some of the critical turnings of plot , seem unmoored from clear and logical motivation ms malarkey never entirely solves the mysteries that get her into her african story in the first place but she is a gifted writer with a keen sense of place and a basketful of aromatic characters , expatriates and africans alike , who give her book plenty of romantic charm the chief mystery has to do with templeton s disappearance strangely , when ingrid arrives on pelat , he makes no effort to contact her there , or to let her know where he is , even though she has always been his star pupil and special moral and scholarly admirer why templeton behaves so strangely is one of those matters never fully accounted for in ms malarkey s scheme still , once you accept that templeton has vanished and yet is present in the lives of the savory inhabitants of pelat , you can enjoy ingrid s adventurous efforts not only to find him but to puzzle out what he has discovered about the historical king along the way ingrid unearths a host of others , dissolute , roguish , scheming , vulnerable , drunken and , in one case , unhealthily irresistible this latter figure is finn bergmann , whose scandinavian father , now dead , founded salama , a luxurious hotel on pelat where the island s chatty and catty expats gather finn is a white african he fishes for a living and is a sort of male counterpart to a femme fatale he is strong , handsome and seductive but while he is willing to share ingrid s eager bed he is unwilling to have sex with her he also seems to know something important about templeton , but he does n't share this precious information with ingrid , which makes her all the more annoyed that she ca n't get finn out of her mind her thoughts were clear , ms malarkey s narrator intones this man was a confused drunk , a fundamentally crippled human being he could not think , feel or talk she smiled as politely as she could 'i'm sorry to have caught you in my confusion' 'do n't concern yourself with my opinion of you , ' finn said 'i have none' some of ms malarkey s characters risk reminding one of central casting what recent cultural product about whites in africa , for example , does not have the equivalent of ms malarkey s danny chisham , the man who drinks steadily at the salama and has no purpose in life other than to be hurt and utter witticisms \? then there is fatima , the cloaked muslim woman whom we see striving to keep finn from losing himself among these dissolute europeans , as she intrigues from the shadows the issue that concerns everybody and that ingrid ca n't quite get a handle on has to do with a new hotel being built by another cagey expatriate , stanley wicks , on the other side of pelat from the salama the first hotel , built by finn s father , created an opposition group on the island , a kind of protofundamentalist core that feared the tourism business would pollute the native way of life , turning local boys into bartenders and bellhops now another eager european wants to bring more commercialism , more liquor , more european fashion to the very part of the island where the dissident faction lives somehow templeton is involved with that faction and is opposed to the new hotel finn , too but why ca n't anybody just tell the mystified ingrid what is happening \? in real life they might have , but then ms malarkey would n't have had much of a story , and we would have been deprived of the entertainment she has given us ms malarkey s ending involves a kind of showdown among the contending parties again , the stakes , especially for the europeans , do not seem quite large enough to justify the grisly acts that are committed , including some by templeton , as the final battle is fought but by then ms malarkey has given us a savory , intimate dose of africa and a main character whose combination of pluck and despair make us want to have as much of her as possible an obvious enchantment is far from entirely convincing , but its virtues are distinguished enough for us to keep reading with pleasure and a sense of edification about a faraway world that ms malarkey has brought colorfully to life

tallahassee , fla , nov 28 a circuit judge this evening denied a plea from vice president al gore s lawyers to accelerate his lawsuit that seeks to overturn gov george w bush s victory in florida , refusing to recount thousands of disputed ballots at least until he holds a hearing on saturday though the judge , n sanders sauls , agreed to mr gore s request that nearly 14 , 000 such ballots be sent up from south florida , the judge s decision to call a hearing on whether to count them was a blow to efforts by mr gore s lawyers to establish an accelerated timetable for contesting the election the lawyers are aware that they must wage a fullblown trial and several rounds of appeals in the two weeks before florida sends its electors to the electoral college , and they demanded that judge sauls set an extraordinarly fast schedule for the case under their proposal , officials would have begun counting 14 , 000 ballots from miamidade and palm beach counties on wednesday morning , continuing through the weekend for seven days , with a ruling from judge sauls next wednesday and any appeals to the florida supreme court over the next few days mr bush s lawyers , on the other hand , proposed a more leisurely schedule , one that would have ended the trial stage on dec 11 , the day before the designation of electors , leaving no time for any appeals mr gore appeared before television cameras in washington today to discuss the details of his motions , which he said was essential in ensuring a full and accurate count of the ballots , and to accuse the republicans of deliberately stalling the process page a28 they have proposed two weeks of additional court proceedings and additional hearings , right up to the dec 12 deadline for seating electors , mr gore said and under their plan , none of the thousands of votes that remain to be counted would be counted at all i believe this is a time to count every vote and not to run out the clock this is not a time for delay , obstruction and procedural roadblocks judge sauls , wielding folksy aphorisms to fend off the enormous pressure of the elite legal teams arrayed before him , tried to steer a middle course he called for a hearing on saturday to determine whether to count the ballots three days after the gore team wanted the counting to begin and said the hearing would also take up the issue of what standards should be used to count the ballots and whether marks like dimples should be considered votes to prevent logistical delays , the judge ordered the two counties to send their ballots to leon county circuit court here by friday afternoon , though he said the order did not necessarily suggest that he intended to tabulate votes this does n't mean in any way , shape or fashion that we 're going to be counting the ballots on saturday , unless there is a basis that dictates they should be counted , he said but at least if we have them , we should be able to move the judge s actions were not good enough for either side , and particularly for mr gore s lawyers david boies , mr gore s chief trial lawyer , told the judge that if he insisted on a saturday hearing , the democrats would immediately appeal that scheduling decision to the florida supreme court we ca n't afford to wait till saturday to answer these questions , mr boies said , his usual placid , smiling demeanor showing cracks of impatience waiting until saturday is tantamount to denying the relief we seek speaking to reporters later , however , mr boies said he had not decided whether to appeal the saturday hearing barry richard , mr bush s lead lawyer here , said far more time was needed to debate the question of whether the ballots should even be examined my client is entitled to a hearing before mr boies s client gets relief , but every time your honor gives him another thing , he s back on his feet asking for one more thing you 've already denied him twice , mr richard said , visibly angry he s asking this court to give him everything he s requested , which is to begin another ballot recount before he has provided one iota of evidence or permitted my client to have one hour of hearing on whether or not he s entitled to a recount judge sauls , joking that he was trying to be unfair to everybody equally , said the timetable mr boies was proposing would strip mr bush of his basic dueprocess rights to respond appropriately to legal motions after the hearing , mr boies tried to put the best face on the rulings , celebrating the decision to transport the ballots but conceding that the new schedule put his team on a very tight leash if the counting eventually begins , he said , it would probably have to go on 24 hours a day mr boies expressed skepticism that it could be finished in time obviously the court is moving faster than the defendant would like but slower than we would like , he said it s going to be a very close call mr boies added , justice delayed here really is justice denied though displeased with the saturday deadline , mr richard said outside the courtroom that he would work within the parameters set by the court it would be appropriate to give us more time , he said we will be as prepared as we can possibly be by saturday

a few more days , and the knicks' cure for the ordinary will arrive marcus camby will be back dropping in like a parachutist , ready to turn an innocent rebound into an energizing event charlie ward will return to toss his body across the floor like a tumbleweed , scrambling to turn a loose ball into a fast break without ward and camby , the fantasy lineup coach jeff van gundy has installed out of necessity using allan houston and latrell sprewell in the same backcourt has been more of a letdown than a pickmeup since the allstar game break it s not just games like monday night s collapse in miami although the knicks are 53 since the break , and 42 with the big lineup , houston and sprewell have not been convincing in their roles as a dynamic duo in the eight games since the allstar game break , houston s points a game have dropped from 209 to 171 , sprewell s from 189 to 16 but the return of camby and ward wo n't come without side effects there are bound to be issues concerning playing time for the last three weeks , kurt thomas has been inserted into the lineup and john wallace has grabbed the title as the inspirational leader coming off the bench when i come back , i do n't think i 'll be 100 percent , said camby , who is scheduled to practice today for the first time since he injured his knee on feb 6 it still feels sore and there is some swelling i'm not going to play 30 or 35 minutes the first night , but maybe 15 or 20 after that , i do n't know what s going to happen with the minutes and that situation john has really helped us he s done well and kurt has done well , too john has been terrific wallace has gone from the easy target of van gundy s irritation with the coach known to yank him off the floor in 30 seconds if the forward s defense lapses to the player with a gold star by his name i do n't think jeff is just yelling at me for no reason , said wallace , who s scoring 74 points and shooting 48 percent in 153 minutes off the bench since the break a lot of times , i'm making some mistake i do n't think he s yelling at me just to yell he knows the game he s a great coach , and i respect his criticism it s never a problem where i do n't agree with him if he s saying something , it s usually because i messed up so i'm going to listen i'm not worried about playing time marcus is a good friend or mine i do n't ever want to see him hurt if i have to get time because he s injured , i do n't want it when he comes back , and i do n't get time , i'm going to keep on working hard that s the kind of attitude that might ease what could be a difficult situation , the kind that nearly undid the knicks during their dysfunctional run last year playing time was an issue last season , as van gundy remembers i'm going to play guys who give us the best chance to win in that game , whoever that is , van gundy said and john certainly makes me feel more comfortable using him with how he s playing now john has given us a spark and right now , allan is going through a tough time scoringwise what john has provided us is exactly what we needed the knicks need support for their weary stars although patrick ewing is capable of a 20point night , the frayed elasticity in a 37yearold body can result in a singledigit night the next most of the burden is on the slumped backs of sprewell and houston , particularly since the allstar game break it s hard for us to win when both of those guys do n't score , van gundy said before the allstar game break , the knicks were averaging 92 points a game in the last six games using the big lineup , that average has plummeted to 85 nothing is coming easy for sprewell and houston often , sprewell is getting doubled on the catch the moment he touched the ball monday night , the heat circled him like a campfire the diminutive tim hardaway helped force him into 7 turnovers and held him to just 13 points often , houston s postallstar body language has resembled a loitering teen he s just hanging out , waiting for something to happen but teams are sending longarmed defenders like toronto s tracy mcgrady , the suns' anfernee hardaway and miami s waiverwire find , bruce bowen to put up a fence around his comfort zone in response , he appears too tired to attack but he shrugs off the notion that he s still suffering the aftereffects of his exhausting allstar weekend i'm just not getting my shots , said houston , who scored just 6 points in the second half of the knicks' loss to the heat the defense has been taking that away , and with two guards , the opportunity is not the same and also , a lot of it is me camby and ward are on the way photo after squandering a 20point lead and then losing in miami monday night , the knicks are waiting for the return of marcus camby and charlie ward \( gary i rothstein for the new york times \)
if i feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off , emily dickinson once said , i know that is poetry i 'll get back to this , in a minute we were in the lobby of a midtown bank at 3 am , filming that scene you know the one in which the ghost of hamlet s father \( sam shepard \) appears on a surveillance monitor , prompting hamlet s spooked pals to dash to the elevator to check it out after the second take , one of the producers turned to me and said , this reminds me of scoobydoo' i did n't feel insulted it was n't the first or last time i had to face the implicit question what are we doing here \? why hamlet again here and now \? the answer leads back to emily dickinson by way of orson welles , who conjured up a version of macbeth in 1948 , shooting for 21 days on an rko sound stage cluttered with fantastic , soggylooking papiermache sets welles described his film as a rough charcoal sketch of the play , and this remark , alongside the finished picture , provoked in me a sharp suspicion that you do n't need lavish production values to make a shakespeare movie that s accessible and alive shakespeare s language , after all , is lavish enough the meaning and emotion are all embedded there , line for line , word for word in the last 400 years , who more than shakespeare has been so directly responsible for transmitting the particular electrical charge that emily dickinson described the recognition of sudden and contrary meanings colliding in your brain , a certain topofyourheadbeingtakenoff feeling \? dickinson herself felt the ceiling lift when reading shakespeare after first taking in a volume of his plays , she was prompted to ask why is any other book needed \? at any rate , i was visited by an elemental desire to film shakespeare it was , as emily would have it , practically a physical impulse like wanting to go swimming in the ocean , or running out into a storm at night then again , maybe it was n't so purely hedonistic i had some hope that my reflexes as a filmmaker would be tested , battered and bettered that i 'd be swept along into deeper shakespearean currents i was hovering over various possibilities , relatively obscure plays and i was resisting hamlet it seemed too familiar , too obvious , and it s been filmed at least 43 times better to leave it to high school productions , spoofs and skits and the lion king as t s eliot noted years back , hamlet is like the mona lisa , something so overexposed you can hardly stand to look at it but masterpieces are definably masterpieces because they have a way of manifesting themselves in our everyday lives the play , and the character , seemed to be chasing me around new york i passed high school kids quoting hamlet on the street i was informed of the existence of a hamlet porno film and i found myself thinking back to my first impressions of the play , remembering its adolescenceprimed impact and meaning for me the rampant parallels between the melancholy dane and my many doomed and damaged heroes and imaginary friends james agee , holden caulfield , james dean , egon schiele , robert johnson , vladimir mayakovsky , jean vigo i was struck by the fact that no film of hamlet features a truly young man in dozens of versions \( including two silent films with women in the title role \) none of the actors were under 30 , and the most definitive , conspicuous modern incarnations olivier , richard burton , kevin kline , mel gibson were all at least 40 when they tackled the part \( kenneth branagh , at 35 , seemed hardly any younger , despite his trim platinum haircut and the enthusiastic swashbuckling moves unleashed for the climactic duel \) why not entrust the role to an actor in his 20 s \? the character takes on a different cast when seen more clearly as an abandoned son , a defiant brat , a narcissist , a poet filmmaker perpetual grad student a radiantly promising young man who does n't quite know who he is \( the play s famously simple first line is , who s there \? \) and i was heartened by the polish scholar jan kott s passionately lucid 1964 book , shakespeare our contemporary the genius of 'hamlet , ' mr kott wrote , consists in the fact that the play can serve as a mirror an ideal 'hamlet' would be one most true to shakespeare and most modern at the same time given the story s familiarity , it seemed altogether natural to locate a new hamlet in the immediate present , to translate the danish kingdom into a multimedia corporation , and to watch the story unfold in penthouse hotel rooms , skylevel office corridors , a coffee shop , an airplane , the guggenheim museum the chief thing was to balance respect for the play with respect for contemporary reality to see how thoroughly shakespeare can speak to the present moment , how they can speak to each other when i showed ethan hawke a sixpage treatment and explained my intention to shoot fast and cheap in new york , to film in super 16 millimeter , to make everything as urgent and intimate as possible , to keep all spoken dialogue as written by shakespeare but set within and energized by a contemporary context ethan got it immediately he trusted me , and he was ready , with a breathtaking absence of hamletlike equivocation , to leap in you know , he said during our first discussion , in a bar , over midafternoon glasses of beer , we do n't have to go to yale to do this then again , given 400 years of tradition , we knew we could never prepare enough
rwakitura , uganda , may 8 uganda and rwanda agreed today to withdraw all their troops from the third largest city in congo and to let united nations forces take over the area if the two nations stick to their pledges , the city , kisangani , and its immediate surroundings will become the first neutral region of congo , controlled by neither president laurent kabila s government nor by his enemies security council members who brokered the deal say they will urge secretary general kofi annan to start sending monitors backed by troops as soon as possible more broadly the agreement , finally completed today in a meeting between seven security council members on a peace mission to africa and president yoweri museveni of uganda , allows virtually every african leader involved in the congo war to retreat from the conflict without appearing to back down backtracking by any one of them could sink the delicate process of untangling a complex war richard c holbrooke , the american ambassador to the united nations and the leader of the security council mission , said after the agreement was announced here that rwanda and uganda , close allies , were eager to put a clash last week over kisangani behind them this is something both presidents want , mr holbrooke said it was not imposed on them by the security council we just happen to be in the neighborhood mr holbrooke spoke by telephone today with mr kabila and president robert mugabe of zimbabwe , who supports mr kabila with 12 , 000 troops , and said they were pleased with the accord mr mugabe told the delegation on saturday that he was prepared to discuss a withdrawal but would not be the first to leave mr kabila has always argued that the war is not a civil war but a result of an invasion by rwanda and uganda leaders of some congolese rebel groups met the security council delegation but they are not seen as much of a problem if their backers in rawnda and uganda choose to revive the flagging peace accord , which was signed in july mr museveni said after the talks here that he and president paul kagame of rwanda would meet on sunday to plan their moves in cooperation with the united nations mission and a military commission that represents all six nations in the conflict , including namibia and angola mr museveni said the tensions with rwanda on congolese territory are taking us away from our legitimate problems , which are the presence of the interahamwe there and the use of congo by sudan to send terrorists into uganda the interahamwe are ethnic hutu militias responsible for carrying out a genocidal campaign against tutsi and their moderate hutu supporters in rwanda in 1994 when a tutsiled government took over that year , the hutu fled to eastern congo , then zaire at that time , rwanda and uganda were backing mr kabila in his drive against zaire s dictator , mobutu sese seko about a year after mr kabila took power in kinshasa , rwanda and uganda took up arms against him part of an agreement announced on sunday in kigali , the rwandan capital , calls for a program to identify the interahamwe still in congo and offer them reintegration into rwanda or settlement in a third country some diplomats are skeptical of rwanda s promises , saying mr kagami s government has successfully exported its major problem with militant hutu and has no reason to want to see them rehabilitated also , some diplomats say , if densely populated rwanda is really in congo for the resources diamonds , gold , timber and rich agricultural land the interahamwe serve as a convenient excuse for keeping troops there kisangani , called stanleyville in colonial times , is an important city of nearly two million people and the capital of a diamondproducing province , orientale it has long been an important port , built on the congo river at the point where it ceases to be navigable for trade some united nations officials in kinshasa , the congo capital , saw the perennial fighting in kisangani as a squabble over spoils if that is the prime motivation , keeping kisangani neutral may not be easy mr holbrooke said today that sending in united nations forces to the city would now become , in our recommendation , the most urgent next action asked whether the sierra leone crisis would hurt recruiting for the far more complex congo operation , mr holbrooke said none of us in the delegation think that what s happening in sierra leone or even in the horn of africa directly affects the lusaka peace process on congo however , we all recognize the political context in which these decisions are made that s undeniable
al gore received an endorsement yesterday from one bill bradley , a former basketball player mr bradley is said to have served in the united states senate , but he seems to have spent most of this millennium in seclusion , and much about him is unknown , including the identity of his favorite book in a brief joint appearance with mr gore in wisconsin , mr bradley revealed that he had once spent 15 months running for the presidential nomination himself , in this very country he then treated the crowd to a brief recapitulation of his old stump speech , followed by the tribute to mr gore , whom he praised as a member of the democratic party mr bradley provided a real test for mr gore s reputation as a man who can pander to anything , even an inanimate object but the vice president delivered the goods , describing mr bradley as an important part of america s future and , far more imaginatively , a friend it took four months for mr bradley to work himself up to this moment returning from his selfimposed exile from public life , he seems like a ghost of campaigns past , somebody who once traded shots with jimmy carter or estes kefauver now that he s back , sort of , he 'll automatically be mentioned as a potential vicepresidential candidate it s none too soon , since we 've been running through the pool rather quickly people call this campaign boring , but when you think about it , the carnage has been quite spectacular remember when bill richardson was a favorite for the number two slot \? back in february the secretary of energy was so omnipresent in mr gore s entourage you expected him to start handing out the box lunches but that was before gasoline passed 2 a gallon and our national defense secrets turned up hidden behind an office copying machine now the poor man is such political dog meat , he 'll be lucky if the democrats let him watch the convention on television and it was just a couple of months ago that senator bob graham of florida was a hot ticket , shepherding mr gore around the state , introducing him at rallies while the vice president stared at mr graham with rapt , tipperlevel attention the senator had so much influence he helped prod mr gore into his saveeliangonzalez moment , an unprecedented triplepanderwithsplat that politicians will be gasping about for generations mr graham , apparently searching for a really dramatic coup to put himself back in contention , recently opened his diaries to time magazine it turns out that the senator writes down every single thing he does , 247 , and has an entry to prove that on the evening in 1994 when his daughter gave birth to a son , he spent the moments between 1 301 45 pm rewinding a video of ace ventura , pet detective he must have presumed that mr gore would be particularly attracted to a potential vice president who has every move recorded in 4 , 000 notebooks , colorcoded by season the republican field is getting frayed , too gov christie todd whitman of new jersey crashed and burned this week , when a photo surfaced showing her frisking a black man and grinning wildly mrs whitman had apparently been riding around with some state troopers a few years back and jumped at an opportunity to play cop this raises questions not only about mrs whitman s racial sensitivity , but also her iq even the most dimwitted male politician in the universe would know what to say if he was invited to pat down a woman in the presence of a photographer it was a question , at that time , of being handson , said the governor defensively in a tv interview when an elected official pretends to be hanging with the tough guys you get michael dukakis driving that tank , or rudy giuliani and al d'amato dressed as hell s angels bill bradley , whose example should definitely be followed in this matter , is so averse to funnycostume campaigning he refused to put on shorts and pretend to be a basketball player when he had a fundraiser at madison square garden with his former knicks teammates that event , believe it or not , took place during the very same presidential race we 're having now and when you think about it , mr bradley s refusal to come out in public since he lost might just be an attempt to dodge the possiblevicepresidentialcandidate curse

the huge potential power of the proposed aol time warner has applied electroshock to the cortex of the convergence industries information , entertainment and communication one of the biggest jolts is being felt in the growing market for highspeed , or broadband , internet services combining the world s largest internet service provider with the world s largest news , entertainment and cable television megalith has set off increasingly urgent discussions about the future of broadband and how best to ensure that no single company abuses its control of the internet s infrastructure the reasons for urgency are twofold first is the issue of how to open privately owned broadband internet access to all comers in addition , the freespeech issue arises when any single entity , of any size , controls both a transmission medium and the information that flows over it open access is a particular concern premerger america online was in the midst of strident lobbying to shame the att corporation , which had recently acquired the cable giant telecommunications , into opening its cable network to america online s \( or anyone s \) customers the precedent for this demand known euphemistically as open access is actually commoncarriage law , which for decades has compelled telephone companies to interconnect their systems and serve all customers , including competitors , without discriminating on price or on who can buy access despite america online s assurances of continued support for open access , industry executives and public interest watchdogs fear that once it actually owns time warner s highspeed cable network that view may evolve , as one person close to the deal put it the specter of att and america online as broadband superpowers controlling enormous closed networks has convinced a growing number of observers that without some kind of government dictum declaring you will interconnect , the battle for broadband market share is certain to devolve into an internecine contest that wastes trillions of dollars and frightens away customers some of these issues were being addressed even as the merger was announced in october , the ieeeusa , a trade organization for engineers , cosponsored a symposium at cornell university \( www johnson cornelledu faculty mcadams \) , at which participants drew scenarios of a broadband future but two participants realized that none were accounting for the inevitable public policy issues ahead every scenario is a nightmare scenario , says richard j solomon , a technology policy expert who is now a senior scientist at the university of pennsylvania s center for communications and information science and policy we 'll end up with a monopoly and nothing good from a technology perspective or there 'll be a stalemate where everyone will sue each other to block everything from happening or he cites another scenario in which billions , maybe trillions will be spent on marketing competing standards , so that building a network will take 30 years mr solomon and michael e bloom , a veteran telecommunications engineer , consultant and industry analyst based in san ramon , calif , were asked to write a paper for ieeeusa on these issues they concluded that some variation of common carriage was the only solution the fact that common carriage encourages the network to be everywhere and fully interconnected , they argue , would provide stability and thus significantly speed the development of the broadband market it would also free owners of content and conduit from legal liability for carrying the content of others on their wires the threat of too much government oversight and control , mr solomon and mr bloom say , can be mitigated by getting everyone to the table to create a cooperative , open system since government is going to be involved one way or another , like it or not , we 're proposing that the industry sit down with government now , sit down with public policy makers now , get everyone in the same room and work out a set of investment and public policy scenarios to invest in a broadband network , mr solomon says everyone loves to talk about their pet operating system or protocol but five years arguing is five years lost in fact , he adds , the broadband standards embraced today by cable and phone companies are outmoded already the pair even proposes that this group agree to create some kind of entity governmental , quasigovernmental , a private corporation with a set of rules that would own or manage this network , or both nicholas johnson , a former member of the fcc who teaches law at the university of iowa , said the precedent for such an arrangement was the internet itself , before it was sold off by the government the government built it , made it available , mr johnson said you could move over whatever you wanted to move there was no content control it was fully distributed , a flat organization in terms of control , and the thing just ran mr johnson says a governmentoperated network would keep us 2 , 3 , 10 years ahead of the rest of the world , because it would give us the infrastructure we 'd really need , and avoid an incredible amount of wasted time and energy not every expert agrees with the need for so radical a solution for example , glenn manishin , a lawyer with patton boggs llp in washington , argues , if we regulate too soon , then we run a risk of deflecting investment mr manishin , whose firm represents america online , has been immersed in telecommunications law since serving as an antitrust lawyer for the justice department during the breakup of att but he agrees that there is a role for government there should be some kind of requirement that these providers establish a basis upon which interoperability can occur , he says like the telephone network , like the public internet , which arose because of open standards , we 'd have an open , broadband , interoperable network of networks mr johnson asserts that the ability for anyone to move content throughout such a network is essential to free speech yet , powerful corporations like att and the proposed aol time warner would have the power to balkanize the broadband internet for their own purposes , with no legal reason to open their networks to competitors and as mr johnson points out , if you ca n't get on the network , you 've been locked out of the market drawing \( stuart goldenberg \)
seoul , south korea when the scandal first broke , it seemed to have all the elements of an airport novel , revealing as it did the seamy underside of high finance in this country s booming technology industry , brazen stock manipulation and loan fraud by a young and dashing internet pioneer there were allegations of millions of dollars' worth of bribes paid to politicians and financial regulators , and even reports of a janitor acting as bag man inside the presidential palace still , none of this would have unduly shocked south korea , where multimilliondollar scandals involving executives are a fairly regular occurrence these days that is , until the director of the governmental financial supervisory service turned up dead , apparently by suicide , in a hotel room recently after the internet entrepreneur chung hyun joon told investigators he had paid huge bribes to the regulatory agency investigators have since revealed that the regulator , chang rae chan , was suspected of taking a 300 , 000 bribe from the entrepreneur s company , korea digital line what is worse , the police suspect at least 116 other regulators of taking bribes to protect shady startup ventures and banks from scrutiny the watchdog agency where they worked , the financial supervisory service , was created by president kim dae jung to help revive his country s credibility after the asian economic crisis of the late 1990 s instead , with their rampant cronyism and wild west deal making , the scandals have reminded investors of the worst days of the crisis with allegations of corruption now flooding the agency and even washing up on the doorstep of the blue house , south korea s presidential residence , mr kim s government has been badly shaken at a time when he might have been basking in the prestige of the nobel peace prize he recently won for his rapprochement with north korea mr kim has faced a barrage of criticism from the press and from an ever aggressive opposition for being careless about corruption and the economy as the proliferating scandals have knocked down investor confidence , along with the won , the korean currency clearly dismayed , mr kim announced somewhat cryptically this week that he would be making a big decision to restore government credibility the heaviest speculation has centered on a sweeping cabinet reshuffle , as well as efforts to distance himself from cronies in his own party , the millennium democratic party but the vague pledges have done little to calm the waters the scandals have caused immeasurable harm to korea , said lee hahn koo , an opposition legislator and director of policy for the grand national party they mark the failure of policies intended to nurture new capitalists but now very few people believe in the capability of this government among the least understood , and potentially most explosive , elements of the scandal is the arrest of the blue house janitor , lee yun gyu , with 360 , 000 allegedly obtained from the head of korea digital online after he passed himself off as mr kim s presidential chief of staff associates of the president say that there is no evidence that the janitor bribed anyone higher up , and they deny any executive branch involvement in the scandal the case of the janitor is a matter of fraud involving a lowlevel worker at the blue house , said chun sye kyun , a close presidential ally and member of the legislature s finance and economy committee the problem at the center of these scandals is the inability of the financial supervisory service to prevent irregularities the suicide of mr chun tragically highlights this problem it is unfortunate that these incidents have occurred , but it has been proven that there was no involvement of highlevel officials so far , few koreans seem so sanguine indeed , a second huge financial fraud scandal to break here in as many months , has only deepened perceptions of widespread corruption reaching high into mr kim s administration in that case , a 27yearold entrepreneur named jin seung hun managed to amass 196 million in illegal loans , prosecutors say , by rigging stock prices and defrauding banks mr jin , who now faces trial for fraud , told the south china morning post there is not a shred of evidence against me
i note that something called snow day looms on the horizon , starring my old classmate chevy chase chevy and i were at bard college together in the late 60 s years before he became famous on saturday night live as the goodlooking guy who won the emmys for his acting and writing , for his imitations of gerald ford , for starting weekend update by saying , i'm chevy chase and you 're not , and for falling down staircases and ladders and off chandeliers \( at bard , he was a literature major \) i 've hardly seen him in recent years , but i have a notion of his spiritual whereabouts because i get a christmas card each december , featuring a chase family photo this most recent christmas , chevy appeared in a rustic autumn setting , surrounded by his wife and his daughters , all wearing pants , except for chevy he has on a rather short , lowcut print frock as in his fletch movies , in which he can be seen as anything from a beach bum to a 19thcentury southern plantation owner , it s really just chevy sticking out of a costume , with none of the standard milton berle accouterments he s not even wearing a wig and has , instead , accessorized the dress with chest hair , sunglasses and a baseball cap his inappropriate headgear , however , may be somehow balanced by that of three large dogs , posed moodily in the foreground wearing headbands adorned by reindeer antlers i gave the christmas card to my 5 1 2yearold , luc , to pin up on his bulletin board he already knew who chevy was because we watch the national lampoon vacation movies together and we both laugh a lot , though not always at the same lines but when i told luc that chevy and i went to school together , he was less impressed than bewildered you mean clark is real \? he exclaimed of course , despite my efforts , there may still be some confusion there about cinematic technology but i guess it s also a testament to chevy s remarkable transformation into the klutzy , sentimental dad he always plays in socalled family movies real \? i do n't know those of us who take an interest in his professional trajectory will not be surprised to learn that in snow day , chevy gets to wear a number of bizarre costumes he plays a dad , of course , a television weatherman whose boss \( played by pam grier \) , in an effort to improve the station s ratings , has him dress up as jack frost , or a gaudy hawaiian tourist as to the plot of snow day , which opens on friday , here is the preliminary publicity information meet the brandstons mom , dad , three kids a typical american family from syracuse , new york little do they suspect that this snow day is going to change their lives forever because , anything can happen on a snow day and sometimes it does ! an article written while snow day was being shot in calgary quotes the producer , julia pistor , praising chase as a trouper says ms pistor , we 've had him in all these silly costumes when it was very cold and he did not complain one iota indeed the calgary sun then quotes chevy i did n't have to wear anything like this in 'fletch , ' he says of the jack frost and hawaiian getups no , i 've never stooped quite this low in any film , he says until the reporter reminds him of oh heavenly dog , with benji yeah , i stooped pretty low in that one i 'll give you that but chevy s career of stooping also of crawling , tumbling , crashing into walls , dropping his pants , putting his finger in his nose , and falling , falling , falling is well documented his filmography includes some 30 items among the most notable being fletch and caddyshack \( which , along with their sequels , have become perennials on the college cult circuit \) the innumerable national lampoon vacation movies \( which , contrary to most sequels , seem to be getting funnier \) funny farm , directed by george roy hill memoirs of an invisible man , with daryl hannah , and seems like old times , with goldie hawn i want to particularly single out the 1986 film three amigos ! , which also stars steve martin and martin short and which i happen to believe is hilarious not everyone agrees , but then not everyone enjoys scenes such as the one in which mr martin , mr short and chevy , playing three hollywoodstyle cowboys in mexico , are taking the iconic pause in their journey through the desert to sleep beneath the stars , their horses tethered nearby , under the big sky whose delicately gorgeous pastel is progressively reddened by the equally iconic setting sun just as you might expect , as chevy strums the guitar , the three amigos cannot resist breaking into song i especially relish the moment when the horses join in but then , i do admit a predilection for that category of comedy i have n't always been willing to laugh so easily at dumb humor the truth is that it has become more and more precious to me so much about our lives is laughable and too few people are amused it s as if we 've come to believe in a reallife fourth wall thank goodness for movies i'm not sure we 'd ever laugh at ourselves any more if we were left to our own devices at bard , when i was very young and not so much in need of cheap jokes , i remember doing a very good job of not laughing at chevy s jokes there was a division among his fellow students some thought he was a riot , and others attempted , instead , to engage in a dense , resonant notlaughing

have you checked your cable bill lately \? average rates have risen 33 percent over the last five years , and the pace shows few signs of letting up that may irk the nearly 70 million cable subscribers in the united states , but it would seem to be good news for cable stock investors so why is the paul kagan associates index of cable company stocks down 218 percent this year through friday , while the standard poor s 500stock index is flat \? investors see problems for the industry , especially in the growing popularity of satellite television providers like hughes electronics' directv and echostar communications' dish network not helping is a recent poll by the yankee group , a research firm , that showed 46 percent of satellite subscribers rated their service as excellent , versus just 15 percent for cable subscribers but none of that should dissuade investors from ponying up for the shares of one cable company , according to some analysts and money managers they say cablevision systems , the bethpage , ny , company that provides service to 29 million people in the new york area , should bear up better than most cable companies under the satellite onslaught they 're one of the leastvulnerable cable companies out there , said tom eagan , a painewebber analyst who recently upgraded his recommendation on the stock the number of cablevision subscribers grew 24 percent in the first quarter , versus 2 percent growth for the industry , even as satellite companies were heavily promoting their services in the metropolitan area cablevision benefits because good satellite reception is relatively hard to get in urban areas like new york but the company has also been rolling out enhanced analog settop boxes that allow subscribers to receive as many as 110 channels , versus about 50 with its old boxes and it is converting its network to digital , which will improve picture resolution , and plans to introduce sony digital boxes later this year that provide still more channels they 're going to be the first cable provider that converts to 100 percent digital , which will give them an enormous amount of capacity that will really dwarf every other network , said ray katz , an analyst at bear stearns mr eagan expects cablevision s proforma earnings before interest , depreciation and amortization to hit 13 billion in 2001 , up 18 percent from this year at 689375 , its shares are down 87 percent this year , trading for just 10 times his estimate of 2000 cash flow , low enough to prompt takeover talk cablevision itself is selling its cleveland system to adelphia communications for 153 billion in april , it agreed to swap its boston system with att for 125 , 500 customers in the northern suburbs of new york city , plus 878 million in att stock and 284 million cash mr eagan values the deals at roughly 20 times cash flow , far higher than cablevision s own multiple he notes that the swap will strengthen its grip on the metropolitan market focusing on one market is a risky strategy , one that could set up cablevision for a tumble should the new york city economy dangerously dependent on wall street falter but the new york market is the most lucrative in the nation , and cablevision s geographic focus has let it develop a kind of vertical integration that is unprecedented in the cable business , allowing for profitable synergies no other company has tried to build the type of multimedia network cable , entertainment , telephone and internet access that cablevision executives are seeking the synergies come in part from cablevision s 74 percent interest in rainbow media holdings , owner of madison square garden , its cable network and the three professional sports teams the rangers , the knicks and the liberty that play there rainbow also owns radio city entertainment and holds stakes in the american movie classics and bravo cable channels cablevision itself owns some high profile new york properties , including clearview cinemas and the wiz , the electronics retailer the benefits of its intertwined holdings can add up knicks games , for example , are often shown exclusively on the msg network , allowing the company to avoid paying for expensive broadcast rights the wiz sells cable modem systems at a steep discount , fostering the galloping growth of cablevision s highspeed cable internet service , which has more than 70 , 500 subscribers and lightpath , cablevision s fledgling local phone company , could provide more of the crosspollination that has already impressed analysts they 're really leveraging their properties off one another , said robert g routh , an analyst at ladenburg thalmann they 're basically becoming new york s entertainment company jim jundt , portfolio manager at jundt associates , a money management firm in st louis park , minn , said new york is a unique situation , and they own some unique properties i think they are doing a smart thing he has about 25 percent of his firm s assets in cablevision , which he says is worth 123 a share the company is planning to shuffle more assets it expects to issue a tracking stock in august to represent the earnings stream of its rainbow media stake , but cablevision does not expect madison square garden or its sports teams to be included in the deal that would let cablevision monetize some of the programming assets it controls , which typically trade for far higher multiples than cable systems still , it is unclear how long cablevision will remain independent att already owns more than 30 percent of its stock , and has been buying cable systems time warner controls the most profitable piece of new york s cable market , manhattan , so it has also been mentioned as a possible acquirer charles s dolan , chairman of cablevision , and his son james l dolan , chief executive , together with their family , control 80 percent of its voting shares they have declined to comment on any

pristina , kosovo , oct 28 under the protection of the nato peacekeepers who in effect freed them from serbian rule , jubilant kosovo albanians swarmed around polling places today to take part in what they saw as the first genuinely free vote they had ever enjoyed donning their best clothes to tramp through mud or ride horse carts and tractors to village schoolhouses and other buildings hastily converted into polling places , the albanians cast ballots in municipal elections organized by the foreign administrators who run kosovo and see the vote today as the first step toward creating a government for the province this day is itself a celebration , a special celebration , said sokol statofci , an election observer for the democratic league of kosovo , the kosovo albanians' biggest party , in a polling place on the edge of the capital , pristina i am very happy it is the first time i am able to vote freely in elections that are mine the mood was completely different among the dwindling serbian population , now estimated at around 80 , 000 people almost none of them registered to participate in the vote , arguing that continuing albanian violence and harassment afforded neither the freedom of movement nor the security required to vote even though they were only choosing local officials to run municipal authorities , most albanians said the vote was proof of their freedom from belgrade s rule and confirmation of their right to independence a right that is not acknowledged by the united nations security council resolution governing the foreign presence in kosovo , nor by foreign governments or the yugoslav federation , of which kosovo is still formally a part in 1989 , riding a wave of nationalism , slobodan milosevic , then the president of serbia , stripped kosovo s albanians of the autonomy granted them under communist rule in 1974 in 1990 , albanians were either fired or quit their state jobs , and ran their own schools , hospitals and even in 1992 makeshift elections , while serbia and its security forces formally ruled the province to kosovo albanians , therefore , today was the first time any of them had voted free of communist or serbian rule this is a free vote for independence and democracy in kosovo , said ibrahim rugova , leader of the democratic league of kosovo his biggest rival , hashim thaci , who led the armed rebellion by the kosovo liberation army and now heads the democratic party of kosovo , had much the same message i fully believe that the international community very soon will recognize the right of kosovo to be independent as a state of all citizens of equal rights , he told journalists illustrating how far apart the serbs and albanians are , there was not one albanian political party taking part today that does not support independence the elections are clearly albanian ones , and as far as serbia and yugoslavia are concerned , they are totally invalid and illegitimate , zivorad igic , a senior official of mr milosevic s socialist party in belgrade , told agence francepresse although mr milosevic has been ousted as yugoslav president and a new leader , vojislav kostunica , favors a more moderate serbian nationalism , few if any serbian politicians would publicly renounce their claim to kosovo however , there were signs that the kosovo serbs might rethink their boycott dr bernard kouchner , head of the united nations administration in kosovo , said this week that in coming months local elections will probably take place in four municipalities of 30 in all that are dominated by serbs although the serbs boycotted , several parties representing minority groups mostly gypsies , turks and muslim slavs did take part some 40 , 000 peacekeepers , who took control of kosovo in june last year as serbian forces withdrew after 78 days of nato bombing of yugoslavia , and 6 , 000 united nations and local police were out to prevent any violence in the divided city of mitrovica , they escorted albanians living in the serbdominated north of the town to vote but across the province , the mood was mostly relaxed , if chaotic voting places opened late and were disorganized several were still swamped at 7 pm , and forced to stay open well beyond the 12 hours allotted for voting some people , including the wife of mr rugova , found they were not on voting lists in the allalbanian village of trstenik , an italian policeman lost his temper and cursed at the unruly crowd but as he marched a young man off to the back of the line , the villagers began to giggle trstenik lies in drenica , a region of central kosovo where the desire for independence burns strongest inhabitants recalled their very different elections in 1992 , when the albanians staged a parallel vote to organized serbian elections that they boycotted the albanians voted then in private houses , and their appointed election officials went from home to home to collect the ballots then we had people standing guard outside to watch for the police and if they came we would run away , said haradin kuqica , 27 at one place , the police confiscated all the ballots he and several friends arrived at midmorning to find some 200 people still waiting outside the school it would be better to go back to voting in private houses , joked one no , mr kuqica said we waited with impatience all these years if there is a need we will wait all night all these people were in the woods , he said , describing how first during 1998 , when the rebellion against serbian rule began in earnest and the serbs retaliated with brutal expulsions , and then during the war in 1999 the villagers fled their homes so we are happy , and they can queue up as long as it takes the election campaign was marred by some violence two members of mr rugova s party were shot dead earlier in the year , apparently in political assassinations attributed by some albanians to mr thaci s party , many of whose members are former rebel fighters and have been accused of using violence and threats to seize power mr rugova led a movement of passive resistance against the serbian police rule of mr milosevic and has for the last 10 years been seen by most kosovo albanians as their leader his party , a moderate group largely led by educated professionals with a broad grassroots organization , is expected to do the best in the vote , especially in the towns but mr rugova s once unsurpassed position has slipped since younger albanians grew impatient and started taking up arms in 1997 to fight serbian forces election violence has waned in recent weeks , with incidents reported in the campaign s final days amounting to someone cutting the loudspeakers as mr rugova was speaking at a rally in western kosovo and a fist fight breaking out between supporters of the two parties there have been reports of voter intimidation but most people asked said they felt free to choose their favorites mr statofci , the election observer from mr rugova s party on the outskirts of pristina , said no one felt under pressure to vote one way or another this is important , said have dvoreni , who came with her family to vote we are all invited to come and choose who we want , the big and small after this vote we are hoping for a better future , no more fear , no more obstacles photo kosovo albanians lined up

libby , mont when w r grace company sold them the 21acre site along the kootenai river seven years ago , mel and lerah parker were ecstatic they finally had a tract large enough to build new quarters for their thriving nursery business and a new home now , the business is closed , and bulldozers will soon raze everything on the land , forcing the parkers to find a new place to live and work in recent months , tests have revealed that their property is contaminated by a toxic form of asbestos called tremolite , the result of years in which grace used the site as a transport center for the vermiculite ore the company mined nearby tremolite , a microscopic fiber that causes lung disease and several forms of cancer , occurs naturally in vermiculite , which is used in insulation and dozens of other products katie , my 7yearold granddaughter , is asking me if i'm going to die , mrs parker said , sobbing why should children that age be thinking about things like that \? the parkers knew of lawsuits linking the mining operations to illness but mrs parker said no one from grace ever told them that ore dust all over the property when they bought it posed any lingering health threat from asbestos as a result , the parkers are among a growing list of libby residents reeling from the medical , psychological and financial consequences of the mining operation , which over its 67 years provided desperately needed highpaying jobs here in the vast stretches of northwest montana though grace shut it down in 1990 , the mine is being blamed for scores of cases of respiratory illness and death from exposure to the tremolite the problems in libby , a town of 2 , 700 , represent the most significant single source of asbestos exposure in the nation s history , said paul peronard , a coordinator for the environmental protection agency the area contaminated by the mining operation is now the agency s first priority for cleanup , which will probably take six months and cost 3 million , mr peronard said who will pay for the cleanup is still in dispute , but the agency said it would proceed while negotiating with grace in the last 15 years , scores of local residents , armed with medical opinions linking their relatives' deaths to asbestos exposure from mining , have filed lawsuits against grace , charging negligence and deceit without acknowledging any deliberate wrongdoing , grace has settled dozens of cases out of court , largely to avoid expensive litigation , company lawyers said other cases are still pending meanwhile , the company has also offered medical coverage for people who were exposed aside from exacting a human toll , the mining operation has raised questions for people here concerning how much grace knew about the dangers of asbestos and whether state supervision was too lax the story has also caused deep divisions in libby some residents welcome the recent publicity and governmental attention , but others fear they are the new millennium s version of the 1970 s environmental disaster in the love canal neighborhood of niagara falls , ny the story here , they say , might do irreversible damage to a town struggling to share in the nation s economic good times while acknowledging the problem , grace executives said that little was known at the time about the effects of asbestos , and that as knowledge grew , they did their best to comply with the safety standards of the day there is no question in my mind that if the company knew how to do it , if anybody knew how to do it , it was done , said harry eschenbach , the company s director of health and safety for 20 years , through 1997 mr eschenbach insisted that grace violated no laws , provided annual chest xrays and updated technologies in libby sure , the state would come in and tell us to do more , he said but do what \? the technology was n't always there if it was , we 'd have used it mr eschenbach also denied that grace hid anything the workers , he said , had a right to know the hazards to which they are exposed i always told them , one on one and in groups of one on two or three for the most part , the rising incidence of illness and the ensuing legal battles have played out in relative obscurity then , in november , articles by the daily inter lake in kalispell , mont , and the seattle postintelligencer brought new focus to the mining operations and caught the attention of the epa tests of air and soil since then found several areas still contaminated by asbestos as a result of the review and lawsuits , a fuller picture of the operation and its effect on libby has emerged for as long as the mine operated 40 years under the nowdefunct zonolite company , its last 27 under grace workers , as well as company and state officials , recognized illness as an occupational risk nor did anyone especially fear any deadly impact of asbestos in the early days in fact , the residue containing asbestos was so abundant and powdery that libby children were invited to play in it many did other people took bags home to use as insulation , mulch and cat litter
albany , may 16 hillary rodham clinton tonight accepted the nomination of the new york state democratic party for united states senator , plunging into a race shrouded in confusion with a speech that reflected her uncertain political reality she still did not know if her opponent this fall would be mayor rudolph w giuliani the result was a political transposition the democratic convention was based here in the state capital , but the attention of the 11 , 500 democrats who assembled in the pepsi arena , among them the president of the united states , was firmly focused on new york s city hall right through this evening , democrats were still trading rumors that mr giuliani was about to seize mrs clinton s spotlight by finally announcing whether his diagnosis of prostate cancer and the public unraveling of his marriage would lead to his leaving the race in this extraordinarily unsettled atmosphere , mrs clinton indeed , all the democrats who spoke during the nearly fivehour session offered none of the kind of sharp partisan attacks on mr giuliani that would be customary at this kind of political gathering mrs clinton s acceptance speech presented her election as a contest between political philosophies , an attack not on any candidate but on republican policies that the first lady s aides said would stand whether her opponent ended up being mr giuliani or another republican make no mistake about it this election is not about me or about any republican opponent , mrs clinton said it s about the people of new york , and the mission that we are pledged to what is that mission \? i think it is to strengthen our families and to protect our children , to improve our schools and to extend health care to every new yorker to free our families and our communities from the terror of gun violence she went on to describe the mission as to strengthen our families , to protect our children , improve our schools and to extend health care to every new yorker the sole official task at hand for this gathering of 352 delegates , joined in the bleachers by an audience of thousands , democratic officeholders , advocates and lobbyists , was to nominate mrs clinton they did that with a single shout of aye ! at 9 13 tonight , and then judith hope , the chairwoman of the state democratic party , went to the microphone and announced ladies and gentlemen , please welcome the next senator of the united states , hillary clinton , and the president of the united states the enthusiastic and confident tone of the session suggested how far mrs clinton had come since she began traveling the state last summer , a reflection both of what democrats tonight described as the evolution of mrs clinton s political skills and of the recent difficulties that have confronted mr giuliani she was the unanimous choice of delegates here tonight no other democrat even managed to gather the 15 signatures needed to have his or her name entered into nomination we have a united democratic party , mrs clinton told a crush of reporters and state legislators who turned out to see her at a prenomination reception sponsored by the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , a manhattan democrat we 're going to work in this campaign we 're going to be victorious in november if the events here were largely predictable , the democratic party took pains to take note of what transpired here in albany tonight a first lady was chosen for the first time to run for public office the words history in the making were affixed to the front of the lectern , and this city buzzed as the news spread that president clinton would accompany his wife to the event even on what should have been the most orderly of days , there were touches of disorder throughout the evening , in keeping with the history of both the democratic party of new york and the nation s first family with jockeying among elected officials for a highprofile spot at this unusually highprofile convention , the party was unable to produce a copy of its program until just 45 minutes before the convention was gaveled to order , and the convention was running behind schedule within the hour mr clinton s decision to attend was a lastminute change of course , the outcome of a debate in mrs clinton s camp over whether his appearance would overshadow the first lady on her day , or whether it would seem odd for a candidate s spouse not to be by her side at this event the first lady and her aides were tinkering with her speech until the last moment , just as her husband frequently does with his mr giuliani s campaign , which has pushed ahead full throttle even in the midst of uncertainty about the candidate himself , had a response to mrs clinton s speech out more than two hours before she was scheduled to speak no matter how hard mrs clinton tries to reinvent herself , said juleanna glover weiss , a spokeswoman for mr giuliani s campaign , there is still only one candidate in this race with the record of success and followthrough that has improved the lives of new york families it was , in some senses , a tricky political day for mrs clinton s campaign , as it sought to balance competing forces taking advantage of what should be a stellar moment in the campaign , without seeming to be overly harsh toward mr giuliani at a time of personal difficulty for the mayor mrs clinton did not mention mr giuliani s name in a speech that went on for 39 minutes her speech was , in fact , notably unadventurous , as she endorsed a number of democratic positions on issues that her aides hope will be key in the campaign among them were gun control , increasing the minimum wage , providing affordable health care to all , and opposing broadbased republican tax cuts in congress in some ways , in terms of the length of her remarks as well as the laundrylist presentation , her speech was reminiscent of the state of the union addresses that were given for eight years by the man who sat silently behind her on the stage tonight president clinton smiled and clapped throughout the evening , particularly when his wife firmly attached herself to his record and offered an effusive tribute to her husband i am delighted that the president is here this evening , mrs clinton said , making no mention of the debate among her and her aides as to whether he should attend and i am so grateful for his support , she continued as the hall fell silent i would not be standing here tonight were it not for bill and were it not for all he has done for me , and i could not be prouder as an american and as a new yorker to have a president who has meant so much to our country we are a better country than we were in 1992 the audience rose in an ovation to the president although mrs clinton seemed to be taking pains tonight not to be too partisan , senator charles e schumer , the democrat elected in 1998 , offered in his nomination speech for mrs clinton a hint of the line of attack that he has counseled her to use in the fall with hillary s victory , mr schumer said , we 're going to tell trent lott that he s no longer running the united states senate we 're going to tell trent lott that his dream of a supreme court that overturns roe v wade and an nra that writes all gun legislation is dead , buried , gone with hillary rodham clinton s victory photo hillary rodham clinton arrived at the state democratic party convention in albany last night with judith hope , party chairwoman , and sheldon silver , assembly speaker \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
thirty years ago , kathleen neal cleaver , instantly recognizable by her iconic afro and kneehigh leather boots , was writing to agitate for the black panther party today she is 55 , the afro has given way to a cascade of goldenbrown locks , and ms cleaver is engaged in a rather different writing project she is plumbing her buried past for a book aptly titled memories of love and war unearthing those recollections has taken years it has forced her to recall the murder and incarceration of countless friends it has pushed her to reflect on what happened to many others , including her exhusband , eldridge , the panthers' information minister who became a republican , a mormon and a drug abuser it has compelled ms cleaver to consider her own trajectory the constant surveillance by law enforcement officials , the raising of two children on the lam , the dissolution of the black panthers and then the breakup of her own marriage the story of ms cleaver s memoir not only underscores the difficulty of writing about a life spent literally under the gun it also reveals how tricky it can be for such a central figure to write a personal account of such a contested period of american history does she confirm or defy official panther lore \? does she set the record straight on the unflattering things written about her , most notably in the former panther leader elaine brown s 1993 memoir , a taste of power , in which she and her exhusband are described as destructive elements of the organization \? martin duberman , a historian who has also written memoirs , says the history of a movement written by an outsider is not necesssarily any more reliable than one by a participant the counterassumption tends to be , once a historical account is conscientiously done by a socalled objective observer , it is definitive , mr duberman said there would be a variety of accounts , none of which by itself will be a definitive version of what went on all you have to do is take part in a bridge game and later ask the four people what happened for her part , ms cleaver says she ca n't be bothered with answering other people s accounts of history \( although she does dismiss ms brown s version as unreliable \) it s a memoir , she said recently i'm entitled in fact , i am required to be subjective and emotional and personal she was speaking during a conversation over sushi in midtown manhattan , a few blocks from the new york public library , where she was one of 15 fellows this year at the center for scholars and writers that s not going to be , by definition , historical revealing herself took some getting used to , however once she offered an early manuscript to a writing teacher it does n't really say much about you , she recalls him saying well , she snapped , that s nobody s business she offers a throaty laugh at this exchange now it has taken a long time to be able to pick through threads of memory this book has undergone various incarnations over the last 15 years i wrote agitational material , she said i had no clue that if you tell a story in which you are a participant , you have to write about yourself kathleen neal , who was born in 1945 , spent her earliest years in what she remembers as a sheltered , segregated black community , almost victorian in its conventions , in tuskegee , ala her mother had an advanced degree in mathematics her father taught sociology at tuskegee university before joining the foreign service and taking the family to india and the philippines as a teenager , she attended a desegregated quaker boarding school and enrolled at oberlin college in 1963 but it was n't long before she dropped out , moved to new york city and threw herself into the student nonviolent coordinating committee , then a driving engine of the civil rights movement she was 21 when she met cleaver and through him , the panthers he had just been released from folsom state prison soul on ice , his groundbreaking 1967 prison memoir , was attracting enormous attention because of his confessions of rape they were married within months , on dec 27 , 1967 \( the wedding date which they had forgotten was one of the few useful pieces of information she has culled from the files kept on her by the federal bureau of investigation , she says \) in 1968 , after a shootout with the oakland , calif , police in which another panther was killed and two policemen injured , cleaver fled to algeria a few months later , pregnant with their first child , ms cleaver joined him there , they had a son and a daughter by 1971 , after bitter leadership battles inside the organization , the cleavers split from the panthers today she compares those four years in algeria , then ruled by a military dictatorship , to being shipwrecked it was one of the only times in her life she remembers being depressed i 'd never been marooned , she said the task of raising her children kept her anchored youthful delusions of immortality helped her survive , she says , and probably , too , the contradictory conviction that life could end at any moment you do n't have to maintain your sanity if you think any day , you might get killed , she explained

paris , may 18 if europe is virtually allergic to the genetically modified seeds that are so popular with north american farmers , it got a reason this week to sneeze with fury hundreds of farmers in england , france , germany and sweden are finding that they have unwittingly planted rapeseed oil crops for two years from bags of canadian seed that inadvertently contained a scattering of genetically modified seeds for the plant used to make canola european governments have emphasized that there is no health risk from the oil produced from last year s crop or environmental risk from the plants that are now growing less than 1 percent of one company s seeds had bioengineered genes , meaning that just some individual plants in the millions of acres of rapeseed would be involved but european newspapers are referring to fields as tainted and contaminated , and environmental groups are calling for all the farmers who bought the company s seed to be tracked down and their fields burned before the crops mature and produce pollen that could blow to other plants the seed company , the papers say , should pay for the destroyed crops this may seem extreme to americans , but there are a lot of people in europe who do n't want to eat gm food under any circumstances , said harry hadaway of the soil association of great britain , an organicfarming group the company , advanta of the netherlands , said that it did not intend to import any modified seeds and that it had broken no laws , because none govern the genetic content of seeds advanta says testing for biotech material at concentrations of less than 1 percent is technically difficult and expensive but it has halted all its european sales of one variety of rapeseed and asked european governments to create reasonable standards that it can meet according to a spokesman for the company , kees noome , the problem was found last month , when the german government conducted random checks of seed advanta is not sure what impurity the seeds have , mr noome said , but the company presumes that it is a resistance to weed killer , a trait that is legal and sought after by many american and canadian farmers advanta also presumes that the trait entered some seeds when pollen blew from other fields the pollen , mr noome said , would have to have blown hundreds of meters , because the company would n't buy seeds from a farmer whose direct neighbor grew the crop even nonbiotech seeds , he added , need to be grown as far as feasible from accidental pollination , because farmers buy seeds for particular crossbred traits like disease resistance in britain , the finding occurred at an awkward moment prince charles lectured on the bbc this week on the sacred trust between mankind and our creator and cautioned against the artificial and uncontained transfer of genes between species of plants and animals in the independent newspaper today , a text of his speech was printed near a prominent commentary that accused the prince of denigrating science and suggesting that the strictly organic methods that he uses on his farms in cornwall could produce only enough food to feed a world of four billion people , leaving the remaining two billion to starve
washington , sept 6 prominent republicans around the country , including several who advise gov george w bush , say they are worried that his candidacy has floundered in recent weeks , allowing vice president al gore to build on his velocity from the democratic convention in a way that they never expected while none of these republicans expressed panic and all said that mr bush could reverse the trend , they acknowledged puzzlement , frustration and even some distress about the strides that mr gore has made , a degree of progress that they said went beyond an inevitable tightening in polls there s no doubt about it there s real worry about the general state of things , said william j bennett , the former secretary of education , who has advised mr bush from time to time there s nervousness that was not there before in interviews during the past several days , leading republicans on capitol hill , at state capitals and even at the bush headquarters in austin , tex , raised concerns beyond poll numbers many of them expressed unease about the way mr bush has handled himself , saying that in the last two and a half weeks there had been too many instances when he seemed either defensive , bumbling , weary , detached or peevish and there have been too many missteps , several republicans said for starters , some cited mr bush s refusal to go along with the debate schedule proposed by the bipartisan commission on presidential debates , saying his reluctance had made him look timid and was diverting attention from issues that he would be better off discussing others said mr bush was letting himself get dragged too deep by mr gore into the bogs of a policy debate , where the vice president is at his best still others said that mr bush s choice of dick cheney as a running mate had produced scant excitement on the campaign trail but significant damage in the news media , manifest in weeks of questions about the financial details of mr cheney s retirement package from halliburton , the energy services company he served as chief executive several republican officials said they had serious reservations about the party s tongueincheek tv commercial broadcast last week that challenged mr gore s truthfulness and political consistency representative john r kasich of ohio , chairman of the house budget committee , said the campaign was too preoccupied with trying to make everyone happy and not delivering a clear message the biggest mistake we can make is to try to be all things to all people , he said we have to be very aggressive and not engage in any reticence about our philosophy or our positions ari fleischer , a spokesman for the bush campaign , dismissed the worries about the state of the governor s candidacy , so dominant for most of the year everybody wants to win in a landslide , he said landslides are rare we 've always known and said this was going to be a close race indeed , to some republicans , mr bush began the process of correcting his campaign this week on tuesday , he moved aggressively to neutralize mr gore s advantage on the critical issue of health care by releasing his own plan to give prescription drug benefits to the elderly and mr bush has engaged mr gore much more forcefully in his comments and oratory but republicans said that the combination of mr gore s surge and mr bush s stumbles had made mr gore , for perhaps the first time in the 2000 presidential race , the front runner many said they were unnerved by voter surveys showing that mr gore who for months trailed in the polls had pulled even or ahead of mr bush nationally and in some important states like florida , pennsylvania and missouri , where campaign officials had long predicted victories everybody expected a bounce , but not nearly as much as this , said representative fred upton , a michigan republican , referring to mr gore and , he said , it had significantly altered the mood of republicans in his state , a crucial battleground there is a lot of chatter at the grassroots level about how they 're scared of these new numbers , he said this has shocked the system from what looked like a slam dunk gov tom ridge of pennsylvania , who has campaigned with mr bush in his state for the past three days , said i'm at a loss to explain the rather significant change in the polling numbers while mr ridge said he was confident mr bush would recover , he said , we 've got to go a little bit more on the offensive he added of mr gore , this guy s tough in fact , in the nearly three weeks since the end of the democratic convention , mr gore has been constantly on the offensive first he declared himself the candidate of the little guy and portrayed mr bush and mr cheney as beholden to big oil and drug companies then he relentlessly attacked mr bush over tax policy and health care at the same time , mr gore has managed to use the favorable attention he received during the convention even the much publicized kiss he planted on his wife , tipper , before his acceptance speech to give life and personality to his stiff and uninteresting stereotype a republican official closely involved in the bush campaign said that mr bush s aides had readjusted their expectations for a spate of new polls that are to be released in the next few days
hempstead , ny , nov 3 for chris hayes , this is a dream , a chance after years of the anonymity and bodybeating of special teams to get significant playing time at his true position , safety it s a blessing , hayes said i 've been waiting for years i do n't want to take away from special teams everybody comes into the league to play their rightful position i want to take advantage of my opportunity for jets coach al groh , this a nightmare uncertainty at a critical position pervading preparations for a game against denver the broncos feature the most productive receiving combination in the national football league and , by groh s calculation , are in the top three in the league in total number of explosive plays runs of 16 yards or more and receptions of 40 yards or more the jets have already yielded seven completions of over 40 yards this season this is a bad time to be playing the thirdbest passing offense in the nfl i'm not giving up on progress , groh said of the free safety position we 've been trying to put this together for four years now with no luck groh has not said who will start at free safety against the broncos at giants stadium on sunday , but it does not really matter scott frost , who started last sunday , will rotate with hayes this is the latest incarnation at an unsettled position that is very likely to be even more in the spotlight than usual this weekend , because receivers rod smith and ed mccaffrey each have more than 50 receptions smith s longest catch went for 47 yards and mccaffrey s longest was 61 yards smith leads the league in receptions of more than 40 yards and the broncos have the american conference s highestrated passer in brian griese , who has completed 637 percent of his passes and has a quarterback rating of 1055 the jets have given up nearly one big play a game last week frost and cornerback marcus coleman were the victims when buffalo bills receiver eric moulds ran down the left sideline to catch a 52yard pass late in the game , which moved the bills to the jets' 1yard line hayes said the jets' safeties were in the correct place on all the long passes they have simply failed to make the play on the ball strong safety victor green has said that the repeated changes at free safety have impeded the ability of the players in the secondary to communicate effectively among themselves groh sarcastically rejected that notion , and said it sounded like an excuse for poor play groh said today that none of the long plays given up by the jets had been the result of poor communication the players have attempted to play the coverage as designed , but it just has not turned out well it s always that one or two plays that you have a breakdown on , hayes said i know it s going to be a hard task this week at any given time , i 've seen them both covered and still make plays that is the jets' greatest fear i think we 've given up as many as we did all last year , coleman said of the long gains you do get tired of seeing that we 've got to make a more conscious effort and make sure if it s a corner or safety or nose tackle , make sure we 're deep and stay deep and keep everything in front of us extra points al groh is no sentimentalist when it comes to injuries the hernia surgery for linebacker john abraham on friday elicited a matteroffact reaction from the coach , whose team had escaped serious injury all season i would have been pretty surprised if the season had finished without something of significance happening , groh said it was just who and when
tenafly , nj hagup h asadourian communes with shadows some are dark and frightening , like the shades of turkish soldiers who in 1915 herded him and his family from his armenian village , leaving him to watch his mother and four of his sisters die of typhus in the syrian desert some are sweet , revolving around the raucous armenianlanguage plays put on in the 1920 s at the yiddish theater at madison and 27th street in manhattan and some are poignant , like the reunion with his sister , the only surviving member of his immediate family , 39 years after they lost each other one night near the dead sea as they fled with a ragged band of armenian orphans from syria to jerusalem but his battle to preserve memory , the theme of all his 14 books , cannot save him from the destructive march of time and time , to the rapidly vanishing community of exiled armenians , will soon finish the work that , he says , was begun by the turkish army 85 years ago mr asadourian s latest book , the smoldering generation , is , he said , about the inevitable loss of our culture no one takes the place of those who are gone , he said , seated in front of a picture window that looked out on a carefully groomed garden at his home here your children do not understand you in this country you cannot blame them as he spoke , his son , john , who has used a wheelchair since a stroke , jerked himself into position behind his father he listened , his head cocked slightly to one side , with a grimace the death of more than one million armenians in turkey is often cited as the opening act for the genocidal campaigns that convulsed the 20th century although the allied powers condemned the turks during world war i , there was no effort to hold them accountable for actions against the armenians after the dissolution of the ottoman empire the magnitude of the deaths and ultimate indifference may have led hitler , on the eve of the invasion of poland , to remind his followers , who still speaks of the extermination of the armenians \? the ottoman turks , who feared a nationalist revolt like the one that had convulsed the balkans , spent six months in 1915 driving most of the two million armenians out of turkey in what armenians call genocide , at least a million were forced to march in pathetic columns into the deserts of what are now syria and iraq , where several hundred thousand were slaughtered or left to die of starvation and disease by 1923 , armenia says , 15 million were dead and orphanages throughout the middle east were flooded with some 200 , 000 destitute armenian children the turkish government still vigorously denies the event it says that some of the armenians killed were rebels during world war i and others were victims of the fighting and the widespread famine the turks say they escorted armenians away from the fighting for their own safety they concede that , because of the war , some unfortunate incidents took place , but say that during this time fewer than half a million armenians died along with two million turks much of the world of the armenians , first mentioned by the greeks and persians in 6 bc , has been reduced to dusty , forgotten relics in presentday turkey officially , the republic of armenia has a population of about 34 million , but the poor economy , the recent earthquake and the ethnic conflict that is continuing between azerbaijan and armenia in nagornokarabakh have caused at least a third of the population to leave in the last decade , armenian scholars say after world war i , about 25 , 000 armenians came to the united states some of their tales survive in small american collections of armenian literature and poetry , like the 15 , 000 volumes in the zohrab center at 630 second avenue in manhattan but these books lie unread by all but a few scholars little of the work has been translated zarmine boghosian , the principal of the holy martyrs armenian day school in queens , said she , like most who speak armenian , failed in her effort to bring the literature to her children and though she gives her 100 elementary schoolchildren daily lessons in armenian , she concedes that as they go on in school the language is swiftly forgotten when the sons of an armenian school principal can no longer grasp an armenian work from the bookshelf and read it , she said , it means that we can no longer dream of maintaining this literature the loss is not only literary , but severs armenians from the perspective of their parents and grandparents being armenian , for many , is little more than a label we are losing our multigenerational thread , said aris sevag , the managing editor of the englishlanguage armenian reporter , a weekly newspaper published in queens we are losing our ability to understand the armenian gestalt , our inner world yet even as the armenian language disappears , american scholars have been turning their attention to armenian history peter balakian , a professor of english at colgate university , said that in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s , the rising awareness of human rights brought more attention to the armenian diaspora the armenian genocide is perhaps the hottest discourse in the genocide studies arena and is being taught nationwide in high schools and universities , said dr balakian , who is of armenian descent
suddenly i had walked into what is still , five years later , a recurring dream i was back in department 103 of the los angeles county superior court judge lance ito was once more on the bench , sitting solemnly behind his collection of hourglasses marcia clark , in her prechic incarnation , had returned to the table where the prosecutors always congregated christopher darden was once more peering into the jury box he is a murderer he was also one hell of a football player but he is still a murderer , he was saying as the defense lawyers behind him looked laboriously indifferent the defendant himself was looking away , toward the wall , as he always did when anything unpleasant was going on say , when pictures of his bloodied wife or her equally bloodsoaked friend , ron goldman , were on display cut ! the director , lawrence schiller , suddenly shouted from the back of the courtroom the spell was broken we were jolted into real time it was august 2000 , not september 1995 we were not in los angeles but in north hollywood , not in a real courthouse but in a converted warehouse , not in judge ito s realm but in a meticulous replica this judge ito was a doppelganger named clyde kusatsu this darden was an actor named ruben santiagohudson to paraphrase marx , the trial of o j simpson was repeating itself , first as farce , second as american tragedy that s what mr schiller called his bestselling , behindthescenes look at the simpson defense , published in 1996 , and that s what he s calling his fourhour miniseries , which stars ving rhames as johnnie cochran , ron silver \( robert shapiro \) , christopher plummer \( f lee bailey \) and bruno kirby \( barry scheck \) the first half will be broadcast tonight on cbs the concluding segment will be shown on wednesday the simpson saga is one of those assignments , like wars or epic election campaigns , that no reporter ever forgets for those of us who covered it , as i did for the new york times , it claimed a year of our lives a year of endlessly surreal events , backbreaking deadlines , intense bonding and total immersion in the bizarre demimonde of southern california celebrity , at once unspeakably trivial and the very center of the universe as a journalistic experience , it was fascinating and frustrating hard to top and , as i have since learned , equally hard to escape i am still haunted by the stories i missed i am still asked the same question whenever my connection to the case comes up , always in a conspiratorial whisper , always as if i 've never heard it before so , was he guilty \? in august , mr schiller gave me a chance to relive the experience , both by inviting me to watch him make american tragedy and by giving me a couple of lines in it for mr schiller author most recently of perfect murder , perfect town , an examination of the jonbenet ramsey case american tragedy the movie is but the latest stage in his complex relationship with mr simpson first , in early 1995 , he put together i want to tell you , mr simpson s bestselling , selfserving book of prison ruminations , which almost singlehandedly kept the defendant financially afloat and thereby able to afford his highpriced laywers then , ostensibly as a technical adviser to the defense , mr schiller was a constant , conspicuous presence in court , dispensing gossip and mm s to his favored reporters then , after discovering that no one wanted the trial book mr simpson had asked him to write , he began american tragedy , which was based largely on his friendship with mr simpson s pal robert kardashian unhappy that his private affairs were being bruited about , mr simpson tried to block publication of the book and when the movie began filming , he went to court to stop it , claiming it was based on privileged conversations with his lawyers ten days ago , a los angeles court threw out his case , a fact brandished before each installment of the miniseries like the good housekeeping seal of approval mr schiller believes the public is ready for another go at the simpson case , but with a few provisos one is that american tragedy is not a courtroom drama original footage of some witnesses , like detective mark fuhrman , is interspersed quite seamlessly with the new material , along with news reports from fred graham , terry moran , dan abrams and other stalwarts of the o j press corps but most of the action takes place where the cameras and microphones never reached during sidebars or in the judge s chambers or in the lawyers' homes , conference rooms , cars or favorite fancy restaurants similarly , the drama focuses on the defense lawyers themselves , as they schmooze , strategize and deceive either the court , the prosecution , the jurors or , most entertainingly , one another the best parts of american tragedy consist of all the wonderful behindthescenes bitchery , as mr plummer put it , that plagued the socalled dream team officially , the movie is about people v orenthal james simpson , but it s also about cochran v shapiro , shapiro v bailey and cochran v bailey
st petersburg , russia , feb 15 nine years ago a sea of russians celebrating the collapse of a communistbacked coup jammed the traffic circle outside kgb headquarters in moscow and stripped away icons of dictatorship , including a bust and plaque honoring the late spymaster and soviet ruler , yuri v andropov on dec 20 , in a littlenoticed ceremony at entrance 1a of the old headquarters , workers put them back on the personal order of prime minister vladimir v putin to westerners , it seemed a curious tribute a gesture of respect from a selfproclaimed democratic reformer to a chief of an infamous machine of repression now that mr putin is acting president and the runaway favorite to win a full term in presidential elections next month , it is a bit unsettling , too but in a country that believes in a strong hand at the tiller , there was logic to the affinity mr andropov was not simply a shadowy terror chief propping up a disintegrating totalitarian state he was also a leader who recognized that the system had to be reformed not to make it democratic and western , but to make it great and powerful he began with draconian discipline in the streets and a crackdown on vodka after half a year as prime minister and a month as acting president , mr putin his ambitions , his methods , his intentions remains largely unknown but what is known his career in the kgb , his tough suppression of chechnya , his statements , his ascetic habits point in many ways to an updated version of the andropov model he may have little use for mr andropov s soviet system , and a greater appreciation for law and order and the value and efficiency of westernstyle business but he has shown himself a man every bit as intolerant of russia s disarray , and as determined to do something about it why did the soviet union break up \? he asked in a december interview , then answered himself because things were allowed to happen laxness and if we continue like this , russia will fall to pieces , and it will happen so quickly you and i cannot even imagine then there will be a real tragedy , much bigger than we are seeing today in the north caucasus , much bigger , he said you can imagine what will follow if we see the russian federation fall apart , a nuclear power we do not have the right to be lax we do not have the right the unanswered question is what he intends to do about it mr putin advertises himself as a democrat he says that a free press is an essential deterrent to tyranny that russia s only dictatorship should be a dictatorship of laws , that russia is committed to fundamental political rights and human liberties but his six months in the kremlin present a far muddier picture in prosecuting the war in chechnya , mr putin has proved not just indifferent but belligerent toward international criticism of russian behavior there his aides have used both financial and police levers to cow critics of that war in the press , even fingering some skeptical reporters as potential collaborators with the enemy apparently for the purpose of skewering mr putin s potential rival , former prime minister yevgeny primakov , deputies aligned with mr putin struck a powersharing deal with the communist party in parliament , shunning democratic forces the acting president has talked of fiscal , legal and social reforms , but his presidential agenda remains vague what he has offered are gestures like mandatory military education in schools which hint at a streak of nationalism and a bent for strong , centralized rule mr putin clearly has an intellectual grasp of democracy and of what he has called the historic futility of communism he is a veteran of an intelligence service in which , as an agent in east germany in the 1980 s , he could witness the reality of socialist economics and soviet rule but his defining characteristics seem to be a passion for order and a desire to see russia rise from the ashes matthew h murray , a former united states senate aide who has worked with investors here for the last decade , frequently negotiated with mr putin when he worked with foreign businesses mr murray called mr putin very tough , mentally swift , immaculately prepared and ingenious at navigating russia s labyrinthine bureaucracy he s a 'khozayin , ' a tough taskmaster , mr murray said he knows how the pieces of this society fit together he knows how to take care of people and he knows how to get results there s a great potential on the part of the west to misinterpret putin , mr murray added you should n't mistake a lack of an economic worldview for a lack of economic purpose he has a purpose to get russia back on its feet igor antonov , a retired kgb officer who says he has worked with mr putin , and carries a tattered snapshot which appears to prove it , agreed in a long conversation this week that mr putin and mr andropov shared some traits but westerners seeking a clue to mr putin s style of leadership , he said , might look to a more familiar ruler , an ironfisted democrat and abrasive nationalist of the 1950 s and 60 s to me , vladimir vladimirovich is most like de gaulle , mr antonov said i do n't know if that s good or bad but in my opinion , he is close to this
david brower , an uncompromising environmentalist who spent more than half a century fighting to protect america s wilderness areas against speculators , developers , state agencies and the federal government , died on sunday at his home in berkeley , calif he was 88 mr brower was widely regarded one of the most articulate and powerful conservationists of the 20th century , and at various times led a number of environmental groups , including the sierra club and friends of the earth long an opponent of compromise in the face of efforts to tame wild lands , he was a primary force during the 1960 s in preventing the construction of two major government dams in the grand canyon he also played a pivotal role in blocking a dam , proposed for the green river in utah , that would have flooded parts of dinosaur national monument over the years he also fought , sometimes alone , to maintain the wilderness of the northern cascades in oregon and washington , point reyes and kings canyon in california , the great smoky mountains in tennessee and north carolina , the red river gorge in kentucky , the allagash wilderness in maine and the everglades in florida he sought to protect redwoods from loggers , animals from furriers , porpoises from tuna fishermen and the public from nuclear energy and any number of projects proposed by the army corps of engineers and the federal bureau of reclamation mr brower \( the name rhymes with hour \) also spoke against the indiscriminate use of herbicides and pesticides you are villains not to share your apples with worms , he would tell his audiences bite the worms they wo n't hurt nearly as much as the insecticide does mr brower s life seemed to be a perpetual joust against what he found to be the careless use of land for commercial purposes we 're not blindly opposed to progress , he said , we 're opposed to blind progress in a book about mr brower , encounters with the archdruid \( farrar , straus giroux , 1971 \) , john mcphee likened him to a circuitriding preacher on environmentalism , who referred to his standard conservation talk as the sermon brower , mr mcphee wrote , has computed that we are driving through the earth s resources at a rate comparable to a man s driving an automobile a hundred and twentyeight miles per hour and he says that we are accelerating he reminds his audiences that buffalo were shot for their tongues alone , and he says that we still have a buffalotongue economy 'we 're hooked on growth we 're addicted to it in my lifetime , man has used more resources than in all previous history' if mr brower was a druid , he was an angry one he seemed to maintain a level of indignation that would have burned out a lesser man i wish we did n't have to be angry all the time , he said but someone has to get angry russell train , who in the early 1970 s was administrator of the environmental protection agency , once observed thank god for david brower he makes it so easy for the rest of us to be reasonable in 1952 , mr brower became executive director of the sierra club , the conservation organization founded in 1892 by the naturalist john muir it had a membership of 7 , 000 and an annual budget of 75 , 000 when mr brower started by 1969 , when he stepped down under pressure by members who thought he had gone too far too fast , it had 77 , 000 members and assets of 3 million , and had probably blocked or delayed construction of at least 7 billion because of its opposition to the two proposed dams in the grand canyon , the sierra club lost its taxexempt status in 1966 , on the ground that it had become much a political organization mr brower later told the membership that it owed thanks to sheldon cohen , the commissioner of internal revenue , because his ruling had attracted new , militant members who did not care whether joining gave them a tax advantage even as it moved from the gentility of muir s time to the militancy of mr brower , the sierra club attracted favorable notice from more traditional conservationists with its handsomely illustrated books , which argued the cause of nature with photographs the books were mr brower s idea , and among those for which he was editor and publisher were summer island penobscot country time and the river flowing , which described the grand canyon and gentle wilderness the sierra nevada but the sierra club s militancy continued to irritate some members , none more so than the photographer ansel adams , who described mr brower s followers as almost inquisitorial toward those accused of despoiling the environment some in the club , for instance , were open to proposals for the construction of the diablo canyon nuclear reactor in california mr brower despised the project , which was ultimately built at 17 times the cost originally estimated and began operating in 1985 , fully 13 years behind schedule in 1969 , after the defeat of a slate of candidates for sierra club positions who were friendly to him , mr brower resigned as executive director and founded two new groups friends of the earth and the john muir institute for environmental studies
los angeles , sept 23 as the second round of senate hearings approaches on wednesday over a federal trade commission report critical of the way some rrated movies have been marketed to children , the hollywood studios are in the throes of deciding what exactly they are going to say and how the movie industry can repair any damage that the report might have caused eight highranking executives from eight companies will testify and answer questions , said jack valenti , president of the motion picture association of america , which represents most of the major movie studios in washington and administers the 32yearold movie ratings system in addition , the mpaa is working to develop initiatives that each of our member companies can sign on to , and we are in the last stages of putting that together i am pleased that what i think we are going to present will be responsive and show that we care about doing what is right none of the studios was interested in saying , on the record , what they intended to tell the senators on wednesday frankly , we have been told by every political consultant in the business that it would be political suicide for us to do so , said one studio official plus , it would be rude but several officials were willing to speculate on what types of proposals the industry would probably put forward in an effort to convince the senators and parents that they were serious about addressing the issue many said that the new proposals would probably be similar in tone and thrust to guidelines announced on sept 12 by the walt disney company at that time , disney promised that it would , among other things , include more information for parents in its advertising , previews and world wide web sites about why individual films received their ratings , refrain from testing rrated films on anyone under 17 , prohibit theaters from showing previews for rrated films before any film bearing the disney banner \( all of which are rated either g or pg \) and establish a regular internal review process to make sure that the new guidelines are followed we are in the last stages of putting together our list and will probably finish it up on monday or tuesday , certainly in time to present it to the senate committee on wednesday , mr valenti said the main thrusts of the industry s response are expected to be selfpolicing and finding ways to help parents by giving them more information about the content of movies whatever the studio executives end up saying , the session will be in high contrast to the first round of hearings , on sept 13 , when mr valenti alone represented hollywood and not a single top studio executive appeared , much to the consternation of senator john mccain , republican of arizona , the commerce committee chairman , and others on the panel this time , hollywood will be there in force the ftc report , released on sept 11 , caught many in hollywood by surprise the report cited instances in which it said some of the studios , unnamed in the report , had specifically aimed their marketing campaigns for some rrated films to entice children under 17 the commission also found instances in which even younger children were used to testmarket films that eventually earned an r rating an r rating means children under 17 must be accompanied by an adult to attend when the senate held hearings two days after the report s release and none of the studios sent representatives , saying that their executives were unavailable or had not been officially invited it turned into a political pileon and a hot issue in the presidential race vice president al gore , whose campaign has received millions of dollars from the entertainment industry , said that if he were elected he would give the industry six months to clean up its act before considering some sort of government regulation last week , however , at a fundraiser in beverly hills , calif , the vice president took a more conciliatory tone , saying that his administration would never be interested in playing the role of censor this has been seized upon by many republicans as evidence that the democrats are hypocritical , beholden to hollywood donors and unlikely to put muscle behind their threats
martina hingis sprayed her trademark winners around the grandstand court yesterday , played her sharp angles , and quietly moved on to the quarterfinals of the united states open , a sly cat under a white baseball cap the resumption of her sunday night match with france s sandrine testud was as brief as a sun shower , finishing , 62 , 61 , and sending hingis into a fastemptying interview room as the followup act to serena williams it s more pressure on them , hingis said of the fascination with everyone named williams these days inside the national tennis center they have to do well and make the results for me , it s never been the talk not entirely true , as hingis has had her share of oral food fights with the family williams , in addition to those intemperate , homophobicsounding remarks she made regarding amelie mauresmo a couple of winters ago at the australian open well , hingis was only 18 at the time , riding impossibly high with her fifth and last grand slam singles title now , her sorority crowded with contemporaries who dwarf her 5foot7inch frame , her 20th birthday only 25 days away , she somehow seems undeterred by the calamity of less attention better yet , she began this tournament by stating for the record that she would under no circumstances do anything potentially harmful to get it i do n't want to die when i'm 30 , she said when asked if she had considered using creatine and other supplements in an effort to become stronger , more williamsready i'm scared of that stuff my life is too nice right now these remarks , augmented by her stated desire to remain fast and lean , were reported , and pretty much forgotten within one 24hour news cycle they were n't angry , like the ravings of damir dokic , banished father of jelena they were n't as provocative as that kneejerk gender commentary from the mouth of john mcenroe hingis s quotes just needed to be written in stone and presented like a mantra to all young athletes in our enhancementcrazed culture it was a real positive because what she was saying is that she needs to focus on her own strength , her speed and cunning , and not try to become something she s not , said dr brian hainline , the tournament physician and the coauthor of the 1989 book drugs and the athlete what i would hope for is that young people could really hear what she s saying and that message could take off because the bigger question of whether creatine is harmful or helpful , or if androstenedione made a difference in mark mcgwire hitting home runs , is why pharmacology has become an integral part of what young athletes believe is needed to win if ever there has been a candidate to succumb to the sad notion of the body as an experimental tool , it is hingis , who ruled the tour before lindsay davenport harnessed her power ground strokes before , as serena williams said yesterday , venus and i lifted the bar hingis is too pure a player to ever overlook the computer still acknowledges her as no 1 but the buzz is clearly not around her anymore mcenroe and donald trump wo n't be challenging her to a battle of the sexes anytime soon vain , probably , hingis said the other day on the subject of mcenroe and his claim that any college male or senior player \( read himself \) could handle either williams jealous , too , like the neglected jock whose last cry for attention is , inevitably , let s arm wrestle what was mcenroe s point \? there was none , other than to apparently remind us that the men may be boring , but they 're bigger twist the logic and the implication is that men are better , the more enhanced sex i do n't think it s necessary to say things like this , hingis said i mean , i'm playing on the women s tour the men are not her problem , not even when her new boyfriend s got problems while magnus norman struggled in his fiveset comeback against max mirnyi sunday night , hingis said she grew exasperated by the length of her wait to get on the same court against testud at fourall , i had no more feelings , she said i was like , 'come on , get it over' norman survived , and hingis and testud eventually played a set and a game before the rain sent them inside for the night hingis awoke yesterday at 9 , hit a few practice balls , finished off testud and began thinking about monica seles , next up in the quarters she 'll have to deal with the williamses later this week and for the next several years her promise to do it with what comes natural is a powerful message , a winner on all courts photo martina hingis \( vincent laforet \)
strange victory hitler s conquest of france by ernest r may illustrated 594 pages hill and wang 30 it does n't take a great historian to realize that if france and britain had been able to hold germany to a stalemate or , even better , to defeat it in 1940 , the world would have been immensely different as it was , the german blitzkrieg on france in may 1940 led to a french surrender in about six weeks after that , hitler began his bombing campaign against britain , sent his panzer divisions into the soviet union , took control of greece , the balkans , hungary and romania , and began the systematic extermination of jews , none of which would very likely have occurred had he been stopped in france in strange victory , the historian ernest r may presents a broadshouldered , cogent , powerfully argued revisionist study of the battle of france of 1940 , in which he strips the nazis' stunning victory of its retroactive veneer of inevitability mr may examines the war from several different vantage points the process of decisionmaking in germany , france and england , the nature of intelligencegathering , the state of military preparedness to show that the german triumph of 1940 was a far closer thing than most have tended to believe his extremely interesting and important conclusion , moreover , is that the defeat in france did not result from the reason most conventionally given , that is , a german military invincibility combined with a a moral rottenness and pervasive defeatist despair among the french france capitulated in 1940 because its armies were defeated in battle , mr may writes in his concluding chapter this capitulation has commonly been interpreted as the last gasps by a nation already doomed , but in fact , mr may contends , there was nothing inevitable or foreordained about the german victory absent defeats in battle in may 1940 , france was in no more danger of moral collapse than britain , it seems to me , and in less danger than germany mr may , who is the author of nearly a dozen books and has taught american diplomatic history at harvard for decades , supports this conclusion with a detailed and meticulous examination of the three main parties to the events of 1940 , germany , france and england his arguments are not immediately convincing weakest of all is his effort to refute the notion that france was defeated partly because its leadership was bad mr may s intimate portraits of such leaders as prime minister edouard daladier and his chief political rival , paul reynaud , show them to be perhaps more capable than postwar images would allow but sorely lacking in the powerful assertiveness and bold leadership that , sad to say , hitler possessed in abundance still , in a big book crammed with facts , mr may combines diplomatic and military history in a critical inquiry of great breadth and understanding among the most probing of his recapitulations is his portrayal of decisionmaking in germany compared with that of france and britain , a comparison in which the tyrant hitler got better results than daladier or prime minster neville chamberlain of britain mr may shows almost week to week how the german military plan evolved during the winter of 1939 and the spring of 1940 as hitler s demand for a frontal assault on france was slowly modified by germany s more cautious generals indeed , to read mr may s account of the development of plan yellow , germany s war strategy for france , is to be struck by the way history unfolds through a combination of will and accident hitler wanted to attack france in the winter of 1939 and , had germany done so then , it would have sent its main forces through belgium , where they would have met the best troops and equipment france and britain possessed the worst likely result of this from the allied point of view , mr may argues , would have been a battlefield stalemate at best it would have been a crushing defeat for germany and , as a consequence , an implosion of the nazi regime but weather delayed the attack initially planned and gave germany s high command an opportunity to revise it , so that what eventually occurred was a feint in belgium and a massive attack through the ardennes that took the french completely by surprise the surprise , moreover , was fully intended by germany s military planners , who , mr may contends , were simply better than their french and british counterparts mr may singles out a single german intelligence officer , ulrich liss , as the genius behind that fateful modification liss stood in for the allied commanders as the german general staff played out various invasion plans in a series of war games in late 1939 and early 1940 liss assumed that the allies would rush their best forces into belgium that they would place weak forces to guard the ardennes approaches and , most important , that they would be fatally slow to redirect their forces to counter the main german attack he was right in all three assumptions , as the allies failed to make good use of the extremely good intelligence available to them the signs , for example , that germany was massing troops for an assault through the ardennes were abundant and distinct , mr may writes it is simply astonishing that allied leaders continued to discount such a contingency and made relatively few preparations for it mr may gives a blowbyblow account of the invasion , showing , among other things , that , even given the surprise , the allies could have turned the attack aside their equipment and their men , contrary to the common assumption , were at least as good as and probably better than germany s had they deployed their best forces against the german panzer divisions pouring into eastern france , they might well have turned the germany victory into a defeat the suffering that resulted from their failure to do so is incalculable , staggering , as is the very thought that , had the british and the french been more imaginative , hitler might have been stopped five years and millions of lives earlier but that is what the best historical writing does it confronts the reader with staggering possibilities mr may s book is a brilliant and essential contribution to the store of knowledge and wisdom photo ernest r may \( martha stewart hill and wang \)
in an age when almost anything can be bought online , one of the main exceptions has been commercial real estate with its complicated procedures and timeconsuming negotiating process , the industry has only slowly adapted to the lightningquick demands of ecommerce ecommerce is so fast , said julie benezet , the director of global real estate for amazoncom it is so unlike real estate , which lumbers along like a mastodon that is changing , but the shape it will take is still far from clear there is no one in our industry who is not struggling with ebusiness , said frank a robinson , a vice president of corporate real estate at mckesson hboc , a healthcaresupply management company that oversees 20 million square feet of space it is going to change the way we do real estate processes , and the ones who do n't get it right are going to be roadkill some real estate executives are already using businesstobusiness services in their daily operations we are using ecommerce to do things more quickly and with fewer people , said scott leibold , a real estate manager at att for example , we can use the system to reserve a conference room and order the food that will be served during the conference at the same time but many executives say the big savings may come from changing the way transactions are conducted , especially sales and leases that will mean changes in how brokers operate and are paid until recently , a big part of brokers' stock in trade was their knowledge of the market brokers are in the market every day , while their clients get involved only when their needs change brokers know what properties have been sold or leased they know how much money has changed hands and they know the terms and conditions of the deals in tight markets , they know which spaces are likely to come on the market in down markets , they know which landlords are willing to make financial concessions to lease space but that information is becoming more accessible to anyone willing to pay a price two national service companies , costar and realtyiq , collect information on property and transactions and make it available to online subscribers for a fee as a result , the value of market knowledge is suddenly much lower any business that is based on knowing things that others do not will be out of business , said joseph rubin , a partner in the real estate practice of ernst young , the accountants brokers are also expensive the standard fee for an office transaction in new york is onethird of the first year s base rent , paid by the landlord in a deal for 10 , 000 square feet at 50 a square foot a year , the broker s fee would be more than 160 , 000 , with commissions often split among several brokers top brokerage executives acknowledge that there may be some erosion of their business , particularly in small office spaces i do n't think anyone is going to sign a lease for 100 , 000 square feet of office space without a real estate professional advising them , said stephen b siegel , the president of insignia esg , a national brokerage and real estate services company but there may be a part of the market , maybe up to 10 , 000 or 15 , 000 square feet , that could become a commodity and trade on the internet barry gosin , chief executive of newmark company real estate , in new york , agreed you might see some small leases done electronically in a tight market , he said it might be useful for small tenants who cannot get the attention of a broker but in larger transactions , he said , brokers advise clients , analyzing the terms of leases as well as their financial and tax implications nevertheless , at least one company is trying to circumvent brokers by using the internet , offering a big cut in commissions as a lure the company , tenantwisecom , in new york , offers to negotiate leases online at www tenantwise com , charging only 20 percent of the standard brokerage commission m myers mermel , the president and cofounder , compares the venture to online stock trading he calls it the schwab or e trade of real estate on the site , which has been active only a few weeks , landlords can post property at no charge prospective tenants can send email messages to tenantwise to schedule visits to the buildings tenantwise employees , working with information submitted online , will help prospective tenants make offers to landlords mr mermel says he has submitted offers to landlords for 20 clients , mostly for spaces under 10 , 000 square feet none of the deals have been concluded , he said the site is currently limited to new york , but hopes to go national next year
rik smits will be anxiously awaiting the pregame decision tomorrow night on patrick ewing smits , the indiana pacers' center , has great respect for ewing , knows he is one of the finest centers of his generation , that he will one day be in the hall of fame smits also knows that the knicks are a much less predictable team when ewing is cheering from the bench in street clothes their athleticism comes to the fore , more players get involved and they are quite successful against the pacers , having won five of six playoff games over the last two years so smits hopes the tendinitis in ewing s right foot , which has kept him out of the last two games , loosens up he would like to see the knicks great in uniform for game 5 if you look at the percentages with or without him , i guess i hope he comes back , smits said smits , who stated last week his preference for facing ewing rather than kurt thomas and chris dudley , was asked if the knicks are better against the pacers without ewing it sure seems that way , does n't it \? he said all the guys individually really step up their game they play with a lot of intensity that s the sign of a good team none of the other pacers were willing to add fuel to smits s fire after last night s 9189 loss at madison square garden evened the eastern conference finals at two games apiece but one by one , they spoke of how the knicks present more matchup problems for the pacers when ewing is not involved jalen rose , who was outscored by allan houston , 113 , in the first half , even said he sensed more assuredness on the part of the knicks when playing without their big man i just think they 're more confident , rose said they get more touches , and it s a different look it s not really a look that you can prepare for because they pretty much open it up jeff van gundy s doing a good job of putting in different plays every game that enable them to get the ball in the lane or to get the ball to people in positions where they like to score the pacers say that when ewing is not in uniform , houston and latrell sprewell react like birds released from a cage without ewing demanding the ball on the post , the knicks' perimeter duo , salivating at the sight of the open lane , beats the pacers' players off the dribble and slashes to the basket that forces other pacers to help , which frees up other knicks on the perimeter that was a major reason the knicks made 10 of 14 3pointers , and why larry johnson , in particular , was able to crush dale davis in the power forward matchup johnson made all five of his 3point attempts and also scored on several short and midrange jump shots the pacers know they do not have strong oneonone defenders , so their chances of stopping the knicks from driving are minuscule mark jackson will not stop charlie ward or chris childs from going to the basket reggie miller is not going to hold houston , and apparently rose cannot keep sprewell from driving , even with sprewell s injured foot we do n't really have a lot of athletic guys , travis best admitted and they 're a quicker team and they 're getting out in transition , and guys are taking it upon themselves to go to the hole strong they 've been isolating us , and we have n't been able to defend that they 've been taking us oneonone , whether it s l j , spree or allan that analysis also accounts for why the knicks outrebounded the pacers by 4132 last night for the first time in the series when the pacers' big men are forced to move in and help their perimeter teammates on defense , they are taken out of rebounding position , which allows the knicks to slide in and grab boards witness johnson s seven rebounds and the six apiece by houston and ward those numbers did not result from them leaping over pacers they resulted from indiana s players being out of position ward has pretty much outplayed jackson and best combined the past two games after scoring zero points in game 2 , he posted 14 points and 9 assists in game 3 and 16 points and 7 assists last night best said ward s aggressiveness , perhaps another byproduct of the freedom granted by ewing s absence , has surprised him i know he s a solid point guard and i know he s athletic , best said i think this is the most aggressive i 've seen him jackson seems tickled by the talk of the knicks benefiting from the loss of ewing , his good friend , and he mocks those who think they are better off without him if you guys think they 're better without patrick , then leave him home , he said we look forward to not seeing him on wednesday speak for yourself , smits says
what separates playwrights from novelists , poets and artists \? chilton ryan , the president of the theater artists workshop of westport , says it is collaboration a sculptor can just go into a room and work alone , said mr ryan , who lives in wilton a playwright eventually needs actors our workshop is a gymnasium where playwrights can work out doug scott , a member of the workshop since 1984 , described the group as a great big sandbox to play in , and said , it s absolutely the best thing a writer can be involved with during the last 17 years , connecticut has seen lots of playwrights' sandboxes come and go , but none have persisted like the theater artists workshop of westport though the annual national playwrights conference , at the eugene o'neill center theater in waterford , is better known , it is conveneed only during the summer the theater artists workshop , on the other hand , has met nearly every week since valentine s day 1983 its playwrights have the chance to try out new material with the help of professional actors and directors at no risk , mr ryan said david wiltse came in one day with 20 pages just to hear if he wanted to continue with it , he said he liked what he heard and it became 'doubles , ' which went on to become a broadway hit theater artists workshop of westport was formed by a handful of professionals keir dullea , susie fuller , sandy dennis , morton dacosta , jerome kilty , burry fredrik , patricia englund and haila stoddard among them they wanted to create a workshop where they could sharpen their skills between plays and movies the workshop has persevered in spite of a steady change of membership as well as an unwelcome change of venue a few years ago the workshop now consists of more than 100 theater professionals , mr ryan said we have about 15 to 20 writers , about 20 directors and the rest are mostly actors , he said some of our actors have turned out to be good writers too danny magee , whose play paddywhack was produced at long wharf theater six years ago before going off broadway , said he enjoyed the selfcontained nature of the workshop all of the performers are drawn from within the workshop , he said a writer can arrange with particular actors to work on their script at any time , it being up to the participants to arrange when and how they get there every member has access to the premises 24 hours a day , so rehearsals can be done when it suits everyone involved on other occasions , mr magee said , actors come at a moment s notice to do something in fact , one of the members introduced the idea of the word of the week , where a word is designated and anyone who wishes can write a brief script using that particular word in any way they choose , he said the following week actors are chosen or volunteer to perform the piece the element of short notice in this exercise is both deliberate and productive the workshop is organized yet casual , mr ryan said there s no guru , nobody telling anybody else what they must do , he said if a playwright wants to hear a new scene , or an actor wants to try a scene , they book the slot mr magee said that he learned more about his work when it was read by professional actors i find real value in watching actors doing things , which they are doing for their own actor reasons , which points out weaknesses or strengths in the scripts they are using , he said so , although the particular piece of work is not being done with my requirements in mind , it can still be informative and useful to me as a writer an open critique follows each scene , unless members say they are just stretching their theatrical legs , mr magee said it also happens that a writer feels they 'd like their work to be given a limited airing in front of the public , he said on these occasions , there is a reading given on a friday evening , which is open to anyone while the criticism is supposed to constructive , the feedback sessions can grow tense the urge to tell a playwright how best to revise his or her work is sometimes irresistible i will sometimes lose sleep trying to figure out how i will rewrite someone else s play , mr scott said william f brown , the librettist of the wiz , said that sometimes a playwright s head can spin from the suggestions you really have to know how to take the feedback , he said i 'd tape it then i 'd pick the things i thought would help besides the fellowship and feedback , playwrights benefit from the connections found within the workshop because so many accomplished professionals have been involved with the workshop , playwrights often have access to productions that outsiders miss 'doubles' is the only play from the workshop to be produced on broadway , ' mr ryan said many other plays have been done in regional theater , though after the workshop , another of mr wiltse s plays , triangles for two , recently had its premiere at westport country playhouse mr scott s play about justice william o douglas , mountain , had its premiere at lucille lortel s white barn theater in westport in 1984 before eventually moving to the lortel theater off broadway mr magee said that his latest play , the prodigal , was given a staged reading at the festival of irish arts and letters at fairfield university s quick center for the arts as a direct result of the workshop the event was thanks largely to june walkerrogers , a talented director who took an interest in my work through the workshop , said mr magee , adding that the prodigal is scheduled for production next year in london , with the possibility of a transfer to the united states while the playwrights of the theater artists workshop cannot always count on having their work produced in topflight theaters , they can rely on the weekly collaboration with other professionals it s so much better than writing in a garret , mr scott said would that every theater had one admission to the westport artists workshop is by audition , script submission or by a substantial body of recognized professional work the number to call for more information is \( 203 \) 8546812 photos richard hall and tess link at the theater artists

timing , as they say , is everything this was supposed to be a jubilee year for firestone one hundred years ago , on aug 3 , 1900 , to be exact , harvey s firestone established the firestone tire and rubber company , and firestone was planning to celebrate that fact , in a big way press kits went out to the media , pointofpurchase displays to dealers a special web site , www firestone100com , made its debut in march , full of tales of past firestone glories , as well as a catalog of firestonerelated merchandise and , of course , there was the inevitable price promotion , offering tires that would normally sell for more than 40 each at the cutrate price of four for 100 one hundred dollars , one hundred years get it \? then it all came crashing down firestone tires have been implicated in 62 deaths and countless injuries now firestone s ad campaign is revolving around notices in 41 newspapers , detailing the mechanics of a huge tire recall so , is firestone s 100thanniversary celebration dead in the water \? should it be \? a few isolated birthdaytheme ads were cropping up on local television stations last week , and a few dealers were still advertising the fourfor 100 promotion in newspapers whether they were stubbornly supporting firestone , or whether the ads had been scheduled too far in advance to pull , was hard to determine throughout this week , bridgestone firestone reacted to questions about the centennial celebration as though it were an irs investigation it refused to make marketing people available for interviews , and its public relations people refused to discuss whether the anniversary celebrations remained anywhere on the burner , let alone the front or back advertising executives who represent firestone refused to answer questions , even if they had nothing to do with the recall even cullen o'brien , an account executive with laughlin constable inc , which designed firestone s 100thanniversary web page months ago and thus , could not possibly be accused of insensitivity in terms of spreading anniversary cheer in light of a giant recall responded to a reporter s questions with a terse call bridgestone firestone i will conclude this conversation right now but one thing is certain there is certainly no allout anniversary ad blitz and marketing professors and crisis management experts are having a lively debate over whether the company is right to downplay its birthday now in one corner stand those who say that anything smacking of celebration had best be shunned susan fournier , an associate professor specializing in marketing at the harvard business school , even thinks the company should dismantle the firestone100 web page lighting candles on a cake right now just seems so opportunistic , she said a birthday is a time for saying , 'are n't you glad we were born' it s an appreciative event , and a lot of people just do n't appreciate how slow this company has been to tackle its problems then , of course , there is the question of money every company has a budget , and firestone should be devoting all of its advertising funds to the recall , said gita v johar , an associate professor of marketing at the columbia business school they can always let the dealers bring up the 100year heritage in conversations with customers or , others say , they can bring it up later right now , firestone s customers are worried about safety , not discounts or history , said sanjay dhar , a professor of marketing at the university of chicago s graduate school of business let firestone spend its money on road safety campaigns , and celebrate its 101st anniversary next year but face it a 101st anniversary simply does not have the cachet of a centennial and other marketing experts say the company should still play the birthday for all it s worth they 've got to forget price promotions , or anything that looks like they are patting themselves on the back , said gary armstrong , a professor of marketing at the kenanflagler business school of the university of north carolina but they should try to create a campaign that focuses on 100 years of safety , and good relationships with customers actually , that might be a bit dicey in itself there s the little matter of the huge recall of firestone 500 radial tires in the late 1970 s with enough deftness , some say , firestone could even turn that into a virtue the 100year anniversary establishes a tremendous credibility at a time that they have none , said robert marston , a new york public relations consultant who masterminded procter gamble s centennial celebration for ivory soap in 1979 they should get the ceo out there , apologizing to the public , tackling the issues of the recall but a 100th anniversary comes just once , and they should use it and how , exactly , should they do that \? they should take the approach of 'every company with a proud tradition of 100 years of service will stumble from time to time , ' mr marston said they should say , 'together we surmounted the problems of the firestone 500 and together we can get through this' even firestone dealers agree to disagree my job is to find replacement tires for my customers , and i'm losing sleep over that , said one dealer , who insisted on anonymity who s going to think of birthdays at a time like this \? jerry m bauer , that s who his dealership , bauer built inc in durand , wis , has sold firestone tires since 1945 , and a few months ago he contributed 5 , 000 to habitat for humanity in firestone s honor no one should object to their promoting their company , mr bauer said sure , they 've got a problem now , but that s no reason to back away from 100 years of success
princeton representative bob franks says he is keeping his options open in the race for governor next year , but that does n't mean that members of his congressional staff , who will need new jobs in about a month , are n't hoping try calling his local office to talk to him may i say what it is about \? the secretary asks it s about the quinnipiac poll , the reporter answers a new one , or the one that came out last week \? she asks mr franks may be weighing his options , but his people are certainly watching the news and hoping the recent poll , taken by quinnipiac university in connecticut , had a lot of good news for mr franks , assuming mr franks is still interested in being a candidate , which is no longer a sure thing benefiting from his strong showing against jon s corzine in the senate race last month , the registered voters of new jersey who responded to the poll indicated that they knew him and liked him in numbers he could not have earned before the campaign in a match against mayor james mcgreevey of woodbridge , who lost narrowly to governor whitman three years ago , mr franks won 35 percent of the hypothetical vote to mr mcgreevey s 38 percent , while mr mcgreevey beat donald t difrancesco , the senate president and undisputed frontrunner for the republican nomination , by 41 percent to 26 percent moreover , the voters now say they know mr franks a miserable 79 percent of the respondents said they did not know enough about mayor bret schundler of jersey city to speak about him , while a surprising 73 percent said the same of mr difrancesco despite his high statewide political profile now for the interesting part only 38 percent said the same of mr franks moreover , mr franks also won a higher percentage of favorable responses from voters who were asked about their personal opinions of a candidate polls , of course , are hypothetical races and hypothetical means unreal mr franks has maintained all along , as he did in a recent conversation , that he is weighing all options and foreclosing on none , which is standard political talk for no comment he is , however , burning up the roads visiting important opinion leaders , from corporate chairmen to the heads of union locals , asking them what they they are worrying about and hoping for in the coming years this all looks a lot like hillary rodham clinton s successful listening tour in upstate new york last summer , though mr franks says he is only trying to learn yes , he admitted , the subject of the governorship comes up at every every single one of these visits , but he is firm i want to be 100 percent legitimate , he warned do n't read too much into this still the secret to mr franks s popularity , of course , is that he has already run a statewide race , and a read of new jersey history shows that losing can be a winning strategy because it overcomes the difficulty of becoming known in a state split between two or more media spheres of influence jim florio had to lose once before he could win the governorship and christine todd whitman made a winning name for herself in losing to senator bill bradley in 1992 the same logic helps mr mcgreevey , however , and he will have the added advantage , as things now stand , of not having to fight a primary battle for the nomination mr difrancesco , meanwhile , will face at least mayor schundler and maybe someone from the republican party s conservative wing to step into a battle against mr difrancesco , who has already sewn up support from 11 of the 21 county chairmen for his nomination , and then have to slug it out with mr mcgreevey in november a year after going through this year s wringer , may not be such an attractive proposition moreover , mr franks is still only 49 , and could easily wait four more years to get the lay of the land he has already been recruited by kenneth m duberstein , ronald reagan s former chief of staff , to teach at harvard s kennedy school of government , and with a law degree and an encyclopedic knowledge of new jersey politics he is , after all , a former republican state chairman mr franks would be in demand in any politically connected law firm in the state a surprising number of people who believe they are close to mr franks say he will not run despite the promising poll numbers he has an infant daughter and has gotten his first taste of life outside the iron fist of politics waiting has its drawbacks , because the fame he has now is perishable but the man driving around the state and listening sounds as if he is having too much fun to worry about that photo iver peterson
beijing , march 15 in a lastditch effort to influence taiwan s presidential election , prime minister zhu rongji said today that the chinese people were willing to use all their blood to prevent the island s independence but , at the same time , he played down a recent chinese policy paper that threatened military action against the island if it indefinitely delayed talks on reunification , saying , there s nothing new in there taiwan , which holds its election on saturday , dominated mr zhu s 90minute news conference marking the end of this year s session of parliament in language that was on balance more incendiary than calming , mr zhu reiterated beijing s position concerning the island , which it considers a breakaway province it was the last major opportunity in a monthlong campaign by the chinese government to use fighting words to pressure taiwanese candidates and voters and mr zhu made clear that the government has strong preferences no matter who comes into power in taiwan , taiwan will never be allowed to be independent , he said if the people who favor independence win , he later added , it is a logical inevitability that such a result might undermine peace there were several such references to chen shuibian , the presidential candidate whose opposition democratic progressive party has advocated formal independence in the past , although mr chen has moderated that position in this election in recent days , chinese officials and communist party newspapers have lobbed numerous thinly veiled attacks at mr chen , saying that he is tricking the taiwanese and still at heart a separatist his mainland policy is merely a tactic to win the election , to pick up votes and deceive voters , xu bodong , a chinese foreign policy expert , said on state television today mr chen is in a tight threeway race for the presidency none of the candidates currently advocates a declaration of independence and beijing s threatening words are aimed to keep it that way mr zhu spoke with passion , but it was an odd role for the government s leading economic reformer , who has never been its point man on taiwan about half way through the news conference , the usually straighttalking prime minister seemed exasperated and refused to answer further questions on taiwan , although reporters kept bringing up the subject again and again , mr zhu repeated that china did not fear war , if it came to that and he lambasted foreign analysts who have recently argued that the chinese military lacks the capability to take taiwan they do not know the history of china and that the chinese people will use all of their blood to defend the unity of the chinese nation , he said on several occasions , mr zhu declined to reassure taiwan that there would be no violence before or after the election for example , when a taiwanese journalist asked if china planned to conduct military exercises this week near taiwan , as it did four years ago in a bid to influence taiwan s last presidential election , he replied let s just wait and see but do n't worry too much , because there are only two days left but at other points , mr zhu reiterated the government s position that its goal is peaceful reunification with taiwan , and said that the alarmed reaction abroad to last month s policy paper released was unwarranted in the 1980 s , he said , the chinese leader deng xiaoping , accused antichina forces in a certain nation of using an innocuous position paper that was meant to be a comprehensive and detailed exposition of china s long standing policy to their political advantage still , he expressed hope that the current tensions would not scuttle china s entry into the wto or damage relations with the united states he said he did not want to connect the taiwan question with other issues related to chinaus relations in the brief interludes when mr zhu managed to move away from talk of taiwan , he solicited foreign investment for chinese development projects , praised china s current anticorruption drive , and said that the government would soon clarify its new policies on the internet and telecommunications sector but he was at his most emotional on the issue of taiwan , giving even declarations of brotherhood vaguely threatening undertones we trust that our taiwanese compatriots will make a sensible choice in saturday s election , he said but he added that if they did not , they might not get another opportunity photo china s prime minister , zhu rongji , made it clear that beijing wants taiwan voters to defeat the candidates who favor independence \( associated press \)

mark jackson s eyes were rimmed with red , and soon the tears trickled down his face emotion left him speechless for a few moments until he pursed his lips and said with a heavy sigh there s a side of me that is so thankful i just want to thank the guys in here for dreaming it thirteen years removed from his rookieoftheyear season with the knicks , jackson had earned his first trip to the national basketball association finals in his sixth year with the indiana pacers thirteen years removed from his rookie season with the pacers , reggie miller finally made it his destination four painful nearmisses in the conference finals , including one on larry johnson s 4point play in game 6 last year in madison square garden , and a game 7 loss to the chicago bulls in 1998 were erased by the pacers' 9380 victory in game 6 last night reg and i have been talking about this for years and years and years and time and time again , keeping each other up all night long , calling in the middle of the night and wondering how are you feeling , jackson said we have gotten there time and time again , but to finally finish it off was awesome miller exited the game with eight seconds left , having detonated the biggest bomb in his career in madison square garden by scoring 34 points , 17 in the fourth quarter alone he had made good on his promise to kill the dog and stick the dagger in the dying knicks after the vicious talk before the game , the first thing miller did afterward was give jackson a hug jackson , an ordained minister , and miller , a preordained knicks killer , could not help but be swept up in the emotion we talked a whole lot of noise about what we were going to do if we won , miller said but i think like mark said , new york was very gracious last year in upsetting us we did the traditional jumping up and down , but you never want to rub it into anyone s face when the pacers got to their locker room , they started hollering then miller began to talk , thanking his teammates for giving him the opportunity to get to the finals he was reflective and nearly in tears of the pacers' 12 players , only sam perkins , 39 , playing for his fifth team , had been to the nba finals before , with seattle in 1996 going into the game , none of these guys have never been to the finals , he said , which explains why jackson would jump out of character and start crying , perkins added and it explains why miller would make a heartfelt speech afterward they 've been going at it for so long , the both of them , perkins said it s satisfying finally getting here but even the younger players , like jalen rose , in his fifth year , could understand the emotion this is a wonderful feeling , said rose , who scored 11 points this is our third straight year here for a lot of these guys , it feels like eight years it s been a long road we 've knocked on the doors a lot of times and now we 're in indiana kicked down the door this year because the pacers made game 6 into game 7 , treating it as if it were their last we did n't want to go to game 7 , said dale davis , who for the fourth time this series pulled down 16 rebounds we were really anxious to get to the finals and we stepped up the last two games jackson ignited the pacers' 30point first quarter with 5 of his 9 points it was the first time since game 1 that indiana won a first quarter when the pacers squandered what had been a 13point lead in the third quarter , miller scored 8 of the team s 12 points in the fourth quarter , travis best , who had scored a teamhigh 24 points in game 5 , came off the bench for jackson and scored 8 of his 10 points he and miller had all of the crucial points in that period , including two backtoback field goals with less than four minutes remaining to give the pacers an 11point advantage , and best sank two foul shots three minutes later to preserve the victory i just wanted to be out there with him to make some plays with him , and fortunately my shot was going down , best said but the pacers did not excel just offensively for the second straight game , they concentrated on playing stringent oneonone defense , motivated by their coach , a threetime nba champion it is a great thing that happened to our veteran players that have been around the league and battled so hard over the years and never had an opportunity to play in the finals , coach larry bird said this is their day
seattle , may 16 no , notwithstanding a joke making the rounds here , seattle has not changed its name to allentown not yet , anyway but from one end of downtown to the other , from a fantastically curvy and psychedelic rock 'n' roll museum , designed by frank o gehry and opening next month at the base of the space needle , to the recent implosion of the kingdome and plans for its replacement with a 450 million outdoor football stadium , the landscape of seattle is undergoing a remarkable transformation bankrolled largely by one man he is paul g allen , who bounces around from being the second to the fourthrichest person on the planet , depending on the fortunes of the stock of the microsoft corporation , which he cofounded 25 years ago with a middleschool chum , william h gates while mr gates continues to do battle from the company s helm against software competitors \( and federal antitrust lawyers \) , mr allen , who resigned from microsoft management in 1983 , has a far more diversified palette of activities and many combine longtime passions of his sports , movies , futuristic designs and the music of jimi hendrix , the late guitarist and seattle native whom mr allen has enshrined in an entire gallery at the new museum with real estate projects that are remaking the face of the city seattle of course abounds these days with cyberbillionaires who are making a huge imprint on the virtual world and , to a lesser extent , on the real world of their hometown but none of the others come close to affecting the visual appearance of seattle in the same way as the 47yearold mr allen , whose net worth is currently around 30 billion , who owns the seattle seahawks of the national football league and the portland trail blazers of the national basketball association , who has major investments in more than 100 new media companies and who even plays rhythm guitar in a seattle band , grown men , that recently released its first cd and , on its web site , describes its music as being inspired by hendrix , pink floyd , tom petty and the eagles mr allen s real estate projects are so eclectic and so broadly spread around the city that jeffrey k ochsner , chairman of the department of architecture at the university of washington , describes him as kind of a modern equivalent to the medici in florence , a man who is building a coliseum as well as a new technopalace of glasswalled headquarters in south downtown others here compare him to baron haussmann , the creator of modern paris intriguingly , though , mr allen seems to have generated less controversy than a bit of civic headscratching as to whether his projects all add up to a grand plan as far as having an 800pound gorilla running around your city , he s a pretty amiable one , said alex steffen , president of allied arts of seattle , an urban planning and arts advocacy group i mean , it s hard to be too outraged by someone who just loves sports and is kind of geeky in his devotion to jimi hendrix but at the same time , you look at somebody with that much sheer power , that much of an awesome ability to shape the landscape of the city you live in , and you want something a bit more visionary i do n't have any sense that he s looking at a map of the city and saying , 'what can i do to make seattle a better place \? ' i get the sense that he s got all these holdings and all this money , and he s looking at the map and saying , 'what could i do there that would be a lot of fun \? ' naturally , mr allen said in an interview , he wants to make seattle a better place but he seemed to bristle at the notion that he should have an overarching design vision there are threads that run through these things , but there s no singular master plan , he said there s the desire to be fresh , to incorporate high technology , to do things in highquality ways what we 're doing downtown kind of reflects the breadth of my interests in all these different areas , all the way from music to sports to high tech to movies and so forth but even if mr allen s central aim were only to find ways to make the city more fun , many people here say , that would be a great idea the new music museum , the experience music project , known as emp , is undeniably fun on the inside an interactive paean to modern american music , including rock , jazz , soul , gospel , country , blues , grunge , hiphop and other forms to come sound studios allow visitors to play their own music , or to strum a guitar that lights the sequence of chords to play louie louie , a song whose lyrics led to an fbi investigative file that is one of 80 , 000 artifacts collected for the museum outside is another matter make it swoopy were the instructions mr allen offered when he hired mr gehry as architect for the project the 250 million museum has an undulating aluminum and stainlesssteel shell of gold , silver , red , blue and iridescent purple , with wires stretched across the top , all intended to evoke the image of a smashed guitar the seattle center monorail runs right through it
the converted motor home that pulled up to the central courtyard of the south bronx housing project shortly before 3 pm was shrinkwrapped in a rainbowcolored display featuring smiling children and upbeat slogans like get on board with kids' health insurance earlier , fliers had been slipped under the doors of the 1 , 200 apartments , signs had been plastered throughout the dr ramon emeterio betances houses on east 146th street in mott haven , and dozens of telephone calls went out as lastminute reminders of the deal being offered inside the motor home and at the housing complex s office and community center lowcost or free health insurance for children despite all the advance hoopla , only four of the most likely hundreds of uninsured people living in the betances houses filled out applications that day last week for some of the 14 people working at the fair , including city employees and representatives of health insurance and nonprofit groups , the meager turnout was plainly frustrating but none of those involved in the giuliani administration s fourmonthold health insurance campaign expressed surprise , saying they know all too well how hard it is to bring the city s estimated 325 , 000 uninsured poor children into the health care mainstream there is a lot of fear in this community , especially among the immigrant families , said crimilda rivera , who was giving away colorful stickers , flying disks and other items to generate interest but you have to be out there constantly in order for people to get to know you , to build trust , and then they will open up for a decade , federal and state programs have offered free or extremely lowpriced insurance to children of lowincome and workingclass families in new york as of last january , an estimated 870 , 000 city children were enrolled in either medicaid , the federal program or child health plus , the state s plan in june , two months after disclosing his own prostate cancer , mayor rudolph w giuliani announced a city effort he called health stat to accelerate the enrollment of the remaining uninsured children this week , mr giuliani is stepping up that drive , with a new health stat advertising campaign and a city hall meeting tomorrow with clergy members and other religious leaders whom the mayor will ask to promote the campaign within their own congregations and neighborhoods in the same way that this administration has made it a safer city , a cleaner city , this administration should and can make it a healthier city as well , said anthony p coles , the deputy mayor who is coordinating the effort already , the almost military zeal with which the giuliani administration has undertaken the health stat effort has impressed some health care advocates , who were initially skeptical about the extent of the city s commitment about 5 , 000 city workers have been trained in the fine print of government health care regulations so that they can explain the benefits available to the residents they deal with every day an additional 100 city workers have been hired or trained more intensively and are being sent throughout the city to enroll children and adults these city workers will join nearly 100 state workers from a dozen community groups who are also signing up city residents the giuliani administration has held weekly meetings at the city s emergency operations center at which city managers review plans that detail how they intend to meet their enrollment or referral goals to augment the state s ambitious effort and a computerized city mapping program is being used to identify neighborhoods with large pockets of uninsured residents starting early next year , health stat is scheduled to be extended to about 700 , 000 uninsured adults in new york city who may be eligible for lowcost coverage under a state program , family health plus it was not just a press conference there is a real commitment , said donna a lawrence , executive director of the new york city office of the children s defense fund , a national advocacy group , which sent a letter to mayors across the united states praising the city s campaign and urging others to follow there is no where else in the country where a mayor has given it a directive like this and taken it on as aggressively evidence of new york s effort is visible across city government routine forms that residents must fill out to register for free school lunches , day care and school recreation activities are being modified to include questions about the health insurance status of children the housing authority sent notices to many of its residents , telling them about health stat and instead of requiring tenants , as they once had , to go to city offices to sign up for insurance , the agency is organizing enrollment fairs like the one at the betances houses the board of education included information about the health insurance program in a mailing to parents of its 11 million students , and school health officials have followed up with telephone calls to 45 , 000 households thought to include uninsured children , city officials said
nashville , aug 8 in the days before george w bush announced his selection of dick cheney as his running mate , vice president al gore and his advisers sensed an unexpected opportunity aboard air force ii and in mr gore s campaign headquarters here , there was a consensus that mr bush and his aides had bungled their selection process , that the republicans had come across as leakprone , rushed and uncharacteristically amateurish the gore campaign swiftly set out to exploit this perceived weakness by trying to turn the running mate selection process itself into a political weapon with lockstep discipline , mr gore s spokesmen derided mr bush for conducting his search like a fraternity rush they presented mr gore s method as dignified , orderly , panderfree and , above all else , private but the strict secrecy imposed by the gore campaign shielded from public view an intensely political , highly competitive and sometimes frenetic selection process again and again , mr gore s search was shaped by gritty political concerns that had little bearing on what he had repeatedly described as his single most important criterion for a running mate someone possessed of the experience and ability to assume the presidency if necessary george j mitchell , the former senate majority leader , for example , never made it to the short list , at least in part because of his work as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry , people involved in the search said senator evan bayh of indiana faced opposition from prochoice groups and gave his assent to a campaign aimed at countering criticism over his voting record on abortion , but faded nonetheless senator bob graham of florida was hurt by his habit of filling diaries with mundane aspects of his day , a practice some in the gore campaign worried would be viewed as eccentric on the other hand , democratic officials said , mr bush s repeated efforts to tarnish mr gore with resurrected memories of president clinton s affair with a white house intern elevated the standing of mr gore s eventual choice , joseph i lieberman , the first democrat to condemn mr clinton s affair from the senate floor the enforced secrecy potential running mates were warned not to divulge details about their contacts with the gore vetting teams also served to obscure lobbying efforts by a select group of wellconnected political professionals several of mr gore s campaign consultants had also worked for those on his list of potential vice presidents , and these men and women fought hard for their favored picks one adviser , bob shrum , has worked with several of the potential candidates but argued for one of them , senator john edwards of north carolina another adviser , michael whouley , argued for his former boss , senator john kerry of massachusetts only last week , al from , president of the democratic leadership council and an influential voice among moderate democrats , lobbied both mr gore and his campaign chairman , william m daley , on behalf of mr lieberman , who is the chairman of the council the message in the method as with any presidential candidate , the choice of running mate is an important and telling decision mr gore s aides argued that the way he went about picking mr lieberman illustrated several of his strengths , notably his meticulous preparation before arriving at major decisions mr gore , they said , has raised vetting to new levels of thoroughness and inclusiveness although mr gore announced in april that former secretary of state warren christopher would lead his selection team , mr gore began to organize his process months before his vetting teams were led by such veteran lawyers as charles f c ruff , the former white house counsel who defended mr clinton during his impeachment trial the team that vetted mr lieberman , led by jamie s gorelick , a former deputy attorney general , went so far as to review the more than 800 legal opinions that mr lieberman rendered when he was attorney general of connecticut from 1983 to 1989 sheldon cohen , a former commissioner of the internal revenue service , was drafted to review tax returns mr gore also instructed mr christopher to consult freely and frequently with an informal group that consisted of labor secretary alexis m herman and former housing secretary henry g cisneros , both of whom have faced ethics inquiries , and senator john d rockefeller iv of west virginia and gen john m shalikashvili , the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff i gained added respect for his values and judgment , mr christopher said when asked in an interview what he had learned about mr gore during the search process i found he went about the process seriously and conscientiously republicans drew different lessons from mr gore s method of picking a running mate while praising mr lieberman as a man of integrity , they said mr gore s selection process underscored what they described as his penchant for tactical ruthlessness and a tendency to shade the truth for political gain
storrs , conn , march 12 defending national champion connecticut has never played utah state and it was evident tonight that coach jim calhoun would rather have met the aggies some time other than in the opening round of the ncaa tournament on friday in birmingham , ala they 've won 19 in a row , and they 're a very good and underrated team , calhoun said after he and his players watched the draw for the tournament close by their home court at the gampel pavilion i thought they 'd be at least a no 9 seed look how they beat fresno state an inexperienced utah state team , seeded no 12 , which finished at 285 after winning the big west conference tournament , was seeded seven notches below uconn \( 249 \) , which lost to st john s in the final of the big east tournament in madison square garden on saturday night they have two very good guards , calhoun said in referring to utah state s tony brown and troy relle , and a tough big man in forward shawn daniels , the aggies' rebounding leader who , with brown and rolle , leads the team in scoring at 12 points a game with 19 consecutive victories , utah state has the longest winning streak in division i the last three victories came in the big west tournament , in which the aggies defeated pacific , nevada and new mexico state rolle and daniels shared honors as the tournament s most valuable players after starting the season with a 95 record against nonconference opponents , utah state posted a 160 record in the big west before winning three straight games in the conference tournament the winner of the connecticututah state game will play either fourthseeded tennessee or 13thseeded louisianalafayette on sunday despite having to play four games on four consecutive days , calhoun said the huskies , who returned to storrs this afternoon , were none the worse for wear it was n't so much the physical part of it all , calhoun said of the four big east tournament games it was more the mental aspect i think we played pretty good basketball and i'm glad to see that five big east teams got into the tournament that s pretty good jack cavanaugh
one of the unexpected results of the computer revolution is that thousands of bridge players are playing the game online every day a table may consist of players from four continents this is unpopular with the proprietors of socalled ftf \( facetoface \) clubs , who believe that it takes away their clients but it is a godsend to those who cannot for some reason leave home , do not have a club nearby , need to play briefly or at an irregular hour , or wish to smoke without inconveniencing others beginners can find foursomes on their own level , while an expert can practice with a partner on the other side of a continent in preparation for a national championship players can make comments to opponents and kibitzers without their partner s knowledge , allowing an improvement on the usual method of alerting conventional bids the oldest , biggest and most sophisticated of the online clubs is okbridge , which is about to start its second internet world championships entries close march 31 , and play , in eight world regions , starts april 10 and leads up to a world final in november further information is available on the organization s web site , okbridgecom it has more than 17 , 000 members in 90 countries , and the annual subscription is 99 a free alternative is the microsoft internet gaming zone \( zonecom \) , which provides robot players if a table is incomplete the diagramed deal was played recently on okbridge , and northsouth climbed to an optimistic grand slam in an experienced partnership south would have a way to discover whether or not his partner held the club queen , but he was playing online with little discussion of bidding method and took a plunge into seven clubs his partner s secondround jump to four clubs hinted at a holding headed by at least the jack , and he knew that the contract would have some chance of success in the west seat was ralph zakar of aventura , fla , and before choosing his lead he thought carefully about the bidding it seemed likely that northsouth held nine clubs between them , and that the declarer would play to drop the queen after a neutral lead he therefore made the spectacular lead of the club seven , apparently giving up hope of scoring a trump trick he was delighted when his partner produced the jack , and he could afford to show his delight , since none of the other players could see his face south won with the ace , and now had a losing option he knew that something odd was happening , but what \? had west made a tricky and unlikely lead from a doubleton queen \? or had he led a singleton trump , in principle a poor choice against a slam \? finally south swallowed the bait he crossed to dummy with a spade lead to the king and finessed the club nine for down one zakar was entirely happy , but he wished there were some live players in sight to whom he could tell the story in thursday s column , the reference to a doubleton diamond jack and a ruffsluff possibility was an error , because west could have safely led a heart diagram
apart from the luster of borrowed seriousness , what literature most often provides the movies is access to a deep and selfreplenishing reservoir of stories film and the novel are cousins not far removed , and the dna they share is narrative but their narrative codes owing partly to obvious differences of media , partly to their divergent histories have grown further and further apart after several generations of fervid experimentation , the flouting of storytelling norms has become , among ambitious fiction writers , a convention in itself while it would be a distortion to say that the rise of the movies as a parallel and competing art form has been the cause , the signature effects of postmodern fiction recursive language games selfconscious , unreliable and multiple narrative voices mobiusstrip skeins of allusion and parody , sincerity and irony seem almost flagrant in their defiance of cinematic appropriation the giants of postmodernism william gaddis , thomas pynchon , don delillo have erected pyramids of prose so intricate in their conceits and so saturated with references as to defy replication altogether their most recognizable progeny carry on this resistance can you picture the 1 , 100 pages of david foster wallace s infinite jest , with its 400 footnotes and uncountable subplots , on the screen \? at the same time , american movies seem , perhaps more than ever , to languish under the tyranny of story , a regime with its own bureaucratic jargon aspiring screenwriters are schooled in the dogma of threeact structure , character arcs and throughlines the average hollywood product , confined within iron boundaries of genre and subjected to the killing discipline of test marketing , arrives in theaters overstuffed with incident , whipsawed by the need for suspense and predictable from start to finish it is hardly surprising , then , that a handful of restless and independentminded filmmakers have turned to contemporary fiction for relief , as though envious of the liberties writers have claimed for themselves the freedom to meander , to proliferate loose ends , to think out loud alison maclean s jesus' son , opening in new york today , is the latest in a series of intriguing efforts to translate the words of particularly idiosyncratic writers into the visual and aural idioms of film like sofia coppola s virgin suicides , bette gordon s luminous motion , mary harron s american psycho and stephen frears s high fidelity , jesus' son is at once a tribute to its source and a bold refashioning of it , an attempt to preserve the author s style and to advance the director s vision in a single gesture in some ways , ms maclean is doggedly faithful to her source , a slim volume of resonant , anecdotal stories by denis johnson the book is held together by his shuffling , soulful , absentminded hero , a young man adrift in a landscape of drugs , sad women and surreal jobs mr johnson s lean , wry prose infiltrates the film s soundtrack through dialogue and voiceover , and some of his descriptive passages are reproduced with meticulous obedience , as though they were architectural drawings but reading jesus' son , you wonder how its spare , halfmumbled vignettes and loopy , hipster jokes could sustain the fleshandblood realism of a movie the supporting characters , not all of whom are named , seem like interchangeable apparitions from a jumbled series of acid flashbacks , and the book as a whole is like a long conversation with a voluble , not entirely sane or sober companion on a crosscountry bus trip the book s resonance and humor seem to dwell between the lines , in the capacity of mr johnson s artful prose and prose in general to be at once more abstract and more sensual than film , however ingenious , can ever hope to be language is able to track the stutterings of consciousness , the bleeding together of thought and sensation , the dislocated experience of time , by the simplest and most efficient of means poetry , robert frost said , is what gets lost in translation , and a corollary might be that prose is what disappears before your eyes consider a typical passage from jesus' son or maybe that was n't the time it snowed maybe it was the time we slept in the truck and i rolled over on the bunnies and flattened them it does n't matter what s important for me to remember now is that early the next morning the snow was melted off the windshield and the daylight woke me up a mist covered everything and , with the sunshine , was beginning to grow sharp and strange the bunnies were n't a problem yet , or they 'd already been a problem and were already forgotten , and there was nothing on my mind i felt the beauty of the morning in a hundred words , mr johnson evokes several distinct states of feeling , jumps backward , forward and sideways in time , and leaps with careless grace from the narrator s inner world to the world outside the camera may be able to approximate some of these effects , or convey , through the alchemical interactions of light on the landscape and the human face , a faint equivalent of them but never with this kind of effortless , offthecuff efficiency or consider another passage , a kiss from jeffrey eugenides s virgin suicides that is stranger , truer , and far more vividly icky than even the most splendidly backlighted classichollywood smooch
there are easier things to do than run a community theater , especially one with a native american theme it s a concept that escapes most people , said marty black eagle carl , founder , president and producing artistic director of algonkuin theater company in hamden they have no clue , said mr carl , who bills the algonkuin as the only native american theater in connecticut really some would guess that we do only native shows or that we 're connected to one of the casinos and have money or that we do cowboy and indian shows algonkuin theater company has existed since 1993 after mr carl directed his own adaptation of gaston leroux s phantom of the opera for talent hut players in seymour , he and a handful of friends decided to start their own company we based it around the idea of promoting native theater when we could find it , mr carl said also , to do other interesting plays that we enjoyed or would like to direct and act in because there is not exactly a surplus of native american plays , algonkuin stages a shakespeare production every summer of the group s four to five annual productions , one or two are native american plays since the algonkuin has no permanent home , it presents plays in new haven at the church of the redeemer , the educational center for the arts and the little theater , and in hamden at the miller memorial library and the eli whitney barn mr carl , who claims blackfoot , african and european heritage , said his aim was to bridge the gap of understanding of native american culture by producing plays by and about native americans so far , mr carl said that most of the native shows have been historic in essence , including elegy for an icon and please do not touch the indians this year we doing a modern time frame native play called someday' by drew hayden taylor , said mr carl marty has always been very into his native american background , said peggy hackett , a longtime friend of mr carl who has helped with set design and lighting since the company was founded as it turned out , most of us that formed the original board had native american blood in us also , so we thought that would be a neat way to go since there did n't seem to be many other native american theater companies around once the algonkuin s founders committed to a native american agenda , they had difficulty finding accessible plays we did n't have plays like the euros did , mr carl said but there was native theater , mostly being religious in content as all theater none of it survives except what s still used in religious practices ms hackett added that most native american plays she is familiar with are not exactly comedies either they usually center around the problems that native americans have gone through such as alcoholism , depression , rape , suicide and of course the mass destruction of their way of life it s stuff that needs to be said and remembered but a more upbeat show would probably draw more people in but the algonkuin might still have a tough time marketing them if they have not run on broadway , which very few have and so the company survives on a calculated mix of popular plays and native work \( its first production , in 1993 , was phantom of the opera with a native spin \) small theater is tough outside of new york because most people wo n't come out to see plays that they 've never heard about , mr carl said people who have seen our work know that we do a wide range of shows , so that s how we get the audiences who come back they 've seen our shakespeare or our neil simon , and some will come back for our artsy shows , or our obscure native shows , because they know they 'll see something good since new haven is n't known for having a large native community , we just try to keep producing good , professional shows all the way around , he said we hope people come and see our native shows and learn about our history , our heritage , where we were and where we are today the algonkuin theatre welcomes anyone wishing to work on productions tanya feduiksmith started volunteering last summer when her husband played the title role in hamlet she directed the algonkuin s most recent production of much ado about nothing , which was presented last month at the eli whitney barn i 'd gotten really interested in directing and marty gave me the chance to direct a couple of shows for the company , which i really enjoyed doing , she said mr carl s wife , margaret , stage manager for many of the theater s productions , said the company s financial constraints have not been all bad it really forces us to be creative , and we are fortunate to find actors who are willing to put their best efforts into a project they do n't get paid for it s great when we get people , especially friends and relatives of the actors , who rarely or never go to live theater and tell us how much they enjoyed it , she said algonkuin theater s next production is the area premiere of someday , by drew hayden taylor , running nov 3 to 18 the production , directed by mr carl , will be presented at the black box theater at church of the redeemer , whitney avenue and cold spring , new haven the algonkuin theater s web site is www algonkuin org photos props for the latest show by the algonkuin theater company at right , marty black eagle carl , left , the group s founder , talking to john benedetto , an actor we hope people come and see our native shows and learn about our history , our heritage , where we were and where we are today , mr carl said \( photographs by michael doolittle for the new york times \)
for a company beleaguered by a federal antitrust investigation , sotheby s pulled off a impressive sale of impressionist and modern art last night its york avenue salesroom was overflowing with collectors , dealers and curiosity seekers the regulars came to watch as millions of dollars' worth of art by masters like monet and matisse , picasso and van gogh changed hands but some in the audience were drawn by the publicity sotheby s has received since the resignations of a alfred taubman , its chairman and major stockholder , and diana d brooks , its president and chief executive , in february sotheby s faces the possibility of steep fines and dozens of lawsuits alleging that the company colluded with its archrival christie s to fix the prices it charges buyers and sellers none of this affected the strong prices last night the sale totaled 1403 million , in the middle of its estimate of 117 million to 163 million of the 50 lots , only 8 went unsold the sale had few star works and many offerings had recently been on the market , but that did n't stop buyers among the best works in the sale was the portal \( sun \) , from monet s series of views of the facade rouen cathedral it had been on the market twice in the last 15 years at sotheby s in 1984 , when it was sold for 25 million , and again in 1987 , when it brought 31 million last night , four bidders wanted the sundappled scene it finally went to an unidentified telephone bidder for 242 million , nicely above its estimate of 15 million to 20 million \( final prices include sotheby s commission , 20 percent of the first 15 , 000 , 15 percent of the next 85 , 000 to 100 , 000 , and 10 percent of any amount over 100 , 000 estimates do not reflect commissions \) the serpentine , a rare matisse sculpture that was up for sale last night , is from an edition of 10 plus one artist s proof this piece was cast in 1948 but the artist executed it far earlier , around 1909 the first hand to go up was that of mariagaetana matisse , the widow of the gallery owner pierre matisse , one of the artist s sons she was sitting with john lumley , international director of impressionist and postimpressionist art at christie s in london but bidding went so fast that she quickly dropped out two tenacious telephone bidders fought for the sculpture , which ended up selling for 14 million , well above its high estimate of 10 million , and setting a record for a matisse sculpture that cast had not been on the market in 30 years , but many of last night s works had been up for sale in recent years picasso s compote and guitar , a 1932 still life that sotheby s experts thought could fetch 10 million to 15 million , sold to another unidentified telephone bidder for 99 million , just below its low estimate the price was hefty , considering that the painting sold for 38 million at christie s eight years ago some works lost their value from the heady days of the 80 s a renoir portrait , portrait of gabrielle \( young girl with flowers \) , circa 1900 , for which a japanese collector had paid 46 million in 1989 at the height of the art boom , was back on the market last night with an estimate of 900 , 000 to 12 million it sold to an unidentified bidder for 11 million before the sale , david norman , head of sotheby s impressionist and modern art department in new york , said last night s most askedabout work was monet s camille sitting on the beach at trouville \( 187071 \) estimated at 1 million to 15 million , it had many determined takers and finally sold to an unidentified collector for 23 million beautifully painted , though difficult in subject matter , is toulouselautrec s abandon , or the two friends \( 1895 \) , depicting two women lying on a bed looking into each other s eyes one of the best examples of the artist s preoccupation with female couples , it was expected to bring 6 million to 8 million seven bidders tried hard to buy the painting , which ended up selling to a telephone bidder for 93 million an example of monet s famous waterlilies series , this one from 1908 , was on offer after selling for 49 million at christie s in 1995 last night , it brought 83 million , right in the middle of its estimate of 7 million to 9 million the price was strong , considering that christie s had sold two paintings from the series on monday night a rare one from 1906 for 209 million and one from 191719 for 68 million a van gogh still life , flowers in a vase \( 1890 \) , which had brought 4 million at sotheby s sale of works from the reader s digest collection in 1998 , was back on the block with an ambitious estimate of 5 million to 7 million it ended up selling for 46 million to an unidentified telephone bidder who beat out two other contenders many of the top prices exceeded 1989 , mr norman said but at the low end , that is n't always the case preparation for the class \( 188285 \) , a degas scene of dancers in rehearsal , was estimated at 5 million to 7 million and brought 52 million the pastel had been up for sale at sotheby s twice in the last decade in 1990 and in 1998 , fetching 49 million both times many collectors and dealers were confused because all levels of the market seemed to find buyers last night , whereas earlier in the week , at christie s sales of impressionist and postimpressionist art on monday night and of 20thcentury art on tuesday evening , buyers were more selective sometimes you think you know exactly where you are , said james roundell , of the dickinsonroundell gallery in new

east rutherford , nj , nov 29 now mister rogers is attacking the neighborhood last wednesday , jim fassel , the giants' usually placid and mindful coach , stepped out of character during a fiery address to reporters and guaranteed that his team would secure a playoff berth today , when told that mike ditka , the coach turned television commentator , referred to the giants as soft over the weekend , fassel erupted again and he began by calling ditka his very good friend i do n't like reacting to hearsay , fassel said at the conclusion of his weekly news conference but mike brought his team in here twice and he went home losing , ok \? now he s in the booth , ok \? he 'd probably prefer to be on the sideline i do n't think he needs to call my team soft otherwise , i think he 'd still be on the sideline tell him to go get another tee time ditka , as coach of the new orleans saints , was defeated twice by fassel s giants at giants stadium , by 313 last season and by 149 in 1997 giants defensive tackle keith hamilton also criticized ditka for his comments after the giants' 317 victory on sunday in arizona fassel , who muzzled his players by telling them not to discuss this weekend s opponent , the washington redskins , was reacting to what he was told today about ditka s remarks but ditka s comments on cbs s the nfl today , were slightly different from those relayed to fassel , although ditka did bring up the soft characterization and did not disagree with it either ditka was talking about fassel s playoff guarantee last week when he said they are not going to the playoffs unless they start playing smarter and tougher football than they are you look at the stats from last year , they 're better on offense , they 're better on defense and their record is better right now and everybody is saying this is a soft team fassel s only other comment on ditka , a member of the pro football hall of fame whom fassel twice called his very good friend , was this i do n't like anybody referring to my team as soft for fassel , today was another public performance with an edge to it he seemed worked up and feisty while joking with reporters before the session , he was asked if he planned to make news again , as he did a week ago sharpen your pencils , fassel said with a laugh as he exited today s team practice even as fassel has made news with his remarks , he has told his players to restrain themselves when talking with reporters many players responded today by saying no comment to questions others simply were not available in the locker room , remaining in rooms offlimits to reporters and others said they would not talk about the giants as a team or the redskins at all , but only about themselves and their play fassel said the players were heeding his directive i'm not interested in anybody s opinion in this organization , fassel said it s part of my job to talk to you and i 'll do the talking i'm not asking for a lot of talk , i'm asking for a lot of action asked what made him deliver this message to his players , fassel said because when it s all said and done , i want more done than said the less said and the more done , the better i like it it s not time to talk , it s time to work i was getting tired of it i'm not interested in opinions we 've got a football game to win that s a fulltime job fassel conceded that winning at washington , which is 75 , is crucial to the playoff chances of the 84 giants because washington defeated the giants already this season , by 166 , a redskins victory on sunday would give them the first tie breaker , which is headtohead play , over the giants already , the giants have lost to two other 84 teams competing for national football conference playoff spots st louis and detroit when it all shakes down , it 'll be the biggest game we 've played , fassel said of sunday s game it could end up being the biggest game we play this season i hope not , but there s a lot at stake this could be the defining moment for our ascension or our decline at one point today , fassel was asked how the redskins , loaded with talent and expected to dominate the nfc east , could be struggling in third place there are no guarantees in this league , fassel said none whatsoever when told that he made a playoff guarantee just a week ago , fassel smiled yeah , and i stand by it , the coach said if somebody s dumb enough to make a guarantee , let them be dumb and i'm not dumb extra points right guard ron stone , who did not play on sunday against arizona because of a bruised rib , returned to practice on wednesday left tackle lomas brown , who left the arizona game with a bruised lower right leg , did not practice , but he worked out with the team trainers at the beginning of practice and was not limping the giants have listed each player as probable wide receiver ike hilliard is out because of a bruised lung and may also miss the next game , against pittsburgh on dec 10 joe jurevicius filled in for hilliard against the cardinals but strained an abdominal muscle during wednesday s practice and was on the sideline as the workout ended jurevicius said he expected to play on sunday , though he had not yet seen the team doctors hopefully , it 'll go away , he said i 've played in pain before the giants' other starting wide receiver , amani toomer , did not complete practice because of what the team called a minor hamstring strain photo jim fassel has ordered his players not to talk about sunday s game \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
how many moralists can dance on the head of a pin \? the more the merrier on its way to yesterday s touching climax , in which new york s mayor , rudolph giuliani , was reborn as jimmy stewart s george bailey in it s a wonderful life , the rudyjudidonnacristyne soap opera has offered many memorable sideshows an aggrieved wife s press conference outside a cardinal s wake , a rollicking new abe hirschfeld campaign for senator , an ebay auction of a mayoral galpal s high school yearbook but none topped the spirited tapdancing of clintonbashers as they labored to draw fine distinctions between white house and gracie mansion infidelities at least his affair is the traditional other woman kind , as would suit a conservative , wrote danielle crittenden in slate according to andrea peyser of the new york post , he did n't lie , he did n't fudge , he did n't equivocate he spoke the truth , no more , no less paul gigot found an alltoohuman mayor , a vulnerable soul with a sense of regret , even remorse peggy noonan told national review online that rudy is normal compared to clinton , and praised the mayor in the wall street journal for being ragged and human and refraining from finger wagging for ann coulter , there s the talmudic difference between a dirtbag and a dirtbag and a felon in the hillary trap , her new entry into the crowded antihillary book sweepstakes , laura ingraham faults the clintons for holding the modern view that moral values are relative but her tome had the misfortune to be published just as the giuliani marital meltdown confirmed that moral relativity is in the eye of the beholder and is becoming an epidemic among conservatives , who only last month put aside familyvalues absolutes to oppose the reunion of elian gonzalez with his dad thus did many of the scolds who bemoaned the dreadful example set by monicagate for the american people s children make no mention whatsoever of children in judigate neither the american people s nor the giulianis' own those who accused bill clinton of sliming the discarded women in his life gleefully trashed donna hanover , either for her taste in off broadway stage roles or for defying her husband \( new yorkers never really liked donna hanover to begin with , opined dick morris , accusing her of exploiting her marriage to advance her career \) those who berated mr clinton for allegedly using arkansas state troopers to further his sexual misadventures were mum about the nypd honor guard at the rudyjudi trysts in the hamptons those who decried vernon jordan s thwarted effort to secure monica lewinsky an entrylevel job at revlon ignored the mayor s successful installation of cristyne lateganonicholas in a 150 , 000 taxpayersubsidized job at the city s tourism bureau and some of those who ridiculed mrs clinton for her theory that a vast rightwing conspiracy had targeted her husband dropped hints that a leftwing conspiracy had set up mr giuliani both mr morris and robert novak have gone on tv to float the notion that , as mr novak ominously intoned , mr giuliani s marital problems may not be all of his own doing , since bad things happen to people who go up against the clintons only a few conservatives resisted this moralrelativism epidemic hours before the mayor s withdrawal , william bennett called him loutish and urged him not to run earlier and gutsier was maggie gallagher in the post , who took on the repulsive spin doctors in her own political camp suddenly , adultery is nothing , and telling the truth about adultery makes you a standup guy ms gallagher went so far as to say that the mayor made bill clinton look good as a husband and father but i do n't buy the argument that the mayor is a total hypocrite yes , his serial attachments \( according to ms hanover s allegation \) would seem to contradict his endorsement of publicschool displays of the ten commandments , his zero tolerance of sex shops and his policing of museums for salacious art but is he really being inconsistent when he humiliates his wife and his two schoolage children by informing them of his divorce plans by press conference or by parading down second avenue with his very good friend for the paparazzi \? he has treated his own family with the exact same compassion and sensitivity that he lavished upon the family of patrick dorismond no hypocrisy there ! i 'd also posit that this whole soap opera is in some ways a public service , since mr giuliani , intentionally or not , helped uncloset one of the most common traumas of modern america divorce for it is divorce , not extracurricular romance , that made this scandal novel we have become inured to infidelities in officialdom , especially among gingrich republicans , but this is the first time most of us have watched a political leader s wandering morph before our eyes into a highprofile divorce , complete with male midlife crisis and hovering lawyers , that played out in full view on television in real time for those of us who 've been through divorce , there is cathartic value in seeing that the high , mighty and normally selfpossessed can behave as childishly and be hurt as badly as the rest of us at that tragic moment when a marriage dies

albany , march 15 the state attorney general today accused the chief of the port authority of new york and new jersey , a longtime friend and fundraiser to gov george e pataki , of fraud and other misdeeds in a real estate deal , and state officials say he will soon leave the authority because of the allegations attorney general eliot l spitzer filed a civil lawsuit today in state supreme court in manhattan , contending that the authority s executive director , robert e boyle , 63 , had illegally profited in the early 1990 s from real estate transactions with hudson valley hospital center in peekskill , where he was chairman mr boyle , a former head of the jacob k javits convention center , becomes the closest person to the governor , and the first highranking member of his administration , to be tainted by scandal the case against mr boyle stemmed from the federal taxfraud indictment more than a year ago against albert j pirro jr , a prominent lobbyist and real estate lawyer , and the husband of jeanine f pirro , the westchester county district attorney , another close friend and ally of the governor s the indictment described a real estate deal that mr boyle and mr pirro entered into with the hospital , though mr spitzer s suit says that mr boyle s role in that deal was hidden there has been no suggestion that mr pataki was involved in , or knew of , any wrongdoing state prosecutors and administration officials said they expected mr boyle to leave the port authority because of the accusations he will either resign , they said , or simply not seek reappointment by the governor when his term expires in april mr boyle s lawyer , andrew j levander , released a statement today saying that the suit was based on tired , inaccurate and invalid allegations relating to events nearly 10 years ago it added , mr boyle intends to move to dismiss this lawsuit in its entirety the governor s office declined to comment directly on the case michael mckeon , mr pataki s press secretary , said , bob boyle has repeatedly demonstrated his worth to the taxpayers , gaining national recognition by taking on organized crime and cleaning up the javits center , and by beginning to turn the monolithic bureaucracy at the port authority into a more productive operation mr boyle s departure from the port authority would complicate matters at an agency that has been paralyzed by a running dispute between mr pataki and gov christine todd whitman of new jersey over how to divide its resources between the two states for more than a year , that feud has held up approval of a crucial contract with the country s two largest shipping companies the federal indictment of mr pirro described a real estate deal that mr boyle and mr pirro entered into with the hospital that prompted mr spitzer s investigation , which was kept secret until today the attorney general decided not to seek criminal charges , but is seeking more than 500 , 000 in restitution to the hospital under the civil action hudson valley hospital center , formerly peekskill hospital , has long been a locus of relationships among northern westchester s influential republicans mr pataki , then a state assemblyman , served on the board at mr boyle s invitation from 1988 to 1992 , as did several local officeholders news reports , the spitzer suit and the federal indictment portray the hospital as a tangle of conflicts of interest , with members of the hospital s board entering into lucrative contracts with the hospital , sometimes without the knowledge of the full board officials in mr spitzer s office said more hospital officers , none of them prominent political figures , were under investigation the suit contends that mr boyle defrauded the hospital and its parent company , westchesterputnam health management system inc , by concealing his role in the real estate deal , and accuses him of many violations of the state s laws prohibiting selfdealing by the officers of a notforprofit corporation it also says that his lies led the hospital and the parent company to file false statements in their annual reports to the attorney general s office two other hospital directors , arthur clements and ruth woolfe , are also accused of violating the laws on selfdealing in the lawsuit today at the center of the lawsuit is an old watch assembly plant in crotononhudson , mr boyle s hometown mr spitzer s suit contends that mr boyle learned in early 1991 , when the hospital was looking for new office space , that the building was available it says that he failed to notify the hospital board , a breach of his legal duty , and instead brought the building to mr pirro s attention mr boyle then became a secret partner in distinctive properties , a real estate company headed by mr pirro , with a 45 percent ownership , the attorney general contends , and distinctive properties bought the building in april 1991 , for 950 , 000 even before the sale closed , mr spitzer says , mr boyle had arranged for the hospital to lease the building for offices the hospital spent 530 , 000 to renovate the building , and hired a construction company owned by mr boyle , rogene industries , as construction manager in 1993 , the hospital bought the building outright for 15 million , a 550 , 000 profit for distinctive properties over those two years , the suit says , distinctive properties and another company owned by mr pirro , a j p management group , funneled more than 292 , 000 , often through intermediaries , to rogene , mr boyle s company state prosecutors say the money was mr boyle s finder s fee and his share of the profits , in disguise mr boyle has said those payments were part of an unrelated real estate deal mr pataki appointed mr boyle executive director of the port authority in early 1997 before that , he spent two years as president of the javits center , another job given to him by the governor at the javits center , as at hudson valley hospital , mr boyle was credited with turning around a failing operation in particular , independent auditors found that he had greatly loosened organized crime s grip on its craft unions yet despite his apparent managerial skill , mr boyle s career has been marked by repeated incidents that critics said called into question his ethics and , at the very least , his judgment for more than 20 years , mr boyle was a part owner of westchester concrete in tarrytown during that time , one of his partners was accused by federal authorities of having indirect links to organized crime , and westchester concrete was sold in 1988 to another concrete company that law enforcement officials said had mob ties mr boyle has said he did not know of either problem until long afterward after mr pataki was elected governor in 1994 , mr boyle was treasurer of his inaugural and transition committees , which raised more than 25 million it turned out that corporations doing important business with the state had given as much as 25 , 000 to the funds , and that the funds had paid up to 50 , 000 to top pataki aides nothing illegal was found , but the committees' finances raised concerns about major companies' trying to buy influence and in 1998 , the port authority under mr boyle spent more than 500 , 000 on lavish parties , expenses that proved an embarrassment for the agency , and led some democrats to call for his ouster also last year , it was revealed that mr boyle had arranged for free office space in the world trade center for the hungarianamerican chamber of commerce , a small nonprofit group that had sponsored mr pataki s trips to hungary in 1995 and 1996 no other trade group had been offered space without charge photo robert e boyle , executive director of the port

white plains , june 21 the third straight day of jury deliberations in the federal taxfraud case of albert j pirro jr ended late this afternoon without a verdict but for the first time , there was a whiff of discord among the jurors just a few minutes after deliberations began today at 9 am in federal district court , one of the jurors , looking grim and perturbed , met privately with judge barrington d parker jr shortly thereafter , judge parker summoned the lawyers and mr pirro to a closed conference then he summoned the jury of eight men and four women he reminded them that it was important that a verdict must be unanimous and that there s no shortcut , no compromising , but that it was just as vital to discuss the case in a polite , friendly fashion , even if one or more jurors were outnumbered or outtalked sometimes , tempers flare and things get a little heated , judge parker said try not to personalize any differences you may have none of the principals in the incident would give any details but given the tenor of judge parker s remarks and mr pirro s reaction upon leaving the conference a beaming smile speculation was rife among people at the courthouse that the angry juror may have been a stubborn lone wolf blocking consensus mr pirro , a successful real estate lawyer and republican lobbyist , and his brother and accountant , anthony g pirro , are accused of improperly deducting 12 million in personal expenses as business writeoffs prosecutors have portrayed albert pirro as a crook driven by greed defense lawyers have said he was often too preoccupied with making deals and doing business to pay close attention to bookkeeping details mr pirro is the husband of jeanine f pirro , the westchester county district attorney , who is not charged with any wrongdoing the jury has given little indication of its leanings and after today s incident , mr pirro , who turned 53 today , was not about to start handicapping his chances it means they 're working hard , mr pirro said whatever the outcome is , i accept it photo albert j pirro jr talked with his wife , jeanine f pirro , yesterday after the jury recessed for the day \( joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
albuquerque , aug 15 in the first of two days of potentially pivotal hearings in the case of the scientist accused of mishandling important nuclear weapons secrets , defense lawyers offered evidence today suggesting that he had been singled out for prosecution largely because he is chineseamerican the lawyers for the scientist , wen ho lee , who has been held for eight months on charges that he improperly downloaded some of the country s most sensitive nuclear secrets , offered affidavits and interviews from top intelligence officials suggesting that dr lee had been made the target of the investigation at least in part because of his ethnicity , while some whites who could have been suspects were not pursued although the prosecutors have denied these accusations , the defense contentions are among the reasons that asianamericans , the american civil liberties union and some other legal groups have embraced the case as an example of racial profiling the outcome of the arguments in federal district court here today are not expected to be known for several days at least as the judge , james a parker , decides whether to allow the defense to gain access to reams of government documents regarding investigations of asianamericans on security matters if the defense is given access and is able to prove that dr lee was unfairly singled out for prosecution , the judge could order that the charges in the 59count indictment be dropped another significant hearing is scheduled for wednesday , in which the defense will argue again that dr lee , who is 60 , be released on bail dr lee was denied bail twice , largely because government experts contended that he had mishandled what amounted to the crown jewels of the country s weapons program and that if the secrets found their way to a foreign power they could alter the international balance of military power the defense has affidavits from a former director of the los alamos national laboratory and other experts arguing that much of what dr lee downloaded from a secure computer at los alamos was either already available publicly or would be of modest use or none to most countries , and was not even given a secret classification until after dr lee had been fired last year in addition , the judge had earlier appeared to rely heavily on government accusations that dr lee had deceived another los alamos scientist when he used the other person s computer to do the downloading the defense says it now has evidence that no such deception took place

anaheim , calif , aug 13 roger clemens came to the big leagues as a power pitcher , and after agreeing to a contract that will endure beyond his 40th birthday , clemens said he intended to finish his career as a power pitcher when he cannot throw hard , he will not throw at all and clemens still throws very hard the best working definition of a power pitcher radar guns not required might be how opposing hitters respond in lateafternoon shadows the anaheim angels reacted as if they heard clemens s fastball better than they saw it in tonight s twilight clemens scattered four hits over six and twothirds innings and helped shut down the angels , 41 , salvaging the last game of the threegame series for the yankees \( 6350 \) they will begin a threegame series in texas on monday clemens \( 106 \) is expected to sign his contract extension this week he is obligated to play two years for the yankees and the yankees are obligated to pay him 309 million for the 2001 and 2002 seasons , an average of 1545 million a year the highest in baseball history it will be the fourth time in clemens s career that he will hold the distinction of earning the highest annual average salary of any pitcher he has 257 career victories and 3 , 446 career strikeouts he struck out only two tonight , but he was overpowering he made no effort to conceal his aggressive approach in the early innings of this game , which started at 5 pm , pacific time the sun sets behind the stands on the thirdbase side here , and when the game started , the shadows cloaked the 60 feet 6 inches between home plate and the mound the lights of edison field were turned on , but they had no effect until the middle innings these are almost the worst possible conditions for hitting because the background is in sunlight and the face of the ball is blackened , like a lunar eclipse you cannot see the spin on the ball , scott brosius said you just look for the dot and swing , david justice said clemens seized the opportunity he threw 14 pitches in the first inning all fastballs ranging from 92 miles an hour to 95 mph and there was nothing but unsure swings from the angels , who were flailing in the dark he knew , said mo vaughn , the anaheim slugger he s a veteran clemens started the second inning with a 92mph fastball and needed only 10 pitches in the inning , mixing in a couple of splitfingered fastballs clemens said afterward that he had hoped to use his splitter more , but it was never really working and he stuck with the fastball he was in a steady rhythm by the third inning , standing tall on the rubber , driving toward the plate , fastball after fastball , getting the ball back from catcher jorge posada and attacking again clemens whipped a 91mph fastball over the outside corner to kevin stocker for a called third strike posada , possessed by clemens s tempo , excitedly rose to his feet and fired to third to start the toss around the infield , and brosius had to jump to spear the ball clemens threw 13 pitches in the third , all fastballs that was the most explosive i 've seen his fastball , said darin erstad , the anaheim left fielder he might 've had the same speed in the past , but tonight he had a good downward movement the score was close and every pitch was pivotal as clemens s energy drained out of him by the fourth inning his velocity was down , and he mixed a changeup and slider with his fastball anaheim s ramon ortiz is a power pitcher , like clemens , and the yankees took many weak swings against him so the yankees offered passive resistance they waited for ortiz to throw strikes , which he could not do consistently bernie williams walked to open the second , and justice was hit by a pitch posada walked with two outs , loading the bases brosius fell behind , one ball and two strikes , and fouled off three straight pitches before drawing three straight pitches out of the strike zone for a runscoring walk after two innings , the yankees had more runs \( one \) than hits \( none \) they added a run in the fourth in similar fashion justice poked a single through the right side with a noball , twostrike count , and ortiz walked martinez and posada bases loaded , once more after the third inning , yankees manager joe torre complained mildly to eric cooper , the first base umpire , that ortiz was repeatedly moving the ball in his glove with runners on base and that it should be a balk now , with the bases loaded and the yankees' bench still chirping about a balk , ortiz leaned back slightly on the rubber , drew up his hands in front of his face and wiped his nose cooper jabbed a finger in ortiz s direction , calling a balk that allowed justice to score clemens carried a 21 lead into the bottom of the seventh , his pitch count nearing 100 , and his effort had sapped his energy after the pinchhitter tim salmon singled , torre replaced clemens with mike stanton , who promptly picked off the pinchrunner benji gil to end the inning clemens was waiting for stanton at the top step of the dugout , hand extended , his pitching line final four hits , three walks and just one run he has not been charged with a loss since june 9 , the last time he allowed more than three runs the yankees added a couple of runs in the eighth , the rally set up when justice somehow recovered after being fooled by a breaking ball and pulled a single to right field mariano rivera retired all five batters he faced for the save , and the weary clemens , marching toward 300 victories , sounded tired afterward he knows he will wake up monday , he said , and his body will suffer for his effort today , all in the life of a power pitcher photos roger clemens won his sixth straight decision , limiting the angels to one run in six and twothirds

as worldcom inc continues to negotiate for the justice department s approval for the company s pending 115 billion acquisition of the sprint corporation , people close to the talks said in recent days that the discussions could lead to the sale of the sprint brand and its longdistance service key members of the justice department team reviewing the merger plan have said privately that components of the deal , particularly in the longdistance telephone business , may violate antitrust laws but it is unlikely that those concerns will derail the entire transaction instead , washington is expected to require that parts of sprint be sold to outside companies as a condition for the merger s approval but , like br'er rabbit being thrown into the briar patch , there is a distinct possibility that at least some of the sprint units the government wants to be spun off are those that worldcom was least interested in acquiring , anyway and any compromise acceptable to worldcom is certain to include what it most desires sprint s nationwide wireless operation last week , bernard j ebbers , chief executive of worldcom , and william t esrey , his counterpart at sprint , met joel i klein , head of the justice department s antitrust division , and talks are expected to continue into june it has been clear since the worldcomsprint deal was announced last year that worldcom already the no 1 internet carrier around the globe would not be allowed to acquire sprint s internet business that may be somewhat disappointing for worldcom , but it certainly will not come as any surprise the plans of the regulators and of worldcom s executives may diverge , however , regarding just what is meant by sprint s internet business and that should be no surprise , either indeed , after worldcom agreed to acquire mci in 1999 , regulators required that mci s internet business be spun off but in the eyes of at least some communications experts , that spinoff was as flawed in its execution as it was noble in its intent what happened \? regulators allowed worldcom to sell mci s internet customers and internet switches to cable wireless of britain , but did not require that the deal transfer ownership of any longdistance fiber optic communications network so while cable wireless acquired a big business , it found it difficult to generate profits from that operation because it still had to buy longhaul communications capacity from mci worldcom regulators are not likely to let themselves be outfoxed in the same way again that s why it would be a surprise if the sale of sprint s internet operation did not include at least some fiber optic assets and that will not go over nearly as well with worldcom s executives ever since acquiring the wiltel fiber optic network in 1995 , mr ebbers has recognized that sustainable profits in the telecommunications industry rest on ownership of physical assets , and he will be loathe to give up any of sprint s the same dynamic with worldcom far more willing to give up customers than network assets may very well come into play regarding sprint s longdistance telephone business as well some people at the justice department appear concerned that a combined worldcomsprint would control too much of the longdistance telephone industry if the department simply asks worldcom to sell off sprint s consumer longdistance unit , the response will probably be clear no problem mr ebbers and other members of his team have never been enamored of the consumer longdistance market as far as they are concerned , it is a lowmargin , highcost sector best left to others , like att and , perhaps in the future , the bell companies as long as regulators do not ask worldcom to sell some of sprint s fiber optic network to go along with them , worldcom would probably have no problem selling sprint s millions of residential longdistance customers to another telecommunications company as part of that discussion , justice department regulators have been expressing concern about worldcom s control of the sprint brand , say people close to the negotiations there too , it appears that worldcom would not protest too much after all , worldcom has already stripped the mci name from the combined company s formal identity far thornier than the fate of sprint s consumer longdistance business , however , will be the disposition of sprint s unit that sells longdistance phone service to business customers the regulators may well ask worldcom to sell big parts of that operation as well , but at that point worldcom is likely to throw up a whole host of arguments the longdistance phone business , worldcom executives have reasoned , is quickly becoming merely one indivisible component of a larger basket of communications services that the company sells to business customers the most likely argument goes something like this if worldcom is using a unified network to sell advanced data services in an integrated bundle along with voice communications and advanced functions to tie corporate locations together , how can it be expected to peel out the voice segment \? nonetheless , it could be done , analysts say , but it would not be easy and it remains unclear just how far down that road the justice department is prepared to go for all of the concessions that worldcom will have to make , none are likely to tarnish the deal s crown jewel sprint s wireless operation if sprint did not own a nationwide wireless telephone network , the acquisition would have never been struck worldcom and sprint may run into some minor opposition regarding the combined companies' extensive holdings of wireless licenses used for transmitting data to fixed locations but worldcom never had a mobile phone business and so the cellular component of the deal is not likely to face any serious hurdles and for mr ebbers , that appears to be the most important thing photo bernard j ebbers , chief executive of worldcom , would probably accept the loss of some sprint units \( reuters \)
the fever has broken manhattan s overthetop real estate market , on a fast roll for more than four years , has lost its frenzied upward momentum and seems to be cooling down apartment hunters , who this spring seemed caught up in a grab it now before it s gone panic , no longer have that desperate urge to buy , a desperation that resulted in bidding wars and angry recriminations within the last two months , following a rise in interest rates and a plunge in the nasdaq , bidding wars have declined , apartments have stayed on the market longer before being sold , and hundreds have even been marked down manhattan real estate prices appear to be finally leveling off one of the things everyone is beginning to feel is that the market is flat , said deborah b beck , executive vice president of the real estate board of new york in another sign of a cooling off , the real estate board measured a 14 percent drop in the number of manhattan apartments sold for the quarter ended june 30 , compared with the same period last year a significant slowdown , ms beck said at the corcoran group , sealed bids , an indicator of unusual levels of competition , were down 33 percent in july compared with july 1999 clearly , the experts say , this is not a case of the seasonal summer blahs the market s softening is most evident with cookiecutter , ordinary apartments notably fixeruppers that had been selling for extraordinary prices over the last two years , said pamela liebman , chief executive at the corcoran group brokers cite myriad examples , including a fiveroom coop at 240 east 76th street reduced in june to 535 , 000 from 615 , 000 a onebedroom at 225 central park west near 83rd street dropped to 305 , 000 from 335 , 000 and a studio at 82 irving place fell to 175 , 000 from 190 , 000 last thursday , a twobedroom at 599 west end avenue at 89th street dropped to 349 , 000 from 369 , 000 even whiteglove gold coast prewars may become a harder sell a fiveroom penthouse at 834 fifth avenue , at 64th street , one of the city s toptier coop buildings , went on the market in april priced at 79 million in late june , it was reduced to 649 million , and on july 31 , the price dropped to 58 million the edge is off the market , said jonathan miller , president of miller samuel , the appraisal firm that compiles statistics for douglas elliman , the city s biggest brokerage firm especially during the last month , mr miller said , we 're seeing much more modest appreciation , more of a return to normalcy the experts link the slowdown to the nasdaq plunge that began on april 14 , and to the federal reserve s halfpoint interest rate increase in may , the one that really had the impact , said marilyn harra kaye , president of prudential mlbkaye realty buyers wonder if they 'll get a better deal if they wait , she said if they buy now , they worry that the higher cost of mortgages will drive prices down and lower their investment the changing statistics mirror a national trend , but there is nothing to indicate the start of a slump like the one in the late 1980 s and early 90 s real estate experts noted that prices remain high the average apartment price for the period april through june was a record 854 , 704 in manhattan south of 116th street on the west side and south of 96th street on the east but that figure represents contracts signed an average of two months before in the whitehot months of february , march and april based on contracts signed in july , mr miller projected a price rise of only 1 percent , to 864 , 000 \( the average price recorded in 1995 was 414 , 187 \) while none of the experts were willing to predict where the manhattan market would be by the end of the year , no one labeled the cooling temporary one thing seems certain one of the biggest sellers' markets in new york history has fractionally tilted more toward the buyer and the buyers are noticing for the first time in his two years of looking , tom pappas , a midtown lawyer , has spotted the same properties showing up week after week on his internet searches but he is not biting until their prices go down then , he vowed , i 'll be there buck morillas , who sold his house in east hampton , ny , and is prowling for a great 800 , 000 loft in the flatiron district , says he thinks he is getting close six months ago , the agents were saying , 'this place is going to fly tonight , so you better make an offer , ' he said now the agents are whispering , 'this place is very negotiable' for their part , brokers insist that no one is grasping at lowball offers , but they concede that now , more sellers are accepting modest reductions off the asking price in interviews , agents said that today s buyers were more cautious and that they spent more time looking , but that many did , in the end , buy and at a good price they reject comparisons to the late 1980 s , after the october 1987 stock market debacle , when the real estate market dipped albeit very slowly into the real estate recession of the early 1990 s for one thing , they say , that was the time of a glut of new , sometimes poorly built condominiums this time ,

what is missing from the debate about a proposed seniorhousing development in melville town sees pressure by suffolk on houses , aug 20 is the unquestionable need for homes for lowincome families the town of huntington has identified nearly 6 , 000 households that are at or below 30 percent of the median income the town s plan repeatedly acknowledges that affordable rental housing is insufficient to meet the needs of these families , and notes that more than 70 percent of existing rental housing is substandard , rendering the units less than fully habitable the town s consolidated plan is required by the federal department of housing and urban development , in return for which the town receives more than a million dollars a year , primarily to provide decent housing for residents of low and moderate income it is a shame that of the 1 , 375 units proposed at the melville site , none will be for lowincome families instead , most of the prospective residents will be seniors moving from large homes they no longer need , seniors in a position to pay 175 , 000 to 350 , 000 the developer purchased this property from the state it was previously a mental health facility , providing housing and other services to the poorest mentally ill individuals it is ironic that poor families and individuals will not be able to reside in this handsome new community the owner has no entitlement to develop the property as it sees fit current zoning guidelines for the 382acre site allow approximately 190 units , requiring the developer to apply for a variance to build the 1 , 375 units proposed the town s responsibility to meet the housing needs of its lowincome families require it to refuse the developer s request not because senior housing is inappropriate and not because the school district might be overburdened , but because there are families in huntington who are without decent housing this is the most compelling need of all michael wigutow attorney , housing rights project touro law center huntington
long before movie stars like paul newman and katharine hepburn made connecticut their home , long before there were even movie stars , the state was something of a budding star itself in the early days of the business , many directors based in new york , which was a hub of moviemaking long before hollywood , came to greenwich to make their films greenwich was both convenient , because of its train service from manhattan , and vastly scenic only 45 minutes from broadway , it had authentic settings , from federal farmhouses to the summer cottages of the supremely rich d w griffith , who went on to fame as the director of birth of a nation and intolerance , made his first movie in the town , and according to local lore , episodes of the serial perils of pauline were filmed in belle haven , a section of greenwich the opening scene of when knighthood was in flower was made in old greenwich during the summer of 1922 the movie starred marion davies , who would become more well known for her boyfriend , william randolph hearst , than for her acting word got around , and it seems to me everybody went there to see it , said william finch , greenwich s town historian emeritus he remembers watching the filming with his parents and brother from their open car that s exactly what it looked like ! he said when shown the production still of miss davies on her gondola it impressed me at the time , and marion davies impressed me always no one knows exactly how many movies were made in greenwich during this time , and many of the movies have since been lost , but in historical accounts of the movie industry and in memoirs , it becomes clear that the town was a favored location during the era of silent films it is believed that greenwich was first used as a location in 1907 in the summer of 1908 , griffith came to old greenwich \( then called sound beach \) to shoot his first directing assignment for the company it was a 10minute short called the adventures of dollie , one reel in which a young girl is kidnapped by gypsies , takes a harrowing and improbable trip down the rapids in a barrel and is rescued by two boys fishing downstream as dollie s mother , he cast his wife , linda arvidson , but only after testing her first you 're good , he told her quite surprised me none of the studio regulars would do for dollie s father , so griffith strolled up broadway in manhattan scanning the crowd for someone who looks as though he owned more than a cigarette he chose arthur johnson , a handsome sixfooter and an actor as luck would have it , but one with no knowledge of picture acting you do n't need to know , griffith said confidently just meet me at the grand central depot at nine o'clock tomorrow morning it s impossible to tell from the film just where in sound beach the adventures of dollie was made it was the country back then , with open fields and unpaved streets common sense says that it must have been within walking distance of the train station because the cameraman would probably have been carrying his equipment and the actors their makeup and costumes the scenes of the two boys fishing do look like the town s binney park or one of the streams running through what was then called laddin s rock farm it was a lovely place , ms arvidson said in her 1925 memoirs , when the movies were young the blackeyed susans were all abloom , she continued , and everywhere was green grass even though it was nearly midsummer before moving to california in 1912 , griffith shot at least four other onereelers for the american mutoscope and biograph company in greenwich the country doctor and what the daisy said featured a goldenhaired actress named mary pickford two period pieces , the golden supper and the cardinal s conspiracy , were filmed at indian harbor , the 80acre waterfront estate of commodore elias c benedict it s hard to remember that the movie business was once considered the artistic equivalent of picking coal off the railroad tracks commodore benedict was a man of wealth and influence , but differed from his contemporaries in one respect he got a kick out of pictures and picture people , gave them the run of his estate , and treated them to champagne and cigars not so elizabeth anderson , the owner of milbank , at 350 acres the largest private estate in greenwich \( the wroughtiron gates opposite the crocus hill in front of the second congregational church on putnam avenue are all that remain \) in 1909 a group of moviemakers passed by milbank , liked the look of the place and , ignoring the private property signs , drove onto the grounds , found the estate manager and slipped him a 20 to let them return the following day they were rehearsing in a barn when down the path marched a fuming ms anderson trembling and weakkneed we looked about us , ms arvidson recalled was she really saying those dreadful things to us \? and so we folded our tents and shamefacedly slunk away

east rutherford , nj , oct 30 jim fassel knows his giants are not the only 62 football team in town he also knows his giants have ascended to this midseason perch quietly , while the 62 jets have been the highwire attraction , forever a step from disaster or distinction today at giants stadium , fassel said he did not care about perceptions or publicity but this being the year of the subway series , in his own understated way , the giants coach delivered a crosstown message we 're 62 , and that puts us near the front of the class , fassel said we could go play with most people who have that record we 're a blue collar , lunchpail team if people want to leave us in the background , we 'll just keep going about our business i 'd rather make a whole lot of noise later than beat your own drum now but after washington s 2721 loss to tennessee tonight , the giants are in sole possession of first place in the national football conference east the jets , who lost to buffalo on sunday , are not the only other 62 team in the national football league , but they are a natural point of comparison and with the urging of reporters they became a popular topic for fassel today i'm happy for the jets , said fassel , whose giants won their third consecutive game sunday with a 247 dismantling of philadelphia the fashion that they 've won games creates attention i understand that but you 're measured on your record and i 've told our guys , that for the most part , we 'll write the story of the season with how we play and fassel likes the way the giants have been playing he wants to score more points , but he does not feel the need to apologize for his team s methodical efforts sometimes when i hear people talk about our games , i want to say 'jeez , we did win the game , ' fassel said we 've been in control of the games we 've won we 've played much like we 've wanted to play sometimes when you 're winning , you do n't have big passing numbers that s just the way it is there s a process , and we have to build through it running the football is the foundation the passing gets the points we have to do one , then the other and running the football helps with the passing game , it controls the clock , rests the defense and gets us physically into the game sunday , the giants were actually fairly balanced , running the ball 44 times and attempting to pass 40 times led by the rookie ron dayne s 93 rushing yards , they gained 152 yards on the ground but quarterback kerry collins had 232 passing yards throwing to six different players the giants reversed fassel s stated offensive formula early , with 9 pass plays in their first 12 plays from scrimmage as the game wore on , it was the pass that set up the run as dayne had 20 secondhalf rushing carries most of all , the giants offense succeeded because collins was rarely under pressure in the pocket and the offensive line opened holes for dayne and tiki barber left tackle lomas brown had an especially good game , limiting the effectiveness of philadelphia s defensive end hugh douglas , who came into the game leading the league in sacks defensively , the giants pressured eagles quarterback donovan mcnabb and sacked him four times by holding the philadelphia ground game to 72 yards , they also made the eagles' offense one dimensional today , fassel could not have seemed more at ease and content he could even joke about the league s instantreplay challenge system fassel had been 0 for 7 in such challenges , but he finally got the officials to agree with him on one sunday i knew i was absolutely right , fassel said of the 9yard reception caught by philadelphia s charles johnson that was eventually ruled out of bounds if i had n't gotten that one reversed , i tell you i do n't know what i would have done , he said fassel gave his players today off , a policy he has adopted after victories in the last month asked how many mondays he expected his players to have off the rest of the season , fassel answered , as far as i'm concerned , i 'd like to have eight more of them off extra points coach jim fassel said he did not think his players would look past sunday s opponent , the cleveland browns \( 27 \) , and begin to think about the giants' home game against the st louis rams on nov 12 our team realizes the seriousness of all of it , fassel said i'm not going to let them think any less fassel said that cornerback jason sehorn \( cracked rib \) might do some light practicing this week sehorn will not play this weekend fassel said that several players had minor injuries but none that should affect his starting lineup sunday
mondo desperado by patrick mccabe 240 pages harper collins 24 the title of patrick mccabe s new novel , mondo desperado , comes , of course , from the 1963 italian movie mondo cane , that socalled shockumentary that chronicled the varieties of human bizarreness around the world mr mccabe s contrived little stories do not range so widely about the globe rather they chronicle the eccentricities and selfdeceptions of people living in the small irish town of barntrosna , a onehorse town whose innocent facade hides a reality as shocking as any seething mass of serpents uncovered by two arms sunk deep in a barrel of seemingly fragrant , beguiling potpourri it is mr mccabe s conceit that these stories were written not by him but by a local hack named phildy hackball , and it s easy for the reader to understand why he would have wanted to hide behind such a fictitious author although mondo desperado borrows the premise of sherwood anderson s winesburg , ohio a series of tales depicting individual grotesques meant to provide a group portrait of a town it does so with none of anderson s insight or conviction for that matter , the book pales next to mr mccabe s own earlier works like the butcher boy \( 1993 \) while reprising many of his favorite themes like the butcher boy , mondo desperado limns the suffocating atmosphere of smalltown life and the alienation experienced by those who defy its provincial mores and like breakfast on pluto \( 1998 \) , it chronicles the efforts of such outsiders to cope by fleeing into fantasy and dreams the difference is that the enormous sympathy mr mccabe lavished on his earlier heroes most notably on francie brady , the lonely , deranged boy turned psychotic murderer in the butcher boy is nowhere to be found in these pages the characters in mondo desperado are flimsy , laughable creatures , stupid , selfdeluding or venal , and quite bereft of the humanity the author s earlier protagonists possessed several of the tales in mondo desperado depict people who allow paranoia or wishful thinking to push them into embarrassing delusions the narrator of hot nights at the gogo lounge allows a friend s casual remarks to convince him that his wife has a secret life , hanging out in basement dives with twobit musicians , popping quaaludes and shoveling gin like it s going out of fashion the narrator of my friend bruce lee believes that the famous kungfu expert has come to his apartment and shared a chinese dinner with him , despite all the evidence that his friends have made him the butt of a practical joke and the narrator of i ordained the devil persuades himself that a successful rival priest is actually satan in disguise , attributing to him virtually every untoward act that has occurred in the village in recent years though these characters tell us their stories directly , mr mccabe makes their naivete laughable instead of being invited to share their inner lives , we are asked to stand back and laugh at their dimness and gullibility this same dynamic is at work in the story of tom gully , a farmer with a huge boil in the middle of his forehead when tom meets a beautiful , flirtatious woman in a bar , he thinks he has finally found true love when he wakes up the next morning , he is shocked shocked ! to discover that the woman has disappeared with all his money other stories in mondo desperado showcase mr mccabe s gothic imagination but while he managed , in the butcher boy , to blend the supremely ordinary and the startlingly horrific into a seamless whole , here his shock effects seem like shallow afterthoughts , clumsily grafted onto his tales for the sole purpose of unnerving the reader one story ends with a boy being blown to bits with an air pump inserted into his rectum another , with a man and his nephew being beaten , kidnapped and forced to perform in pornographic films a third tale of persecution and revenge concerns a family curse brought on by a doctor s botched efforts to create a hybrid being that s part human , part mule like mondo cane , these stories are meant to make us marvel at the oddness of the human condition , but mr mccabe s writing is so awkward that we come away thinking , merely , that his tales are contrived the luck of dympna wrigley is a dark and thoroughly implausible fairy tale about a woman who abandons her mother , becomes a whore , and then meets her prince charming and the forbidden love of noreen tiernan tells an equally hokey story about a sweet , goodhearted nurse who leaves barntrosna for london and becomes a razorwielding crook when her mother and fiance turn up in the city looking for her , she obediently leaves her new life behind and returns home with them these stories do not come together to create a persuasive portrait of barntrosna nor do they stand on their own as compelling fictions instead of giving us a window on a desperate world , they give us the spectacle of a gifted writer inexplicably masquerading as a hack photo patrick mccabe \( carolyn djanogly harpercollins \)
after losing only once in 15 games , the devils lost twice in two nights over the weekend one player was badly cut , and coach robbie ftorek might draw a fine or suspension after tossing a bench onto the ice in the 31 loss in detroit on saturday night ftorek threw the bench because he was so incensed at the officials for not calling a penalty against detroit s mathieu dandenault , who sent jay pandolfo crashing into the end boards pandolfo s forehead and facial cuts were so severe that he required 84 stitches , mostly over his left eye i never lost consciousness , but i knew i hit my head hard , pandolfo said i got the cut on my forehead for crashing against the boards , but the rest is because someone s skate caught me while he was falling on the ice behind martin brodeur s goal , the devils' sergei brylin fell backward over pandolfo brylin s skate opened up the most dangerous cut over pandolfo s left eye pandolfo is almost certain to be placed on injured reserve the national hockey league may take action against ftorek as early as today one mitigating element for ftorek is that he did n't toss the bench toward an official but threw it on the ice in a moment of frustration ftorek would not say whether he expected to be suspended , but ron ego , the supervisor of officials at the game , said a suspension for ftorek was rather unlikely none of the devils interviewed about the incident blamed ftorek for losing his cool in the game between the league s two conference leaders for a game of such significance , especially since it was the teams' only meeting in the regular season , it seemed peculiar that the league did not assign two referees i do n't blame robbie he s a fiery guy , defenseman lyle odelein said he was frustrated , we all were , that a player got hurt like that and nobody did anything about it bobby holik , who is usually the most outspoken of all the devils , was visibly upset that there was no call on dandenault i know this is a democracy , but do n't get me going , holik said do n't get me to say anything there is an unwritten rule that players are not allowed to talk about officials ftorek threw the bench to the delight of the sellout crowd immediately after kirk maltby scored the third goal for the red wings it came with 6 minutes 44 seconds left in the period in the same sequence during which pandolfo was hurt the moment drew more laughs from the crowd when it was announced that the devils were assessed a bench minor slap shots the developments in the loss to detroit overshadowed the fact that patrik elias s teamrecord points streak came to an end after 15 consecutive games sergei nemchinov , who has been nursing an injured abdominal muscle since christmas , skated very hard on saturday and is expected to be taken off injured reserve

united nations , nov 15 a leader of india s dalits , the untouchable underclass of more than 160 million people whose campaign for an end to discrimination is rarely heard in the west , is being honored this month by two major american human rights organizations seeking to raise awareness of the issue on tuesday in new york , martin macwan , a lawyer who founded the national campaign on dalit human rights , was named by human rights watch as one of five outstanding human rights defenders around the world this year and in washington on nov 21 , mr macwan will receive the 2000 robert f kennedy human rights award last year , human rights watch published the first booklength report on the conditions of the dalits and the organization is now also lobbying to put the cause on the agenda of the united nations' first international conference on racism and discrimination next summer the fact that we 're honoring a martin from india reminds us of yet another martin from the us who fought racial discrimination in this country , said stephen rickard , director of the rfk center for human rights , which will give mr macwan his award in washington in an interview today , mr macwan , 41 , described the lives of people who are deprived of land ownership , required to drink and eat from separate utensils , barred from wells and temples , forced into bonded labor and made to clean latrines with their bare hands and carry human waste away from the homes of caste hindus the untouchables , literally outcasts , are also vulnerable to violence at the hands of uppercaste hindus and the police , he said dalits who convert to other religions , to escape the hindu caste system , face double jeopardy in an era of hindu nationalism , said mr macwan , who is a christian mr macwan , who was born into a dalit family in gujarat , said in an interview today that as a student he watched the beatings and sometimes the killings of fellow untouchables , and decided to establish an organization to help them he called it the navsarjan \( new creation \) trust more recently , he formed the national campaign on dalit human rights , linking similar organizations in 14 indian states india has given opportunities to dalits the country s president , k r narayanan , was born an untouchable it also has laws forbidding discrimination , and has introduced affirmative action programs to bring dalits into politics and educational institutions but for a majority of the most disadvantaged , abuses continue the indian government has been very successful at manufacturing an image as the world s largest democracy with a very progressive constitution and many progressive laws on the books , said smita narula , who wrote the 1999 human rights watch report , broken people caste violence against india s 'untouchables we do n't dispute any of this , she said , but none of the laws are implemented and the constitution is not enforced mr macwan described caste discrimination as an institutionalized system that has allowed , for example , the highest brahmin caste , with 35 percent of the population , to hold 78 percent of judicial positions and about half of parliamentary seats he said the indian government has argued that caste a complex division of society with religious , cultural and economic roots is a domestic issue mr macwan disagrees we say that india did support the us civil rights movement in the 1960 s , and also the antiapartheid struggle in south africa , he said in this era of the globalization of markets and of human rights , no country can claim that it s a domestic matter it s a universal concern photo martin macwan , the founder of a human rights campaign for dalits \( marilynn k yee the new york times \)

to the editor re the new , flexible math meets parental rebellion \( front page , april 27 \) for many elementary math teachers schooled in traditional methods , relearning math on constructivist principles was a thrilling and motivating experience they came to see mathematics in a new light , its operations and abstractions all fitting together in beautiful , logical ways this happy effect on teachers alone is enough to recommend constructivism but not to the exclusion of traditional methods children need the scaffolding provided by memorizing basic math facts and certain useful algorithms on which to construct their knowledge none of us have ever learned and understood any complex system without memorizing whole blocks of facts and procedures even before we completely understood their meaning hy edelstein northampton , mass , april 28 , 2000

purchase , ny rumors of the death of painting circulated widely during the 1970 s , only to be disproved by subsequent decades but it seems that a less publicized but possibly better founded rumor of death has been in play recently that of welded sculpture in an essay accompanying welded ! sculpture of the 20th century at the neuberger museum of art here , the exhibition s curator , judy collischan , raises the issue only to deny it welding continues to be a viable means of expression for many artists , she writes but this show a broad but unfocused , mostly mediocre selection of more than 90 metal sculptures from the early 30 s to the late 90 s does little to discourage the thought that welded sculpture as a genre may belong more to the past than to the future the tradition of 20thcentury welded sculpture began in the 1920 s with the spanish metalsmith julio gonzalez , who learned welding in a renault factory his cubist assemblages inspired his friend picasso , who made some of his own and the works of gonzalez and picasso , in turn , inspired david smith , an american who might be called the picasso of welding , so inventive and prolific was his output from the 1930 s into the 1960 s finally , the english sculptor anthony caro , inspired by smith , brought welded sculpture to a climax of formalist daring and elegance it can be argued , then , that the core tradition of welded sculpture coincides with the rise and fall of modernist abstraction but this may be too narrow a view artists used welding to branch off in any number of directions , including abstract expressionist , minimalist , pop and other representational and abstract modes it is this broader view that the neuberger exhibition favors anything in which heat was used to join metal parts qualifies unfortunately , this inclusive philosophy has led to a confusing lack of discrimination in the selection and representation of artists , and in distinguishing among different kinds of welded sculpture this show could use an editor it appears that the project was too ambitious for the resources of the neuberger , the museum on the purchase college campus of the state university of new york major works by major figures are not easy to procure on a college museum s budget gonzalez and picasso are represented , by just three small works the gonzalez , an eightinch cubist figure in silver , is a lovely little classic from 1932 but the two picassos a small , gumbylike figure made from cut and folded sheet metal and a man s head painted on folded sheet steel are from the early 1960 s and have little to do with his innovative , cubismbased metal assemblages of the late 20 s and early 30 s none of the three works by david smith show him to best advantage a fanciful 1945 billiard player assembled from picassoid and miroesque parts steel drawing i , also from 1945 , a flat plate of steel with diagrammatic lines cut through it and a comparatively small voltri xvi \( 1962 \) , a steelworking bench with industrial parts attached with works by comparatively minor artists like theodore roszak , herbert ferber and seymour lipton taking up as much or more space nearby , smith s towering significance is obscured there are good pieces by richard stankiewicz , who made formally exacting yet quirkily animated assemblages of rusted found junk in the 1950 s , and a couple of fine , vintage crushed autobody sculptures by john chamberlain but two of the most important sculptors of the 60 s , caro and mark di suvero , present minor pedestal sculptures , while the far less significant jason seley is represented by a sizable and conspicuously hideous piece made of chrome car bumpers ms collischan gets closer to the right balance in her useful , extensively illustrated catalog \( published by the museum and hudson hills press \) here one finds longer entries with multiple reproductions of other , more important works by the most influential artists \( including some , like naum gabo and jean tinguely , not in the show \) and briefer entries on less important artists like david hare and harold cousins if the show were more like the book , especially in representing the first three or four decades , it could have been a terrific exhibition besides the quality problem , there are conceptual issues a large piece by donald judd , for example , a row of four galvanized cubes joined by a single blue bar , may have welding in it , but unlike david smith s work , which is unimaginable without it , welding was not essential for judd his box works are , as often as not , joined together by screws welding seems incidental to the kinetic work of george rickey , too , who is more interested in the choreography of mechanical movement than in the kind of compositional freedom that welding offers and one of the more interesting new sculptures in the show , jonathan kirk s burning chamber , a funky , neatly made sheet metal construction representing some kind of fantastic industrial structure , could as easily have been riveted or screwed together as welded framed in the right way , such works might deserve a place in this kind of exhibition , but mixed in randomly they are distracting and puzzling that there is a more narrowly definable welded sculpture tradition continuing into the 1990 s is affirmed by many works in the show wellcomposed assemblages by peter reginato , lee tribe , fletcher benton and david annesley reflect the core gonzalezpicassosmith tradition the most impressive piece in this vein is a big , open sculpture that looks like a giant bear trap , by william tucker while artists like mr reginato , mr tribe or mr annesley have a reverent , custodial relationship to the tradition , others relate to it in a more witty way the effect of nancy graves s dr seussstyle assemblage of festively painted , cast bronze plant forms deborah butterfield s remarkably lifelike horse made from found pieces of rusted metal and judy pfaff s expansive , rickety cloud of bedsprings , wire and tin cans all depend in significant measure on their clever play with early modernist modes but whether they approach the tradition earnestly or mischievously , what is notable about all these artists is their retrospective stance for them , welded sculpture does not have the shock of the new that it had for picasso and smith now it is a solidly established tradition , to be honored or spoofed in some cases , like the small , neatly made bowlshaped works by ann sperry and jenny lee or a basketlike object of woven wire by kendall buster , it begins to look as much like craft as art conceivably , a different selection of contemporary artists might have made a case for something more urgent happening in contemporary welding this show makes it hard to avoid concluding that welding by itself is too limiting for today s most adventurous artists welded ! sculpture of the 20th century is at the neuberger museum of art

one of antonio vivaldi s ardent admirers was his contemporary johann sebastian bach in the first third of the 18th century music publishing on an international scale was in its infancy bach himself engraved his clavierubung on copper plates , serving as his own production team , publicist and marketing director when vivaldi s scores made their way to germany and came before him , bach either copied them in his own hand or transcribed them , often in different keys and for different instruments frequently textures and counterpoint were filled out until a generation ago vivaldi pieces in bach s hand were misattributed by musicologists i solisti veneti , an italian baroque orchestra , came to avery fisher hall as part of the mostly mozart festival on thursday night music by vivaldi and his great transcriber were interleaved , the evening ending with the italian s b minor concerto for four violins followed by bach s version transposed a tone down and using four harpsichords bach , possessing what was arguably music s most profound mind , might have envied his colleague s easy gallantry and mercurial sense of drama this indeed was a german who interested himself deeply in french and italian musical fashions while on the surface leading the life of a provincial northern burgher in the transcriptions one senses vivaldi s spirit being moved somewhat to the background but bach learned much from his innovations , especially the increasing separation of solo parts from orchestra parts these devices were the beginnings of the virtuoso concerto form as practiced from the end of the 18th century until today bach , however , also saw the harmonic implications beneath vivaldi s high drama and could not resist spelling them out the result is an imposed density that sounds far more german than italian let it first be said that a full house at fisher hall loved i solisti veneti , and who could argue that this group of about 25 was not an amiable lot to have around for an evening \? i could search through lexicons of diplomatic language , but the unavoidable fact is that they were not very good in the players' favor was a gleaming tutti sound that filled this big hall no one , furthermore , would begrudge them their florid approach to baroque style , their modern instruments or even their conductor claudio scimone s stagy use of terraced dynamics descending into triple and quadruple pianissimos i solisti veneti was founded by mr scimone in 1959 , but on thursday it sounded like a collection of strangers at a first rehearsal there were safe landings on strong beats , but what happened in between turned out to be anyone s guess mr scimone waved his baton with great elegance and grace but what transpired in front of him was muddle and confusion the violin soloists came out of the orchestra , and none were technically strong francesco finotti was a dignified keyboard player giuseppe falco s oboe in the marcello c minor concerto created a pleasant sound and a lot of shaky rhythmic definition yet who of us should complain \? the sounds were sweet the incompetence was almost lovable and the audience had a very good time photo claudio scimone conducting i solisti veneti , a baroque orchestra he founded , in works by bach and vivaldi at fisher hall on thursday \( chris lee for the new york times \)
washington , april 20 federal payments to provide home health care for the elderly have plummeted in the last two years , forcing many medicare patients to spend more time in hospitals and nursing homes , health care providers say the trend has surprised and alarmed advocates for the elderly , health policy experts and many members of congress new government data , compiled by the congressional budget office , show that medicare spending on home health care dropped 45 percent in the last two fiscal years to 97 billion in 1999 , from 149 billion in 1998 and 175 billion in 1997 the sharp decline in spending stems from changes congress adopted in 1997 to slow the growth of medicare the changes limited payments to home care agencies , which provide a wide range of medical and social services to people who are so sick or disabled that they cannot leave their homes senator susan collins , republican of maine , said , the medicare home health cutbacks have been far deeper and more widereaching than congress ever intended the figures from the budget office do not show how much payments to hospitals and nursing homes may have increased as a result of the cutbacks in home health care nor do they show how many people simply go without treatment after losing home health benefits , or how many such patients have died but health care providers and lawyers for the elderly say they have evidence people are going uncared for about 36 million people received home health care services through medicare in 1997 the number dropped to 3 million in 1998 and has continued to decline , though official figures for 1999 are not yet available marilyn moon , a public trustee of the medicare trust fund since 1995 , said most people were caught by surprise at the extent of the reductions we expected home health spending to grow more slowly than in the past but i do n't think anybody predicted an actual dropoff in dollars spent on home health care a new study by the congressional budget office found that spending for home health care fell by 149 percent in 1998 and by an even more dramatic 349 percent in 1999 the cuts have become an issue in many congressional elections , as politicians try to allay voters' concerns about the future of home health care , one of the most popular medicare benefits a federal district court found last month that home health agencies in nine states , including new jersey , connecticut , california and texas , had improperly reduced or terminated home health benefits for thousands of medicare patients without giving them any notice of the cutbacks or of their right to appeal in its annual report to congress on medicare s finances , the clinton administration recently confirmed that there had been a substantial decline in the utilization of home health care services by medicare beneficiaries the reduction in the use of home health care was one of the main reasons total medicare spending dropped last year , for the first time in the 35year history of the program if congress takes no action , medicare payments for home health care will be automatically cut by an additional 15 percent next year , saving at least 5 billion over five years senator collins is leading a bipartisan effort to eliminate the 15 percent cut , which she said would seriously jeopardize access to home health services for millions of seniors her bill has 38 cosponsors 24 republicans and 14 democrats , including charles e schumer of new york and robert g torricelli of new jersey a similar effort is gaining momentum in the house , where legislation was introduced this month by representatives wes watkins of oklahoma , a republican , and william j jefferson of louisiana , a democrat carmela s coyle , senior vice president of the american hospital association , said in some communities , we are beginning to see a backup of patients in hospital beds because home health services are not available patients end up having to stay in the hospital longer that tends to be more costly and it s not where patients prefer to receive their care larry putnam , administrator of phillips county hospital in malta , mont , said our hospital has been busier since the cutbacks in home health care we attribute quite a bit of that to the fact that we ca n't provide adequate home care patients are admitted or readmitted to the hospital or to a nursing home , and both of those are more expensive than home care it seems to us a very shortsighted policy home health care agencies say they have been avoiding sicker patients , particularly those with multiple chronic conditions who require costly , intensive services , because it is difficult to care for them under the payment limits set by medicare in early 1997 , before the change in federal law , the congressional budget office predicted that medicare would spend 127 billion on home health care from 1998 to 2002 now it says spending for such care in those years will total 58 billion , a reduction of 69 billion that is more than four times what congress expected to save when it passed the 1997 law
gus hall , the zealous lifelong communist who led the american branch of the party from the cold war through political oblivion in the postsoviet era , died on friday at lenox hill hospital in manhattan he was 90 and lived in yonkers the son of an impoverished minnesota miner , mr hall became radicalized early , beginning a career as a union and communist party organizer during the depression j edgar hoover once described him as a powerful , deceitful , dangerous foe of americanism he served eight years in prison for his political views , ran for president four times and never apologized for or wavered from the increasingly marginalized ideology he championed by the end of his life he had become a lonely communist stalwart in a postcommunist world those who sought him out for interviews at party headquarters on west 23rd street in manhattan found a genial whitehaired man presiding over a museum of history , as he put it pictures of his family shared space with a portrait of lenin \( a gift from leonid i brezhnev \) a wood sculpture from fidel castro and a tapestry of karl marx , courtesy of erich honecker , the former leader of east germany the struggle between those who own the wealth and those whose labor produces the wealth is one flaw in capitalism that will lead to socialism , mr hall said in 1996 , repeating the familiar marxist formulation mr hall was first elected general secretary of the communist party , usa , in 1959 , when the federal government considered the organization an outpost of the kremlin and all its members potentially dangerous subversives mr hall s message won few converts , and his four presidential campaigns , from 1972 to 1984 , met with yawning indifference in his best showing , the 1976 election , he amassed 58 , 992 votes , about 19 , 000 more than lyndon h larouche , the eccentric candidate who had accused queen elizabeth ii and henry a kissinger , among others , of having ties to drug traffickers yet , in the communist world , mr hall remained an important figure he enjoyed the patronage of every soviet head of state , from nikita s khrushchev to mikhail s gorbachev , and was received as a dignitary on his yearly pilgrimages to moscow a high point came in 1981 when he addressed the 26th party congress , at the invitation of mr brezhnev , the soviet leader mr hall most esteemed he was less admiring of mr gorbachev , whose reforms a few years later , mr hall said , literally destroyed the basis for socialism as long as the cold war raged , however , mr hall s soviet sponsors delighted in the presence of this unmistakably american comrade , an authentic product of the working class , nearer in spirit to joe sixpack , it seemed , than to joe stalin a rockjawed , barrelchested sixfooter , mr hall weighed more than 200 pounds and had the powerful hands of the lumberjack and steelworker he had been in his youth simple in his tastes and habits , he was married to one woman , elizabeth turner , for 65 years , living with her in the threebedroom house they bought in a middleclass neighborhood in yonkers in 1962 she survives him , as do his two children , barbara and arvo , and three grandchildren to his adversaries , mr hall s roughandready manner was a cynical pose that concealed a dedicated apparatchik even political associates sometimes found mr hall s obeisance to the soviet union excessive , and they grumbled , especially in his later years , that his inflexible views and dictatorial personality were hampering the party and isolating it from the wider political world i told gus 10 years ago that he should be grooming new leadership , but he would have none of it , carl bloice , a former colleague , said in 1993 he sees himself as a man on a mission , the last holdout although mr hall insisted that the american communist party was an independent organization , in 1992 the moscow daily izvestia reported that mr hall had been the recipient of 40 million in soviet assistance between 1971 and 1990 radical roots lead from logging to lenin gus hall was born arvo kusta halberg on oct 8 , 1910 , in iron , minn , one of 10 children reared by matt halberg , a miner , and his wife , susannah his parents were finnish immigrants who belonged to the industrial workers of the world , the militant labor organization their son said that after mr halberg was blacklisted from the mines for joining an iww strike the family grew up in semistarvation , in a log cabin mr halberg built with his own hands mr hall left school after the eighth grade and found work in a logging camp his parents' radical teachings were reinforced , he later recalled , by the hardships of that experience , which once included bunking alongside the corpse of a man who had died on the job when you work in the woods literally from sunup to sundown and it s 50 degrees below zero and you eat slop and you make 30 a month , then what was said at home begins to make sense , mr hall once said in 1927 , he was recruited into the american communist party by his father , a member of the organization since its inception in 1919 an apprenticeship in the young communist league qualified him to attend the lenin institute in moscow , where he was trained for two years in sabotage and guerrilla tactics he returned , in 1933 , to a country devastated by the great depression a growing number of americans , convinced that the existing political and economic structures had become outmoded , were attracted to the communist party s promise of a workers' state one of many who plunged into the labor movement , mr hall made his name organizing union locals in the midwest
now that the duke ellington centennial has come and gone , with its attendant profusion of reissues , concerts and other tributes , one might assume there is no ellington music of consequence that has not been widely heard one should , however , never underestimate ellington s capacity to surprise , even a quartercentury after his death this saturday night at st peter s church in manhattan , under the auspices of the duke ellington society , five singers and a fivepiece band led by the pianist arturo o'farrill will perform 18 songs ellington wrote more than 40 years ago for a broadway show that was never produced the score was not recorded , and none of the songs ever made their way into the ellington band s repertory but for all the neglect this music has suffered over the years , it turns out to be vintage ellington one of the greatest thrills in my career was to first hear duke ellington play one of the songs he had written to my lyric , herbert martin , the show s librettist , said in an interview and now , after all these years , to be hearing the entire score performed i do n't have the words to describe how exciting it is the score of what was originally called saturday laughter but is now being called renaissance man contains echoes of other , more familiar works by ellington and his longtime collaborator billy strayhorn who , though uncredited , did at least some of the writing , and quite possibly a lot of it my home lies quiet , for example , is a majestic ballad suffused with a quiet spirituality that recalls ellington s come sunday , while i love singing and i get lonely for a plaything are ellington at his jauntiest , reminiscent of lighthearted standards like i'm beginning to see the light there are other tunes \( the star song , you walk in my dreams \) that , though recognizably ellingtonian , do not sound precisely like anything else ellington or strayhorn ever wrote that ellington should have written the score for a show nobody was willing to produce , no matter how good the music , is not all that surprising as respected as he may have been in the jazz world , duke ellington was never able to make much of a mark on the musical theater only two shows for which he wrote music made it to broadway , beggar s holiday in 1946 and poussecafe 20 years later , and neither one stayed around very long his bestknown work for the stage , the satirical revue jump for joy , lasted 11 weeks in los angeles in 1941 and got no farther ellington s career was on the upswing in the late 1950 s after several rough years his picture graced the cover of time magazine in 1956 , two years before he became involved with saturday laughter but he was still an unproven commodity in the theater world , his name less than enticing to potential investors d uke ellington never had a broadway hit , and one of the reasons for that is that he was unclassifiable , said john franceschina , a theater historian at pennsylvania state university and the author of ellington on stage \( to be published next fall by mcfarland company \) the fans of his big band just wanted to hear him with the band the people who were into rodgers and hammerstein said he did n't write according to that formula if he had been given the opportunity , he had the chops to craft a show as good as 'west side story , ' mr franceschina said and , he added saturday laughter' is the best thing he wrote for the theater it s illuminating in terms of ellington the dramatist , and i think the score also stands on its own as a piece of writing it seems likely that ellington would not have been closely involved with saturday laughter if it had been produced mr martin wrote both the book and the lyrics before ellington was even approached to write the music , and he might never have finished writing it if the show s producer , christopher manos , had not gone on the road with the ellington band to keep an eye on him and make sure he got it done ellington did not take part in the auditions for prospective backers as much as he may have liked writing for the theater , his band was always his priority also working against the show was the fact that mr martin was an even more unproven commodity than ellington a few years later , he would collaborate with the composer michael leonard on the broadway musical the yearling , but he had no track record at the time the south african setting for saturday laughter and its almost entirely black cast did not make it any easier to secure financing it was the early civil rights days , recalled mr martin , 73 , and we were told that people were n't buying tickets for black shows i was young and naive , and i never dreamed that would be the case i thought if you had a black show with music by duke ellington , it would be easy to get it on broadway saturday laughter has never been staged anywhere , except for a limited run presented by mr manos at a nonprofit theater in atlanta in 1977 and it apparently will never be seen again , at least not in its original form
boone s lick by larry mcmurtry 287 pp new york simon schuster 24 it takes just a short minute to leave a place , even though you 've lived there for years , says shay cecil , the 15yearold narrator of boone s lick larry mcmurtry s 23rd novel concerns itself with a trek made by the cecil clan the toughminded matriarch , mary margaret her dissembling brotherinlaw , seth her children , shay , g t , neva and baby marcy and granpa crackenthorpe from boone s lick , mo , to fort phil kearny , in what would later become the state of wyoming , shortly after the civil war the ostensible reason for such an arduous , dangerous journey is mary margaret s determination to hunt down her absent husband , dick , an itinerant freight hauler out west \( she s not quite sure where \) , and tell him she s quitting him even though she has a babe in arms and winter is fast approaching , mary margaret , who has tolerated her husband s long absences for 15 years , has decided she ca n't wait a moment longer so she loads up the entire family and heads north to have her showdown besides being hardheaded , the womenfolk in this family are closemouthed , says uncle seth , the undependable dick cecil s brother and business partner and the man for whom mary margaret proposes to leave her husband thus there is apparently no stopping her , and no information is forthcoming on why her need to quit dick is so urgent in the mcmurtry tradition , the journey , with its attendant escapades , is everything \( weirdly enough , though , the cecils' trek does n't begin until a third of the way through the book you can save yourself much time and ethereal throatclearing by beginning on page 118 \) mcmurtry is a master at celebrating the scruffy glory that was the american west even as he s poking fun at it and so , in a classic wagons , ho ! moment , the cecils arrive at the missouri river to begin the grand journey , their wagon piled high with all their belongings only to discover that there s nothing there i do n't see the boat , ma says i see a canoe , but we ca n't get this wagon in a canoe where s our boat , seth \? once the journey begins , the story proceeds in an episodic fashion , with adventures at every turn in one chapter , a wheel breaks free of the wagon and rolls into a gully , startling a grizzly bear that then charges the wagon in another , baby marcy toddles away from camp and finds a dead miner who s been scalped , his eyes gouged out and tossed away while these strike the reader as amusing vignettes , they are n't quite as thrilling or threatening as they should be in addition to his novels , not a few of which are modern classics \( the last picture show , terms of endearment and lonesome dove \) , the prolific mcmurtry has also written more than 30 screenplays and boone s lick reads at times like a movie treatment the author provides the setup , leaving it to the movie people \( or the imaginative reader \) to fully inhabit this world , supplying the necessary nuance , texture and subtlety still , to mcmurtry s fans , the act of following the narrative meanderings of boone s lick will be like slipping on a comfortable old sweatshirt there are fainting sheriffs , sassy mules that bite , indians who are both menacing and sympathetic , lots of hunting and lousy weather \( including a freak storm that pops up one night on the river and sweeps away one of the main characters \) and an eccentric french priest , father emile villegagnon \( pere villy , for short \) , who walks barefoot on the frozen ground and throws off his brown robes to swim buck naked on the subject of how charlie seven days , an indian who accompanies the cecils part of the way to wyoming , got his name , father villy says , the fact is i gave charlie his name when i explained that the lord made the world in six days and rested on the seventh he decided to call himself charlie seven days he has a shoshone name too , of course , but that one s even harder on the tongue than mine i think it had something to do with the sound a beaver makes when it slaps its tail on the water it s a sound you wo n't hear too often now they 've about trapped out the beaver this is mcmurtry at his best colloquial , poetic , gently elegiac the most curious part of what is clearly a minor work in a major novelist s oeuvre is the choice of shay as narrator the indomitable mary margaret is a far more interesting character a pragmatic woman who has buried four sons and supports an entire family alone and then makes an astonishingly romantic gesture at a time when daily living is already very hard , a time when people are so hungry they are forced to eat their means of transportation indeed , the novel opens with mary margaret shooting a fat roan horse out from under the local sheriff in order to feed her family mary margaret claims that she mistook the horse for an elk , and shay spends an inordinate amount of time pondering whether or not this is true instead of asking the bigger , more obvious questions why is ma putting us through all this just to leave pa , who in every real sense has already left \? what does this have to do with the nature of love and desire \? the romance at the heart of the adventure is an unconventional love triangle , and the narration should rightly belong to either mary margaret or dick cecil , her absent husband or even to seth , the union army veteran and frontiersman who has inspired mary margaret s ardor only an extraordinary teenager would be interested in and privy to the true feelings and motives of his mother , and shay , whose main concerns seem to be the usual ones of a boy his age , is not unusual and so the heartbeat of the story is heard only dimly even though we are told that seth and mary margaret are fine companions , there s little heat between them or at least none to which we , though shay s eyes , are privy boone s lick , which is the first novel in a new series , will inevitably be compared to lonesome dove , arguably mcmurty s masterpiece there s no question that while this first installment lacks the epic grandeur and depth of its predecessor , it nevertheless has the makings of a provocative work boone s lick seems to be saying that amid the wars , bar fights and horse wrangling , romance can still manage to flourish if anyone can tease out this truth for us , larry mcmurty is the one

boston pedro martinez s fingers are not fat enough to fill the holes in the fenway park dike not even he can halt the flood that threatens to sweep the red sox out of playoff contention martinez was his marvelous self for six innings yesterday , but before he slipped in the seventh , his teammates had not been there for him they had not provided him with the equilibrium he needed to steady himself on the icecovered slope that was a threerun home run by scott brosius the red sox simply had not been able to fare much better against andy pettitte in the first six innings than the yankees had against martinez one run was all pettitte allowed in the eight innings he pitched lastinning runs for both teams made it 53 , the yankees' second straight victory in what will be a fourgame confrontation with the red sox this is the team that a national magazine picked in the spring to win the world series \? this is the team that other supposedly knowledgeable observers picked to win the american league east and the pennant \? this is the team that was supposed to beat the yankees \? well , roses bloom in the spring and fade in the fall , too the only way the red sox could beat the yankees would be as the wildcard team in the league championship series but even there , the red sox suffered a setback yesterday , falling three games behind the wildcard leader , the cleveland indians , who defeated the chicago white sox the red sox have lagged more than three games off the wildcard pace before , but that was a month ago now they have only three weeks and 23 games left eight of those games are with the indians , but to make up the threegame deficit in that series they would have to win six of the eight i'm not going to tell you we 're going to catch up with the yankees , martinez said , but none of the other guys are far away from us name one that s three games ahead of us the indians the indians , he said who else \? nobody else three games \? we play them we have plenty of games to beat them we beat them three in a row in the playoffs , did n't we \? does last year count this year \? no , the pitcher said resignedly , we 've got to start over starting over after yesterday s loss could be difficult the red sox cannot afford to lose when martinez starts when brosius stepped into the batter s box in the seventh inning , the yankees had two runners on and two out at that moment , boston opponents were batting 167 against martinez 120 with runners in scoring position and 121 with runners in scoring position and two out pedro s earned run average for the season was 160 he had allowed fewer than three runs in 19 of his 25 starts , fewer than three earned runs in 20 of those starts what chance did brosius really have \? i threw him two good changeups and he swung and missed , martinez said i missed with the fastball , missed with the cutter i came back with the cutter in a 22 count and i thought i had a strikeout but fieldin culbreth , who joined the american league umpiring staff last season , called the cut fastball the third ball brosius concurred i thought everything i saw from 02 on was away , he said martinez begged to differ , though not vociferously i went and looked at the video , he said , and it looked to me like i had a strikeout , especially that deep in the game , doing it as consistently as i had the whole game i hit that corner with the fastball and the cutter i thought i should have gotten that pitch , but the umpire is human you ca n't blame him for that you have to be able to make another pitch and get him out for that pitch , martinez selected a changeup the previous two changes he swung and missed , martinez explained i said if i'm going to die with something , i might as well die with something i made him look bad he did n't even foul them off he swung over it i was hoping i could get the same result changeup was in the back of brosius' mind for the same reason , because he had looked so bad on the first two when he swung at this changeup , martinez figured brosius was waiting for it if fastball crosses your mind one time , martinez said , you swing ahead of it martinez did n't blame culbreth for the loss far from it but he did lament what he perceived as a change in umpiring styles i was in the national league for seven years , he said if you were a veteran like maddux and glavine , if you were hitting the corner , even it if was one , two , three inches out and you 're hitting it in a consistent way and you 're old enough to know what you 're doing and the umpire knew you were doing that on a consistent basis , they would give it to you at certain times that s how it used to be now you never know then , speaking of the umpire , he added in tight situations like that , you have to think that this could mean the whole season for this team , this one game , this one pitch so you have to keep your focus on the game but i do n't blame him we 're all human the yankees do n't necessarily see martinez as human joe torre , their manager , made it clear after the game that he would be very happy to see the red sox fail to reach the playoffs encountering a weapon like martinez in a short series , he suggested , could be very hazardous to a team s health
what do art museums want \? the question is a recurring one , raised at different times for different reasons but lately it has acquired a particular urgency because the answer , it increasingly seems , is that they want to be anything but art museums just look around the lineup of fall shows suggests that museum professionals , driven by the desire to be financially secure , wildly popular or socially relevant , opt for one of two alternatives exhibitions that look like upscale stores , or exhibitions that look like historical society displays this may well be the museum quandary of the oughties how to live with outrageous success and maintain an identity as a museum how to preserve and possibly improve the experience of art as art for ever larger and more diverse audiences how to benefit from cuttingedge academic theory without reducing the centrality of what the art critic dave hickey calls the visible arts in short , how to avoid mounting exhibitions that are terminally afflicted by what looks like a certifiable fear of art today s museums are under attack from arttheory ideology on one side and commerce on the other in their exhibition programs , at least , they often behave less and less like museums that is , places where the goal is the visual , largely private experience of art objects more and more they are in danger of becoming places where larger social and historical patterns are either consciously or unconsciously played out , where people of all ages are given cursory lessons in history and morality , or where consumer desire is stoked by merchandise orchestrated into artful displays that may or may not be sponsored by the maker of that merchandise this fall has brought the spectacle of a major new york museum acting like the world s longest store window that would be the guggenheim , with its overproduced , undercurated armani exhibition spiraling down the ramp although the show was sponsored by in style magazine , it coincides with a reported 15 million donation read rental fee from mr armani , a gift that the museum claims is completely unrelated similar if smaller in scale was the sorry sight of a small respected university museum suddenly turning itself out like a commodity showroom that was face to face shiseido and the manufacture of beauty , on view in september and october at new york university s grey art gallery and study center this exhibitionasdepartmentstoremakeup counter was sponsored by shiseido , the japanese cosmetics giant , and contained material drawn entirely from the company s archives , including ad campaigns and its meager art collection at the other , equally dubious , extreme is the exhibition as historical society these shows do n't replace art with desirable design commodities , as the armani show does they treat it instead as an artifact , just another manifestation of visual culture and sometimes a corrupt , suspect one at that in this approach , all objects are created equal , all present equally significant amounts of history , none should be privileged above the others the major example in this category is the los angeles county museum of art s museumwide millennial celebration , made in california art , image and identity , 19002000 , an ambitious , elaborately researched and presented undertaking that mixes paintings , sculpture , photographs , film , video and newsreel , ceramics , clothing and furniture with rock concert posters , protest broadsheets , travel brochures , orangecrate labels , racist pamphlets , newspaper clippings and much , much else the show , on view through feb 25 , reduces much of the art within its borders to illustration , often reprimanding it for ignoring oppressive labor practices or the destruction of the natural environment equally problematic , if less overtly politicized , is the metropolitan museum s art and the empire city new york , 18251861 , a discordant array of painting , sculpture , photographs , furniture , documents , clothing , ceramics and glass the show , which is uncharacteristic for the met , reflects plenty of material success but is short on genuinely significant objects or artworks and , not surprisingly , in a time as rampant with hybridization as ours , there are also exhibitions that fuse the two extremes the prominent model here is the brooklyn museum of art s hiphop nation roots , rhymes and rage , an exhibition that veers between product showroom and uptothemoment historical society , with little in the way of art in between similar events loom on the horizon in may , the met will open jacqueline kennedy the white house years selections from the john f kennedy library and museum the show is being organized by the museum s costume institute but will occupy the large iris and gerald b cantor galleries on the museum s second floor and the brooklyn museum will devote an exhibition to star wars sometime in 2002 these shows make one wonder whether this season might be remembered as a turning point for the art world , when an important , largely destructive shift in the nature of the art exhibition and the curator s craft reached full flower
santiago , chile dec 20 the supreme court dismissed kidnapping and murder charges today against gen augusto pinochet but the court ordered that the general be interrogated in 20 days , so he might be rearrested and charged again in a 4to1 decision , the judges upheld an appeals court decision last week that an investigative judge had improperly ordered the general s house arrest because he did not first seek a detailed deposition but the supreme court effectively ordered the judge , juan guzman tapia , to move forward with a process that could lead to a proper arrest under rules of due process that ruling suggested that the supreme court did not respond to subtle pressures from the military and rightwing congressmen , as some human rights advocates had feared this was a victory with some taste of defeat for pinochet , said hugo gutierrez , a human rights lawyer a lawyer for general pinochet , pablo rodriguez , said the ruling did nothing more than ratify our arguments that the arrest order on dec 1 was not legal twelve family members of people who disappeared during general pinochet s dictatorship paced the marbled corridors of the supreme court expecting a legal defeat through the morning but when they heard the announcement they cheered , bravo ! this means the process goes on , and that is what is important to us , viviana diaz , leader of the family members of the disappeared , told reporters what we want is justice so the day comes when we chileans can look one another in the eye again in another gain for the lawyers who seek to prosecute the general , the court dismissed the appeals of his lawyers that would oblige judge guzman to await results of a medical examination before interrogating the general that means that general pinochet has a chance of being charged with crimes , even if he is found mentally unfit to stand trial he faces 190 criminal complaints that accuse him of planning and ordering the killings and disappearances of more than 3 , 000 people and the torturing of tens of thousands in his 17year dictatorship , which began with the overthrow of president salvador allende , a socialist , in 1973 a trial would have been unthinkable here until general pinochet was arrested two years ago in london on a spanish warrant it remains highly unlikely that general pinochet , 85 , will ever spend a day in jail he had several minor strokes while under house arrest last year in london , and there is a good chance that doctors will find that he is not mentally competent to stand trial his lawyers say the general is hard of hearing , and thus not able to follow court testimony neurological examinations could begin in a few days at a military hospital , with the results leaving all the legal wrangling moot general pinochet was released from house arrest in britain 10 months ago , after medical authorities had found that he would not be physically able to defend himself in court even if he is found mentally , emotionally and physically able to stand trial here , it is probable that there will be months of legal maneuvering before a trial could begin after that , appeals could take years the central case involves a helicopterborne death squad , the caravan of death , commanded by a military aide to the former dictator , that picked up 77 leftists who were detained in military bases around northern chile none were seen alive again , and 19 remain missing judge guzman concentrated on that case because there is at least the theoretical possibility that some of the 19 could be alive as kidnapping victims because kidnapping is a continuing criminal act , it cannot be covered by an amnesty that the pinochet government issued to cover crimes in the first five years of the dictatorship

washington , jan 30 they were on the same platform on saturday , george bush and george w bush , father and son , former president and wouldbe president , plus the family matriarch , barbara bush , and three of george w s four siblings , seeking votes in the new hampshire primary but you will incur the bushes' wrath if you compare their family to that other wellknown american political clan , the kennedys that really irks me , the former president said the other day , in one of the rare interviews he has given about his son the presidential candidate we 're not like them we do n't do press about everything , and we certainly do n't see ourselves as a dynasty 'd' and 'l' those two words , dynasty and legacy irritate me we do n't feel entitled to anything but is n't talk about dynasties justified , maybe inevitable , he was asked , with the eldest son , george w , the governor of texas who is running for president , and another son , jeb , the governor of florida , both following in the footsteps of their father and their grandfather , prescott bush , a longtime senator from connecticut \? with a fair chance that george w could become the first presidential son since john quincy adams to enter the white house \? what kind of fellow was quincy \? the elder bush replied , taking refuge from a question in the kind of jokey banter that characterizes the family was he an aristocrat , or was he as good a guy as george \? george w bush may be the candidate of the republican regulars , but he , too , disclaims dynastic credentials in midland , tex , where he grew up , he said in a separate interview , you were judged apart from your pedigree texas is like that yes , he followed his father to andover and yale , the only bush of his generation to do so , but unlike his father , he was neither a scholar nor an athlete , and he was a bit uncomfortable at both though he tapped his father s compendious mailing list for donors , the younger bush strives to send the message that his is a texasbased , not a washingtonbased , campaign he often wears cowboy boots he tells crowds in new hampshire , my area code is 512 , not 202 austin , that is , not washington and except for foreignpolicy advisers , he has staffed his campaign with texans , turning his back on many of his father s old aides and on the east coast establishment in general , which he has found socially and intellectually pretentious since his student days he tells friends that he would see himself as the outsider in a contest with vice president al gore this fall it would be a good ol' boy from texas , he told one member of his inner circle , against a golden boy from washington , dc , a graduate of san jacinto junior high school in midland against a graduate of preppy st albans in washington never mind andover or yale or bush family wealth dating back several generations bush father and bush son speak of each other with immense affection and with none of the edge that often mars relations between generations the former president said that the two had always been close , very , very close , though no closer than i was to the rest of my kids george w said he was a proud son at times an independent proud son , because he gave me the sense of freedom to say what i want to say , along with unconditional love but always a proud son during his school days , the younger bush recalled , his father was often away on business trips , and his mother , barbara , took over as the frontline disciplinarian , and you know , she has a very quick fuse , quickburning , quick to forgive mrs bush was the peacemaker who waded into the middle of fights between george w and jeb and sorted them out in a sense , it was a matriarchal family , jeb bush once said bill minutaglio , a texas journalist , in a biography of george w bush , first son george w bush and the bush family dynasty \( times books \) , writes that she was the one who spent most of the time with her eldest child , the one known as the little league mom at every midland cubs game she also passed along her habit of plain and occasionally harsh speech he s much more outgoing than i am , former president bush said he s less constrained by convention maybe it s generational , maybe it s barbara but it s true , anyway that s one reason he s better at campaigning but the former president is clearly his son s hero , the prototype of the good man about whom he often speaks some of the jocularity , the needling and the sarcasm , goes out of george w s voice when he speaks about his father , replaced by a quieter tone he is respectful , deferential , almost worshipful he calls his father a steady beacon of decency and honor who preached the old rules , like keep your word and finish the job he may not have been around to play catch some nights , the younger bush said , but my father more or less invented quality time on one occasion , however , things grew tense between them working one summer on a drilling rig in louisiana , george w left a week earlier than he was supposed to , thinking no one would notice his father noticed he called his offspring into his houston office and told him , as mr minutaglio has written , i just want you to know you have disappointed me confirming the incident , george w recalled i was crushed those are the toughest words a dad can say , 'you disappointed me , son'
tokyo , may 26 in the hallways , bathrooms and lunchroom of the bandai corporation , a major japanese toy maker , the talk these days revolves around one topic an announcement that the company will pay employees one million yen , or 10 , 000 , for every baby they have after their second child although many other companies give congratulatory bonuses to workers who become parents , bandai is offering the largest baby bounty in japan , which is struggling to reverse recordlow birthrates that pose many longterm problems bandai , which makes power ranger toys and tamagotchi electronic pets , said its incentive was intended to help employees defray the high cost of raising children and to expand the company s shrinking customer base children our employees have been speculating on who will be the first one to take advantage of the offer , said the deputy general manager , yusuke fukuda we realize that it costs more than one million yen to raise a child from birth to adult but we are hoping that this large sum will inspire our employees the offer , which began last month , is part of an effort by the government and employers to persuade the japanese , who have one of the lowest birthrates in the world , to go forth and multiply most initiatives focus on making it easier and more economical to raise children , extending flexible work hours , family leave and child care some incentives pay cash and monthly subsidies a law that goes into effect next month will more than double the number of preschool children whose parents qualify for monthly government subsidies currently , qualified parents who have children younger than 3 receive allowances of 50 a month for the first and second children and 100 a month for every child thereafter under the new law , the subsidies will continue until the children reach 6 welfare officials estimate that 70 percent of preschool children will qualify for the program , which is restricted to households with annual incomes of less than 43 , 000 for selfemployed workers and 67 , 000 for salaried workers the officials said the 50 subsidy , though seemingly small , covered 25 percent of the basic monthly expense , including food , clothing and utilities for young children the officials said that by extending the program to 6 , they hoped to alleviate some of the financial burdens of child rearing but they flatly denied that the effort was directly intended to promote childbirth the japanese government does not meddle in a woman s decision to have a baby , because that s an individual s personal choice , said tomohiro onishi , deputy director of the childrearing promotion division in the welfare ministry but our intention is to reduce many of the concerns and hesitations that japanese people have about having children the government also plans to expand child care to accommodate the increasing number of working mothers who do not have access to affordable day care there are plans to open centers with longer hours it remains unclear whether those efforts will succeed in raising the birthrate past efforts have had scant effect , experts said i have to say that what they have done so far has not been effective , said toshinari ogino , chief researcher for the institute of labor administration , a research concern even with these new incentives , most japanese , especially women , feel that it s just too difficult and expensive to have more than two children the average birthrate for a japanese woman was 138 children in 1998 , a record low for japan and one of the world s lowest the government worries that the declining birthrate and rapidly aging population will stem economic growth , because there will be fewer workers to support the growing ranks of the elderly the population is 126 million but demographers estimate that the number will fall , to 105 million , by 2050 , with the median age expected to increase , from 41 to 49 the proportion of the population 65 or older is expected to increase , to 32 percent from 17 perhaps the main factor behind the dropping birthrate is that japan remains a traditional society where women are still expected to work and take care of the household with little participation by men , mr ogino said with more japanese women graduating from universities and obtaining wellpaid jobs , many are marrying later and enjoying their independence japanese women have more options today than ever before , and they are increasingly saying that they do n't want to have a house full of kids that they alone have to raise , mr ogino said yutaka and yoko takeda , who have two daughters 11 and 8 , said they had long considered having a third child , but that the weak economy and high education costs had discouraged them mr takeda , 45 , said if his company offered a bonus like bandai , he would strongly consider having another child but mrs takeda , 40 , said , it s just million yen , and that would n't substantially change our financial situation none of the 950 employees at bandai have qualified for the bonus the company said it had 140 employees with two or more children last year , four employees had their third child , and the company expects that four or five workers a year will receive the bonus this problem is not something that can be only resolved with money , said mr fukuda , the executive as a society , we have provide a more hospitable environment that facilitates child rearing photo a mother , eiko kumakura , with her two children , 6 and 2 , in tokyo she said she would like a third child but could not afford it \( kaku kurita for the new york times \) \( pg a8 \)
shanghai the sons of president jiang zemin of china and one of taiwan s most powerful men broke ground last week on a 163 billion computerchip plant that will be freighted with as much political symbolism as commercial potential many people say the factory a cooperative venture between mr jiang s son , jiang mianheng , and winston wang , the son of wang yungching , chairman of taiwan s largest private industrial company , formosa plastics will herald the gradual shift of the asian computer industry away from its base in taiwan to china but the plant will also be an emblem of the eventual economic integration of the two sides of the taiwan strait that some people say will pave the way for political unification though china and taiwan remain separated by a halfcenturyold civil war , taiwanese businessmen have pumped about 50 billion into the mainland that growing economic bond could become the bridge for a political settlement between beijing and taipei , much as hong kong s economic dependence on the mainland facilitated the former british colony s return to china three years ago never has there been such a public step toward that goal than the recent cooperation the two men symbolically began construction of the plant , the most public step yet toward economic integration between china and taiwan , in a field east of shanghai last week amid the cacophony of a dragon dance and a soaring flock of helium balloons it expresses the wish that taiwan and china can advance together by joining hands , said henry huang , a taiwanese who will run the plant s production planning department he said both of the famous sons share a dream that china will be a stronger country in the next century china s fastgrowing market for computer chips , together with its welleducated workers who work for lower wages , and its plentiful land , makes the country a natural base for the world s semiconductor manufacturing , much of which is now concentrated in northern taiwan since a devastating earthquake shut down tremorprone factories in taiwan a year ago sending chip prices surging worldwide semiconductor makers have been looking for lessvulnerable manufacturing sites to satisfy customer demand for morediversified sources of supply chip users also worry that hostilities between beijing and taipei could cripple the industry china already has six semiconductor foundries , factories that make the circuitetched silicon wafers at the heart of computer chips nec of japan built a 12 billion joint venture silicon wafer fabrication plant in shanghai two years ago and motorola is building a 19 billion wholly owned silicon wafer fab and computer chip assembly plant in the northeastern city of tianjin none of the products from those plants compares with the modern chips produced in taiwan , but the new plant will make eightinch wafers etched with circuits that measure just 025 micron across a micron is onemillionth of a meter that is still several generations behind the latest 12inch , 01micron technology elsewhere in the world , but is enough to make the plant the most advanced of its kind in china the plant is the first of four that mr jiang and mr wang plan to build on a 60acre plot in the pudong development zone in shanghai plants built in the future will have even moresophisticated technology , factory officials said already , a third of taiwan s personal computer hardware is made in mainland factories , and china will soon overtake the island as the world s thirdlargest manufacturer of personal computer hardware , behind the united states and japan yet , almost all of the chips used in pc s assembled in china are imported from abroad that is something china wants to change the trend concerns taiwan officials worried that its negotiating position over any eventual reunification will be compromised by economic dependence on the mainland , taiwan s government has banned investments in china of more than 50 million and forbidden its citizens to put money into strategic sectors like highend chip making on the mainland for that reason , neither mr jiang nor mr wang will officially hold any equity in the shanghai grace semiconductor manufacturing corporation , the wholly foreign owned company that will build the planned shanghai plant mr jiang will serve as the company s vice chairman and mr wang as its president and chief executive officer but the company s name reflects its association with mr wang s grace thw group , and much of the investment will come indirectly from taiwan most taiwanese investment on the mainland is made through offshore shell companies , many based in hong kong two mainland companies associated with mr jiang , meanwhile , own a combined 10 percent stake in two other companies that mr wang has established in shanghai growing economic ties are creating great psychological pressure in taiwan , acknowledged mr huang but , he added , investors have to look to the future photo winston wang , second left , and jian mianheng , second right , joined a group of political figures breaking ground for a 163 billion chip plant in shanghai that could signal the industry s shift from

london it is almost a rite of passage for promising shakespearean actors to play hamlet more than most , though , ralph fiennes seemed made for the part onstage with the royal shakespeare company in a variety of other roles and on screen as the nazi camp commander in schindler s list , he had displayed an intense introspection , a sort of irritable melancholy , that well suited the role of the gloomy dane indeed , when the time came , his hamlet was duly acclaimed in london and in new york , where he won a tony award for best actor in 1995 yet to jonathan kent , who directed mr fiennes in both hamlet and a 1997 production of chekhov s ivanov , the slim , asceticlooking englishman was no less born to play the illfated monarch in shakespeare s richard ii it was also a role that mr fiennes had admired but never performed , since he first saw the play as a teenager in 1980 when looking for a new chance to work together , actor and director had no trouble agreeing to this fairly obvious choice , however , mr kent , an artistic director of the almeida theater company in london , added a more innovative idea why not twin richard ii with coriolanus , another shakespearean political tragedy , albeit one that is infrequently performed , indeed one that mr fiennes barely knew \? to mr kent , the plays not only show constrasting aspects of shakespeare s genius they also offer interesting endofmillennium reflections on the nature of power the result is the program that begins on wednesday at the harvey theater at the brooklyn academy of music 14 performances of richard ii and 12 of coriolanus through oct 1 in an earlier 14week run this spring and summer , mr fiennes and an impressive ensemble of british actors presented both plays to packed houses in the unlikely setting of a longabandoned movie studio in east london after their new york stop , the performers will travel to tokyo for a limited run at the akasaka theater the idea of presenting two or more plays in repertory is hardly a novelty last year , mr kent s productions of racine s phedre and britannicus , with diana rigg and toby stephens in both plays , also went to the academy after successful runs in london more daring perhaps is the idea of scheduling two plays on some days , as mr kent did with the racines and is again doing now , as a way of highlighting their differences and similarities \( the double bills in brooklyn are scheduled for sept 16 , 23 and 30 \) the plays themselves could not be more different in form , mr kent said in an interview before the run ended at the former gainsborough film studio in the london borough of shoreditch 'richard ii , ' with its highly wrought verse , is an exquisite artifact , while 'coriolanus , ' shakespeare s last tragedy , is almost like freeform jazz but both are about men and their shadows , about men clad in their roles one of a king , the other of a warrior who have not developed within that cladding and as it is stripped away , they must confront themselves in this case , the burden is on mr fiennes to make the pairing work , although he evidently enjoyed testing his stamina actually , it s not as exhausting as doing 'coriolanus' twice in a day , which we did in the previews , he said softly , sipping a mug of tea at the studioturnedtheater here but , yes , it is exhausting it s nice to have the challenge and , at the end of the day , to think , 'wow , i did 'richard' and 'coriolanus' one quiet and selfpitying , the other loud and insensitive , both characters nonetheless bring on their own tragedies richard ii , the narcissistic english monarch who almost frivolously banishes his cousin , henry bolingbroke , and seizes his land , only to find he has provoked a rebellion that leads to his overthrow and death and coriolanus , who , banished from rome for scorning its citizens , joins forces with his sworn enemy , tulius aufidius , only to be dissuaded from sacking rome by his allpowerful mother and , in the process , to invite his own murder by aufidius when i first thought about it , mr fiennes recalled , it seemed a very unusual pairing of plays but richard and coriolanus are both men in power who cannot handle their power they 're both alone , as it were , isolated by the nature of who they are they 're not good at opening up or arguing or debating richard has been conditioned to be king and is unable to see anyone apart from himself in his relationship to god as the divinely appointed ruler coriolanus is completely trapped in how he should behave it s a situation created partly by his mother and partly by him with his impossible arrogance and pride in their political messages , both plays are also quietly subversive richard ii tells of the successful challenge to the divine right of kings that paved the way for constitutional monarchy in 1399 but two centuries later , shakespeare still risked royal displeasure in writing this play after the duke of essex s abortive rebellion against elizabeth i , the angry queen had proclaimed , i am richard the second , know ye not that \? shakespeare softened the blow by having the bishop of carlisle warn of the disorder , horror , fear and mutiny that would follow richard s ouster , but today the play speaks more loudly of the perils of absolute power
