washington the pentagon office with responsibilities for assisting us military and civilian overseas voters is issuing a new ballotrequest form that requires civilian voters to make an allornone declaration either that they plan to return to the united states or have no intent of ever doing so expatriate groups say the choice is confusing and unfair , carries potential tax ramifications and could depress voting in ways that might affect close elections in november the new form , the federal post card application , is issued by the federal voting assistance program , the agency legally charged to assist all overseas voters it resides in the pentagon the form is used to help voters abroad register and obtain ballots in the past , the form allowed a less absolute response that the voter was either residing abroad temporarily or indefinitely but the new form leaves civilian voters only these choices i am a us citizen residing outside the us , and i intend to return , or i am a us citizen residing outside the us , and i do not intend to return the pentagon office says it needs the information to help election officials decide whether to send out just federal ballots or federal and local ballots but expatriate groups say this forces people into a choice they do not want , and in some cases are unable , to make i'm very afraid that it will either completely confuse or deter large numbers of wouldbe voters , said lucy stensland laederich of the federation of american women s clubs overseas , who has lived in france since 1970 at least half the group s 15 , 000 members , she said , are living abroad not because we wanted to , but because of marriage , employment , studies , ngo or church work , etc i very frankly have no idea which of those two boxes to check , she added , because i do not intend' to return nor do i not intend' to return worse , she said , is the situation facing people like her daughter , also a us citizen she neither intends nor does n't intend to return' because she has never lived there , ms laederich said in a conference call with election officials and expat advocates last week , bob carey , director of the federal voting assistance program , acknowledged that the changed wording had caused concerns and said that he hoped to add an explanatory preface on the organization s web site but he said it was almost certainly too late to change the choices mr carey said he had changed the wording in response to requests from state election officials voters from some states , he said , receive federal , state and local ballots only if they indicate an intention to return no matter when while those who express no intention to return receive only federal ballots the old language on the form , mr carey said , was basically forcing the state or local election official to divine the voter s intent to return in response to a core concern of expatriate groups , mr carey denied that the answers on the form might increase voters' exposure to taxes the us law that created his organization stipulates as much , he said intent to return means nothing as far as taxes are concerned , he said asked about the tax issue , roland crim , director of american citizens abroad , said individual states look at many factors in determining whether persons overseas are subject to state tax it is incorrect and dangerous to advise voters that tax liability depends solely on whether a state ballot is simply requested or actually cast at least one group that works with overseas americans , the overseas vote foundation , said it would still post on its web site an old version of the form with the more accommodating language mr carey said it would be accepted if voters refused to check either of the boxes about intent to return , state and local officials might react differently , mr carey said some would forward the federal ballot , some might forward both sets and some might not send either in a year when polls show the presidential contest could be extremely close and where absentee ballots could make a difference , the matter has drawn attention in congress representative carolyn b maloney , democrat of new york and chairwoman of the caucus for overseas americans , sent a letter to mr carey on tuesday saying that the new form made it more difficult and problematic to use for overseas civilians it puts most voters in an impossible position of stating what they cannot possibly know , she said , and many will very likely not continue further mrs maloney also noted that expatriate advocates had said they were not consulted mr carey conceded that the original request for public comment did not spell out this change it was added later , he said , after the need for change became clear the language has the potential to carry real impact in close elections an example is the messy 2010 election dispute over a seat in the texas house of representatives from the district around austin a republican challenger , dan neil , lost narrowly to a longtime democratic incumbent , donna howard the 15vote margin was smaller than the number of voters 222 who had used the federal post card application and checked outside the us indefinitely the county clerk had issued those voters only federal ballots , but mr neil contended that their votes should have been included in his race mr neil lost his challenge the texas legislative council found that , under state law , those who had marked that they were abroad indefinitely should have been given only federal ballots ms howard won ultimately by a revised fourvote margin depriving republicans of the seat that would have given them a supermajority in the texas chamber
between 1948 , when american national election studies first surveyed the electorate , and 1970 , the percentage of voters who were white didn t change much , ranging from 89 to 91 percent  anes didn t begin breaking out data on mainline and evangelical protestants until 1960 traditional mainline protestants including episcopalians , presbyterians , methodists and lutherans constituted a decisive plurality of the electorate at 45 percent evangelicals stood at 29 percent and catholics at 20 percent only one percent defined their religion as none by 2008 , whites had fallen to 74 percent of the electorate the following chart , produced by alan abramowitz , a political scientist at emory , shows the minority \( other nonwhite and black \) share of the vote from 1992 \( 13 percent \) to 2008 \( 26 percent \) , with an estimate for 2020 \( 34 percent \) in a study published in february 2008 , the pew forum on religious and public life found that mainline protestants , once the dominant force not only in politics but in the national culture , had fallen to 181 percent of the electorate , behind both protestant evangelicals and catholics and barely ahead of the fastgrowing category of unaffiliated , which reached 161 percent although a majority of the american population today decisively selfidentifies as christian , at 784 percent , america and its politics have in fact become vastly more heterogeneous the connection between religion and politics is very complicated , of course on the one hand , many people do not feel their religious beliefs and their political beliefs are directly related , but for others the former determines the latter not to mention the fact that the tenets of christianity are themselves subject to partisan and subjective interpretation take a provocative query posed in an april 2011 survey by the public religion research institute is capitalism compatible with christian values \? by two to one , 5326 , democrats believe that capitalism and christianity are not compatible republicans , in contrast , believe there is no conflict , by a 4637 margin tea party supporters are even more adamant , believing that capitalism and christian values are compatible by a 5635 margin these very different notions of what it means to hold christian values correlate , in turn , with beliefs concerning core political issues of equality and social mobility in september 2011 , the public religion research institute asked respondents to choose between these two ideas a \) one of the big problems of this country is that we don t give everyone an equal chance in life b \) it s not really that big a problem if some people have more of a chance in life than others the results again show sharp differences of opinion tied to partisan identification some issues are less confounding for example , a january , 2012 prri poll question on samesex marriage revealed a wide split between religiously observant and nonobservant constituencies these findings reflect and drive the growing polarization of american politics but here s the surprising thing given the scope of the demographic and ideological transformation of the united states over the last six decades , it s interesting that the twoparty system has not imploded in the face of sustained centrifugal upheaval including a proliferation of religious affiliations , the enfranchisement of substantial minority populations , rising levels of economic inequality , and the belief among a plurality of voters , 44 percent , that our economic system \( capitalism \) and the religious identification of threequarters of the electorate \( christianity \) are not compatible we still are a nation of republicans and democrats how will the centerright adapt when it becomes clear that its dependence on white voters threatens its ability to compete nationally \? as presently constituted , the republicans have become the party of the married white christian past this stance proved effective in the 1970s and 1980s , and again in 1994 and 2010 , but time is running out will the party , of necessity , become more amenable to religious diversity \? will conservatives embrace immigration reform \? will republicans try to drive a wedge between hispanic and black voters in an effort to fracture the democratic coalition \? and will republicans look to a more subdued form of capitalist competition \? how will the democratic party cope with the fast approaching moment when nonhispanic whites become a minority of its voters \? will democratic presidential nominating contests become explicitly racial and ethnic \? will religious nonobservance and a larger role for the state in the economy become explicit hallmarks of the centerleft \? while a number of political and demographic analysts see current trends giving the democratic party an inevitable advantage in the near future , the history of twoparty competition and the continuing 5050 split in american politics suggests that the out party , sooner or later , responds to negative feedback and changes course the only guarantee \? neither party s future is assured thomas b edsall , a professor of journalism at columbia university , is the author of the book the age of austerity how scarcity will remake american politics , which was published earlier this year
saraqib , it was not yet 5 on tuesday morning i was lying on one side of the bed and the two little girls i was watching were on the other none of us had slept a wink snipers' gunfire rang out from time to time bombs were crashing all around us the girls' frightened mother entered the room the bombing is getting worse , she said we ran out , heading downstairs women and children and some men had gathered in the shelter the children were now capable of distinguishing between the sound of bombs and gunfire , between distant and nearby shelling , and they could discern the direction from which it was all coming  ever since we had entered the country , running across the border late sunday night , four young men had gone out of their way to protect me they cut a hole in the barbed wire fence so that i could scramble through a bomb fell very close to us as we sped away bombs were falling the whole way as the car zoomed along as we passed through the town of atarib in the dark , i understood what extermination meant atarib was a completely decimated city the streets were cratered by bombs , doors were scorched , houses demolished , streets empty at night not even the howling of dogs could be heard it was a ghost town no life whatsoever here and there , on one street or another , lay the charred remains of a government tank we should have gone to sleep after our long journey across the border from turkey we were exhausted but in saraqib , my host s family had stayed up waiting for us , so we sat together into the wee hours of monday morning as they told me about their neighbors who had been killed , about the young men who had been summarily executed in the town square saraqib was one of the first towns to come out against the regime the punishment was severe siege , bombing , arrests and killing now it has five groups of free syrian army battalions to protect it still , there are government snipers in the middle of town , with their headquarters inside the state radio and television building there are nine in all each works a fourhour shift in the building , which is protected by a tank that shells the town from time to time once , when the fsa managed to take out a sniper , the government s army responded by strafing the town with bombs the townspeople say the snipers hunt people down and kill them at random a few days ago a sniper shot a 4yearold girl , diana , wounding her in the back , paralyzing her permanently she was so small and frail that i could n't believe her body was n't totally pulverized by the impact of the bullet  on monday night , we went to meet a group of free syrian army fighters in the town of binnish the oldest one was no more than 35 all were full of vitality and optimism , but also exhaustion i shook hands with every man , except for one , who placed his hand on his heart and bowed respectfully they were n't islamic fundamentalists i 've encountered very few islamist groups and have not observed any connection to al qaeda or salafism , a movement based on a rigid , austere interpretation of islam the young men there told me that a few salafi jihadis had started to appear recently , but that they did not constitute a significant number as we were sitting out on the balcony overlooking an olive orchard , the bombs started falling all around us nearby , the town of taftanaz was being shelled we could see it from the balcony i asked the head of the division , who 'd prepared dinner for us , are n't you afraid that a bomb might fall on your heads right now \? he replied we are n't afraid death has become a part of our lives as we dined , the main topic of discussion was aleppo , syria s most populous city a number of the young men present were from the besieged neighborhood of salaheddin and were getting ready to return they refused to let me go with them for fear of the looming battle i was the only woman among them , and the young fsa men treated me like part of the group during that meeting it became clear that it s a mistake to consider the fsa as a single bloc it is a hodgepodge of battalions , including secularists , moderate islamists and alltooordinary people who joined up to defend their lives and their families at the end of our journey back to saraqib , the commander told me , we are one people , we and the alawites are brothers we had never thought about the sort of things that the regime is trying to stir up i was silent for a moment , until i realized what he was telling me , the daughter of a wellknown alawite family that supports president unconditionally some of my relatives have publicly disowned me for turning my back on the regime as many others have , announcing on facebook that i am no longer considered one of them i squeezed the commander s hand  the children curled up all around me in the shelter on tuesday morning were watching what i was writing the women came together to recount the previous night s events , which of their relatives had been killed convoys of approximately 15 tanks bound for aleppo were passing by almost every hour the young men told me 80 tanks would pass today and that the shelling would only get worse , which meant we had to stay inside the electricity was gone the atmosphere was becoming more and more suffocating we could hear the roar of a fighter jet and then intense bombing the shelling was getting fierce , the sound of bombs louder it was very close the children over 10 were growing anxious but remained silent younger children had started to scream the women in the shelter tried to come up with things to talk about only fsa men were outside now they refused to take me with them , saying that i had to stay in the shelter with the women and children until the battle was over none of the fsa guys were hitting the tank convoys it was the regime s tanks that were firing , and the snipers who were shooting and launching rockets a young man from the fsa told me , we know they have bigger and more powerful weapons but we have our courage and our conviction in our revolution we wo n't let them humiliate us we 're ready to defend our homes to the death the women started singing the shelter was getting hot the children gathered around us were playing with some missile debris o young men , they call it idlib , you can only back away from it , they sang , in a taunting chant at mr assad s forces , mentioning one of the first provinces to rise up do n't be surprised by these times of awakening , times of strength and victory and fallen , fallen , is bashar the children repeated the same verse , then raised their voices up high , fallen , fallen , is bashar when the singing was done , a woman added , we have n't had a decent night s sleep for a year as you can see , the bombing is continuous this is how we and our children live those who have n't yet died from the bombing and the arrests here are waiting out a slow death and all of this because we dared to go out and demonstrate against bashar by 2 pm the tank convoy heading for aleppo seemed to have changed course , which meant that the shelling might lighten up a little bit , but the sound of sniper fire had not abated nevertheless , in less than a halfhour a group from the fsa showed up the leader was named amjad , a young man with a degree from a midlevel technical institute who owned a clothing store in saraqib s souk until it was burned and looted by the regime s army he was quiet , his eyes shining he seemed a bit sad he did n't shake my hand but bowed out of respect and sat down with the group while we talked , the planes returned , flying low over the skies of saraqib we heard the sound of a bomb but the conversation did n't stop their arsenal was no match for the weapons of the regime s army the success they had achieved on the battlefield against mr assad s army depended on their bravery the commander of the group did n't speak at first but soon got involved in the conversation we 're a group of autonomous battalions that do n't obey a central command structure and we 're out here working on our own most foreign support goes to the islamists , he said we have sold our sisters' and our wives' gold in order to buy ammunition and defend the town he was afraid of what might happen if they gave up and the regime survived young men will turn toward fundamentalism and extremism the syrian people have already been subjected to impoverishment and after a year and a half the syrian people have begun to take care of themselves , now that the world has abandoned them i worry that things could get even worse , he added the group commander stopped talking and we heard the sound of a bomb falling i said goodbye and we promised to meet the next day when i got back to the shelter another woman had arrived with a fresh story there was an apple seller who came to saraqib today he was killed by that sniper up on the radio building an army patrol passed by , took the apple cart and they all started eating the apples even as the merchant s corpse was sprawled out on the ground , she recounted the apple seller s son was shouting and crying for someone to help him move his father so that he could give him a decent burial one of them motioned at the son to go and ask the neighbors for help before the sound of a fighter jet flying overhead boomed , the woman said , poor guy he was just a stranger who wanted to sell his apples
a quick look at the final week of the regular season chargers 38 , raiders 26 we start with this game because it had a domino effect on many of the afc playoff races or , rather , it could have had a domino effect a raiders victory would have made the broncoschiefs , bengalsravens and , in retrospect , titanstexans games infinitely more significant unfortunately , the black silver fell flat , which allowed the broncos and bengals to back into the postseason \( kudos to the nfl for scheduling these contests at the same time , thus keeping the drama alive for most of the afternoon \) oakland s secondary , which had been depleted over the last two months so much so that lito sheppard played nearly every snap had no answer for malcom floyd and antonio gates normally , this is where we start speculating about when the raiders coach will be fired \( before or after the senior bowl \? \) but with al davis no longer around , this franchise s instability now derives from multiple sources , which is presumably less conducive for firing hue jackson on a whim jackson actually had a solid first full season anyway , even if his team did set a new nfl penalty record of course , one of the coaches from this game may still be fired if that s the case , norv turner will instantly be the most desirable offensive coordinator on the market bonus link hue jackson was very upset with his team , and didn t hold back in his news conference chiefs 7 , broncos 3 after a 6for22 passing performance and an interception and lost fumble , it s time to stop making any kind of link between tim tebow s quarterbacking and the possibility of divine intervention \( he s playing so poorly that higher powers might be insulted \) the broncos are in the playoffs not because they are the winners of the afc west but because they happen to be , for lack of a better term , the least of the worst of the west that they re 88 and will enjoy homefield advantage against the 124 steelers is just the latest embarrassment produced by the grossly flawed nfl playoff seeding system as for the game itself , it was exactly what we expected lowscoring halfcourt football , with kansas city s pressman coverage stifling denver s passing attack the broncos managed 216 yards rushing but only 3 points against the steelers , expect that rushing total to be no greater than 150 and the point total to be 2 or 4 , depending on what kind of field position denver s defense gets ravens 24 , bengals 16 this was just like the last time these two teams played cincinnati bottled up baltimore s run game for much of the afternoon but was gouged by big plays from ray rice the fourthyear pro \( and possible firstteam allpro \) bolted for a 70yard score on baltimore s first possession , a 51yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter and , almost just as critical , a hardfought 15yarder on the first play of baltimore s final offensive series , which helped milk the clock rice finished with 191 yards on 24 carries without the three big runs , he had 55 yards on 21 carries this is not to take anything away from rice his long runs were sensational a player with less breakaway speed may not have even gained 20 yards on either of those touchdown plays but the point here is to emphasize that the bengals are an elite run defense that , recently , happened to give up a few big runs in recent losses \( to rice in the two ravens losses and one to ben tate in a week 14 loss to the texans their wildcard opponent this saturday \) without those plays , cincy my have had 10 or 11 wins steelers 13 , browns 9 every now and then , the browns , for some reason , give the steelers a tough game they did so under eric mangini in 09 and they ve done so twice this season in a totally different system under pat shurmur this time , they opted to put the game in seneca wallace s hands the careerlong backup quarterback completed just 16 of his 41 pass attempts this might be in part because that careerlong backup quarterback is probably the second or thirdmost talented wide receiver on cleveland s roster the browns \( 412 \) secured the no 4 draft pick in 2012 , which will all but ensure mike holmgren the opportunity to infuse some muchneeded star power in this incompetent passing attack falcons 45 , bucs 24 nothing to report here the falcons jumped to a 420 lead in the first 23 minutes , prompting rahim morris to once again stand with his hands on his hips , wearing a defiant look on his face with his job in jeopardy , morris has publicly insinuated that he hasn t had a full deck of talent to work with this season he s right , but he s also doing himself no favors by denouncing the bucs youth when he was the one who coined the supposedly motivational term youngry before the season the falcons victory means they get to avoid facing drew brees and the saints for a third time but a wildcard win at new york would probably mean a trip to green bay in the divisional round a loss in that round against that team for a second straight year would officially create a dragon for this rising , rocksolid franchise to slay \( what the cowboys were to the niners in the early 90s \) but let s not get ahead of ourselves cardinals 23 , seahawks 20 \( ot \) we grew so accustomed to mocking the nfc west that we failed to notice just how fervid the division became down the stretch the upstart 49ers stayed strong , finishing 133 the cardinals and seahawks both got stronger like the niners , they did it with defense the cardinals finished 72 in their last nine games , yielding no more than 20 points in each of the seven victories they got sharper and sharper in ray horton s system and they did it without a major pass rusher the seahawks finished 53 despite ending on a twogame losing streak their underrated defense which blossomed after the emergence of a bright , young secondary yielded 23 or fewer points in all eight of its final contests both teams have major question marks at quarterback and offensive line but hey , so did \( or still do \) the niners titans 23 , texans 22 the first season finale that the texans have lost under gary kubiak is also their first season finale that is not really a finale the texans knew going in that they would host a wildcard game next weekend , which is why kubiak played most of his backups and went for the makeorbreak 2point conversion from the 7yard line with 14 seconds remaining in regulation the titans won t end up becoming that outoftheblue wildcard team that no one really thought about before january their former superstar running back , chris johnson , rushed for 61 yards in this game to finish with what has to be the most unimpressive 1 , 000yard season in nfl history a true cjquality season would have probably generated one or two more victories for tennessee we ll never know what happened to the 30 million man in 2011 jaguars 19 , colts 13 just going by the box score , you wouldn t know this game was different from any other jaguarscolts game the colts outpassed the jags , 24271 the jags outrushed the colts , 19056 numbers are relative , though 242 passing yards don t translate to a bunch of points with dan orlovsky the way they might with peyton manning the loss gave the colts the top pick in the 2012 draft , which means we get to enjoy four more months of the peyton manningandrew luck discussion manning s future with the franchise will be revealed in time before then , we could learn that his top receiver , reggie wayne , is done the 33yearold wayne has an expiring contract and has clearly lost a step wayne still managed to catch 75 balls for 960 yards under dire circumstances this season , but the colts prefer to pay players by what they show on film , not the box score if they didn t feel wayne was sliding , they would have granted his request for a contract extension before this season if this is indeed it for wayne , congrats a total of 862 receptions for 11 , 000plus yards over 11 seasons , five 1 , 200plusyard seasons and three allpro teams wayne , a great route runner and ballplucker , often looked even better on film than his staggering numbers suggest 49ers 34 , rams 27 justin smith has been mentioned in defensive player of the year discussions patrick willis is regarded as the best inside linebacker in the league his running mate , navorro bowman , actually just had the better season and might \( should \) steal willis s spot on the allpro team cornerback carlos rogers and safety dashon goldson were both voted to the pro bowl , and even though he doesn t directly coach defense , jim harbaugh still gets plenty of credit but heading into the postseason , san francisco s most valuable defensive contributor may not have even been listed in that first paragraph pass rusher aldon smith has blossomed dramatically over the course of his rookie season a quiet day at st louis kept smith stuck on 14 sacks , just a halfsack behind jevon kearse s rookie record still , not bad smith has rare initial quickness in both his first step and hand punch he has lately gotten more reps with the base 34 defense after playing almost exclusively in nickel and dime packages early in the season it s often unrealistic to think a defense , no matter how stingy , can line up and consistently stop an elite offense in today s nfl often , a defense has to make big plays of its own most big defensive plays start with a pass rush the niners know this that s why they invested the seventh overall pick on smith he s already paying dividends bears 17 , vikings 13 on the same day that aldon smith came up just a halfsack short of jevon kearse s rookie single season sack record , jared allen finished just a halfsack short of michael strahan and brett favre s singleseason sack record allen devoured an iffy bears offensive line for 35 sacks , finishing the year with 22 and earning live game updates around other broadcasts and a postgame interview with fox s tony siragusa few players compete with the downtodown tenacity and fundamental sophistication of this eighthyear veteran oh , by the way , for what it s worth the bears won this game packers 45 , lions 41 we could waste a lot of space gushing about the offensive performance of both these teams or , we could all agree that it was fun and just move on a compromise might be to just gush about the performance of matt flynn , since , you know , he s the backup and soontobe hot freeagent quarterback don t be surprised if the packers find a way to retain flynn in order to get a valuable trade package for him \( think kevin kolb with the eagles or matt schaub with the falcons \) they could probably haul in multiple secondround picks for a guy they drafted in the seventh round back in 08 the packers seem to be playing up this angle after the game , mike mccarthy said of flynn s performance it was clearly one of the best i ve been a part of no doubt about it i can t say enough about matt flynn the whole world got to see what we see every day patriots 49 , bills 21 the patriots are to the first quarter what lebron james is to the fourth quarter last week they fell behind 30 after one period on their way to building an early 170 deficit against miami this week they got down 210 after 15 minutes , buffalo had 187 yards of total offense new england had 5 the patriots comeback formula might work against the bottom half of the afc east , but don t expect it to work against a divisional round playoff opponent it will be interesting to see what the patriots do in the postseason they have a sensational offense , but their defense is the worst of any no 1 seed in history saints 45 , panthers 17 the saints posted about a month s worth of total offense in this game of their 208 yards rushing , 127 came from chris ivory you might recall that ivory was the feature back when pierre thomas was nursing an ankle injury for much of last season but when the saints traded back into the first round to make a luxury pick for mark ingram , ivory became the forgotten man he began the season on the injured list with a bad foot and sports hernia when he got healthy , he was often inactive but since ingram went down with a toe injury after week 13 , ivory has stepped in and been the most prominent betweenthetackles runner he has 289 yards in four games , showing a violent burst and fresh legs it s just another example of new orleans s embarrassment of riches at the skill positions eagles 34 , redskins 10 not having watched this meaningless game , we ll eschew analysis and facts in favor of eavesdropping csn washington produced video before the game of redskins offensive coordinator kyle shanahan \( who has a reputation around the league for having a loose , profane tongue \) ranting about something eagles defensive coordinator juan castillo was supposed to have said , and about how the redskins would win the division next season \( you can read about it here via pro football talk \) are shanahan s words storyworthy \? of course not they came in a team huddle , not at a press conference but ask yourself , if we know that mike shanahan and andy reid are both back in 2012 , is there anything else remotely interesting to talk about from this game \? giants 31 , cowboys 14 was it new york s greatness or dallas s ineptitude \? eli manning made a handful of jawdropping offbalance throws in the pocket , with supple superstar \( yes , superstar \) victor cruz often on the receiving end also , the giants run game resurfaced and their makeshift offensive line seemed to finally coalesce however , the giants got some help from a cowboys defense that looked mentally overburdened through much of the first half we used to see this with rob ryan s browns sometimes the browns , like this year s cowboys , would look great with all their disguise and complexity , but when they leaked , they didn t just drip , they gushed how much is too much when it comes to a defensive system \? the cowboys clearly need to upgrade their secondary terence newman is on the decline and none of their safeties are playmakers jason garrett and jerry jones now have time to get to work on roster evaluations the giants , on the other hand , are this year s lowseeded playoff team that nobody wants to face andy benoit is and founder of nfltouchdowncom he can be

a military jury on friday convicted an instructor at lackland base of raping one female trainee and sexually assaulting several others , the first major case in a sex scandal that has rocked the air force s basic training system the jury of two officers and five enlisted airmen found staff sgt luis walker guilty on 28 counts , including adultery , violating regulations and committing sexual crimes against female trainees , most of whom reported to him at lackland , in san antonio , the air force s lone basic training school he faces up to life in prison and a dishonorable discharge when the trial moves into the sentencing phase at least 11 other instructors in the air force s basic training system , nine from the same squadron , are under investigation in the widening case , which is the focus not only of a criminal probe but also a major policy review by a twostar general at least 31 female recruits have been identified as possible victims one of those instructors has pleaded guilty four others have been charged and are facing courtsmartial all have been removed from training duties , air force officials said the lieutenant colonel in charge of some training units at lackland has also been reassigned the sexual abuse scandal is among the worst to hit the military in over a decade in 1996 , dozens of women at the aberdeen proving ground in maryland accused male supervisors of rape , sexual assault and other offenses in 1996 a few years earlier , more than 80 women were assaulted during several days of drunken revelry at the tailhook association convention in las vegas , a case that led to the resignation of the navy secretary and two admirals air force officials said more instructors could be charged as a result of the current investigations , with recruits being encouraged to report episodes anonymously through a 24hour tip line the twostar general s review has also been expanded to include three other air force training bases we 're not satisfied that this one unit is all there is , maj gen leonard a patrick , commander of the second air force , which oversees basic training , said in an interview we want to assure ourselves through a disciplined approach that we 've caught everything or everyone involved in this kind of behavior the scandal has been deeply painful for the air force nine years ago , a survey by the pentagon s inspector general found that 12 percent of the women who graduated from the air force academy that year said they had been victims of rape or attempted rape while at the school the vast majority said they did not report the episodes to the authorities out of fear of being punished that appears to have been the situation in the current cases as well the first assault allegations were reported by the acquaintance of a recruit and not the recruit herself and when investigators began interviewing possible victims , almost all initially denied being assaulted with a staff of about 475 instructors , lackland provides basic training to every air force recruit , about 35 , 000 a year about one in five of those trainees are women , and about nine in ten of the instructors are men the rigorously hierarchical nature of the military makes it especially conducive to sexual abuse , critics say , and basic training is even more so , with instructors looming as intimidating , allpowerful figures to young recruits the pentagon rejects such assertions but amid growing criticism from advocacy groups and congress , secretary of defense leon e panetta announced in april new steps to combat sexual assault , including having higher ranking officers handle sexual assault complaints , a change expected to lead to more prosecutions according to pentagon data , there were 3 , 192 reports of sexual assault in the military in 2011 , but only 240 went to trial , with 191 convictions but the defense department acknowledges that the crime is vastly underreported , estimating the number of assaults may actually be closer to 19 , 000 a year during closing arguments in sergeant walker s trial on friday , the lead prosecutor , maj patricia gruen , portrayed him as a predator who first intimidated , then befriended recruits before assaulting them when you take off the sheep s outfit and the wolf is released on the flock , he looks for those that stand out , and pounces , she told the jury but the defense , which called only one witness during the fiveday trial , focused on the fact that none of the female recruits complained about sergeant walker to the authorities the lead defense lawyer , joseph esparza , also noted that the prosecution failed to produce or surveillance video , even though there were cameras in parts of the barracks we do n't know what happened , he said everyone changed their stories based on when they were asked and who was asking the trial was dominated by the graphic and often emotional testimony of female recruits the new york times does not typically identify possible victims of sexual assault one woman , identified as airman 5 , testified that sergeant walker tried to win her confidence by sympathizing with her after she had been upset by bad news from home he later began sending suggestive texts to her cellphone before cornering her in a supply closet and forcing her to have sex with him the woman said she did not report the episode out of fear that sergeant walker would recycle her in punishment , meaning force her to redo basic training i was scared , and miserable and hurt , the woman testified her version was corroborated in court by a friend another witness , identified as airman 8 , said sergeant walker called her into his office and pressured her to show her breasts she mentioned the episode to other recruits , and word got back to sergeant walker she testified that he then called her back into his office and warned her if you had a problem with it , then you should have come to me , instead of running your mouth remember , i'm staff sergeant , you 're a trainee i went numb , the woman testified i was scared what if he punished me , or ruined my career \?
a criminal investigation into the collapse of the brokerage firm mf global and the disappearance of about 1 billion in customer money is now heading into its final stage without charges expected against any top executivesafter 10 months of stitching together evidence on the firm s demise , criminal investigators are concluding that chaos and porous risk controls at the firm , rather than fraud , allowed the money to disappear , according to people involved in the case the hurdles to building a criminal case were always high with mf global , which filed for bankruptcy in october after a huge bet on european debt unnerved the market but a lack of charges in the largest wall street blowup since 2008 is likely to fuel frustration with the government s struggle to charge financial executives just a few individuals none of them top wall street players have been prosecuted for the risky acts that led to recent failures and billions of dollars in losses in the most telling indication yet that the mf global investigation is winding down , federal authorities are seeking to interview the former chief of the firm , jon s corzine , next month , according to the people involved in the case authorities hope that mr corzine , who is expected to accept the invitation , will shed light on the actions of other employees at mf global those developments indicate that federal prosecutors do not expect to file criminal charges against the formernew jerseygovernor mr corzine has not yet received assurances that he is free from scrutiny , but two rounds of interviews with former employees and a review of thousands of documents have left prosecutors without a case against him , say the people involved in the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity while the government s findings would remove the darkest cloud looming over mr corzine the threat of criminal charges the former goldman sachs chief is not yet in the clear a bankruptcy trustee on wednesday joined customers' lawsuits against mr corzine , and regulators are still considering civil enforcement actions , which could cost him millions of dollars or ban him from working on wall street mr corzine , in a bid to rebuild his image and engage his passion for trading , is weighing whether to start a hedge fund , according to people with knowledge of his plans he is currently trading with his family s wealth if he is successful as a hedge fund manager , it would be the latest career comeback for a man who was ousted from both the top seat at goldman sachs and the new jersey governor s mansion a spokesman for mr corzine declined to comment even with the worst behind him , mr corzine s reputation has suffered lasting damage after the collapse of the firm , which left farmers and other mf global customers out millions of dollars , mr corzine became another face of wall street recklessness lawmakers called him back towashington , a humbling return to the town where he once served as a democratic senator from new jersey , to seek answers and to criticize him with a criminal case unlikely to materialize , the anger over the collapse of mf global is likely to grow typically in whitecollar cases , investigators start their interviews with lowerlevel employees and build up to the top executives of a firm in july , when federal authorities first approached mr corzine s lawyers , it was not clear whether he would agree to an interview but the signs were good in such cases , if prosecutors have damning information , they often file charges rather than extend an offer for a voluntary interview though he is now expected to attend the meeting , questions remain about which government agencies will join because mr corzine still faces scrutiny from regulators , including the commodity futures trading commission , their attendance could pose a problem these agencies , which have a lower bar to proving civil wrongdoing than do criminal authorities , are examining whether top executives misled investors about the firm s health and failed to protect customer money the cftc , the federal bureau of investigation and theunited states attorney s office inmanhattan declined to comment for this article as the government s focus shifts away from mr corzine , it remains interested in a lowerlevel employee in the firm schicagooffice , who was known as the keeper of the books at mf global that employee , edith o'brien , oversaw the transfer of customer money during the firm s final week , when the client cash vanished into the hands of banks , clearinghouses and even other customers ms o'brien , an assistant treasurer , has declined to cooperate with authorities without receivingimmunityfrom criminal prosecution the government is hesitating to grant her request , suspecting that ms o'brien is the highestranking employee with potential liability , one of the people involved in the case said ms o'brien has not been accused of any wrongdoing if mr corzine agrees to a meeting next month with the fbi and federal prosecutors , the authorities are expected to question him about his interactions with ms o'brien but mr corzine is unlikely to offer damning evidence or a critical view of ms o'brien , another person briefed on the matter said the statements mr corzine provides cannot be used against him under the expected terms of the interview , but authorities can use it to build their broader case and if mr corzine were to arouse suspicions during the interview , he could find himself a target mr corzine has already given his version of events publicly in congressional testimony last year , he detailed an exchange he had with ms o'brien days before the firm s collapse the back and forth involved a 175 million transfer to jpmorgan chase to cover an overdrawn account the transfer , it turned out , came from customer money but internal emails suggest that mr corzine did not know the origin of the funds an email reviewed bythe new york timesshows ms o'brien explicitly stated that the money belonged to the firm , not customers it is possible that with the books in disarray , ms o'brien was not aware that customer money was in jeopardy a lawyer for ms o'brien declined to comment while mr corzine also testified that he never authorized or intended to authorize the misuse of customer money , his risky trading strategy helped pave the firm s downfall known as an obsessive trader who had the highest returns at the firm , mr corzine frequently inhabited a desk on the trading floor one visitor to mf global recalled that during a tour of the firm s manhattan headquarters , his guide suggested that if he stuck around he might catch the chief executive trading a few million dollars in bonds as the firm s leader , mr corzine was upbeat about its future , writing an email to employees in january 2011 let s be an example of how to do it right and play a leadership role in restoring confidence in our industry but a 63 billion wager on the european sovereign debt proved fatal the size of the bet was enough to wipe out the firm many times over , and as questions abouteurope s health grew , a run on mf global ensued in the panic , the firm tapped customer money to stay afloat , which scuttled a lastminute deal to save the firm mr corzine resigned just days after the firm filed for bankruptcy this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print

tripoli , libya soon after the revolt against col began in libya last year , foreign banks and governments began freezing billions of dollars in assets held by his family and government , just as they had frozen accounts of the toppled governments in and  but the dictators and their inner circles had spent decades amassing and hiding vast fortunes , and much of the wealth was not easy to find libyan investigators say they have identified tens of billions of dollars in swiss banks alone that was never frozen all of it skimmed from libya s vast oil wealth and disguised under innocuous names in tunisia and egypt , the new governments are pursuing foreign real estate , yachts and bank accounts that are also said to be worth billions investigators in all three countries say they now face formidable obstacles in tracing and recovering the money in libya , stolen oil proceeds were often laundered through complex foreign partnerships that gave them a whiff of legitimacy in egypt and tunisia , the new governments are trying to recover the assets of the ruling families and of their allies in business and industry , which they say were gained through cronyism and corruption , if not outright theft proving that those insider fortunes were gained illicitly can be extremely hard , especially when foreign legal systems are involved in some cases , the people who know where the money is held are at risk not only because they are viewed as criminals in their home countries , but also because they hold secrets to questionable or corrupt deals that implicate companies and governments in the arab world and the west shukri ghanem , a former libyan oil minister who fled the country last year , was found dead under mysterious circumstances in the danube river in vienna on april 29 days earlier , he offered to tell libyan officials everything he knew about a range of suspect oil deals in exchange for immunity from prosecution , according to two men who spoke with him another qaddafi confidant , bashir saleh bashir the only man who knows the whereabouts of 7 billion in colonel qaddafi s african investments , libyan officials say was captured by rebels last year and then apparently allowed to escape , later turning up in france libyan officials say they believe mr bashir also has information about an illicit deal between colonel qaddafi and nicolas sarkozy , the former french president \( mr sarkozy has long denied that he received any money from the colonel \) mr bashir s current whereabouts is unknown so far , almost none of the shadow assets have been returned in march , the libyan authorities gained ownership of a that belonged to saadi elqaddafi , one of the former dictator s sons two aircraft in france and switzerland belonging to the former tunisian dictator , worth a total of 30 million , were transferred to the country s new government last year and the state assets frozen last year are gradually being made available the rest of the money is hard to find , often hidden behind multiple fronts that zigzag between half a dozen countries , according to several investigators and lawyers who have worked on recovering it in theory , much of it could still be cashed in by the shadowy intermediaries who deposited it once identified and frozen , it can still be defended by lawyers for the former ruling families lawyers hired by the ben ali clan have fought efforts to repatriate about 70 million held in swiss bank accounts at every step , according to enrico monfrini , a swiss lawyer working on behalf of the new tunisian authorities saadi elqaddafi , who is now in niger , expressed an interest in defending his ownership of the london house but was unable to do so in the time available , said nick kaufman , an israeli lawyer and former international criminal court prosecutor who has been retained by mr qaddafi and his sister aisha recovering these assets is not easy , said robert palmer , an investigator with the anticorruption group global witness first you must find the assets second , you must prove they are owned by the politician in question third , you must prove they were corrupt , and this requires evidencegathering by the requesting country that is costly , difficult and timeconsuming even with money that has been located and frozen , delays in the recovery process have led to tensions between the new governments and western countries in march , the illicit gains authority of the egyptian government filed suit against the british treasury to try to force it to provide information needed to help repatriate about 135 million in bank accounts belonging to 19 people in the inner circle of former president hosni mubarak british officials say they are bound by british law , which requires the egyptians to provide them with criminal convictions first switzerland is still blocking about 450 million in mubarak family bank accounts pending resolution of the egyptian government s claims with money held by figures close to the former egyptian government , recovery is likely to be harder hussein salem , an egyptian magnate who was close to mr mubarak and is said to be worth billions , fled to spain last year he has maintained that he earned his fortune honestly this month spain s supreme court upheld a decision to extradite him to egypt to face corruption charges , but the spanish government froze only 45 million of his assets , and it is not clear whether the rest will be returned in libya , there is much more money involved , much of it missing , said mustafa abushagur , a deputy prime minister in libya s transitional government of the 160 billion in libyan state foreign assets listed by the country s central bank just before the revolution , billions were never actually frozen because no one knew where the money was or because the governments in question simply refused to take action a united nations panel that was formed to identify these assets reported in march that some african governments declined to respond to the panel s requests or provided false information only one man is believed to have full knowledge of libya s african assets , estimated at 7 billion mr bashir , the 66yearold qaddafi confidant who was captured last year and fled to france mr bashir ran the libyan african portfolio , a that invested libya s oil wealth in hotels , banks , telecommunication shares and mining concessions spread across the continent the fund was never audited or supervised , according to abdelhamid eljadi , a libyan banker who is advising the government on asset recovery bashir is the one who knows everything about this money , and not only that , he still has access to it , mr jadi said libyan officials , who this month released a list of 338 people and entities linked to stolen assets , say it is important to recover the money soon because some african countries have begun to nationalize libyan investments zambia , for instance , seized control in january of zamtel , the country s largest phone company , which is mostly owned by the libyan african portfolio the case of mr ghanem , the former oil minister who died in vienna , remains a mystery the austrian authorities have said the cause of his death was not clear he had been viewed as a relative reformer in colonel qaddafi s government , and he once complained that the dictator s sons were using libya s oil company as a personal bank , according to a leaked united states diplomatic cable from 2008 but he was close to the colonel s son seif alislam elqaddafi and deeply familiar with the libyan government s inner financial workings , according to the leaked cables and a number of officials here a lot of shukri ghanem s partners who did corrupt deals with him wanted him to stay quiet , said mr jadi , the libyan banker
the ' best player said it all in three letters wow that was the reaction , via twitter , of the angels' doeverything outfielder , mike trout , to the news thursday that his team had signed josh hamilton from the rival texas rangers hamilton , a former american league most valuable player , did not get as much money as pitcher for their southern california neighbor , the los angeles dodgers , for six years and 147 million this week but hamilton did just fine , agreeing to a fiveyear , 125 million contract , according to a baseball official with knowledge of the deal , which will not be official until hamilton passes a physical it is tempting to say that the deal swings the balance of power in the al west to the angels , but we learned last winter that it really does not work that way a year ago , the angels signed albert pujols for roughly double the hamilton deal , and also added the former texas starter c j wilson but the angels finished in third place , behind texas and the surprising oakland athletics , who stole the division title from the rangers on the regular season s final day texas had a final chance to get into the division series , but lost the wildcard playin game to baltimore that game began with an error by first baseman michael young , who was traded this week to philadelphia , but the home fans saved most of their booing for hamilton , who went hitless in four meek atbats i gave them my all every time i went out there , hamilton said by his locker late that night , as the orioles partied down the hall hopefully , they appreciate it more than they did n't i think they do hey , we did n't get a win , but ca n't win 'em all the rangers came tantalizingly close to winning it all in 2011 , until pujols and the cardinals snatched the storybook from their grip in foiled in the ninth inning when needing only one strike to win , the rangers took a lead in the 10th on a homer by hamilton they blew another lead in the bottom of the 10th again after coming within a strike of winning and never recovered had scott feldman secured that final strike in the 10th inning , hamilton s homer would have lived in baseball lore , and catcher mike napoli , to that point the dominant hitter in the series , would have probably been the mvp napoli is likely gone , too , as he works to complete the threeyear contract agreement he made last week with the boston red sox hamilton leaves a meaningful legacy with the rangers , who had never won a playoff series before he arrived from cincinnati in a trade after the 2007 season hamilton led the team to two pennants , captivating fans with his power and his gripping back story of addiction , faith and a struggle for recovery that has included at least two public relapses in signing with the angels , though , hamilton probably undid a lot of the good will he had built in texas rangers general manager jon daniels told reporters at a luncheon thursday that he was unhappy with how hamilton had handled his decision to depart hamilton , daniels said , did not let the rangers make a final offer , as he had promised , the kind of revelation that will give fans incentive to boo hamilton even louder the next time they see him really , though , that is the way of the business world if hamilton had any desire to stay with the rangers after hearing the angels' pitch , he would have reached out to them he did not , a clear signal that there was nothing daniels and his boss , the hall of famer nolan ryan , could have done the rangers , for now , look lost they badly wanted greinke and have also chased arizona outfielder justin upton in a trade but after the diamondbacks made a threeway deal with cleveland and cincinnati this week , sending pitcher trevor bauer to the indians and obtaining the top shortstop prospect didi gregorius from the reds , they said they were not trading upton that stance could change , of course , and the rangers also have freeagent outfield options , like michael bourn , cody ross and nick swisher but given the rangers' pursuit of greinke , they also believe they need pitching help almost as an afterthought thursday , they lost starter ryan dempster to boston maybe , though , the rangers have outsmarted everyone extravagant freeagent spending does not always work , and teams that overcommit to their own players like the yankees with alex rodriguez and the phillies with ryan howard tend to show signs of decay the rangers have some of baseball s best prospects jurickson profar , mike olt and they are on the verge of making an impact in arlington the angels still need pitching , and with a surplus of outfielders , they could pursue the mets' r a dickey if they offered mark trumbo , a powerhitting outfielder who made the allstar team last summer , the mets could bite the angels were active before the hamilton agreement , adding joe blanton , sean burnett , tommy hanson and ryan madson to the pitching staff all are legitimate major leaguers , but none has the star power of hamilton , who brings his talents to the edge of hollywood and , yes , there is already a movie in production about his life
the mexican navy announced monday that a man suspected of being a member of a drug gang had been captured while carrying the identification cards of a recently slain newspaper employee in the state of veracruz the authorities link the suspect , juan carlos hern ndez pulido , whom they captured friday , to the killing of the newspaper employee , irasema becerra her dismembered remains were found in may along with those of three photojournalists six journalists have been killed in mexico so far this year five of them in veracruz none of the crimes have been solved yet
cairo voters cast ballots on saturday for the first competitively elected leader in s history , even as a lastminute grab for power by its ruling generals raised questions about whether the election would be a milestone in the transition to democracy or a facade obscuring the reemergence of the old order voters faced a stark choice between two faces of the past ahmed shafik , a former air force general and stalwart of former president hosni mubarak who promised to restore order and thwart the rise of an islamist theocracy , or mohamed morsi , a veteran of the onceoutlawed muslim brotherhood campaigning as a defender of the revolution against a return of the mubarakera autocracy the ruling military council that took power after mr mubarak s ouster 16 months ago had pledged that this weekend s twoday presidential runoff would be the final step in the transition to civilian government before the generals were to cede power the day before the vote , however , they dissolved the democratically elected , islamistled parliament that had been the chief accomplishment of the revolt so far acting on a rushed ruling by a court of mubarakappointed judges , they declared they would be the sole lawmakers , even after a new president is elected and they began drawing up a new interim constitution that would define the power of the president whom voters were choosing on saturday this is the end stage of the whole transition , said mahmoud ismail , 27 , a political activist in the nile delta who said he would vote for mr morsi to be or not to be the military s seizure of parliament precluded the possibility of the islamists of the muslim brotherhood taking control of both the legislature and the presidency now , if mr morsi wins , he will face a prolonged struggle for power against the generals , while mr shafik who had long been considered one of mr mubarak s likely successors could emerge as a new militarybacked strongman unrestrained by either a constitution or parliament mr shafik , mr mubarak s last prime minister , has made no public comment on the dissolution of parliament he cast his ballot on saturday in the style of his former boss , arriving at a polling place in an upscale suburb surrounded by a heavy guard of military and police officers the lines were pushed aside and guards immediately closed the facility for his private use crowds of his supporters were waiting both inside and outside the polling place the brotherhood is dissolved , they chanted , cheering at the dissolution of the brotherhoodled parliament state media reported that a cameraman in a military vehicle filmed mr shafik s trip to the ballot box , apparently to preserve it for posterity mr morsi of the muslim brotherhood sought saturday to cast the election as the last chance to beat back the full revival of the mubarak government he waited in line for more than two hours in the nearly 100degree heat to cast his vote in the nile delta town of zagazig , where he used to teach engineering god is great , a throng of supporters cried as he emerged , and he shouted over them to salute those killed while demonstrating against mr mubarak today is the day of the martyrs , he declared there is no place at all for mubarak s helpers across egypt , the streets were calm , but enthusiasm was low and turnout had fallen sharply from the first round the two candidates , however , revved up the battletested political machines that helped them advance past last month s first round of voting mr morsi turned to the brotherhood s system of local cells and charities built over 84 years of preaching and politics mr shafik , who surged to roughly tie mr morsi in the first round of voting , scarcely a month after he announced his campaign , relied instead on the network of local power brokers , including retired army officers and former leaders in mr mubarak s defunct ruling party in mr shafik s campaign offices in menoufia , in the nile delta , staff members said that they were enjoying the novelty of egypt s first competitive presidential race this is a good feeling , if you do n't know what will happen , said tarek alwarraqui , a campaign volunteer who previously helped manage local elections before , we knew he cataloged the brotherhood s missteps and touted his colleagues' proficiency in the bareknuckle politics of the district we have a network , he said we have someone in every village the brotherhood s experience is different , he said we worked in the light they were underground he handed out fliers throughout the district calling the brotherhood members liars and mubarak cronies a photograph on one showed the brotherhood s speaker of parliament accepting what appeared to be chocolate candy from ahmed ezz , a fellow lawmaker and steel tycoon reviled as a symbol of the old elite s corruption several pictures captured brotherhood leaders sitting or shaking hands with the american ambassador it was an extension of a campaign of bold inversions that mr shafik himself has leveled against the group the brotherhood was mr mubarak s principal opposition and then a mainstay of the tahrir square protests , but mr shafik has accused it of collaborating with the mubarak government and directing the shooting of tahrir square protesters in his last television interview before the vote , mr shafik even claimed credit for mr mubarak s ouster i'm the one who proposed the idea of stepping down , and i proposed it insistently , he said he had proposed it in a meeting with the top military leader , field marshal mohamed hussein tantawi and former vice president omar suleiman to plot a response to the uprising , he said , and it took perseverance to persuade field marshal tantawi to carry it out eman youssef , a housewife in the nile delta town of shibin alkom , was ready to believe him about the brotherhood they accomplished nothing with the power we gave them in parliamentary elections , she said i hate them the brotherhood scrambled to respond to dissolution of parliament , previously the group s power base seizing on the appearance that the militaryled government was out to thwart them , brotherhood leaders held news conferences accusing mr shafik and his allies in government of schemes to rig the vote , such as busing plainclothes security officers , who were legally barred from voting , to the polls none of their accusations could be proven but mr morsi and brotherhood leaders around the country sought to use the threat of voter fraud to rally voters to the polls egyptians , defend your will , continue to vote heavily , the brotherhood declared in a statement , urging voters to stand up against any attempt to waste the gains that you have achieved with your free votes in the people s assembly and the presidential elections after a meeting between mr morsi and top brotherhood leaders , the group acknowledged for the first time that the military had shut down parliament , and demanded a national referendum on its legal status the military council is grabbing the legislative power without any right , as well as the executive authority it is supposed to hand over to civilians in two weeks , the group said in a statement it is a coup against the entire democratic march , and it sends us back to square one their warnings , too , found sympathetic ears heba mahmoud , a 30yearold resident of the cairo neighborhood of imbaba , said she was voting for mr morsi mainly to stop mr shafik and to remove the military council i'm not voting for the brotherhood , she said i'm voting for regime change however , another imbaba voter , izzat eissa ibn mahmoud , 53 , said he voted for a leftist in the first round but swung to mr shafik this time he had just closed his business making crafts for tourists because the instability had decimated it we all want change , he said we 're not stupid , and we know this is n't ideal but , he added , i ca n't afford it i ca n't afford real change right now real freedom is too hefty a price
when gen ambrose burnside took over the army of the potomac in november 1862 , the republicans had suffered major losses in the midterm elections , and the pressure was on to strike the confederacy hard and end the rebellion but burnside took over a command as divided as the union itself many soldiers , particularly in the lower ranks , were angry over the recent dismissal of their beloved but controversial leader , gen george b mcclellan , and had serious doubts about both burnside s competence and the north s shifting war aims and yet the country rallied behind the bewhiskered new commander as someone who could win on the battlefield the new york times hailed him as just the man , of all men now in the field , likely to illustrate by some daring act of war in which he has thrown all the energies of his chivalric soul unexamined were his penchant for gambling , his failures to make his own reconnaissance of the terrain his soldiers were to fight on , and his publicly expressed doubts about his own abilities within two days of taking command , burnside delivered his plan to move the army south from warrenton , va , to fredericksburg , a city 40 miles away , and from there to advance on richmond henry halleck , the de facto army chief of staff , took the matter to president abraham lincoln both men were skeptical they had pushed commanders to destroy the confederate armies rather than take geography moreover , they and others considered an assault on fredericksburg too large and complex a move to make without serious planning montgomery meigs , the quartermaster general , compared burnside s plan to undertaking to supply boston without any previous provision being made halleck , meigs and herman haupt , head of the military rail system , rushed to warrenton on nov 12 to see burnside burnside was , for once , confident in his efforts instead of a supply chain , he said , he would have his troops forage for food and supplies , even boats from which to fashion pontoon bridges halleck had his doubts , and indeed burnside s orders to round up boats and other supplies went largely unfulfilled still , lincoln , through halleck , gave his wary approval lincoln , halleck later wrote , thinks it will succeed if you move rapidly , otherwise not speed , lincoln concluded , might reduce the need for supplies burnside s three grand division commanders moved out immediately they made rapid progress down the eastern side of virginia edwin sumner reached falmouth by nov 17 , while on nov 18 william franklin was in nearby stafford court house and joseph hooker at hartwood soon they were on the opposite bank of the rappahannock river from fredericksburg sumner was anxious to go ahead and ford the river , but burnside wanted to wait for the pontoons to arrive as a result , sumner recalled , we lay there nearly a month , while they were fortifying before our eyes by dec 10 , almost 80 , 000 confederate soldiers were in place around fredericksburg their strongest position was along the sunken road and the stone wall on marye s heights , to the west of the city center and invisible to the union position across the river by then , burnside couldn t sleep more than a few hours each night his civil war had been a series of near disasters , which never hindered his steady rise in the ranks in slightly over a year , he had survived the first battle of bull run when union regulars came to his aid invaded north carolina in an expedition that teetered on disaster fought his corps through one of the bloodiest engagements at antietam \( caused by his own inattention to detail \) and at least twice refused the command of the army of the potomac , professing his loyalty to mcclellan , before being ordered to replace him it all caught up to burnside at fredericksburg under the cover of early morning darkness and fog on dec 11 , union engineers began laying the bridges as they neared the shore , the confederates hidden in the town opened fire , driving the engineers back the only way to complete the bridges was to pummel fredericksburg with artillery and storm it with infantry coming by boat burnside s troops occupied fredericksburg early on dec 12 but it wasn t a forceful enough move that morning , as another heavy fog settled over the valley , hooker remained on the northern bank , and franklin stayed behind to keep open a line of retreat and instead of immediately engaging the enemy just outside the city , burnside waited until 7 30 am to send out his orders all this dithering by burnside left his force of 120 , 000 divided in the immediate presence of a powerful enemy finally , when the fog burned off around noon , gen george meade s division of pennsylvania volunteers advanced on gen thomas j stonewall jackson s troops on prospect hill surprisingly , meade s 4 , 500 battleinnocent men penetrated the line more deeply than pickett did at gettysburg , according to a later report but without reinforcements and fire closing in on them from every direction , they fell back shortly after 2 pm over at marye s heights , sumner , observing from a church steeple , saw his men dying by short rounds from both friendly fire and the entrenched confederates i sent word several times that they were firing into us , he wrote the union ranks melted like snow coming down on warm ground with franklin staying put , burnside threw brigades piecemeal into assaults on marye s heights , an aggressiveness that hooker thought murderous folly burnside , ever the gambler , doubled down the assaults on marye s heights continued when gen andrew a humphreys s men passed over the wounded from earlier attacks , the survivors told them that they were heading into an abbatoir in the fading light , gen george w getty s troops moved to attack if it had been daytime , he recalled , they would have killed about every one of us the confederate entrenchment was impregnable sebastopol was not as strong , the new york times wrote the day set with the union having failed to gain any significant ground since the morning , but with thousands of casualties to show for the effort the night was bitter cold , one soldier recalled , and a fearful one for the first line of surviving soldiers hugging the hollows of the ground lanterncarrying surgeons searched the twomilelong battlefield for the wounded the confederates continued shooting the afternoon s failure drove burnside to talk wildly about leading his beloved ninth corps in a bayonet charge the next day talking calmly , sumner insisted that such a charge could only mean a repetition of his disastrous assaults on burnside s bridge at antietam , where a small band of confederates held his forces off for hours , and which he finally took at a high cost the question instead turned to whether to stay on the south side of the river , or leave fredericksburg entirely a ceasefire to collect the wounded bought some time until burnside ordered a retreat under the cover of bad weather and darkness on dec 15 the union suffered 12 , 500 casualties , to the confederates 5 , 400 burnside took the blame for the loss as he reported to halleck , the fact that i decided to move from warrenton onto this line rather against the opinion of the president , secretary , and yourself , and that you have left the whole management in my hands , without giving me orders , makes me the more responsible but burnside was wrong the move on warrenton wasn t the mistake as the historian francis w palfrey wrote , it is both possible and probable that if burnside had permitted sumner to cross the rappahannock on nov 17 the costly and useless sacrifices of the dec 11 and 13 might have been spared a few days after the battle two mcclellan loyalists , brig gen john newton , a west point graduate and son of a longtime virginia congressman , and brig gen john cochrane , a former democratic new york congressman , headed to washington the pair said they wanted to present their case against burnside to leading members of congress \( which , they must have known , wasn t in session \) instead , they convinced secretary of state william seward to arrange a meeting for them with the president the next day at the white house the pair , saying they were only reporting feelings and opinions of men in the army , pointed to the rising numbers of resignations and desertions and asked for an outside party to gauge morale in the camps and review burnside s performance when the president asked if the army would not fight with burnside in command , newton demurred , but the message got across lincoln sent burnside a telegram to not make a general movement without letting me know of it the general chalked the telegram up to the president s coordinating other military movements lincoln told burnside in a dec 31 meeting that two officers described his command as dispirited and demoralized that any attempt to make a movement at that time would result in disaster burnside protested that no one knew his larger plan lincoln sent for halleck and stanton to hear burnside out on one point halleck and burnside agreed officers who made those representations to the president should be at once dismissed but the larger question remained finally , on jan 20 , 1863 , burnside issued his new orders to strike a great and mortal blow to the rebellion the temperature was above freezing as a new march south began by nightfall , a light rain fell by midnight , the winds picked up and the heavier rains drenched those with only a blanket for protection early in the morning , without coffee and little or no food , the soldiers discovered their wagons sinking in a complete sea of mud whipping the animals on failed by afternoon , the entire army was exhausted the roadways and paths are strewn with every conceivable kind of army material , from muskets and accoutrements to cannon , caissons , supply wagons , lumber , pontoon boots and planks , dead horses and mules , one man recalled exhausted soldiers died by the roadside from cold , wet , and fatigue having ridden forward to see what was happening , burnside ordered his muddy , wet , ugly , sour , and insubordinate men back at their old campsites into the next day , whiskey flowed unendingly for burnside , enough was enough he dismissed hooker for unjust and unnecessary criticisms of the actions of his superior officers deducing that newton and cochrane met with the president , he fired them and added brig gen william t h brooks , a division commander , for good measure he did the same to franklin and three others then he prepared his own letter of resignation and took it to the president instead , lincoln replaced burnside with hooker he also relieved sumner and franklin , but refused to accept burnside s own resignation he later served in two commands until the 1864 battlefield disaster at the battle of the crater in which union engineers planted an enormous mine beneath confederate lines , only to be cut to pieces when they rushed in pushed him to the sidelines for good none of this mattered to voters in his home state of rhode island

our subject for today is presidential nominating conventions why are they still around \? other possible subjects were the facebook phenomenon and why does its board of directors look like a reunion tour of the backstreet boys and their managers \? or the new sensation of dancing dogs on tv talent shows and how many of them do you think were ever made to ride on the roof of a car \? but , no , i think we should go with the conventions the republicans are having theirs in tampa , fla , in august and then the democrats will be in charlotte , nc , at the beginning of september the presidential nominees have been chosen , but there s still a lot to look forward to the speeches ! the funny hats ! and , um littleknown factoids about the upcoming conventions the democrats have an official barbecue sauce actually , three you can buy them on the official web site , along with a bunch of tshirts and a very fetching oven mitt the republican national convention says that it is expecting 13 , 000 to 15 , 000 members of the news media , which would make it the single largest media event in the world except for the olympic games the convention should try to use this olympic theme more extensively , perhaps decking out all the potential vice presidential nominees in speedos and recounting heartwarming stories involving ailing family members who are rooting for them back home the governor of florida has rejected tampa s attempt to ban the carrying of concealed weapons downtown during the republican convention i guess this is one way to ratchet up excitement , but i 'd prefer donald trump nominated for vice president you , the taxpayer , are paying the bill yes ! back in the 1970s , after a watergate scandal involving lobbyists who traded huge donations to the republican convention for special favors from the nixon administration , congress passed a law providing federal funding indexed for inflation , it s now about 18 million per it s the one part of the public funding program both parties seem more than happy to accept , said anthony corrado , a professor of government at colby college and an expert on the financing of political conventions \( is n't it reassuring that there are people struggling to get the country worried about presidential nominating convention finances \? it reminds me of the year i was in charge of making it fun to read about the new york city charter revision commission \) the parties swear , when they take the cash , that they wo n't solicit additional contributions but in american politics , when there s a law against raising money you want to raise , the answer is a \) break the law b \) find a crazy billionaire c \) form a committee option c wins ! the cities that want to be a convention site create committees , which promise to raise copious cash if chosen the host committee in charlotte , for instance , is pledged to raise 3665 million this is turning into something of a struggle , particularly since the democrats , in a littlenoted reform effort , prohibited the host committee from accepting donations above 100 , 000 , or money from lobbyists or corporations \( the republicans will pretty much take anything from anybody \) instantly , like a daffodil in spring , a new committee popped up in charlotte , called new american city its mission is to showcase all that the city and region has to offer during the convention and , of course , it has none of those irksome limitations while they were banning corporate contributions , the democrats also reduced this year s convention to three days from the usual four however , the eliminated day will be turned over to a celebration at the charlotte motor speedway , during which viewers will have the opportunity to note the close ties between the democratic party and nascar dads and since it is happening before the official opening gavel , it can be paid for by new american city do not tell me that this country has lost its capacity for innovation in a sane world , the conventions could run one day and 18 million would be plenty they could skip almost everything but the speeches by the candidates , and president obama will actually leave the convention to make his at charlotte s unfortunatelynamed bank of america stadium why do they stretch it out \? well , there are a lot of politicians out there yearning for a chance to address an empty auditorium at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and our public officials have to deal with an endless line of really irritating people who are impossible to make happy a convention is a mound of favors they can do for their special interests a party invitation , a seat in the vicinity of joe biden , or just the opportunity to mingle on the floor with the south dakota delegation \( good hats ! \) if it was n't for the need to treat the monied troops , the republicans could hold their convention at mitt romney s vacation house which i hear is much more pleasant than tampa in late august
nineteen seconds later , under a brilliant blue sky , a national champion jockey named jacky martin lay sprawled in the furrowed dirt just past the finish line , paralyzed , his neck broken in three places on the ground next to him , his frightened horse , leg broken and chest heaving , was minutes away from being euthanized on the track for finishing fourth on this early september day last year , jacky martin got about 60 and possibly a lifetime tethered to a respirator the next day , it nearly happened again at virtually the same spot , another horse broke a front leg , pitching his rider headfirst into the ground the jockey escaped serious injury , but not the 2yearold horse , teller all gone he was euthanized , and then dumped near an old toilet in a junkyard a short walk from where he had been sold at auction the previous year in the next 24 hours , two fearful jockeys refused their assigned mounts the track honored two other riders who had died racing as doctors fought to save mr martin s life , a sign went up next to the track tote board hang in there , jacky we love you in 2008 , after a kentucky derby horse , eight belles , broke two ankles on national television and was euthanized , congress extracted promises from the racing industry to make its sport safer while safety measures like bans on anabolic steroids have been enacted , assessing their impact has been difficult because many tracks do not keep accurate accident figures or will not release them but an investigation by the new york times has found that industry practices continue to put animal and rider at risk a computer analysis of data from more than 150 , 000 races , along with injury reports , drug test results and interviews , shows an industry still mired in a culture of drugs and lax regulation and a fatal breakdown rate that remains far worse than in most of the world mr martin s injury occurred in a state with the worst safety record for racetracks , a place where most trainers who illegally pump sore horses full of painkillers to mask injury and then race them are neither fined nor suspended and owners of those drugged horses usually keep their winnings the failure of regulators to stop that cheating is reflected in the numbers since 2009 , records show , trainers at united states tracks have been caught illegally drugging horses 3 , 800 times , a figure that vastly understates the problem because only a small percentage of horses are actually tested in the same period , according to the times analysis , 6 , 600 horses broke down or showed signs of injury since 2009 , the incident rate has not only failed to go down , it has risen slightly the greatest number of incidents on a single day 23 occurred last year on the most celebrated day of racing in america , the running of the kentucky derby one derby horse fractured a leg , as did a horse in the previous race at churchill downs all told , seven jockeys at other tracks were thrown to the ground after their horses broke down a statebystate survey by the times shows that about 3 , 600 horses died racing or training at stateregulated tracks over the last three years it s hard to justify how many horses we go through , said dr rick arthur , the equine medical director for the california racing board in humans you never see someone snap their leg off running in the olympics but you see it in horse racing even some of america s most prestigious tracks , including belmont park , santa anita park and saratoga race course , had incident rates higher than the national average last year , records show why racehorses break down at such a high rate has been debated for years , but the discussion inevitably comes back to drugs laboratories cannot yet detect the newest performanceenhancing drugs , while trainers experiment with anything that might give them an edge , including chemicals that bulk up pigs and cattle before slaughter , cobra venom , viagra , blood doping agents , stimulants and cancer drugs illegal doping , racing officials say , often occurs on private farms before horses are shipped to the track few states can legally test horses there they are pharmacist shops , said dr george maylin , the longtime head of new york state s testing laboratory nobody has any control over what they are doing even so , legal therapeutic drugs pain medicine in particular pose the greatest risk to horse and rider in england , where breakdown rates are half of what they are in the united states , horses may not race on any drugs at higher levels , pain medicine can mask injury , rendering prerace examinations less effective if a horse cannot feel an existing injury , it may run harder than it otherwise would , putting extra stress on the injury as many as 90 percent of horses that break down had preexisting injuries , california researchers have found while highprofile triple crown races get the most attention , the mainstay of racing in america is the lower tier , socalled claiming races horses in these races are most vulnerable , in part because regulators often give them less protection from potentially dangerous drugs the times analysis found that horses in claiming races have a 22 percent greater chance of breaking down or showing signs of injury than horses in higher grade races that lower level of race has been particularly affected by the arrival of casinos at aqueduct , most of the 16 horses that have died so far this year were in the lower ranks , where purses have increased the fastest because of new casino money last year at the track , dr ohlinger counted 63 dead horses that , she said , is more than double the fatalities of five years earlier oversight undermined race officials have always done their best to hide fatal breakdowns , erecting screens around fallen horses and then refusing to disclose the tracks accident rates but amid criticism that individual state racing commissions lacked the will to make the sport safer , and the threat of federal oversight , the industry promised changes , including new restrictions on the use of drugs , a program to accredit racetracks and drugtesting laboratories and uniform rules for punishing drug violators the industry also set up a national database where tracks were asked , but not required , to report injuries with the promise of confidentiality so far , the response to these reform measures has fallen short fiftyfive tracks pledged that they would seek accreditation , requiring among other things prerace inspections and postmortem examinations , or necropsies fewer than half have kept their promise some tracks do not have the money to spend to meet our standards others think it s window dressing and why bother , said michael ziegler , executive director of the national thoroughbred racing association safety and integrity alliance any followup with tracks has gone unanswered the laboratory accreditation program , introduced in july 2009 , has fared even worse after calling the program an unprecedented step that ultimately will change the face of drug testing in this country , a consortium of industry groups that manages it says not a single lab has been accredited an association of racing regulators wrote to congress on may 14 , 2010 , boasting that with the exception of antibleeding medicine , race day medications are not allowed yet records show that in florida , a major racing state , trainers continue to use corticosteroids , an antiinflammatory , on race day the national repository for injury reports , maintained by the jockey club , the most powerful racing industry group , has been more successful , gathering data from 92 percent of the racing days we put it into a database , and we provide tools back to the racetracks where they can analyze and slice and dice the information themselves , said james l gagliano , president of the jockey club , who says the group has encouraged racetracks to make the statistics public so far , 24 out of 86 tracks have done so to assess how often horses get injured , the times bought data for about 150 , 000 races from 2009 through 2011 , then searched for terms indicating that a horse encountered a physical problem , like broke down , lame or vanned off although the people who chronicle the races , known as chart callers , can be stylistically different , they are taught to use standard industry terms , and their descriptions constitute the official record used by gamblers to evaluate horses the analysis showed that during those three years the rate of incidents for horses in the united states was 52 per 1 , 000 starts by contrast , woodbine racetrack in toronto , which year after year has one of the lowest breakdown rates in north america , had an incident rate of only 14 , according to the times analysis one of the differences here is medication is not as permissive as it is in the us , said jamie martin , executive vice president of racing at woodbine yet no accident over the last three years can match what occurred in a single race on feb 29 , at hollywood casino at charles town races in west virginia eight horses started seven fell one finished along the way , seven jockeys were left scattered on the ground the next and final race was canceled , not just because it took so long to clear the track , but also because too few jockeys were available or willing to ride drug violations it was the day s first race in hobbs , nm the track was fast and the weather clear shortly after noon on oct 16 , 2010 , nine young horses were loaded into the starting gate at zia park casino with the finish line a mere 400 yards away , this would be an allout sprint , horse racing s equivalent of a drag race while these races , run by a breed called quarter horses , lack the ebbandflow suspense of a longer thoroughbred race , they make up for it in a pure adrenalin rush the best quarter horses can hit nearly 50 miles an hour three weeks earlier at zia park , mark anthony villa was on the back of a quarter horse when it fell just past the finish line , throwing him to the ground with a herd of thousandpluspound animals bearing down on him , mr villa tried to crawl to safety he never made it a horse s hoof struck him in the head with such force that his helmet shot like a bullet across the track he died within an instant , leaving a wife and twin children with mr villa s death still on the minds of riders and spectators , a gray 2yearold colt named i glance at chicks settled in the 6 hole waiting for the starting bell for bettors , he was an animal to watch the horse had won his only race and was trained by andres gonzalez , who , according to racing commission records , was not above allowing his horses to race with extra help illegal help a week earlier , another horse trained by mr gonzalez had raced at zia park with 12 times the legal limit of a drug that mimicked steroids by the end of 2011 , mr gonzalez would have amassed a dozen drug violations in just four years his uncle , ramon o gonzalez sr , for whom he often worked , had his own lengthy list of violations , including accusations that he drugged 10 horses in just two months whether i glance at chicks felt pain as he raced is unknown , but he never challenged for the lead shortly after crossing the finish line in fifth place , he broke down the diagnosis a bone fracture in his front left leg and ligament damage , injuries from which he could not recover a veterinarian , dr clayton mccook , euthanized the colt with an injection of pentobarbital afterward , dr mccook wrote a note to whom it may concern , expressing his distress to the authorities over this fatal breakdown and others like it i have had to euthanize several horses due to catastrophic injuries and feel they are occurring in greater numbers than one should expect , dr mccook wrote i do not pretend to be an expert in racing surfaces , nor in the training of racehorses , but i do know that something appears to be amiss at zia park according to an analysis of race records , zia park in 2010 had the nation s secondhighest incident rate , 133 last year , it ranked fourth with a rate of 119 after horse owners complained about the track surface , zia park officials said they spent 80 , 000 resurfacing it before the 2011 racing season during the three days that a times reporter visited zia park last november , eight horses collapsed , died or were transported off the track at the time , track officials said it was company policy not to allow a reporter access to the backside where trainers stable their horses christopher mcerlean , vice president of racing at penn national gaming , which owns zia park , said in a statement that the times analysis used figures produced by nonmedical professionals for the purpose of handicapping feature races mr mcerlean also said some horses are vanned off as a precaution and may not actually have been injured but zia park officials said that last year , a significant number of horses had to be carried off the track because of exhaustion stemming from the possible abuse of a drug that mimics anabolic steroids as well as other medication issues mr mcerlean said penn gaming endorses tougher penalties for those who violate drug rules without a postmortem exam of i glance at chicks , no determination could be made as to whether a preexisting condition or some other unknown factor might have played a role in his demise but tests did reveal that the horse had been dosed with a large load of a powerful painkilling medicine called flunixin in at least two states , 2yearolds may not race with any flunixin not so in new mexico , where they can run with up to 50 nanograms of the drug , more than double the amount allowed in a higher class of competition called graded stakes races but even that higher amount was not enough for mr gonzalez i glance at chicks carried 282 nanograms of flunixin to put that figure in perspective , dr mary scollay , chief veterinarian for the kentucky racing commission , said she had never seen such high levels in her state when you look at the history of our medication violations flunixin most are under 50 nanograms , 35 nanograms , something like that , dr scollay said in fact , she said she had never seen a violation in kentucky over 104 in new mexico , it is common practice tests on horses in new mexico showed results over 104 nanograms on 68 occasions since 2009 , with some registering 1 , 000 and even 2 , 400 , records show the levels are so high that regulatory veterinarians in other states say the horses must have been drugged on race day , a practice that is forbidden before the new mexico racing commission could pass judgment on the overdosing of i glance at chicks , another horse trained by mr gonzalez tested positive for even higher levels of flunixin the extra dosing did not hurt performance the horse finished first , and its owner , mr gonzalez s cousin ramon gonzalez jr , got to keep his winnings if andres gonzalez was worried about how the racing commission viewed his treatment of i glance at chicks , he need not have been records show he received a warning and nothing more lax penalties new mexico s racing industry the tracks and their regulators has been unusually slow in responding to the safety alarms new mexico also recorded no positive tests in 2010 and 2011 for the most frequently abused pain medicine in racing , phenylbutazone , a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory commonly known as bute after the times asked why none had been found , the new executive director of the state s racing commission , vince mares , said that after researching the question , he discovered that the previous leadership had cut back on the tests for financial reasons without a national law regulating drugs in racing , new mexico regulators can be as lenient as they wish in disciplining drug violators trainers in new mexico who overmedicate horses with flunixin get a free pass on their first violation , a 200 fine on the second and a 400 fine on the third , records show in indiana , by contrast , winnings are forfeited after the first drug offense if someone who violates the rule thinks the penalties are going to be mild or nonexistent , then breaking the rules is just a cost of doing business , said joe gorajec , the executive director of the indiana horse racing commission new mexico gives offenders another break it wipes away flunixin violations every 12 months , allowing trainers to again overmedicate horses without penalty dozens of huge flunixin overdoses have resulted in warnings only sometimes the same horse is illegally drugged twice on may 9 , 2009 , runawayslew , a horse trained by andres gonzalez , raced with two antiinflammatory drugs nineteen days later , under another trainer , runawayslew raced on cocaine to varying degrees , the picture is similar nationwide trainers often face little punishment for drug violations , and on the rare occasions when they are suspended , they are allowed to turn their stables over to an assistant since january 2005 , 116 trainers have had five or more drug violations , and 10 trainers had 10 or more , records show in new mexico , cody kelley , an albuquerque lawyer who represents people accused of violating racing commission rules , including andres gonzalez , said punishments were too arbitrary are there people that cheat at horse racing in new mexico \? yes , happens everywhere , mr kelley said but i think our commission right now is not equipped to deal with it what we need are national rules mr mares , the new mexico racing chief , agrees that his agency needs more uniform penalties to avoid charges of favoritism there is an issue of consistency you can quote me on this , mr mares said it is being addressed new mexico recently became the first state to temporarily ban all horses from racing on clenbuterol , a drug that aids respiration , but that has been widely abused because it can build muscle in recent years , the state commission has had its embarrassments one former investigator faces trial on charges of stealing horses while working at the commission another trainer s doping violation was dismissed because the assistant attorney general handling the case neglected to show up in court and the commission had to drop charges against ramon o gonzalez sr for drugging 10 horses because it forgot to file the proper paperwork , according to the state attorney general s office nonetheless , odds are slim that any of the gonzalezes andres , ramon sr or ramon jr will show up at a new mexico racetrack any time soon in late january , a federal grand jury in albuquerque indicted them on charges of participating in a drug trafficking scheme tied to one of mexico s most notorious drug cartels all have pleaded not guilty andres gonzalez was arrested at sunland park racetrack and casino in new mexico his uncle , ramon sr , was arrested while pulling a horse trailer that the authorities said was carrying 26 kilograms of cocaine and 500 pounds of marijuana  masking pain , or healing it breakdowns can be caused by a variety of factors , including poor track surface and jockey mistakes but drugs , often used to mask existing injuries , are the prime suspect it s not that these medications caused the injuries , but the trainers knew the horses were injured and gave them the meds to get them into the race , said dr arthur , the veterinarian for the california horse racing board necropsies are considered essential to determining if an existing injury contributed to a fatal breakdown however , only 11 states require them , a times survey found in california , where necropsies are required , researchers found that a large majority of horses had existing problems at the site of their fatal injuries to be fair , some of that is microscopic and may not be readily apparent , dr arthur said we re trying to figure out why vets and trainers are not identifying injuries prior to catastrophic injuries but many prior ailments are indeed serious the times obtained hundreds of necropsy reports on racehorses that died racing in pennsylvania and found problems that included severe degenerative joint disease , severe chronic osteoarthritis and pneumonia with severe , extensive lung inflammation one horse had 50 stomach ulcers another had just one eye pathologists also found metal screws in two horses that had broken bones from previous accidents in the united states , horses are usually allowed to run on some dose of pain medication , usually bute the question , fiercely debated in the racing community , is at what level do therapeutic drugs make racing unsafe \? virginia s fatality rate went up after regulators in 2005 raised the allowable level of bute to 5 micrograms from 2 micrograms our catastrophic incidents increased significantly , said dr richard harden , equine medical director for the state racing commission virginia returned to the lower level in 2009 , though the fatality rate has not come down iowa s fatality rate rose by more than 50 percent after the state in 2007 allowed a higher level of bute regulatory veterinarians say the higher allowable levels make it difficult for them to spot lameness and injury during prerace examinations in one study , researchers at oklahoma state university said they found bute in most of the horses that died racing or training at oklahoma tracks in 2010 six had both bute and flunixin , a dangerous practice called stacking , the report said the researchers also expressed concern that despite fewer races , a record number of horses died , necessitating a careful reevaluation of track surfaces , medication enforcement and prerace examinations but prominent owners and trainers , and even some veterinarians , say evidence linking drugs and breakdowns is unconvincing kent h stirling , chairman of the national medication committee for the horsemen s benevolent and protective association , said there was no scientific evidence whatsoever that 5 micrograms of bute on race day is dangerous mr stirling and others say sore horses should not be denied therapeutic medicine when needed if you re a horseman and you re trying to keep a horse going and keep him happy and healthy as you can , then these therapeutic medications are very helpful , he said regulators typically view prescription drug violations as more benign than the use of banned substances on horses and they constitute the bulk of the 3 , 800 violations that the times found by surveying racing states but others , including racing regulators overseas , say horses should not compete on any drug regardless of type therapeutic drugs , by definition , are used for healing and curing , said arthur b hancock iii , whose farm produced three kentucky derby winners drugs that mask pain and enhance performance are not therapeutic they are what they are performanceenhancing drugs the industry group that runs graded stakes races had promised to ban all therapeutic drugs for 2yearolds , but in late february backed off , saying it did not have enough time to bring state regulators on board george w strawbridge jr , a prominent breeder and owner , resigned from the group over that decision , calling it one of the most craven acts he had seen how on earth did we get to this sorry state \? mr strawbridge said the first reason is that in this country there are no significant consequences for doping horses respecting the ride chris zamora knows the sensation of riding a sore horse but one ride in particular stands out on nov 25 , 2008 , mr zamora was guiding his horse , sinful heart , into the first turn at zia park when he sensed something was wrong he didn t want to take the turn , he said he was in pain sinful heart drifted out , clipped heels with another horse and fell a trailing horse tripped over them mr zamora , the winner of more than 1 , 000 races , nearly died in the accident , fracturing his skull , pelvis , ribs and four vertebrae his lungs collapsed , his liver was lacerated and his heart was compressed they had to insert a needle to take the pressure off of my heart , he said sinful heart survived to race three more times , in successively cheaper races , never winning before collapsing and dying on the track at ruidoso four months after his accident , in march 2009 , mr zamora returned to the track but he had changed no more cheap horses i tried to ride quality over quantity , he said i didn t ride a horse that somebody said was already sore i scratched more of them at that time than i had in my whole life the best trainers might have been unhappy , he said , but they trusted his judgment and fixed the problem they were great horsemen , mr zamora said , offering the ultimate compliment but not all were now , he said , some trainers just go to another rider these guys will head a horse up until it breaks down completely , and when there s a man on top of them , it s bad , he said other injured jockeys tell similar stories i think more should be done for the horse to let him heal naturally than to be getting him to the next race so we can get one more race out of him , said randy meier , a winner of more than 4 , 000 races , many in the chicago area along the way , mr meier broke his neck , collarbones , ribs , shoulder , legs , arms , wrist and sternum and developed a brain bleed new mexico jockeys have been hit particularly hard not only was mr villa killed and mr zamora and mr martin critically injured , juan campos died in an accident in august 2008 jimmy ray coates fell the same year , his heart stopping twice after breaking his femur , shoulder and collarbone carlos rivas had no pulse en route to the hospital after rupturing his aorta in 2010 , and the same year kelsi purcell fractured multiple vertebrae in a spill there were other injuries as well we ve been through this so many times , said terry meyocks , national manager of the jockeys guild more than 50 permanently disabled jockeys receive assistance from the jockeys guild , he said after mr zamora s accident , mr martin , a friend and hunting partner , had told him not to abandon hope you ll be back , he said you re in great shape , it won t be that long you re not done you won t be in a walker like all jockeys , mr zamora knew the risks of riding every time you do it , you take a chance one is going to break it off even with the soundest horse you take a chance good jockeys can alter their ride if a horse is sore or about to break down in some cases , though , there are no hints , no warnings and that is when jockeys face the greatest danger jacky martin had no warning i thought he was going to die , said adrian a ramos , who was riding in the same race he hit the ground hard , real hard i was behind him and i saw everything a second chance the favorite did eventually win and would have paid him 120 , 000 , the jockey s standard share for riding the horse that broke his neck , mr martin took home little more than the cost of a tank of gas until that wrenching moment in the ruidoso dirt , mr martin at age 56 had been on a redemptive journey to right the wrongs in his life , to help younger jockeys avoid the mistakes he had made and to regain what he had lost an opportunity to sit atop a racehorse and to coax from it all the power it was willing to give , and nothing more for four years , mr martin had been barred from racing after being sentenced to probation in 2006 for poaching deer and possessing less than a gram of methamphetamine he and his wife , tracey , also his agent , moved to louisiana i worked horses every day for three and a half years being a gallop boy , mr martin said that s all i was , a 10 gallop boy in the afternoon , mr martin helped to build fences and even a barn , his wife recounted we actually bagged horse manure and sold it and delivered it just to get through , she said it was a steep fall for a man so highly revered in the sport that mexican businessmen would send armed guards to escort him to highstakes races south of the border after a time , he took ownership for the wrong things that he did and worked his way through it , ms martin said just as important , friends say , he developed an even deeper appreciation for the role others played in racing , from grooms to horse owners struggling to stay in the game in the summer of 2010 , mr martin was finally cleared to race , and he returned to ruidoso unsure of how he would be received when word spread that jacky was back , owners were eager to extend a helping hand , but most of all , they were eager to win and win he did with the racing season half over , mr martin stormed into the lead to become the top winner and champion jockey for 2010 he was so grateful he got a second chance , ms martin said in december he was on the radio saying people out there need to know that they can be forgiven and succeed if i can fix my screwed up life , you can too in mr martin s quest to win an eighth futurity in 2010 , his horse lost by a nose in one of the biggest upsets in the history of that race but the loss did not diminish the joy he felt competing again it s just a fairy tale for it to turn out the way it has , mr martin told a racing publication in 2010 mr martin fell a year later , on the friday before labor day at the beginning of the final , biggest weekend of racing at ruidoso the tens of thousands of spectators , who would later fill the stands and line the distant highway with parked cars , had yet to arrive only a small , quiet crowd , including relatives of riders , trainers and owners , was on hand to watch mr martin go down one woman screamed because she mistakenly thought her husband had been the one injured the authorities did little to determine why mr martin s horse , phire power , broke down the commission said drug tests found no prohibited substances , but the scope of those tests is unclear , including whether the horse was tested for bute the state also said the horse s body did not undergo any postmortem exam before it was destroyed within minutes , ms martin was escorted onto the track to be with her fallen husband over the next six months , she would rarely leave his side in two days , mr martin had been scheduled to sign autographs at ruidoso to raise money for injured jockeys instead , other jockeys signed autographs to raise money for him since the accident , mr martin has been in and out of hospitals in three cities he has suffered through infections , pneumonia , nausea , weight loss , bed sores and other problems he remains paralyzed , unable to move his arms or legs he breathes with a respirator meanwhile , the racing community has rallied to his side , sending not only words of support but also money to help defray his mounting health care costs ruidoso s owner , r d hubbard , promised 100 , 000 there have been silent auctions and other fundraisers his wife worries that it may not be enough through it all , mr martin refuses to feel sorry for himself in december , as he struggled to breathe in a houston hospital , he told a reporter softly that he had no regrets it s a bad deal , he said but if i could do it again , i would be right out there doing it i ride horses it s the risk every jockey takes back home in el paso , ms martin says her husband derives one of his few pleasures from sitting in his wheelchair next to a window watching horses train silently in the distance mr martin s injury deeply affected mr zamora he was not only losing a friend from the jock s room , the sport was losing a rider , a gentleman , who had come to represent the best it had to offer he rode the best horses in the world , but he was worthy of the best horses in the world , mr zamora said he had great hands he let a runner be a runner instead of going to the whip too early them animals loved him , and they ran for him and he understood them when one didn t want to run , he let em not run he didn t take to the whip you have to understand them that s what makes a great horseman and he was he was special last fall , several weeks after mr martin s spill , mr zamora left the jock s room for the last time i knew i had come so close , and i couldn t deal with that pain , up close it was the third race at ruidoso on july 11 , 2009 in the stands , laura and armando alvarado sat with their two grandchildren , ages 11 and 14 the alvarados were not racing fans , but this was a vacation they had driven up to the mountain resort from el paso and they thought their grandchildren might enjoy watching their first horse race mr alvarado took the children down to the rail for a closer look ten horses sprinted out of the gate , including a gray texasbred quarter horse named sinful heart , the same horse that fell several months earlier , nearly killing chris zamora the children were not visibly shaken , but ms alvarado said she was sorry they had to witness death at such a close range after a few more races , they went shopping five days later , a relative with a passion for racing was visiting the alvarados , and they all went to the track it was going to be an allday experience , and i thought how nice to have this man give them all this history and details , ms alvarado said once again , mr alvarado took the children to the rail to watch the finish of the day s first race this time , a horse broke its leg , pitching its rider who happened to be chris zamora into the ground , where rider and animal rolled like tumbleweeds across the finish line it was awful , mr alvarado said although mr zamora was not seriously injured , the horse was the bone was showing through the skin , mr alvarado said both children began to cry i have never seen anything that horrible close up , mr alvarado said the kids were terrified the horse was euthanized on the track the family quickly left the premises ms alvarado said i told armando , just drive we wanted to get out of there afterward , her granddaughter said , i don t want to go to a racetrack ever again ms alvarado wrote a letter to the editor of the local paper for the sake of the animals and children , we felt compelled to let city officials , agencies and others know of this painful experience and urge you to investigate , she wrote she said she sent copies of the letter to the mayor , the track , its chief veterinarian , the humane society and the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals ms alvarado expected a response she never got one , she said

my girlfriend pressed her balled up sweatshirt against her mouth and squeezed her eyes shut , tears striping her temples she lay on her back on the floor of our living room , feet tucked under the coffee table , head on a sheetcovered pillow , left arm outstretched i knelt over her , the heat of my breath filling the yellow surgical mask , hands slick under sterile gloves i delicately peeled up the corner of her bandage , the skin beneath it smooth and pale as onionskin with every tug , i saw her chest heave gritting my teeth , i pried the plastic dressing from the tiny tube that led into her upper arm it was midjune , and the dressing had melted onto it she kept her arm still , but i heard her moan through the sweatshirt heart thudding , and tears pricking my own eyes , i kept going , despite the refrain in my mind i can t do this , i can t do this , i can t do this it is a terrible thing , to hurt the person you love most as a former professional dominatrix , i have willfully hurt a lot of people \( albeit in my more callous early 20s \) sometimes , while torturing my clients , a little voice whispered , do you like this \? what does that mean \? i needn t have worried about my nascent sadistic streak i can now say with complete assurance that i have no desire to hurt anyone who does not enjoy it now i m a writer i still trade in fantasies but i could never have imagined this accompanying someone i love through the labyrinthine annals of treatment for a disease that the medical establishment doesn t yet understand i never imagined asking for so much help and i certainly never imagined having to pull a melted bandage off a tube that entered in a small hole in my lover s arm and led straight to her heart but there i was and i could do it , because i had to one night in february 2011 , my girlfriend called me from beth israel hospital in manhattan after months of increasingly debilitating symptoms , sini s doctor had sent her to the emergency room because of an irregular heartbeat , in addition to air hunger , extreme pain in her joints , a migraine headache and severe exhaustion for years , her doctor had been treating these symptoms individually she had an inhaler , arthritis medication , headache medication and allergy pills all with imperceptible effects and since she had quit her day job to work full time on a documentary she was directing , she d been paying out of pocket i had insurance through my job as an adjunct professor at sarah lawrence college and purchase college , and we had recently become eligible for domestic partner benefits we were just waiting for her coverage to kick in before seeking further help for her mystery illness but sini couldn t breathe , so we couldn t wait i lugged my wheeling briefcase off metro north and arrived at the er around 10 pm , four hours after sini had arrived she was lying on a cot in a room buzzing with doctors and sick people she looked terrible her freckled cheeks washed yellow , blue eyes glassy and frightened i could see that she was still having trouble breathing have they given you anything \? what are they saying \? i asked tylenol , she said this is a long story , and the longest parts are painfully kafkaesque suffice to say that watching your suffering beloved be ignored , in the place meant to attend such suffering , is nearly as difficult as causing her pain yourself we waited for over 21 hours to be admitted for observation the doctors ran a few tests , kept her for two nights and told her there was nothing they could see wrong , no illness that would manifest so many disparate symptoms we left with a 24 , 000 bill , charged even for the television she didn t watch over the next few weeks , her symptoms persisted , with new ones woven in pain , rashes , swelling and headaches came and went her vision blurred , and she was fitted for glasses , but by the time they arrived , the prescription no longer matched she became confused on the subway , knowing where she was , but not where she was going at first , she doggedly continued working on the documentary but increasingly , she spent the bulk of her days in bed she went to a healer who shook her feet and told her to forgive her father , and a neurologist who didn t even examine her before suggesting that her problem was psychological the only medical professional who didn t dismiss her symptoms was the physician assistant at our shared gp s office when the insurance kicked in , two days after sini was released from the er , we went to see her she listened carefully , examined thoroughly and concluded that she didn t know what was wrong i didn t know how rare this was at the time but have since come to appreciate no doctoral skill more than the ability to admit ignorance she had one idea though sini had tested negative for lyme disease earlier that month but lyme , known as the great imitator , is one of the few diseases that can manifest so many fluctuating symptoms and the test was apparently notoriously unreliable so the physician assistant decided to prescribe sini a short run of the antibiotic used to treat lyme i grew up on cape cod , mass , and nearly every member of my family has had lyme like most people , i knew lyme as a disease easily treated with a short course of antibiotics and acute lyme usually is but if it isn t caught early , we learned , the disease becomes a nightmare an insidious bacterial infection that can hide from antibiotic treatment in the large joints , heart and brain , only to reemerge and reproduce for years there has been much controversy over testing , treatment and diagnostic guidelines the medical community basically falls into two camps those who insist that latestage lyme doesn t exist , at least not in treatable form and those \( including millions of patients and their families , as well as the doctors who have successfully treated them \) who insist that it does while sini researched lyme online , recognizing symptom after symptom , i stacked the unopened notices from beth israel , from the labs , from the insurance company my insurance was now covering some of her appointments , but almost none of the blood work her medical debt was steadily rising , and there seemed nothing i could do about it but stop opening the envelopes thankfully , the antibiotics helped almost immediately sini s breathing improved , her brain fog cleared significantly , and she had energy for the first time in months but our doctor couldn t prescribe more of the drug without an official diagnosis so we made an appointment with an infectious disease specialist because insurance companies refuse to cover so much of what he treats , he doesn t take any insurance at all , so it was 900 , out of pocket ultimately , he made a diagnosis of latestage lyme disease and coinfections , and we agreed to his treatment a pulsing of different medications over the next few months , including high doses of antibiotics , herbal tinctures and a foul yellow syrup typically used to treat malaria over the course of those months , i grew used to waking in the middle of the night to sini writhing and twitching with involuntary movements and moaning with pain in reaction to the medicines fighting the lyme bacteria \( known as a jarisch herxheimer reaction \) she was covered with plumsize bruises , as if she were being beaten from the inside and sometimes , on the subway platform , or just sitting on our couch , she would ask me if the floor was moving , or vibrating , or if i heard a highpitched ringing it wasn t , and i didn t increasingly , we spent more and more time alone in our apartment , canceling plans with friends and colleagues , to whom it felt impossible to explain what was going on in the spring of 2011 , i quit my adjunct jobs and took a fulltime assistant professor gig in central new york partly for the better health benefits and we moved away from the city the highdeductible health plan sounded ominous , but a patient hr staffer assured me that the college would cover much of the 3 , 600 we d need to spend before blue cross blue shield paid for anything she walked me through the complex system of deductibles , claims , approval and health savings accounts , and i left the office with a stack of papers so thick that she gave me a courier bag emblazoned with the college s logo to carry it but meeting our deductible turned out to be harder than expected we spent the 3 , 600 in the first few months , but it took many more months to get the bills processed each one had to be sent with a claim form to the insurer so that it could decide what amount was eligible i would send in the same form two or three times and still there would be some minuscule error requiring resubmission and when it did miraculously travel this administrative digestive tract , a bill for , say , 360 would usually be approved for only around 120 toward our deductible sini had improved with the antibiotics , but the handfuls of pills weren t strong enough to beat the infections , and her traumatized stomach couldn t keep them down anymore , regardless she needed a picc a peripherally inserted central catheter this is a tube inserted into a puncture wound in the patient s upper arm and threaded through the veins until its tip rests just above the heart it s a relatively common procedure for injecting high doses of antibiotics , though it comes with frightening risks of infection the new specialist \( whose appointments ran over 1 , 700 and who also didn t accept insurance \) suggested that she would likely need a minimum of six to nine months of iv treatment he also warned us not to hope for more than 28 days of insurance coverage after that , we would have to hire a visiting nurse out of pocket or do the dressing changes and administer the treatments ourselves in april of this year , we finally reached our deductible and the insurance coverage kicked in within days , at both doctors strong suggestion and the warning that her condition would only worsen without more aggressive treatment , we set up the picc insertion we sat in the hospital after the procedure , surrounded by patients with iv poles slowly dripping bags of fluid and the same air of friendly resignation there is a strain of patience cultivated in places like this , i ve found when panic , rage , defiance and denial are exhausted , and sickness remains , you are deposited into a room like this longterm emergencies require an emotional stamina of which the healthy have no need as i watched the afternoon sunlight fall across the room and the first bag slowly empty into sini s body , i felt a strange mixture of despair and relief we had crossed some line that day , after which it would be impossible to pretend that what was happening might suddenly lift , like the fog of a bad dream for three weeks , i injected sini with preloaded syringes of antibiotics and the attendant saline and blood thinner the picc site requires a stringent , multistep cleaning and redressing process , and i took careful notes from the visiting nurse when she came to change the dressing then the 28 days were up , and i took over in an enormous stroke of luck , one of sini s closest friends is a picc nurse and mailed us free supplies , including alcohol swabs , sterile gloves , and iv tubing saving us thousands of dollars the first time i changed the dressings , she was there via skype , her anxious face filling the laptop sini and i sat on the floor steadying my trembling hands , i scrubbed the open puncture wound with swabs doused in searing chemicals i could not fan , or blow , or even hold her hand without contaminating the sterile field i m sorry , i m sorry , i m sorry , i chanted as she gritted her teeth and turned away , tears seeping from her closed lids stop apologizing , she whispered , but i couldn t i charged the second month of her medication on my credit card then , i drafted a letter to everyone we d ever known asking for help has never been a strength of mine sini is similarly disposed but we were out of alternatives we set up a page on the crowdfunding web site indiegogo one of sini s best friends , a photographer , designed it i wrote the copy another friend , a filmmaker , edited a video and others agreed to spread the word we modestly estimated the picc treatment costs for the coming months \( not including living expenses or the considerable debt already accrued \) at 12 , 000 none of us expected to raise the full amount over the 60day period , but any little bit would help one morning this may , about an hour after the campaign went live , i checked my phone while out running errands to see if anything had been donated there was already 1 , 500 in pledges i refreshed the browser to confirm that i was seeing correctly , and the number jumped another 300 i shakily drove home and opened the computer we had raised more than 3 , 000 by the end of the first day , we had raised 8 , 000 by the end of the second , we had surpassed our goal knowing that sini would be able to continue her treatment was a magnificent relief but what so blindsided me and filled my heart were the comments , emails , texts , tweets and facebook postings poured toward us in hundreds most of the donations were between 20 and 100 , and the vast majority of these were from family , friends , new yorkers and others who had performed or worked with sini , or been helped by her work and from other people suffering from latestage lyme \( and other diseases that insurance fails to cover \) thanking us for going public with our struggle , for raising awareness and helping them to feel less alone sini and i had both felt completely detached from our community for the past two years unmoored , and consumed by our situation , we had felt guilty requesting the help of these people from whom we had alienated ourselves but it was as if they had just been waiting for us to ask two months have passed , with two days left in the campaign , and we have raised over 19 , 000 , a number beyond my wildest expectations because here is the thing we didn t expect anything it is not our community s responsibility to pay our exorbitant medical bills , to prevent our lives from being annihilated by the cost of illness it is our government s responsibility perhaps , for others like us , the affordable care act will make a difference my hope is that by the time the legislative changes trickle down to our lives , sini s health will have improved enough that she will no longer be in danger of being bankrupted by medical expenses for now , she seems better we moved back to new york city i m returning to adjuncting because the fulltime insurance turned out not to be worth it , and here we can be close to friends and sini s work there have been more trips to the er , and several complications , but there was a day last week when sini looked at me , wideeyed , and said i feel ok right now i m not in pain or exhausted i can breathe it was the first time in almost two years that she could say that

bettiah , india khushi knew it was cancer ankita thought she was injured none of the girls knew why they were suddenly bleeding , why their stomachs were paining , as indian english has it they cried and were terrified and then they asked their mothers and their mothers said , you are normal you are menstruating you are a woman now but that is not all the girls , whose names i 've changed here for the sake of their privacy , were also told when you menstruate , do n't cook food because you will pollute it do n't touch idols because you will defile them do n't handle pickles because they will go rotten with your touch pickles , i asked ankita \? yes , madam , she told me , in her schoolyard in rural uttar pradesh my mother says it is so her mother believed it , and her mother before her it must be true i read of another girl who said that her nail polish had spoiled because she had applied it during her period she saw nothing weird about this i met ankita and her peers in november , while accompanying a sanitation and hygiene carnival , the , which has traveled a thousand miles across rural india the aim of the yatra , organized by a nonprofit called wash united , is to spread the right messages about health and hygiene do not defecate in the open , wash your hands with soap after the toilet and before eating using singing , dancing , games and support from cricket players and bollywood stars the tactic works all of its stalls have queues of men and boys waiting to play all except one a curtained tent , where only women are allowed this is the menstrual hygiene management lab , where girls and women can come to learn how to safely make and maintain cloth sanitary napkins \( use clean cloth dry it in the sun iron it to remove moisture \) as well as for something even more revolutionary to talk frankly about periods the taboo of menstruation in india causes real harm women in some tribes are forced to throughout their periods there are health issues , like infections caused by using dirty rags , and horror stories , like that of one girl who was too embarrassed to ask her mother for a clean cloth , and used one she found without knowing it had lizard eggs in it according to one of the yatra outreach workers , the subsequent infection meant her uterus had to be removed when she was 13 she would be forever tainted as a barren woman , so that whoever saw her first in the morning had to take a bath to wash her stain away but beyond superstition and discrimination , many indian women face the straightforward lack of clean , safe lavatory facilities back in my high school in england , we may have been embarrassed by our periods , as most girls are , but we had clean bathroom stalls in which to change our sanitary pads in privacy , and trash bins in which to throw them many students in india , where around 650 million people still lack toilets , ca n't say the same most schools i visited had filthy latrines , used only because there was no alternative some had none at all students and teachers made do with fields and back alleys concentrating on lessons when you are desperate for the bathroom is hard on anyone it s nearly impossible for a girl who is menstruating and has nowhere to change or dispose of her pad girls grow tired of dealing with it often their families encourage them to stay home from school and get married in one survey , 23 percent of indian schoolage girls dropped out of school when they reached puberty girls suffer if they are n't empowered to manage their menstrual cycle without pain and shame each month , said chris williams , the executive director of the water supply and sanitation collaborative council , which runs the menstrual hygiene management lab their health , schooling and dignity are in the balance and the world suffers , too educated women are healthier , have smaller families , often earn more and have a positive impact on development it can take years , even generations , to change a taboo but anecdotally , outreach workers note that the only girls who do n't believe the superstitions about menstruation are those with educated mothers so the best way to change the minds of future women is to keep girls in school today , and basic lavatory facilities are one of the easiest ways to do that back in ankita s schoolyard , something revolutionary was happening although many male teachers in rural india are terrified that broaching the subject of menstruation will be considered inappropriate or worse , one of ankita s teachers was different after attending a yatra outreach session , he used 200 rupees \( less than 4 \) of his own money to turn a disused latrine into a simple incinerator , which girls could use to burn their dirty cloths it is n't perfect girls still face the embarrassment of going to the incinerator with everyone knowing why but this rudimentary construction , with its vent made from a discarded wellwater pump , could have huge consequences not only could it bring educational salvation to ankita and her classmates , but a better future for generations to come
evanston , ill the latest film by steven spielberg , lincoln , which opens nationwide on friday , has the makings of an oscar shooin , particularly for daniel daylewis s performance in the title role the first scene is arresting two black soldiers speak with the president about their experiences in combat one , a corporal , raises the problem of unequal promotions and pay in the union army two white soldiers join them , and the scene concludes as the corporal walks away , movingly reciting the final lines of the gettysburg address unfortunately it is all downhill from there , at least as far as black characters are concerned as a historian who watched the film on saturday night in chicago , i was not surprised to find that mr spielberg took liberties with the historical record as in schindler s list and saving private ryan , his purpose is more to entertain and inspire than to educate but it s disappointing that in a movie devoted to explaining the abolition of slavery in the united states , africanamerican characters do almost nothing but passively wait for white men to liberate them for some 30 years , historians have been demonstrating that slaves were crucial agents in their emancipation however imperfectly , ken burns s 1990 documentary the civil war brought aspects of that interpretation to the american public yet mr spielberg s lincoln gives us only faithful servants , patiently waiting for the day of jubilee this is not mere nitpicking mr spielberg s lincoln helps perpetuate the notion that african americans have offered little of substance to their own liberation while the film largely avoids the noxious stereotypes of subservient africanamericans for which movies like gone with the wind have become notorious , it reinforces , even if inadvertently , the outdated assumption that white men are the primary movers of history and the main sources of social progress the nation s capital was transformed by the migration of fugitive slaves from the south during the war , but you 'd never know it from this film by 1865 mr spielberg s film takes place from january to april these fugitives had transformed washington s streets , markets and neighborhoods had the filmmakers cared to portray africanamericans as meaningful actors in the drama of emancipation , they might have shown lincoln interacting with black passersby in the district of columbia black oral tradition held that lincoln visited at least one of the capital s governmentrun contraband camps , where many of the fugitives lived , and was moved by the singing and prayer he witnessed there one of the president s assistants , william o stoddard , remembered lincoln stopping to shake hands with a black woman he encountered on the street near the white house in fact , the capital was also home to an organized and highly politicized community of free africanamericans , in which the white house servants elizabeth keckley and william slade were leaders keckley , who published a memoir in 1868 , organized other black women to raise money and donations of clothing and food for the fugitives who 'd sought refuge in washington slade was a leader in the social , civil and statistical association , a black organization that tried to advance arguments for freedom and civil rights by collecting data on black economic and social successes the film conveys none of this , opting instead for generic , archetypal characters keckley \( played by gloria reuben \) is frequently seen sitting with the first lady , mary todd lincoln \( played by sally field \) , in the balcony of the house of representatives , silently serving as a moral beacon for any legislator who looks her way arguably her most significant scene is an awkward dialogue with lincoln in which he says bluntly , i do n't know you , meaning not just her but all black people keckley replies , as a representative of her race , that she has no idea what her people will do once freed as if one archetype were not enough , she adds that her son has died for the union cause , making her grief the grief of all bereaved mothers meanwhile , slade \( stephen henderson \) is portrayed as an avuncular butler , a black servant out of central casting , who watches in prescient sorrow as his beloved boss departs for the theater on a fateful april evening it would not have been much of a stretch particularly given other liberties taken by the filmmakers to do things differently keckley and slade might have been shown leaving the white house to attend their own meetings , for example keckley could have discussed with mrs lincoln the relief work that , in reality , she organized and the first lady contributed to slade could have talked with lincoln about the 13th amendment indeed , his daughter later recalled that lincoln had confided in slade , particularly on the nights when he suffered from insomnia even more unsettling is the brief cameo of lydia smith \( played by s epatha merkerson \) , housekeeper and supposed lover of the pennsylvania congressman and radical republican , played by tommy lee jones stevens s relationship with his mulatto housekeeper is the subject of notoriously racist scenes in d w griffith s 1915 film birth of a nation though mr spielberg s film looks upon the pair with far more sympathy , the sudden revelation of their relationship stevens literally hands the official copy of the 13th amendment to smith , before the two head into bed together reveals , once again , the film s determination to see emancipation as a gift from white people to black people , not as a social transformation in which africanamericans themselves played a role the screenplay , written by tony kushner , is attentive to the language of the period and features verbal jousting among white men who take pleasure in jabs and insults by contrast , the black characters earnest and dignified are given few interesting or humorous lines , even though verbal sparring and oneupmanship is a recognized aspect of black vernacular culture that has long shaped the american mainstream meanwhile , perhaps the greatest rhetorician of the 19th century , frederick douglass , who in fact attended the white house reception after lincoln s second inauguration in march 1865 , is nowhere to be seen or heard it is a wellknown pastime of historians to quibble with hollywood over details here , however , the issue is not factual accuracy but interpretive choice a stronger africanamerican presence , even at the margins of mr spielberg s lincoln , would have suggested that another dynamic of emancipation was occurring just outside the frame a world of black political debate , of civic engagement and of monumental effort for the liberation of body and spirit that , too , is the history of abolition lincoln is an opportunity squandered

for generations of americans , it was a given that children would live longer than their parents but there is now mounting evidence that this enduring trend has reversed itself for the country s leasteducated whites , an increasingly troubled group whose life expectancy has fallen by four years since 1990 researchers have long documented that the most educated americans were making the biggest gains in life expectancy , but now they say mortality data show that life spans for some of the least educated americans are actually contracting four studies in recent years identified modest declines , but a new one that looks separately at americans lacking a high school diploma found disturbingly sharp drops in life expectancy for whites in this group experts not involved in the new research said its findings were persuasive the reasons for the decline remain unclear , but researchers offered possible explanations , including a spike in prescription drug overdoses among young whites , higher rates of smoking among less educated white women , rising obesity , and a steady increase in the number of the least educated americans who lack health insurance the steepest declines were for white women without a high school diploma , who lost five years of life between 1990 and 2008 , said s jay olshansky , a public health professor at the university of illinois at chicago and the lead investigator on the study , in health affairs by 2008 , life expectancy for black women without a high school diploma had surpassed that of white women of the same education level , the study found white men lacking a high school diploma lost three years of life life expectancy for both blacks and hispanics of the same education level rose , the data showed but blacks over all do not live as long as whites , while hispanics live longer than both whites and blacks we 're used to looking at groups and complaining that their mortality rates have n't improved fast enough , but to actually go backward is deeply troubling , said john g haaga , head of the population and social processes branch of the national institute on aging , who was not involved in the new study the fiveyear decline for white women rivals the catastrophic sevenyear drop for russian men in the years after the collapse of the soviet union , said michael marmot , director of the institute of health equity in london the decline among the least educated nonhispanic whites , who make up a shrinking share of the population , widened an already troubling gap the latest estimate shows life expectancy for white women without a high school diploma was 735 years , compared with 839 years for white women with a college degree or more for white men , the gap was even bigger 675 years for the least educated white men compared with 804 for those with a college degree or better the dropping life expectancies have helped weigh down the united states in international life expectancy rankings , particularly for women in 2010 , american women fell to 41st place , down from 14th place in 1985 , in the united nations rankings among developed countries , american women sank from the middle of the pack in 1970 to last place in 2010 , according to the  the slump is so vexing that it became the subject of an inquiry by the national academy of sciences , which published a report on it last year there s this enormous issue of why , said david cutler , an economics professor at harvard who was an author of a 2008 paper that found modest declines in life expectancy for less educated white women from 1981 to 2000 it s very puzzling and we do n't have a great explanation and it is yet another sign of distress in one of the country s most vulnerable groups during a period when major social changes are transforming life for less educated whites childbirth outside marriage has soared , increasing pressures on women who are more likely to be single parents those who do marry tend to choose mates with similar education levels , concentrating the disadvantage inklings of this decline have been accumulating since 2008 professor cutler s paper , published in health affairs , found a decline in life expectancy of about a year for less educated white women from 1990 to 2000 three other studies , by ahmedin jemal , a researcher at the american cancer society jennifer karas montez , a robert wood johnson foundation health and society scholar at harvard and richard miech , a professor at the university of colorado denver , found increases in mortality rates \( the ratio of deaths to a population \) for the least educated americans professor olshansky s study , financed by the research network on an aging society , found by far the biggest decline in life expectancy for the least educated nonhispanic whites , in large part because he isolated those without a high school diploma , a group usually combined with high school graduates nonhispanic whites currently make up 63 percent of the population of the united states researchers said they were baffled by the magnitude of the drop some cautioned that the results could be overstated because americans without a high school diploma about 12 percent of the population , down from about 22 percent in 1990 , according to the census bureau were a shrinking group that was now more likely to be disadvantaged in ways besides education , compared with past generations professor olshansky agreed that the group was now smaller , but said the magnitude of the drop in life expectancy was still a measure of deterioration the good news is that there are fewer people in this group , he said the bad news is that those who are in it are dying more quickly researchers , including some involved in the earlier studies that found more modest declines in life expectancy , said that professor olshansky s methodology was sound and that the findings reinforced evidence of a troubling pattern that has emerged for those at the bottom of the education ladder , particularly white women something is going on in the lives of disadvantaged white women that is leading to some really alarming trends in life expectancy , said ms montez of harvard researchers offered theories for the drop in life expectancy , but cautioned that none could fully explain it james jackson , director of the institute of social research at the university of michigan and an author of the new study , said white women with low levels of education may exhibit more risky behavior than that of previous generations overdoses from prescription drugs have spiked since 1990 , disproportionately affecting whites , particularly women professor miech , of the university of colorado , noted the rise in a 2011 paper in the american sociological review , arguing that it was among the biggest changes for whites in recent decades and that it appeared to have offset gains for less educated people in the rate of heart attacks ms montez , who studies women s health , said that smoking was a big part of declines in life expectancy for less educated women smoking rates have increased among women without a high school diploma , both white and black , she said but for men of the same education level , they have declined this group also has less access to health care than before the share of workingage adults with less than a high school diploma who did not have health insurance rose to 43 percent in 2006 , up from 35 percent in 1993 , according to mr jemal at the american cancer society just 10 percent of those with a college degree were uninsured last year , the census bureau reported the shift should be seen against the backdrop of sweeping changes in the american economy and in women s lives , said lisa berkman , director of the harvard center for

jim palmer was preparing for a broadcast at camden yards last wednesday when the scoreboard showed history unfolding in seattle felix hernandez , the mariners' ace , had reached the ninth inning of a perfect game , and palmer , the baltimore orioles' hall of fame righthander , had to watchpalmer had been there before on june 16 , 1973 , he retired the first 25 texas rangers hitters at memorial stadium two outs from perfection , palmer fell behind the texas catcher , ken suarez , 20 , and challenged him with a fastball suarez chopped a single through the middle , the price palmer paid for refusing to risk a walk i had already pitched a nohitter , palmer said , referring to a game in 1969 so i was going for the perfect game palmer watched with particular interest as hernandez fell behind his final hitter , sean rodriguez , also 20 instead of a fastball , hernandez toyed with rodriguez by breaking off a slider for a strike it was a clear signal that hernandez had extreme confidence in his stuff , and rodriguez soon struck out , sending safeco field into delirium it was the first perfect game in mariners history , but the third in the majors this season , after philip humber of the chicago white sox \( who also threw his in seattle \) and matt cain of the san francisco giants this is the first season ever with three perfect games , and hernandez s gem was the sixth since july 2009 historically , the outbreak of perfect games defies explanation in the entire decade of the 1970s , only three pitchers carried perfect games into the ninth inning palmer and pittsburgh s ken brett gave up hits the chicago cubs' milt pappas issued a twoout walk before retiring his final batter there were no perfect games in the 1890s , 1910s , 1930s or 1940s , either but the most recent extended stretch came from may 8 , 1968 \( catfish hunter \) , to may 15 , 1981 \( len barker \) , a period that covered the prime years of some of the game s most durable and celebrated arms nine pitchers threw 2 , 400 innings in the 1970s gaylord perry , phil niekro , steve carlton , palmer , ferguson jenkins , tom seaver , bert blyleven , don sutton and nolan ryan all are in the hall of fame none pitched a perfect game so why are there so many now 3f yankees manager joe girardi , who caught the fourth and final perfect game of the 1990s , by david cone , was stumped there s a lot of guys with high velocity and guys with outstanding breaking balls , girardi said still , in saying that , it s kind of shocking i would say it s random , because no matter what , as good as your stuff is that day , there s still luck involved , that a guy does n't get a swinging bunt with two strikes , or he does n't get a bloop over the infielder s head i mean , there s still luck so i just think it s a coincidence palmer offered a few theories , including advanced scouting reports that predict where each batter will hit the ball , thus putting fielders in better position he also said that talented pitchers could exploit today s wider strike zone , and that hitters were more accepting of strikeouts now than they used to be cain had 14 strikeouts in his masterpiece , tying sandy koufax s 1965 record for the most in a perfect game , and hernandez had 12 yet humber had only nine strikeouts , and mark buehrle \( 2009 \) and dallas braden \( 2010 \) each had just six and while the perfect game cluster is unusual , baseball has experienced other , sudden surges in nohitters , even before the current era of steroid testing the 1990 and 1991 seasons each included seven nohitters , similar to 2010 , which had six , and this season , which also has six whatever the frequency , palmer said , a perfect game s a perfect game in other words , always special and the circumstances often defy logic against the yankees in 1967 , palmer came close to perfection by facing the minimum 27 batters and allowing only a single to horace clarke , who was erased on a double play but palmer had nothing i got a cortisone shot so i could get out there , he said i was throwing about 80 miles an hour , and they were expecting 97 they were swinging before the ball even got there my next start , i gave up three runs in one inning in boston i was on my way to tearing my rotator cuff palmer recovered , of course , and dominated the next decade , with three cy young awards and eight 20win seasons but he was never perfect , and neither was anyone else this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo the mariners' felix hernandez on wednesday after completing the third perfect game of 2012 \( photograph by ted s warren associated press \) chart no playing experience necessary six of the current 30 major league managers never played in the major leagues \( source baseballreferencecom \)

cormac mccarthy has won some of the most coveted honors in literature , from the pulitzer prize to a spot on oprah s book club but now it may be time for mr mccarthy to add another laurel to his resum genius copy editor the paperback of lawrence m krauss s quantum man , a biography of the physicist richard feynman , will arrive in bookstores in march bearing not just quotes from favorable reviews but a line on the back cover noting that the book reflects changes suggested by none other than the author of all the pretty horses and the road i was thrilled that cormac volunteered to do this , mr krauss told the chronicle of higher education he said he had never done this before , but he loved the book so much that he wanted to make it better the novelist s corrections appear to be more literary than scientific in addition to suggested some rephrasing , mr krauss , said , mr mccarthy made me promise he could excise all exclamation points and semicolons , both of which he said have no place in literature \( a quick digital search through mr mccarthy s border trilogy and several other novels finds no examples of the offending punctuation \) mr krauss may be the first to brag about it on the back cover of his paperback , but he s not in fact the first topflight physicist to get a thorough redpenciling from the publicityshy novelist in 2005 , mr mccarthy , through a friend , offered to read the manuscript of the harvard physicist lisa randall s first book , warped passages unraveling the mysteries of the universe s hidden dimensions he gave it a good copyedit , ms randall told the radcliffe quarterly in 2007 he really smoothed the prose he also fiddled with the punctuation cormac isolated all the semicolons in the margin i then removed them , ms randall said in an email apparently exclamation points are only for exclamations ! those were removed too ms randall s copyeditors were a bit less conscientious , rendering his first name cormack in the acknowledgments but that didn t stop mr mccarthy from offering to help out again on ms randall s second book , knocking on heaven s door he removed the semicolons the editor added , ms randall said on a more serious note , we had some nice conversations about the material in fact , i saw a quote where he used a physics example i had given in response to a question about truth and beauty mr mccarthy has long maintained an office at the santa fe institute , an independent research center founded in 1984 by the particle physicist murray gellmann and others , where the clacking of his manual typewriter is sometimes audible in the hallways and his scientific knowledge commands respect cormac is scary , the physicist luis bettencourt recently told the daily beast he just asks really good questions if mr mccarthy reads his scientific colleagues books carefully , some of them also return the favor to coincide with his oprah s book club appearance in 2007 , several biologists and ecologists wrote essays on scientific themes in the road , including man vs nature coevolution of social and ecological networks and the end of the world extinction and reemergence of life

baltimore the four cranes rise grandly over the port here , 14 stories high just off the boat from china and now being prepared for operations , the 40 million machines are part of this city s gamble that when supersize container ships start coming through the expanded panama canal in 2015 , baltimore will be one of the few ports on the east coast ready for their business we think it s going to be a major win for us , said james j white , the executive director of the maryland port administration this sense that the new set of locks now being built to allow giant ships through the canal will bring riches 1 , 000 miles or more to the north is shared by industry and government officials along the east coast and the gulf of mexico , who have been promoting multimillion and in some cases multibillion dollar port projects for years the obama administration has now moved to speed up the review process for developing and deepening the harbors for several of these ports , including those of new york and new jersey charleston , sc savannah , ga jacksonville , fla and miami the initiative will help drive job growth and strengthen the economy , president obama said in announcing it last month but some who are following the efforts have begun to express skepticism about the hope and money going into dredging mud and raising steel with so many ports competing for a share of the bounty , experts are questioning how big that bounty will be everybody is trying to go after it there are going to be few beneficiaries , in my judgment , said william d ankner , a former official of the and a former secretary of transportation for louisiana the big ships known as postpanamax and even superpostpanamax are already in heavy use worldwide , making up 16 percent of the container fleet but accounting for 45 percent of its capacity , by the army corps of engineers and those numbers are projected to grow significantly over the next 20 years , said maj gen michael j walsh , deputy commanding general for civil and emergency operations for the corps , in announcing the report in the race that began when plans for the expansion were first announced in 2006 , some winners have already emerged the port of virginia , in norfolk , is ready to receive the big ships today and new york is also prepared , thanks to that began 13 years ago but nearly every port in the game still faces major challenges and expenses including the port authority of new york and new jersey , which plans to spend 1 billion to raise the bayonne bridge roadway by 64 feet to allow the giant ships through on their way to to newark and elizabeth , nj baltimore , which already has a 50foot channel , has a bottleneck on the land side the howard street tunnel , through which trains have to pass to reach the port , and which is too small to accommodate the doublestacked container cars that are increasingly the standard for rail shipping the rail line csx has announced a workaround that could cost hundreds of millions , involving a new yard beyond the tunnel filled with containers brought by truck the port will load the trains with a single container to get through the tunnel , and the trains can be completed at the yard miami is putting 2 billion into improvements to its port its dredging project was approved by the army corps of engineers in april , and the city is building a tunnel costing an estimated 1 billion to create a crucial link between the port and the interstate system of highways savannah is preparing to move forward with a 652 million deepening project , while the south carolina legislature has to dredging for charleston a plan for the two cities to team up on a common port has all but stalled the big ships will also come via places beyond panama many are expected to come from southeast asia through the suez canal , and from south america s eastern ports but more fundamental questions have been raised about the real benefits of the coming trade , and especially the effects of the new canal traffic moving goods by water is generally cheaper than moving them by land because of the economies of scale of moving so many containers on those big ships , said john martin , a ports consultant in lancaster , pa so that would suggest canal routes will offer lowercost shipping to the east coast and midwest through the canal but , he said , containers loaded on the west coast , which has built up its container yards and highway and rail infrastructure , can outrun those that travel to the east coast by water , and that can make the difference when speed and dependability are more important than cost alone besides , he added , costs and fees can shift panama can be expected to raise rates for canal passage , and the railroads are not going to sit idly by and let the water route undercut their business scudder smith , a consultant with the engineering consulting firm parsons brinkerhoff , said that a water passage , all things being equal , will cause cost reductions but all things are not equal , he added , and so i'm not at all confident in any numbers that could be why j christopher lytle , executive director of the port of long beach , does not sound a bit worried there s just not going to be a huge movement of cargo from the west coast to the east coast , he said his port , and its counterpart in los angeles , are already dealing with some of the biggest vessels on the water , capable of carrying the equivalent of 13 , 000 container units vessels too big to pass through the new panama canal locks after talking up port projects in ways that sound a bit like the overblown economic predictions about new stadiums and convention centers in recent years , some officials are now scaling back their claims after , gov haley barbour of mississippi trumpeted plans for a port of the future at gulfport with a 50footdeep channel , on a project he pledged would spur the economy and create bountiful jobs a state the single largest economicdevelopment project in the state s history , and officials predicted that it would surpass the port of los angeles today , mississippi and the port are being more modest the port recently noted that it is not pursuing the announced plans to dredge the channel to 50 feet , and because of lapsed maintenance , the channel does not even reach the depth of 36 feet authorized by law the port is now focused on improving what it has instead of expanding greatly , and plans focus more on the cascade effect as smaller ships are crowded out of the major ports by the new superships local critics of the original plan like reilly morse , policy director of mississippi center for justice , said the state had been swept up in a national fad that promised far more economic benefits than it could deliver and risked far greater burdens on the host community than it could support other ports try not to overstate their goals mark montgomery , the chief executive of ports america chesapeake , the private partner with the state of maryland in baltimore s project , said that his port and supporters understand that they are not likely to defeat the megaports of the west coast , or even new york and norfolk instead , he said , his port will serve baltimore , washington and northern virginia though he also sees it as a potential gateway to the midwest our expectations are rightsized , he said to robert puentes , a transportation expert at the brookings institution , the problem of whether the ports are overbuilding for a panama payoff is one of planning we are the only industrialized country on the planet that does n't have a comprehensive freight policy , he said as for port development , he said , i ca n't see the federal government picking winners and losers in such a politically charged environment , but they could provide a little more guidance where right now they are providing none
the ticking sound you hear in the background of the republican presidential primary is the fundraising clock the longer the four republican hopefuls battle one another , the less time the eventual nominee will have to build a war chest to compete with the advertising assault expected from president obama s reelection team \( see the article thursday by the times s jeff zeleny and jim rutenberg \) the financial woes apply to all of the republican candidates , but perhaps none more so than mitt romney , whose campaign is partly built on the idea that he would have the financial resources to stand up to mr obama in the fall that is still likely to be true the republican money machine will gear up this summer for mr romney if he is the nominee , helped by super pacs that are already stockpiling cash to be ready to battle mr obama when the time comes and the republican party will be at mr romney s disposal as soon as he is the clear nominee but the period from late spring until the national convention at the end of the summer could be a difficult period as mr romney or whoever the nominee is has to begin building a national campaign organization that process takes time , and money in the spring of 2008 , senator john mccain s campaign struggled to keep up with mr obama s fundraising juggernaut mr mccain turned to the republican national committee for logistical and financial help mr romney will likely do the same if he becomes the nominee and the super pacs which weren t around four years ago will try to ride to his rescue by buying plenty of ads to counter mr obama but like it did for mr mccain , that means a loss of control super pacs are not allowed to coordinate their messages with a candidate or a campaign so relying on them is risky for mr romney , who would also need to spend time crafting a summertime message that appeals to independents and swing voters mr romney is clearly aware of the challenge his campaign has set aside plenty of time in the weeks ahead for fundraising in an attempt to pad his campaign coffers mr romney is seeking bigtime donations for a washington fundraiser this month , according to a copy of the invitation obtained by the caucus mr romney s campaign is asking wealthy supporters to collect 10 , 000 for a table of 10 people for a breakfast reception at the hyatt regency hosted by mr romney s backers in congress in the meantime , the primary battle between mr romney and his rivals continues , draining cash for all of them and the clock keeps ticking
all sorts of merchants , but particularly booksellers , were infuriated by amazon s effort before the holidays to use realworld shops as showrooms for people to check out items before ordering them more cheaply online the retailer s refusal to collect sales tax in many states is a persistent grievance independent booksellers have even been forced into the novel position of hoping that their onetime foe , barnes noble , survives so that it can serve as a bulwark against amazon publishers , if anything , are more fearful than booksellers from amazon s point of view , it does not want to destroy the book business but simply to reinvent it \( amazon declined to comment \) nancy pearl has been caught in the crossfire here ms pearl is the seattle librarian who popularized the notion of having everyone in a city read the same book at the same time she was library journal s librarian of the year in 2011 an action figure was created in her likeness there are some books that ms pearl wants people to read that are not in print her agent , victoria sanders , shopped a rediscovery line to 20 publishers none were interested last month amazon made a deal with her and that s when the furor started the pacific northwest booksellers association , which just gave ms pearl its lifetime achievement award , described the reaction among its members as consternation in seattle , it was frontpage news betrayal was an oftenused word was amazon sincerely trying to rescue lost classics or was it cynically buying a local hero s endorsement to cover up its aggressive tactics \? a month later , the debate is unresolved ms pearl still seems a little shaken by the intensity of the response i knew the minute i signed the contract that there would be people who would not be happy , but the vehemence surprised me , she said to protect herself , she did not read facebook or twitter or any of the social media sites ms pearl , at one point an independent bookseller herself , is trying to bridge a gap that might be unbridgeable i understand and sympathize with the concerns about amazon s role in the world of books , she said if i had to do this deal all over again , she said , pausing before adding , well , it s a hard question but i would still want these books back in print david streitfeld commentnot all books purchased on amazon are from their warehouses small booksellers like myself have been selling books quite steadily to satisfied customers online for years donna t , malta , ny photo nancy pearl at third place books in seattle in 2005 \( photograph by kevin p casey bloomberg news \)
there is no such thing as a typical nohitter , but this year it seems pitchers are going to extreme lengths for individuality johan santana broke the mets' 8 , 019game streak of not having a nohitter six seattle mariners pitchers combined to throw one and philip humber of the chicago white sox tossed a perfect game just a few years removed from being considered a major league bust measured against that group , jered weaver s nohitter in may seems almost boring but on wednesday night , matt cain of the san francisco giants trumped them all , throwing not just a perfect game but also perhaps the secondgreatest perfect game in baseball history cain s 100 masterpiece against the houston astros was the first perfect game and 14th nohitter in the giants' 130season history , which includes the efforts of the hall of fame pitchers christy mathewson , carl hubbell and juan marichal cain s performance was nothing short of stunning his 14 strikeouts tied the perfectgame record set by sandy koufax of the los angeles dodgers against the chicago cubs on sept 9 , 1965 , and he allowed just seven balls out of the infield contrast cain s performance to that of humber , who threw his perfect game on april 21 against the seattle mariners humber struck out nine and had 13 flyouts it is splitting hairs , but cain s combination of 20 outs through strikeouts or ground balls was superior in the sense that he controlled more of the game s outcome the statistics guru bill james developed a statistic called game score to evaluate pitching performances it awards points for outs , innings and strikeouts and takes points away for hits , walks , runs and earned runs by that measure , cain s performance tied koufax for the most dominant of the 20 modernera perfect games with a score of 101 making game score controversial in the evaluation of nohitters and perfect games is that it is a measure of dominance , not perfection for instance , nolan ryan also scored 101 in one of the nohitters he pitched , but he also allowed two walks , balanced out by his 16 strikeouts the highest game score came in a game that was neither a nohitter nor a perfect game cain , koufax and ryan all trail kerry wood , who , as a cub , struck out 20 astros , walked none and allowed one hit on may 6 , 1998 , setting a nineinning record with a game score of 105 in wood s masterpiece , the lone hit was a groundball single by ricky gutierrez to trade one groundball single for six strikeouts gives wood the edge in dominance , even if the performance lacked the romance of a pitcher remaining perfect the only knock against cain s performance was the quality of his competition while the 1965 cubs were not a particularly good team , koufax had to contend with billy williams , ernie banks and ron santo , a much more intimidating threesome than the lighthitting 2012 astros can offer cain needed 125 pitches to complete the game , while koufax needed just 107 it is fitting that the competition for greatest perfect game would come down to a dodger and a giant the teams have had a fierce rivalry since the 19th century , and by the narrowest margins koufax does appear to have the edge on cain if cain and koufax threw the most dominant perfect games , the least imposing in terms of game score was pitched by addie joss of the cleveland naps against the white sox in 1908 in that game , joss struck out just three batters , giving him a game score of 90 individual game data is searchable on only since 1918 , but in that time frame 639 starters have had a game score higher than joss did in a nineinning game however , what joss lacked in dominance in his perfect game he made up for in economy , needing just 74 pitches to get through nine innings the oddest of the perfect games was one of the two thrown before the modern era began in 1901 lee richmond of the worcester ruby legs was perfect on june 12 , 1880 , but benefited greatly from the rules of the era richmond was throwing underhand from 50 feet away , and three times in the game an out was recorded on a foul ball that had bounced the rule on bouncing foul balls being counted as outs was not changed until 1883 finally , on the same night that cain was attaining perfection , r a dickey of the mets managed a game score of 95 by striking out 12 in a onehitter against the tampa bay rays the scoring decision on the base hit is being appealed by the mets , but it is not likely to be reversed for now , anyway , dickey has the 79thmost dominant nineinning performance of the last 94 years
last summer , the trainer doug o'neill was formally sanctioned after one of his racehorses at hollywood park in california tested positive for illegal drugs a year before , in 2010 , o'neill was punished for administering an illegal performanceenhancing concoction to a horse he ran in the prestigious illinois derby the third time he had been accused of giving a horse what is known as a milkshake four months later , he was accused again of giving a milkshake to a horse in california over 14 years and in four different states , o'neill received more than a dozen violations for giving his horses improper drugs o'neill s horses also have had a tendency to break down according to an analysis by the new york times , the horses he trains break down or show signs of injury at more than twice the rate of the national average but none of it the drug charges or the rate of damaged horses under his care has much impeded o'neill s rise in the ranks of racing , and so there he was last saturday , saddling i 'll have another , the surprising 3yearold who won the 138th  o'neill s derby victory places him and his troubled record center stage at a time when thoroughbred racing is facing perhaps its greatest ethical reckoning there is legislation before congress calling for federal regulation of the sport gov andrew m cuomo of new york has appointed a task force to investigate a spike in the number of catastrophic breakdowns at aqueduct racetrack , which races thoroughbreds industry groups representing breeders , owners and racetracks are proposing new drug rules and integrity measures to better protect the horses and riders i have been guilty of running horses more often than i should , o'neill said this week through some terrible moments in my career , i 've learned to be more patient and more cautious o'neill , who has fought some of the charges brought against him over the years , continues to insist he has never given a horse a milkshake a mix of baking soda , sugar and electrolytes delivered through a tube down a horse s nose to combat fatigue the racing industry has come to realize that lax regulation and the absence of meaningful punishment have fostered a culture where top trainers with multiple drug violations are more the rule than the exception of the top 20 trainers in the united states measured by purses won in 2011 only two , christophe clement and graham motion , were never cited for a medication violation , according to the racing commission international database in march , the jockey club , one of the sport s most influential groups , proposed a set of stricter racing medication rules , and it has encouraged racing jurisdictions throughout the country to implement them on thursday , the jockey club , along with the thoroughbred owners and breeders association , started an advocacy web site , , dedicated to the reform of medication rules thoroughbred racing cannot tolerate individuals who repeatedly violate its drug rules , said james l gagliano , president and chief operating officer of the jockey club under this structure , there would be a cumulative penalty system and stronger penalties fines , disqualifications , loss of purse earnings and even lifetime suspensions would be imposed on habitual violators alex waldrop , president and chief executive of the national thoroughbred racing association , commended o'neill s skills as a horseman as well as his passion , which has made him among the most enthusiastic ambassadors of the sport however , waldrop said in a statement , o'neill s record of repeated violations cannot be ignored or excused in recent years , the issue of whether trainers continued to break the rules in part because the penalties were so minor was exemplified by the case of richard dutrow jr for years , dutrow trained horses at tracks across the country despite amassing dozens of drug violations he paid fines , litigated cases for years and in 2008 found himself the trainer of , the winner of the 2008 kentucky derby and  last october , new york authorities , citing 70 violations in 15 states , revoked dutrow s license , barring him from state racetracks for 10 years but dutrow appealed the ruling and continues to race horses effectively enough to be the nation s 11thranked trainer with more than 22 million in earnings for 2012  o'neill , 43 , is a selftaught horseman who is popular among thoroughbred owners in california , where his training operation is based he went to the track after finishing high school in santa monica with little experience with horses beyond being a fan he did n't know how to train any horses , said his longtime friend mark verge , now a top executive at santa anita park outside los angeles but he had a passion for the game , and he learned he was upbeat and nice to everyone verge was a coowner of stephen s got hope , a horse trained by o'neill that tested positive for having received a milkshake in the illinois derby two years ago he was also coowner of another o'neilltrained horse , argenta , which , california regulators said , tested positive for a milkshake in 2010 after racing at del mar o'neill paid a 1 , 000 fine and served a 15day suspension for the illinois violation he has contested the results of the violation for argenta , arguing that environmental factors may have caused a false positive the case should be heard within two months , and o'neill , if found in violation , could be suspended up to 180 days although that would apply only to racing in california , other jurisdictions have the choice to uphold it verge said o'neill had been the victim of his success and might have been sabotaged people hate his guts because he wins , verge said it was o'neill s gregarious nature , however , that won over the owner of i 'll have another , paul reddam , who first met o'neill in 2004 when he bought a small piece of an inexpensive horse he called me every day with updates , said reddam , who has horses with several trainers here and in england i had a lot more horses with other guys , but i did n't hear from them as much doug was an effective politician , and he figured that as the relationship grew i might give him more horses he was right reddam , who owns the california lender cashcall , buys toplevel horses and points them to stakes races , but he said that most of o'neill s more than 75 horses remain in the everyday tier of the sport he said none of his horses were involved in o'neill s drug violations he said that o'neill had insisted to him that he does not cheat with his horses , and that he takes the trainer at his word doug races a lot of horses , and i think the numbers catch up to him , reddam said i do n't think illegal drugs are rampant in his barn horse trainers , like people in all sports , look for whatever edge they can to win everyone thinks the other guy is doing something nationally , thoroughbred horses break down or show signs of injury at a rate of 51 per thousand starts , according to of more than 150 , 000 races over the past three years in more than 2 , 300 starts , horses trained by o'neill show a breakdown or injury frequency more than double that rate , at 120 per thousand starts it s a horrible statistic to be associated with , o'neill said in comparison , horses in the care of motion one of the trainers without a single drug violation and who will race went the day well in the preakness stakes next saturday have started nearly 1 , 900 races and broken down or showed signs of injury in just 05 per thousand starts dr mary scollay , chief veterinarian for the kentucky racing commission , said she spent 20 years on the racetrack dealing with a variety of trainers , including one that never had a single horse taken from the track because of injury or breakdown how do you explain that , when other trainers dealing with the same genetic pool of horses , racing over the same surfaces , and using the same vets are having a substantially greater incidence of injuries \? she said that guy knew his horses better than anybody they were professional athletes and he asked a lot of them , but he knew when he was asking too much in 2010 , o'neill s handling of a horse named burna dette was called into question by the california horse racing board after he entered the filly in a bottomlevel race at los alamitos racetrack she broke down and had to be euthanized in the span of two months , o'neill had bought burna dette for 25 , 000 , raced her at del mar , where she was well beaten , but then went ahead and two weeks later ran her in a race where she could have been bought for 2 , 000 the investigation centered on whether o'neill knew the horse was hurt and was trying to get rid of it the board eventually determined it had insufficient evidence to pursue any action against o'neill or his owners it was a horrific event and hearing her name still brings chills to me , o'neill said i was trying to get her a win and work her back up the ladder o'neill , in his interview this week with the times , said he would prefer to be speaking about the prospects of i 'll have another s winning the 137th preakness stakes and perhaps then heading to new york for the and an opportunity to become the 12th horse to sweep the and the first since affirmed in 1978 but he said he also understood how , with his win in the derby , his disciplinary record had fed the debate for a sport at a crossroads o'neill said he was trying to own up to his mistakes while fighting the allegations that he said were not true in the past , he said , he had succumbed to the pressure of racetrack officials who , eager to have full fields in their races , persuaded him to run horses that might have needed more rest on wednesday , however , he said , by way of example , he turned down the requests of officials at his home track of hollywood park to enter more than half a dozen horses for this saturday s races in the past , i may have led a few over there that i knew did n't have a chance to win to help them fill the race and me to maintain my stalls , he said last few years , i 've been taking the approach of running less often my horses are well taken care of , and i love them and i love this sport
it might go down as the most reluctant gamewinning touchdown in history when ahmad bradshaw was handed the ball and had an open lane to the end zone with 1 minute 4 seconds left to play sunday , he had a tough choice the giants were trailing the , 1715 , and would take the lead with either a field goal or a touchdown knowing the patriots would get the ball back , the giants wanted to score but did not want to leave the patriots with much time to execute a comeback with a clear path to a touchdown , bradshaw paused at the goal line , but his momentum carried him for a 2117 giants lead i thought i heard eli yelling at me to fall down , bradshaw told reporters , referring to giants quarterback eli manning i tried , but i could n't do it the patriots had made a strategic decision to let the giants score quickly , so they could get the ball back sooner you want to let them score so you can get your offense back on the field , patriots linebacker jerod mayo said bradshaw finished the game with 72 yards rushing , none more important than the final 1 on that 6yard touchdown a similar play occurred in super bowl xxxii , in which green bay allowed denver s terrell davis to score with 1 45 left in the game in hopes that it would give the packers time to rally in each instance , the plan backfired for the team that allowed a touchdown on purpose

through a 17week nfl season , there are certain players who stand out each week as the most interesting story line for their team with many of the playoff teams already decided , we chose this week to take a look at the players who stood out , not only on the field but off it quarterback robert griffin iii , washington redskins he does not have as many comefrombehind wins as andrew luck and is not on quite as big of a roll as russell wilson , but among the celebrated rookie quarterbacks , griffin seems like the one with the brightest future week in and week out , he was the most talkedabout redskin , achieving nearly rockstar levels of attention from fans and the news media more important , he backed up the hype with sensational play running back adrian peterson , minnesota vikings if you start the year as a question mark because of relatively recent knee surgery , and end it with a chance of breaking the singleseason rushing record , you are the allmatchups running back it has not always been pretty for the vikings , who have seen their passing game fall apart , but peterson has made a team with christian ponder at quarterback worth watching that is more impressive than chris johnson s ability to magically disappear and reappear depending on the opponent , arian foster s twitter musings or marshawn lynch being marshawn lynch wide receiver brandon marshall , chicago bears calvin johnson broke jerry rice s singleseason record for yards receiving , but managed to give matchup writers very little to work with he performed well each week , his team generally lost and he did not have anything all that interesting to say marshall , on the other hand , talked trash to the green bay defense , suggested his teammates should lose their jobs if they continued to fail to produce and was the only consistently interesting thing on the bears offense along the way he broke his franchise s record for yards receiving tight end jason witten , dallas cowboys it had been joked about for years that tony romo looked for witten on nearly every play , but this season it seemed to be true not only did witten become the cowboys franchise leader in career receptions , but he also had a careerhigh 18 in week 7 last week became the third tight end to record 100 receptions in a season , and he will be adding to his record of 103 this week defensive lineman jj watt , houston texans he had a good nickname \( jj swat \) , he got off to a fast start , he is closing the season well and his team is one of the top seeds heading into the playoffs even after losing its emotional leader \( linebacker brian cushing \) his pursuit of the singleseason sacks record he already is just the third afc player to record as many as 20 was impressive , but his 15 pass deflections were just as much fun linebacker von miller , denver broncos aldon smith , san francisco 49ers both players owe a great deal of their success at getting to the quarterback to another star defender on their defense \( elvis dumervil for miller and justin smith for aldon smith \) but they have both terrorized opposing passers all year , and have increased their dominance as the season wore on smith will likely finish with more sacks , and could even break michael strahan s singleseason record , but miller appears to have a narrow edge in both wellrounded play and personality defensive back richard sherman , seattle seahawks the entire seahawks secondary is intimidating , but none more than sherman a 6foot3 cornerback , with dreadlocks bursting from his helmet , sherman can shut down the passing game as both a ball hawk and a fierce tackler in prime time last week , when his team was putting on a show against the favored 49ers , sherman politely applauded at one of the few passes san francisco able to complete against him the show of confidence embodied everything that has made the seahawks such a fascinating story in the season s second half special teams greg zuerlein , st louis rams if there is such a thing as a rookie sensation at placekicker , zuerlein fits the bill having successfully made 14 kicks of greater than 40 yards , including a personal best of 60 yards , zuerlein earned himself two nicknames greg the leg and legatron the last kicker to inspire similar praise in such a short period of time was sebastian janikowski , though zuerlein seems far more stable than the polish cannon games that matter packers \( 114 \) at vikings \( 96 \) sunday , 4 25 pm line packers by 3 the packers and the seahawks are finally square a terrible call gave seattle an undeserved touchdown and a win over green bay in week 3 but the seahawks made up for it last week by beating san francisco , which gives the packers control of their own playoff fate a win gives them a firstround bye and at least one game at lambeau field standing in the way will be a vikings team that needs a win to get into the playoffs and can best accomplish that by running the ball early and often with adrian peterson it is probably too tall an order for peterson to run for 208 yards , which is what he would need to break eric dickerson s singleseason record of 2 , 105 , but every time the ball is in his hands it is not in those of aaron rodgers or christian ponder for the vikings , that is ideal pick packers cardinals \( 510 \) at 49ers \( 1041 \) sunday , 4 25 pm line 49ers by 17 a win would give the 49ers a second consecutive nfc west division crown combine that with a green bay loss , and the 49ers would get a first roundbye and play at home in the playoffs against anyone other than atlanta it may not matter where they are playing should justin smith not return soon a runnerup for defensive player of the year last season , smith s importance has been proven in his absence the team has looked lost since he left san francisco s week 15 win over new england with an elbow injury without smith , the 49ers defense goes from amazing to average pick 49ers rams \( 771 \) at seahawks \( 105 \) sunday , 4 25 pm line seahawks by 11 for the last three weeks , the seahawks have been the best team in football their offense has finally found the swagger that their defense has had all season and they have become the team no one wants to face in the playoffs the stakes are low for seattle , with a playoff spot secured and a division title unlikely , as it would require a san francisco loss to arizona if they let up at all , the rams , 401 in division games , will be able to sweep their season series but teams that let up don t score 150 points in three weeks like seattle has pick seahawks ravens \( 105 \) at bengals \( 96 \) sunday , 1 pm line bengals by 1 regardless of the outcome of this game , the ravens will be the afc north champions and the bengals will be the no 6 seed in the playoffs but the game will help determine who each team plays in the first round and also gives baltimore a chance to prove itself on the road and the bengals a chance to have beaten their biggest division rivals in consecutive weeks the only thing that is at stake is you go out and play to win the game every time we go , bengals coach marvin lewis told reporters this week that s important pick ravens texans \( 123 \) at colts \( 105 \) sunday , 1 pm line texans by 7 for a team to come back late in a game , first it has to be losing the colts , for all of the dramatics this season , likely would be ok with just winning a game in boring fashion unfortunately , the texans have plenty of motivation to win , since that would guarantee them the no 1 seed in the playoffs and would be their franchise s first win in indianapolis the colts will get a boost from the return of coach chuck pagano , out since week 3 for leukemia treatment , but that will not be enough to beat a far superior team pick texans buccaneers \( 69 \) at falcons \( 132 \) sunday , 1 pm line even falcons coach mike smith has said atlanta will be playing to win this week considering a firstround bye has been secured along with homefield advantage throughout the playoffs , and the likelihood that his offensive personnel will likely take some or all of the game off , atlanta s effort will most likely be lacking , regardless of smith s rhetoric taking things easy against the buccaneers could cost them , as coach greg schiano has made a point of not letting up on his players , and will be looking for a win to close his first season in the nfl pick buccaneers chiefs \( 213 \) at broncos \( 123 \) sunday , 4 25 pm line broncos by 16 a week after managing just 119 yards of total offense against oakland , the chiefs exploded for 507 against indianapolis a marked improvement , but in both cases they lost the broncos , still playing for a chance at the no 1 seed in the afc , should crush the chiefs if peyton manning can pass for 346 yards , he will set a career high in passing yards , something no one could have predicted coming into the season pick broncos bears \( 96 \) at lions \( 411 \) sunday , 1 pm line bears by 3 little has gone right this season for the lions even calvin johnson s recordsetting 1 , 892 yards receiving have come with just five touchdown catches knocking the bears out of the playoffs , and letting johnson make a run at the first 2 , 000yard season for a receiver , would help redeem the lost season pick lions dolphins \( 78 \) at patriots \( 114 \) sunday , 4 25 pm line patriots by 10 losing to san francisco at home was mildly embarrassing for the patriots needing to come back for a win over jacksonville was simply unacceptable with a small chance remaining that they could be the no 1 or no 2 seed in the playoffs \( should they get help in the form of losses by houston and or denver \) , the patriots need to fix their recent problems on third down , get the run game rolling and get their defense healthy pick patriots cowboys \( 87 \) at redskins \( 96 \) sunday , 8 20 pm line redskins by 3 a win \( or a tie \) would give robert griffin iii and the redskins a division title and would send the cowboys home without a trip to the playoffs despite brilliant play by tony romo as the season drew to a close motivation will be a factor for washington should minnesota and chicago both lose prior to kickoff , which would clinch a redskins playoff berth if that happens , the desire to keep griffin s balky knee healthy will likely limit their offense to the point that romo can beat them pick cowboys eagles \( 411 \) at giants \( 87 \) sunday , 1 pm line giants by 7 for the giants to qualify for the playoffs , they need the following things to happen they need to beat the eagles dallas needs to lose to or tie washington minnesota needs to lose to green bay and chicago needs to lose to detroit if all of that happens , the giants should all go buy lottery tickets pick giants games that don t matter panthers \( 69 \) at saints \( 78 \) sunday , 1 pm line saints by 6 if the saints allow more than 281 yards of offense to the panthers , they will break the record for yards allowed in a season , set by indianapolis in 1981 since the panthers are likely playing for coach ron rivera s job , and cam newton has been on a roll , that kind of yardage seems all but certain regardless of the game s final result pick saints browns \( 510 \) at steelers \( 78 \) sunday , 1 pm line even the browns have not won in pittsburgh since 2003 and have not swept the steelers in a season since 1988 but with the steelers playing for division pride after being eliminated from the playoffs , those streaks are unlikely to end pick steelers jets \( 69 \) at bills \( 510 \) sunday , 1 pm line bills by 4 a matchup between these teams next season may look very different the jets may trade mark sanchez and tim tebow , and could fire rex ryan after his team failed to qualify for the playoffs for a second consecutive season the bills will likely fire coach chan gailey , and their general manager , buddy nix , has talked about drafting a quarterback to replace ryan fitzpatrick shonn greene , a free agent after this season , should pad his season rushing total significantly against the inept bills defense pick jets jaguars \( 213 \) at titans \( 510 \) sunday , 1 pm line titans by 4 we ve got to come out way better than this and finish strong , titans cornerback alterraun verner told reporters this week this is embarrassing if it is embarrassing for the titans , with five wins , imagine what it is like to be the jaguars , with two pick titans raiders \( 411 \) at chargers \( 69 \) sunday , 4 25 pm line even when one team is trying to decide between matt leinart and terrelle pryor at quarterback , and the other is not favored to win , the game hardly seems worth watching pick chargers

anyone on madison avenue who set up google alerts for havas , the french agency holding group , has probably received far more links lately to articles about the young english singer and songwriter lianne la havas that could well change as of monday that is when havas , controlled by its chairman , vincent bollor , is formally to adopt a new structure the centerpiece of the changes is the renaming of all the advertising agencies owned by havas that bear the euro rscg worldwide name as havas worldwide the renaming affects agencies like euro rscg worldwide , euro rscg life , euro rscg 4d and euro rscg worldwide pr to mark the name change , the new york operation of what is now havas worldwide is to announce it has landed two new accounts the euro rscg name , which will be retired , was adopted after a merger of eurocom with an agency called rscg after four french ad executives bernard roux , jacques s gu la , alain cayzac and jeanmichel goudard until now , havas worldwide had been the name of a division of havas composed of agencies like euro rscg worldwide , arnold worldwide and smaller shops that include victors spoils under the reorganization , that division will now be known as havas creative the other havas division , called havas media , will keep its name another change involves the creation of the havas digital group , an umbrella brand that , executives say , will operate across the havas creative and havas media divisions it is being formed to underline the havas commitment to digital advertising the changes are part of a much bigger initiative to create an agency holding group for the future , said david jones , who has three titles chief executive at havas chief executive at havas worldwide , now havas creative and chief executive at euro rscg worldwide , now havas worldwide the goal is for havas to be perceived by clients and potential clients as more entrepreneurial and more agile , mr jones said , and to have a much simpler structure the renaming poses a risk in that some may confuse havas , the parent , with havas worldwide , the agency there would be precedent for any such confusion because another french agency holding group , the publicis groupe , named one of its agencies publicis worldwide the good news is none of our clients thinks it s confusing , mr jones said of the redesignation of euro rscg worldwide as havas worldwide havas worldwide is the agency and havas is the publicly traded holding company it s very easy to see the difference the only negative reaction , he added , was , why not do it sooner \? the name change was not inspired by the recent travails of the euro currency , mr jones said asked if innumerable headlines like euro in crisis and euro on the brink spurred the renaming , he replied , it didn t even factor in mr jones said it was obviously disappointing that charles schwab , a large client of what will now be known as havas worldwide new york , placed its creative account in review last week , days before the renaming the agency said it would take part in the review for the account , with spending estimated at more than 130 million it is an opportunity to demonstrate what we ve done in the last seven or eight years for schwab , mr jones said on the plus side of the ledger are the new two accounts havas worldwide new york is to announce on monday the agency will be the creative agency of record for a new joint venture between dreamworks animation and technicolor named mgo , a planned entry in the field of digital storefronts for movies online and havas worldwide new york will serve as a strategic marketing consultant to live nation entertainment , which owns companies like ticketmastercom and live nation concerts the newly named havas worldwide is making plans to move its headquarters early next year to 200 hudson street from its current location at 350 hudson street
verizon and redbox have teamed up on a service intended to rival netflix in allowing consumers to rent physical dvds and stream movies via the internet , the companies said monday any broadband customer , even if are outside the verizon fios network , will have access to the new service , said paul davis , chief executive of coinstar inc , the company that operates the redbox selfservice dvd rental locations redbox has 35 , 400 kiosks at convenience stores , in some mcdonald s and grocery and drugstores nationwide verizon has more than 100 million wireless customers and nine million broadband subscribers it s the best of both the physical and the digital , mr davis said in an interview in the last few years , cable and satellite companies have increasingly tried to deliver video via the web verizon said redbox brings brand recognition in the competitive home video arena and the ability for the joint company to offer physical dvds , which , at least for now , many consumers still prefer to streaming currently , redbox does not offer a streaming service and does not control the digital rights to its movies the verizon partnership is expected to change that verizon estimates that by 2015 nearly half of the 1147 million united states homes with televisions will have internetenabled sets those televisions already typically come with icons for netflix , youtube and hulu the hope , said bob mudge , president of verizon consumer and mass business markets , is that soon they will include a redbox icon roughly 30 million people rent dvds and video games for as little as 1 each at redbox kiosks , compared with 244 million netflix subscribers we ll target existing customers , but we ll also be agnostic as to where you get your broadband , mr mudge said even if you don t have verizon , you ll get redbox branded content also on monday , redbox said it would pay up to 100 million for assets of the ncr corporation s entertainmentrelated businesses , which include blockbuster express kiosk locations and dvd inventory fourthquarter earnings reported by coinstar on monday showed that the company s revenue jumped 33 percent largely because of redbox unlike netflix , which offers television and movies and is experimenting with original content , redbox primarily focuses on recent movies on dvd and bluray and video games having a partner like verizon could give the company the financial backing and scale to negotiate with hollywood studios , with which webstreaming companies have had a tense relationship , and acquire more programming verizon will hold a 65 percent ownership share in the joint venture , and coinstar 35 percent subscription services , which analysts expected to be priced at nearly half of what netflix charges for dvdbymail and streaming services , will be introduced in the second half of 2012 verizon and coinstar declined to comment on pricing netflix already has powerful streaming competitors in amazon prime , hulu plus and walmart s vudu service , though none of them offer dvd rentals
guatemala city the little boy flies like an airplane through the hotel , his arms outstretched then he leaps like a superhero , beaming as the red lights on his new sneakers flash and flicker , while the american couple he is with dissolve in laughter he calls them mam and papi they call him hijo son he corrects their fledgling spanish they teach him english awesome , he repeats carefully , eyeing his new shoes to outsiders , they look like a family but geovany archilla rodas , an impish 6yearold boy with spiky black hair , lives in an orphanage on the outskirts of this capital city the americans amy and rob carr of reno , nev live a world away they are the only parents he has ever known they have been visiting him every year , usually twice a year , since he was a toddler , flying into this central american city for a few days at a time to buy him clothes and to read him stories , to wipe his tears and to tickle him until he collapses in giggles at their hotel or in the orphanage yet half a decade after agreeing to adopt him , the carrs still have no idea when or if they will ever take geovany home there s this hope in you that does n't want to die , said mrs carr , who arrived here last month with her husband , more determined than ever to cut through the bureaucracy in my heart , he s my son the carrs are among the 4 , 000 americans who found themselves stuck in limbo when shut down its international adoption program in january 2008 amid mounting evidence of corruption and child trafficking officials here and in washington promised at the time to process the remaining cases expeditiously but officials and prospective parents say that bureaucratic delays , lengthy investigations and casework hobbled by shortages of staff and resources have left hundreds of children stranded in institutions for years today , 150 children including geovany are still waiting in orphanages and foster homes here while the guatemalan authorities weigh whether to approve their adoptions to families in the united states stalled adoptions are not unique to guatemala concerns about fraud , including allegations of kidnappings and baby selling , have held up american adoptions for months , and sometimes years , from ethiopia , kyrgyzstan , vietnam and haiti the state department currently refuses to approve adoptions from cambodia and vietnam to pressure those countries to install safeguards so that children with biological relatives who can care for them are not shipped overseas , officials say but the problem of delayed adoptions is particularly acute in guatemala , a country of about 14 million people , which in 2007 ranked second only to china in the number of children sent to the united states as officials here have spent months , and then years , trying to distinguish legitimate adoptions from fraudulent ones , many hopeful couples who had painted nurseries , hosted baby showers and bought brand new cribs began to despair as the infants they had hoped to adopt took their first steps and spoke their first words without them faced with a seemingly endless process , scores of prospective parents quietly abandoned their efforts to adopt the children they once considered their own , officials say guatemalan officials said they never intended for the children to remain institutionalized for so long they say they have had to thoroughly investigate the cases , some of which are complicated by inconsistencies , false documents and questionable stories , to ensure that the children were not bought or stolen from impoverished rural women these are very vulnerable people , who can be easily taken advantage of , said elizabeth orrego de llerena , president of the board of directors of the national adoption council , which is processing the adoption cases once they have been cleared by the child welfare investigative branch at times , they have not had the opportunity to make a complaint or to seek solutions ms orrego de llerena said that the investigations , which typically include searches for biological relatives , were necessary to ensure that children were given up voluntarily this is why , at times , the process takes longer , said ms orrego de llerena , who added that her office was committed to finding permanent families for children as quickly as possible american officials counter that the process has taken long enough , noting that officials have published notices seeking out birth parents in local newspapers , have encouraged parents to report missing children and have sought out adoptive parents domestically they added that anomalies in case files often reflect complicated family situations , not corruption , pointing to instances in which unmarried teenagers and victims of rape and incest have lied about their identities or asked others to hand over their babies to protect themselves and their families from shame they say many judges and child welfare officials in guatemala have delayed approving cases out of fear of increased government scrutiny and prosecution , not because the children should not be approved for adoption i think these investigations have gone on long enough , said susan jacobs , the state department s special adviser for children s issues , who has traveled to guatemala four times trying to resolve the backlog if no one , after all this time , has come forward to say i want to give this child a home , i think the matches they have made in the past should be honored , ms jacobs said just decide do n't leave these kids forever in institutions it s just wrong desperate for a resolution , the prospective parents have created web sites and facebook pages to highlight their plight , made costly visits to guatemala to maintain their fragile bonds with their faraway sons and daughters , and pleaded with lawmakers and administration officials for help they found a champion in senator mary l landrieu , democrat of louisiana , who has prodded american and guatemalan officials to focus on their situation it is unwarranted and unnecessary , ms landrieu said of the prolonged process alejandro mayorkas , director of united states citzenship and services , has also traveled to guatemala to try to ease the logjam prospective parents hope that an agreement worked out by guatemalan and american officials will speed the processing of the remaining cases but so far , only five adoptions have been made final this year more than 100 cases remain unresolved , including geovany s , without any word of a concrete timeline in november , the carrs packed a green suitcase full of socks , underwear , legos and coloring books for geovany and flew back for four full days here , determined to make some headway on their ninth trip to guatemala in five years they arrived on a friday evening at the grand tikal futura hotel , armed with a letter from their senator harry reid , the majority leader , and a plan to meet with their lawyer as well as officials at the national adoption council and the american embassy and as they unpacked , they prayed that they would finally clear the last hurdles , even as they worried about the inevitable difficulties ahead the carrs , who have three biological children , adopted their first child a little girl named samantha from guatemala without a hitch they agreed to adopt geovany in december 2007 , just weeks before guatemala closed its program he was abandoned , their adoption agency told them a clearcut case they were told he would be home within six months , a toddler who would integrate relatively easily into their lives they never dreamed that they would be trying someday to assimilate a spanishspeaking boy who had grown up in an orphanage , or that they would be forced to confront the unexpected mysteries in his past mrs carr , 42 , who is a stayathome mother , and her husband , 43 , who is a software engineer , firmly believe that god has called on them to give geovany a home but they still wonder how will geovany cope in school without speaking english \? how will he adjust to a life that is considerably more freeflowing than the regimented rhythms of the orphanage \? and what about the impact of years of institutionalization \? geovany , who has lived in an orphanage since he was an infant , shies away from hugs and kisses and rarely seeks comfort from adults if he is sad or hurt if somebody had said to me five years ago , would you adopt a 6yearold boy , i would have said no , mrs carr said there are a lot of pieces of this that do concern me he does n't really know what family really means but during their brief visit , there was little time to mull over such worries a manager from the remar foundation , which runs the city of children orphanage where geovany lives , brought him to the hotel lobby on saturday morning he hurtled into mr carr s arms for four precious days , geovany was no longer a child without parents , a face in the crowd among the nearly 300 children at the remar orphanage instead , he was the center of attention as he pored over the carrs' family photos and greeted their children and parents in the united states using a video chatting program he stamped his feet in the new sneakers they bought for him and played pirates with mr carr , jousting with brightly colored balloons , as they scrambled through their hotel room chacha ! geovany shouted , slashing his orange balloon sword through the air geovany shrugged uncertainly when asked whether he knew what the word adoption meant but he spoke with confidence when asked about the carrs , saying that they were his mother and father who lived in the united states with his brothers and sisters he said he had never flown on an airplane and would like to try it then he practiced adding their name to his own geovany archilla rodas carrrr , he said , rolling the r s on the surname he hopes to take someday soon the carrs tried to treasure the moments as the time flew by , counting down to the day when geovany would return to the orphanage and they would have to fly back to reno they alternated story time with geovany with emails and phone calls to their lawyer , their interpreter and government officials , as they tried to set up the appointments they prayed would help them complete their adoption the carrs no longer expect miracles they know it is possible that they may never take geovany home but on this trip , they were determined to finally get what has long eluded them straight answers , mr carr said at their home in reno , the uncertainty often feels unbearable geovany is there , but not there he is an ephemeral presence , peering out of a black frame that hangs on the wall alongside photos of all the carr children a group photo of the entire family , with geovany when he was just a baby , sits on a shelf in the living room their adopted daughter , samantha , conjures him up in her evening prayers and he occasionally slips into mrs carr s dreams or into her mind during the day when someone asks , unknowingly , unwittingly , how many children she has mrs carr s children are no longer surprised when they stumble across her weeping and wondering whether geovany is sick or scared or feeling abandoned she cannot help thinking of all the milestones she has missed the day he spoke his first words , lost his first tooth , took his first bus ride to school the caseworkers at their adoption agency advised them several years ago to give up on the process even mr carr has wondered at times how long they should continue to wait in october , as they planned their trip here , mr carr told his wife that he did not think he could do it again i do n't want to go down and visit him and leave , he recalled telling her before recommitting himself yet again to geovany i said , i'm just ready to quit' it was not the journey that the carrs envisioned when they first saw geovany s photograph he was a baby boy in a battered , wooden crib with a runny nose and a missing sock it was december 2007 and in the midst of completing the adoption of samantha , the carrs were studying the pictures of hundreds of children who were available for adoption , trying to decide whether to bring one last needy child home mr carr stopped short when he saw the darkeyed baby with the bare foot he could not explain the wave of emotion that swept over him but suddenly he was sure that boy needs a dad , he said , and i'm his dad so the carrs accepted geovany on the spot , without worrying about the identity of his mother or how or why he had been deserted by his biological family their adoption agency assured them that the courts had issued a decree certifying that he had been abandoned , and that was good enough we were thinking about bunk beds , mrs carr said we fully expected that he would be home before his second birthday but the case stalled first , they were told that there was a typo on their power of attorney form then in november 2008 , they learned that their case was being investigated , because the woman who had given him up for adoption was not his birth mother astonished , the carrs turned to the only tangible link they had to geovany s past , an eightpage abandonment decree issued by the courts , which they had never read because it is in spanish to their dismay , they learned that geovany s story was not straightforward at all his surname in the records was different from the one that the adoption agency had given them he was months older than they had been told the court records said that he had been given up for adoption by a woman who had described him as her son the woman agreed to take a dna test to prove the relationship , but she vanished before the results came back the test results showed that the woman was not geovany s mother notices were placed in the newspapers calling on the woman , her relatives or anyone who knew anything about the child to come forward no one responded officials also checked with the national police , who reported that no child of geovany s description had been reported missing or kidnapped finally , geovany was formally declared eligible for adoption the carrs were dumbfounded who was this little boy \? what was his real name \? who was his mother \? who was the woman who had given him up \? no one knew american officials , who have reviewed all of the pending adoption cases , said that the carrs' case was similar to many of the others stuck in the pipeline here , filled with contradictory dna test results , uncorroborated accounts , sloppy casework and unresolved mysteries maybe geovany s mother was an unwed teenager , the carrs thought , or a rape victim who had handed her child to someone else if she had really wanted him , would she not have searched for him or visited him \? those worries faded only to be replaced by new ones as the years passed without the birth mother s reemergence in the end , the couple found some comfort in the fact that geovany s biological mother , whoever she is , never came looking for him sometimes you have questions that you do n't have answers to , mrs carr said you just have to keep going she reminded herself of that in guatemala after she and her husband and geovany visited their lawyer she arrived feeling hopeful she left in tears a judge had certified that geovany was eligible for adoption , but the decree was written up incorrectly , the lawyer said it was likely that the national adoption council would reject it , and the carrs would have to go back to court to have it reissued to make matters worse , there had been some confusion about the length of their visit , and as a result they would not be able to meet with anyone at the adoption council geovany , who listened quietly as the legal discussion swirled around him , was somber after the meeting , which took place on a monday afternoon that evening , the carrs told him that he would be going back home the next day to the united states \? geovany asked they shook their heads to the orphanage , they said mrs carr took a sleeping pill that night to ease the heartbreak she reassured herself that geovany would be fine he was accustomed now to their comings and goings and the syncopated rhythms of their dislocated lives it s much easier for him than it is for us , she said but geovany did not sleep well in their hotel room that evening on his last night before returning to the orphanage , he tossed and turned restlessly in his rollaway bed twice , they awoke to hear him crying nearly 300 children live in the sprawling orphanage that sits behind a black metal gate in the impoverished community of san jose villanueva ask geovany and he will tell you that he was born here , even though the administrators know that is not true it is the only home he has ever known inside the compound , he shares the top floor of a spare house that bears the name , the love of god , with other abandoned children sofia villanova , the house mother , was waiting for geovany to return from his visit with the carrs she was bracing herself for the emotional turmoil she said she knew he would experience once the americans were gone every time that they leave , he finds himself alone once again he is sad , solitary , isolated , ms villanova said we try to give him the most support , the most love that we can but it s not the same as having parents it takes time to reintegrate him to the routines of the house the orphanage s administrators say that none of geovany s blood relatives have come to visit him in all the years he has lived at the institution no one , they said , knows who they are but on tuesday , their last full day in guatemala , as they settled in for a meeting with officials at the american embassy who had reviewed their case file , the carrs learned that the guatemalan authorities had finally unraveled the mystery of geovany s origins they had located geovany s birth mother their adoption , the american officials told the couple , was delayed once again while guatemalan caseworkers tried to reach the woman , who lives in a remote area they wanted to give her a dna test and to interview her to determine once and for all if she had voluntarily given up geovany when he was a baby the carrs were stunned their lawyer had not mentioned a word of this it had been nearly four years since anyone had brought up geovany s birth mother geovany , unable to understand the conversation in english , sat quietly on mr carr s lap my heart just sank , mr carr said another hurdle how many hurdles are we going to have to go through to get this kid home \? mrs carr thought fearfully about the stories she had heard from other prospective adoptive parents , about guatemalan officials who forced birth families to accept their abandoned children , a charge that guatemalan officials have denied then she thought of that woman out there somewhere , geovany s mother we love him , mrs carr said finally we want him to be a part of our family but if there was a birth family out there who wanted to raise him , would that be better for him \? her shaky voice trailed off geovany and the carrs wept quietly in the hotel lobby when it was finally time for him to go , and they clung to each other on the bus ride back to the orphanage but the little boy s face brightened when he stepped into his house and received a hero s welcome geovany ! the other boys shouted geovany ! geovany proudly reintroduced the carrs as his mam and papi and opened his brand new ben 10 backpack to share his goodies he offered bites of cold pizza \( saved from lunch \) to his closest friends , glowsticks to everyone , and displayed the drawing that the carrs' daughter samantha had made just for him this is from my sister , he told them then mrs carr began blowing up dozens of brightly colored balloons , twisting them into animal shapes and swords , transforming the orphaned and abandoned boys into a motley crew of rambunctious , swashbuckling pirates it was dark by the time the americans finally said goodbye to geovany and clambered back onto the bus as they headed back to the hotel , they tried not to lose themselves in sorrow the months fly by so quickly , the carrs reminded each other soon there would be christmas to celebrate and the new year and their children s birthdays and then it would be spring again , time to start planning another trip to guatemala
early in this american league division series , noticed that first baseman mark reynolds would not hold him on the bag when he reached first he considered stealing but never felt spry enough to try the left calf strain that had cost him nearly all of september kept holding him back in the fifth inning of friday s game , though , teixeira could not let the opportunity pass after a leadoff single , he stole second , putting a yankee into scoring position for the first time all evening six pitches later , raul ibanez singled up the middle to score teixeira and give the a 10 lead i was either going to be a hero or a goat there , teixeira said but i felt like we needed a spark it was only the yankees' second stolen base of the series , and it could hardly have come from a more unlikely source teixeira , still feeling the effects of a grade 1 calf strain , had swiped just two bases all season , none since july 6 against boston for his career , teixeira has only 21 stolen bases , and friday gave him his first postseason steal of his career as a team , baltimore allowed only 63 stolen bases all season , fewest in the american league their catcher , matt wieters , was fourth in the majors , throwing out 386 percent of potential base stealers jason hammel had allowed only six stolen bases when he was pitching this season so orioles manager buck showalter elected again not to hold teixeira on the bag before the game , teixeira said he talked with the coaches about the possibility of trying to steal he seized the chance to take a sizable lead , ran on a secondpitch curveball and easily beat an accurate throw from wieters you talk about trusting your players and their instincts , manager joe girardi said he trusted them , and he was right the play jolted a little bit of life into a pensive yankee stadium crowd teixeira had just picked up the team s first hit of the game , but managing to get him around to score was a different issue the yankees came into the game hitting 6 for 28 with runners in scoring position for the series ibanez worked the count full and , on the eighth pitch , grounded a 32 slider from hammel up the middle teixeira raced around to score , giving the yankees the first run of the game ibanez said the goal of his atbat changed with teixeira in scoring position with no outs any means necessary try to get him to third base , ibanez said if the ball goes through , that s even better but once you get to two strikes , you 're really just battling , trying to stay in the middle of the field and get the guy over until a few weeks ago , it was not clear how well teixeira could even jog he missed 30 games after straining his left calf on aug 27 , and aggravating it sept 8 , against the orioles before returning on oct 1 , against the red sox when he came back , he admitted the leg was not 100 percent , but he said he would play through any soreness
when ilana glazer and abbi jacobson met for lunch at cafe cluny in the west village recently , they looked tanner than usual ms glazer had taken up biking it s my new thing , she said none of this was totally unrelated to the month they 'd just spent in los angeles these creators of , a web series with devoted followings among women and new yorkers and a rabid following among certain female new yorkers , including influential comedians were on the west coast to meet with producers and executives at fx , the cable channel for which they are currently developing a script for a potential broad city pilot so were the biking and the sunkissed skin signs that ms glazer and ms jacobson were preparing to move and to shoot their potential pilot on hollywood s syntheticmanhattan sets \? ms glazer shook her head of brown curls it s got to be here , that was in our pitch , she said we made it for no money here who could argue with that \? ms jacobson \( she of the brown straight hair \) began her response with a few profanities and ended with an emphatic no there it was the quintessential newyorkordie perspective that defines broad city , in which ms jacobson and ms glazer play friends who embrace , duck and battle the oddities of young urban life the shorts , two to seven minutes long , cover phenomena peculiar to new york \( pursuing a guy purely for his inunit washer and dryer \) and universal to young women \( the insufferable experience of hanging out with ultrabeautiful women \) the show in 2010 , and its two seasons convey the kind of authentic 20something flavor that network executives spend enormous energy to concoct after churning out half a dozen this year , the industry finally seems ready to give the duo s screenready work a shot whether it can find a home , especially in the wake of the starting sunday on hbo , remains a question we try not to get our expectations up too much , said ms jacobson , who , along with ms glazer , is awaiting fx s notes on the pilot script but at the same time we know it s a really good product ms jacobson , 28 , and ms glazer , 25 , are passionate , funny and sometimes raunchy but when it comes to the work of comedy , they 're the equivalent of straighta students they did their research \( by living the bewildering lives of transplant new yorkers \) studied hard \( at the theater , where they met on an improv team \) and turned in neat work \( every episode is professional quality and bookended with crisp credit sequences \) but their vignettes were never the stuff of instant , webtotv starmaking deals they are subtle and wry not as dialogue heavy as girls and not drenched in shock value either and some still draw online views so in 2011 ms jacobson and ms glazer set out to produce their own pilot but they ran into money problems when a kickstarter crowdsourced fundraising campaign it was bad , ms glazer said they decided , with the help of a manager , to pitch their show to networks , but meanwhile ran into a setback on the finale of the web series the actress kristen schaal was set to make a guest appearance but had to pull out because of a scheduling conflict ms jacobson and ms glazer resigned themselves to going ahead without a star cameo i had been taking off work all these days , like , sorry , i have to live my dreams , ' ms glazer said \( they have since turned full time to writing and producing \) but they did n't give up trying for a name guest and through an upright citizens brigade contact sought out amy poehler , one of the founders of the theater it was more of a would she ever do this \? ' than a will she do this \? ' ms jacobson said the next day the contact relayed ms poehler s written response sure ! i love broad city' ms glazer and ms jacobson can still hardly put that part into words without getting , as ms glazer said , verklempt she added , i felt like i would fall to my knees they had no idea ms poehler had even seen their series but she had i knew of abbi and ilana from their work at upright citizens brigade , ms poehler wrote in an email they 're knuckleheads who are n't afraid to look ridiculous i love that broad city' feels like a true new york show , and reminds us that men are n't the only ones who are adolescent and adrift days later ms poehler showed up to the barrow street set she shook hands with ms glazer s dad and gamely rolled around on the sidewalk amid spilled oranges \( after the schedule was changed for ms poehler , ms schaal was able to rejoin the shoot so included both \) seven months later ms poehler came aboard as the fx project s executive producer there s a scene in the web series finale where we 're running , and then amy comes and joins us , ms jacobson said and that s what it feels like now if the fx series goes forward , the pair will face two disadvantages not only would they arrive at the end of a string of femalecentered comedies , but they would also be doing so on a historically  yet they 've also got an entry in the advantage column ms glazer and ms jacobson have been refining the show s voice for nearly two years what started as a twominute clip of asking a homeless man for change grew into an anthology with chapters on female empowerment , sexuality and embracing , rather than postponing or dreading , adulthood all of it mirrored the ways ms jacobson and ms glazer were evolving i 've been in new york almost seven years now , ms glazer said the thing i feel luckiest about is that i had this project to help me define myself i have no idea where i 'd be without it but , again , probably not los angeles

did you guys all see the show \? tony danza asked strangers in the elevator to the afterparty for girls , the new hbo comedy yes , the guests all nodded so that s what s going on out there , mr danza said sheeeesh ! that s my revelation later , he could be heard factchecking the veracity of the more ribald storylines with people younger than his 61 years the new york premiere of girls , the series developed , written , directed by and starring lena dunham , alongside allison williams , zosia mamet and jemima kirke , as striving , postcollegiate brooklynites , was a mustattend event for culture , media and downtown circles in new york on wednesday a generational segue at 25 , ms dunham has already been profiled by the new yorker and appeared on the cover of new york magazine , but she wears her ambition lightly we ve been working on the show now i can t believe it for almost two years , she said before the screening at the sva theater in manhattan which means that i ve had friends for almost two years ! the series the first three episodes were shown at the premiere deals frankly with the travails of young adulthood , from underemployment \( those are my interns lives ! a woman said at the afterparty \) to friendship to sex lots and lots of sex i feel like i need a cigarette , john cameron mitchell said after the screening the party , on the top floor of the standard , drew a who s who of performers , writers , artists , designers , musicians and newscasters kevin bacon and kyra sedgwick ed norton jay mcinerney claire danes chlo sevigny the singer lissy trullie katie couric cast members from saturday night live , 30 rock and the office cynthia rowley and bill powers and judd apatow , an executive producer of the series though mr apatow and ms dunham hosted a rapturous sneak preview of girls at south by southwest in march , for much of the cast , it was their first time seeing it with an audience it was an exceptional experience , ms mamet said of course , it was nervewracking i was just a little bit numb it s so much to comprehend for your first time around it s like birthing a child , and letting it walk and having people judge it she and jenni konner , another executive producer of the show , were wideeyed at the packed party , a smaller affair by hbo standards , complete with a table full of blue and white cookies that spelled out girls this is not a small party , ms konner whispered ms williams sat with friends and family , including her father , the newscaster brian williams , whom she had discussed at length in an appearance on late show with david letterman that night ms dunham , in a strapless black gown that highlighted her tattoos , her hair in a braided updo , hung out with mr apatow and his wife , leslie mann , and earned praise from friends like the bridesmaids director paul feig still basking in the glow of lenadunham s girls , mr feig wrote on twitter later a total game changer i m in awe congrats to all involved thank you , thank you , thank you , ms dunham repeated , with genuine enthusiasm , to wellwishers of various ages , before going in search of a glass of water by 1 am , the party had thinned out , and the girls and their friends gathered on a banquette by a window with a glittering skyline view their dresses poofed out around them heels were kicked off , hair was stroked they leaned into each other , talking intently amazing perfect dream night , ms dunham wrote on twitter later , in the wee hours sleeping in all of my makeup , all of my jewels , and none of my clothes thanksnightsky loveyouuniverse
among the 67 , 000 sore , weary , traumatized federal soldiers in ulysses s grant s army that followed the confederate retreat back toward corinth , miss , after the battle of shiloh was my greatgreat grandfather , pvt edward d willis most of what i know about him comes from the meager information gleaned from his service record edward had enlisted with the 25th kentucky the previous fall in henderson , on the banks of the ohio river in western kentucky , shortly after the confederate general leonidas polk occupied the river city of columbus , an important rail depot at the confluence of the ohio and mississippi rivers the occupation violated kentucky s official policy of neutrality , and soon thereafter , two regiments , the 17th and 25th , began enrolling men in the region edward was 18 like the german iron youth in erich maria remarque s all quiet on the western front , these young men had little life experience against which to judge what was being demanded of them remarque s paul ba mer noticed how all the older men are linked up with their previous life they have wives , children , occupations , and interests , they have a background which is so strong that the war cannot obliterate it we young men of twenty , however , have only our parents , and some , perhaps , a girl that is not much , for at our age the influence of parents is at its weakest and girls have not yet got a hold over us besides this there was little else some enthusiasm , a few hobbies , and our school beyond this our life did not extend and of this nothing remains whether it was the american civil war or world war i , the effect was the same war shatters youth although physically strong and eager , edward and his teenage comrades embodied an invisible fragility that left them especially vulnerable to the war s brutal alienation they would be shattered in spirit , if not also body , at shiloh edward and his comrades were borderstate men , with divided borderstate allegiances what compelled him and the other men in the two federal regiments to answer the call of the union instead of the confederacy remains unknown none of them left a diary or later wrote a memoir no letters written to family members explaining their motivations remain despite the relatively high literacy rate of civil war soldiers , many of whom left a vibrant and evocative written record of their service , the men of the 17th and 25th appear to have bucked the trend in fact , it is highly likely that edward did not know how to read or write his son , my greatgrandfather ben , could only sign his name , a skill imparted to him by his wife , a tall , bigboned woman who bore little resemblance to her portly namesake , queen victoria unlike ba mer , no schoolteacher cajoled edward into enlisting if , after shiloh , he lay awake at night cursing whoever convinced him that enlisting was a good idea , those curses belonged to someone other than a trusted educator who had schooled him in the cause of union although he shared the fictional german soldier s youthfulness , edward had not led a sheltered , middleclass life edward s father , alexander , uprooted his growing family in the late 1840s , moving them from adair county in central kentucky to osage county in eastern missouri , where edward first appears in the historical record the 1850 census lists him as the 7yearold son of alexander , a farmer with six children and no valued real property the willises were among the poorest of the poor , the mass of midcentury western migrants looking for land and opportunity that had eluded them ten years later , alexander had found something of what he was looking for , having accumulated 300 in real estate and 475 in personal property but that modest improvement had not tempted edward , by then 17 , to stay at home no longer listed as a member of alexander s family in the 1860 census , he had returned to kentucky , where he heard the siren call of war the following year was it polk s brash violation of kentucky s attempted neutrality that compelled the men of the 25th to enlist \? did they rally to drive back what they believed was an invading force \? or did youthful bravado , a longing for adventure , and a desire to prove his manhood guide edward out of john james audubon s idyllic and peaceful forests and onward toward shiloh \? did he succumb to the wild intoxication of war like the writer ambrose bierce , another shiloh veteran , who compared the call of battle to the kisses of a beautiful woman \? although edward had seen some action at fort donelson in february , shiloh would be his elephant the first major battle he would see , and at that point in the country s history , the worst any american had seen for a glimpse at the horrors of what edward witnessed as he and the other kentucky unionists made their stand on the warm sunday afternoon of april 6 , at the infamous peach orchard , i must rely on the memories of others most likely edward was caught off guard that morning , perhaps eating his breakfast in camp , when the first sounds of battle reached his ears both the 17th and 25th kentucky made their way around the battlefield that day , which according to the historian bruce catton was a grab bag full of separate combats with little if any discernible organization at least it must have seemed that way to an infantryman like edward , who undoubtedly experienced the tunnel vision commonly described by combat veterans i saw only what transpired in my immediate front and vicinity , one shiloh veteran recalled some years later so , it s unlikely that edward was aware that his comrades nearby had held the hornet s nest just long enough to buy grant time while he waited for gen don carlos buell s reinforcements to arrive from across the river it s also doubtful that he realized that gen albert sidney johnston of the confederacy had bled to death on the ground just yards away from him after a bullet clipped his femoral artery the confederacy had lost one of their most valuable soldiers , and perhaps even the battle itself at that moment all edward knew , however , was that the final confederate pulse johnston had led against the kentuckians in the peach orchard had driven them back , forcing them to turn and run for the tennessee river the beautiful kisses of an anticipated battle surely were a distant memory by then other survivors recalled the feeling of their hair standing on end , the fear churning in their stomachs and making them sick , the deafening thunder of artillery , the clouds of impenetrable smoke making their eyes burn and water , the pitiful sights of mangled and dying animals half buried in the mud , and the screams of wounded men , begging simultaneously for life and for death , and not being able to tell which was worse did he , too , trample over dead bodies as he made for the river and the safety of the arriving federal gunboats \? was he now deaf to duty and dead to shame , as bierce described the men he saw sheltering against the bank of the river \? a more demented crew never drifted to the rear of broken battalions , the author recalled they would have stood in their tracks and been shot down to a man by a provostmarshal s guard , but they could not have been urged up that bank an army s bravest men are its cowards whatever edward expected to see that day , whatever reason drove him to enlist in the union cause , the thing that most likely remained with him at the end of that first awful day was the feeling of utter exhaustion never was i so tired as this night , wrote george hurlburt , an ohioan but the boom of cannon , fired deliberately throughout the night to disrupt the confederates sleep , also kept the federals awake , along with the sounds of death emanating from the wounded scattered on the battlefield tomorrow they would lick em , just as grant predicted they would as he mused over the day s losses , but that was no comfort to the men who had just lived through the worst day of their lives one survivor recalled without shame his willingness to trade in every jot and title of military glory falling to me if only i could have been miraculously set down a thousand miles away at that moment , did edward regret ever leaving his father s home in missouri \? did he wish he were back in henderson , listening to the songs of spring warblers in audubon s woods instead of the buzz of minie balls and the cries of bleeding men \? had he been undeceived , as herman melville imagined the dead at shiloh , men who no longer cared for fame or country \? edward willis survived the next day in fact , he survived the entire war , his service record mirroring that of bierce and another famous shiloh veteran , the confederate sam watkins , whose memoir co aytch serves as a favorite source for historians wishing to understand the life of a private and the experience of combat neither bierce nor watkins harbored any pretensions of glory or romantic patriotism about the war , and i doubt edward did either he died in 1878 from complications of small pox he contracted during the war , leaving his wife , edith , and two children , flora and ben , nearly destitute but like those two more wellknown survivors of shiloh , edward probably lived with the horrors of what he experienced that day , as well as the exhilaration of what it felt like to come so close to death long after the fighting was over , even the acerbic , malcontented bierce still recalled the moments before shiloh with longing as sincere as it was intense and this was , o so long ago ! he wrote of those memories in 1881 how they come back to me dimly and brokenly , but with what a magic spell those years of youth when i was soldiering ! although bierce lived on , his youth died that day , as i imagine it did for edward and countless other soldiers in that war and other wars to come i cannot know for sure the historical record for edward is so sparse or even nonexistent that i am forced to rely on bierce , watkins and even the fictional ba mer to stand in , however imperfectly , for him this is , i believe , why both historical fiction and family history enjoy such popularity both genres engage our imagination in ways that academic history often fails to do the empirical demands of the profession can be frustrating , particularly when it comes to recreating the lives of nonliterate peoples however , by learning to see history as being as much about imagination as documentation , the skeleton of edward willis s life can be covered in some skin and clothes , even if i know they re only borrowed follow disunion at or join us  sources e merton coulter , civil war and readjustment in kentucky ann e marshall , creating a confederate kentucky the lost cause and civil war memory in a border state aaron astor , rebels on the border civil war , emancipation , and the reconstruction of kentucky and missouri bruce catton , terrible swift sword shelby foote , the civil war , vol i joseph allan frank and george a reaves , ed seeing the elephant raw recruits at the battle of shiloh ambrose bierce , what i saw of shiloh sam r watkins , co aytch a confederate memoir of the civil war carole emberton teaches history at the university at buffalo her first book , beyond redemption race , violence , and the american south after the civil war will be published next year by the university of chicago press

dietrich fischerdieskau , the german baritone whose beautiful voice and mastery of technique made him the 20th century s preeminent interpreter of art songs , died on friday at his home in bavaria he was 86 his wife , the soprano julia varady , confirmed his death to the german press agency dpa was by virtual acclamation , from the 1940s to his official retirement in 1992 , and an influential teacher and orchestra conductor for many years thereafter he was also a formidable industry , making hundreds of recordings that pretty much set the modern standard for performances of lieder , the musical settings of poems first popular in the 18th and 19th centuries his output included the many hundreds of schubert songs appropriate for the male voice , the songs and song cycles of schumann and brahms , and those of later composers like mahler , shostakovich and hugo wolf he won two , in 1971 for schubert lieder , and in 1973 for brahms s sch ne magelone mr fischerdieskau \( pronounced feeshurdeescow \) had sufficient power for the concert hall and for substantial roles in his parallel career as a star of european houses but he was essentially a lyrical , introspective singer whose effect on listeners was not to nail them to their seat backs , but rather to draw them into the very heart of song the pianist gerald moore , who accompanied many great artists of the postwar decades , said mr fischerdieskau had a flawless sense of rhythm and one of the most remarkable voices in history honeyed and suavely expressive onstage he projected a masculine sensitivity informed by a cultivated upbringing and by dispiriting losses in world war ii the destruction of his family home , the death of his feeble brother in a nazi institution , induction into the wehrmacht when he had scarcely begun his voice studies at the berlin conservatory his performances eluded easy description where reviewers could get the essence of a pavarotti appearance in a phrase \( the glories of a true italian tenor ! \) , a fischerdieskau recital was akin to a magic show , with seamless shifts in dynamics and infinite shadings of coloration and character he had the good luck to age well , too in 1988 , at 62 , he sang an allschumann program at carnegie hall , where people overflowed onto the stage to hear him donal henahan , then the chief music critic of the new york times , noted that mr fischerdieskau s voice had begun to harden in some difficult passages but also that he was tall and lean and handsomer than ever , and had lost none of his commanding presence mr fischerdieskau described in his memoir reverberations \( 1989 \) how his affinity for lieder had been formed in childhood i was won over to poetry at an early age , he wrote i have been in its thrall all my life because i was made to read it , because it gave me pleasure , and because i eventually came to understand what i was reading he discerned , he said , that music and poetry have a common domain , from which they draw inspiration and in which they operate the landscape of the soul albert dietrich fischer was born in berlin on may 28 , 1925 , the youngest of three sons of albert fischer , a classical scholar and secondary school principal with relatively liberal ideas about education reform , and his young second wife , theodora klingelhoffer , a schoolteacher \( in 1934 dr fischer added the hyphenated dieskau to the family name his mother had been a von dieskau , descended from the kammerherr von dieskau , for whom j s bach wrote the peasant cantata \) family members knew dietrich , as he was called , as a shy , private child who nonetheless liked to entertain he put on puppet shows in which he voiced all the parts , sometimes for an audience of one his physically and mentally disabled brother , martin , with whom he shared a room before adolescence dietrich was inducted into a hitler youth group where , he recalled years later , he was appalled by the officiousness as well as by the brutality his father died when he was 12 and he had just finished secondary school and one semester at the berlin conservatory when , in 1943 , he was drafted into the wehrmacht and assigned to care for army horses on the russian front he kept a diary there , calling it his attempt at preserving an inner life in chaotic surroundings poems by morgenstern , one entry read it is a good idea to learn them by heart , to have something to fall back on lots of cold , lots of slush and even more storms , read another every day horses die for lack of food it was in russia that he heard that his mother had been forced to send his brother to an institution outside berlin soon , he wrote later , the nazis did to him what they always did with cases like his they starved him to death as quickly as possible and then his mother s apartment in lichterfelde was bombed granted home leave to help her , he found that all that remained of their possessions could be moved to a friend s apartment in a handcart but as early as his second day home , he and his mother began seeking out theater , concerts , a lot of other music defying the irrational world instead of returning to the disastrous campaign in russia , he was diverted to italy , along with thousands of other german soldiers there , on may 5 , 1945 , just three days before the allies accepted the german surrender , he was captured and imprisoned it turned out to be a musical opportunity soon the americans were sending him around to entertain other pow s from the back of a truck the problem was , they were so pleased with this arrangement that they kept him until june 1947 he was among the last germans to be repatriated still , he was only 22 when he returned for further study at the berlin conservatory he did n't stay long called to substitute for an indisposed baritone in brahms s german requiem , he became famous practically overnight as he said , i passed my final exam in the concert hall because of his youth , mr fischerdieskau had been in no position to make his own choices in the 1930s and '40s , so he did n't encounter the questions about nazi ties that hung over many a prominent german artist after the war \( the soprano elisabeth schwarzkopf , his frequent musical collaborator , repeatedly denied that she had joined the nazi party until confronted with evidence in 1983 it was akin to joining a union , she said in an explanatory letter to the times , and exactly for the same reason to have a job \) mr fischerdieskau gave his first professional lieder recital in leipzig in the fall of 1947 success followed success , with lieder performances in britain and other european countries , beginning in 1949 he first toured the united states in 1955 , choosing for his new york debut to sing schubert s demanding winterreise cycle without intermission he had made his opera debut in 1948 , singing posa in verdi s don carlos at berlin s st dtische oper \( later renamed the deutsche oper \) , where he was hired as principal lyric baritone he also sang regularly at the bavarian state opera in munich and appeared frequently in the opera houses of vienna , covent garden , salzburg and bayreuth versatility was not the least of mr fischerdieskau s assets he tackled everything from papageno in the magic flute who knew that a goofy bird catcher could have immaculate diction \? to heavier parts like wotan in das rheingold and wolfram in tannh user he recorded more than three dozen operatic roles , italian as well as german , along with oratorios , bach cantatas and works of many modern composers , including benjamin britten , whose war requiem he sang at its premiere in 1962 mr fischerdieskau was married in 1949 to his sweetheart from his student days , the cellist irmgard poppen they had three sons matthias , who became a stage designer , a conductor and manuel , a cellist ms poppen did not live to see them grow she died of complications after manuel s birth in 1963 for her husband it was a profound , disorienting loss he was married again , to the actress ruth leuwerik , from 1965 to 1967 , and again , to christina pugelschule , the daughter of an american voice teacher , from 1968 to 1975 his fourth marriage , to ms varady , the hungarian soprano , in 1977 , was a rewarding match like the many artists who studied with him more formally , ms varady found him to be a kindly , constructive and totally unsparing mentor mr fischerdieskau s insistence on getting things right comes through vividly in scenes of him at rehearsal or conducting master class in a widely circulated video at the time , showing him coaching a young christine sch fer , ms sch fer is singing beautifully , or so it would seem to your average mortal , yet the smiling maestro interrupts time and again to suggest something better and it is n't merely that he is invariably correct it s also that when he rises to sing just a few illustrative notes , the studio is instantly a stage , and he illuminates it with what seems to be an inner light even better is a documentary by bruno monsaingeon , , with archival and uptodate footage of a master at work in his many trades besides making music , he wrote about it insightful , accessible books about the lives and music of great composers , including schubert and schumann he was a widely exhibited painter , too , known especially for his portraits mr fischerdieskau retired from opera in 1978 he continued giving song recitals through the end of 1992 and then , on new year s day 1993 , announced that he would sing onstage no more of the many tributes he received over the decades , perhaps none was more heartfelt than that of the british music critic john amis providence gives to some singers a beautiful voice , to some musical artistry , to some \( let us face it \) neither , but to fischerdieskau providence has given both the result is a miracle , and that is just about all there is to be said about it mr amis continued , having used a few superlatives and described the program , there is nothing else to do but write finis , ' go home , and thank one s stars for having had the good luck to be present
washington the does not always have the last word sure , its interpretation of the constitution is the one that counts , and only a constitutional amendment can change things after the justices have acted in a constitutional case but much of the court s work involves the interpretation of laws enacted by congress in those cases , the court is , in theory at least , engaged in a dialogue with lawmakers lately , though , that conversation has become pretty onesided , thanks to the legislative paralysis brought on by congressional polarization the upshot is that the supreme court is becoming even more powerful here is the way things are supposed to work in cases concerning the interpretation of ambiguous federal statutes , the justices give their best sense of what the words of the law mean and how they apply in the case before them if congress disagrees , all it needs to do is say so in a new law the most prominent recent example of this dynamic was , the 2007 ruling that said title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 imposed strict time limits for bringing workplace discrimination suits , justice ruth bader ginsburg reminded lawmakers that on earlier occasions they had overridden what she called a cramped interpretation of title vii once again , she wrote , the ball is in congress s court congress responded with the , which overrode the 2007 decision this sort of back and forth works only if congress is not paralyzed an overlooked consequence of the current polarization and gridlock in congress , , has been a huge transfer of power to the supreme court it now almost always has the last word , even in decisions that theoretically invite a congressional response congress is overriding the supreme court much less frequently in the last decade , richard l hasen , the author of the study , said in an interview i did n't expect to see such a dramatic decline the number of overrides has fallen to almost none the few recent overrides of major decisions , including the one responding to the ledbetter case , were by partisan majorities in the past , when congress overturned a supreme court decision , it was usually on a nonpartisan basis , said professor hasen , who teaches at the university of california , irvine in each twoyear congressional term from 1975 to 1990 , he found , congress overrode an average of 12 supreme court decisions the corresponding number fell to 48 in the decade ending in 2000 and to just 27 in the last dozen years congressional overruling of supreme court cases , professor hasen wrote , slowed down dramatically since 1991 and essentially halted in january 2009 tracking legislative overrides is not an exact science , as some fixes may be technical and trivial and there may be other reasons for the decline , including drops in legislative activity generally and in the supreme court s docket but scholars who follow the issue say that professor hasen has discovered something important particularly since the 2000 elections , there has been a big falloff in overrides , said william n eskridge jr , a law professor at yale and the author of on which professor hasen built his own it gives the supreme court significantly more power and congress significantly less power richard h pildes , a law professor at new york university , said the findings were further proof that the hyperpolarization of congress is the single most important fact about american governance today it is , he said , a phenomenon that has been building steadily over the last 30 years and is almost certainly likely to be enduring for the foreseeable future the assumption , he added , has long been that when the court interprets a federal statute , congress can always come back in and fix the statute if it disagrees with the court now , however , the court s decisions are likely to be the last word , not the first word , on what a statute means the justices are alert to their increasing power over the constitutionality of the centerpiece of president obama s , justice antonin scalia mused about what should happen if the key provision were struck down \( , of course \) leaving the balance of the law in place so that congress could revise it as it saw fit would not work , he said you ca n't repeal the rest of the act , he said , because you 're not going to get 60 votes in the senate to repeal the rest if congress is incapable of responding to supreme court decisions with overrides , it may react in other ways , notably through the confirmation process the big question , professor hasen wrote , is whether the increasing partisan opposition to supreme court nominees on ideological grounds will lead senators to begin to consider filibustering supreme court nominees from the other party
bellefonte , pa stood in court tuesday in his current uniform , the bright red jumpsuit of the centre county jail no longer was he in his coaching gear , nor in the suit and tie he wore at his trial in june he was , in a sense , as powerless before his victims as they had once been before him so he sat , forced to listen we both know exactly what happened , said one of three victims who stood and spoke another said i am troubled with flashbacks of his naked body , something that will never be erased from my memory jerry has harmed children , of which i am one of them there is no punishment sufficient for you , the mother of another victim wrote in a statement read by the lead prosecutor another victim wrote there is no remorse there is no acknowledgment of regret , only evil the penn state sexual abuse scandal does not have many chapters left the former football coach joe paterno is dead , his name tainted by a formal investigative finding that he failed to respond to warnings of mr sandusky s crimes , even chose to cover them up the university s president , graham b spanier , has been dismissed the university s football program has been sanctioned the victims are seeking money , and penn state has acknowledged it will have to pay but there was the matter of setting mr sandusky s term in prison for 45 counts of abuse , and judge john m cleland addressed that business with emphatic scorn he sentenced mr sandusky to 30 to 60 years i'm not going to sentence you to centuries , judge cleland said to sandusky it makes no sense for a 68yearold man this sentence will put you in prison for the rest of your life judge cleland added that the case , which shook penn state and called into question the role of major college sports on campus , was , in the end , a story of betrayal you abused the trust of those who trusted you , he said mr sandusky entered the courtroom just before 9 am , looking thinner than he had at his trial he took his seat and turned , smiled and waved to his wife , dottie he soon gave a rambling , 15minute statement in court , in which he professed his innocence , as he had in a broadcast on a penn state radio station monday night i did not do these alleged disgusting acts , he said tuesday mr sandusky was convicted in june of sexually abusing 10 boys , all from disadvantaged homes mr sandusky used his connections to the penn state football program , as well as his own charity for disadvantaged youths , the second mile , to identify potential victims , get close to them and then sexually violate them mr sandusky s remarks tuesday at times resembled a pregame motivational speech , perhaps reflecting his years as a widely admired defensive assistant for mr paterno casting himself in the role of an underdog fighting against a conspiracy to find him guilty , mr sandusky mentioned that seabiscuit was one of his favorite movies he read aloud a letter from a boy who described mr sandusky as a savior for his life and called him touchdown jerry and he emphasized how he brought joy to children through activities like water balloon fights he also painted a picture of his life in prison he used his small cell , with four concreteblock walls , as a metaphor on his 46th wedding anniversary , he said , he rolled over in bed expecting his wife to be there instead , he literally hit the wall he became emotional when discussing how he had not been able to see his family and when he declared that he and his family would continue to smile despite his conviction and sentencing because that s who we are , his voice caught others were not so moved his statement today was a masterpiece in banal selfdelusion , completely untethered from reality and without any acceptance of responsibility , said joseph e mcgettigan iii , the lead prosecutor it was entirely selffocused , as if he , him , were the victim it was , in short , ridiculous judge cleland deemed mr sandusky s statement unbelievable mr sandusky s crimes have exacted a tremendous toll on penn state within days after the indictment of mr sandusky was made public in november 2011 , mr paterno , the football team s longtime head coach and a patriarchal figure at the university , was fired he had been alerted to at least one of mr sandusky s attacks on a boy two and a half months later , mr paterno died of cancer at 85 meanwhile , the penn state community found itself confronting the idea that it had placed the interests of its football team above concern for children at risk a sevenmonth investigation conducted by louis j freeh , a former director of the fbi , determined that penn state s leaders most prominently mr spanier , mr paterno , the former university vice president gary schultz and athletic director tim curley had disregarded the welfare of sandusky s victims four of sandusky s victims are suing the university , as is mike mcqueary , a former assistant who testified to seeing what he thought was mr sandusky raping a boy in a shower on penn state s campus in 2001 mr mcqueary claims the university has mistreated him since mr sandusky s actions became public mr curley , who is on leave , and mr schultz , a former senior vice president , are scheduled to stand trial in january on charges of perjury and failing to report child sexual abuse , relating to the attack mr mcqueary reported in 2001 mr sandusky s lawyers said they would appeal his case , arguing most strenuously that they were not given enough time to prepare his defense before the trial one of them was asked tuesday if mr sandusky could have pleaded

members of congress used to be embarrassed when they could not perform their basic job of passing spending bills and instead had to finance the government with a series of shortterm resolutions but such patchwork has now become commonplace , and it is a sign of washington s profound dysfunction that the shortterm agreement reached on tuesday came as a relief to both sides to keep the government running through march , preventing it from shutting down when the fiscal year ends on sept 30 with congress polarized and paralyzed by the coming election , no regular appropriations bills have been enacted , and none will be before the deadline the prospect of a shutdown was a real one because house republicans broke with the senate last year on the size of the federal budget for the 2013 fiscal year , the two chambers passed a measure setting discretionary spending at 1047 trillion for 2013 but to make one of its periodic points about excessive spending , off that amount in march , much of which , pell grants and state aid at the time , many house conservatives said that they relished a confrontation with the senate , hoping the threat of a shutdown would give them the cuts they wanted after all , it worked the year before when republicans cynically used the deadline to wring nearly 40 billion in cuts from the 2012 budget the withdrawal of that much spending helped neutralize the stimulative effects of the previous year s payroll tax cut , keeping the economy stagnant the difference this year is the november election wiser republican leaders knew that a shutdown crisis in september would leave a bad taste with voters , many of whom \( correctly \) tend to blame these kinds of things on their party so the lawmakers agreed on a continuing resolution that will keep the spending limit at 1047 trillion far lower than it should be when the economy needs a boost , but at least it s not making things worse the white house signed on , and the resolution is supposed to be passed after the august recess both parties are hoping the outcome of the election will give them an advantage when the agreement has to be renegotiated next year but stalemate is still the most likely outcome as long as voters keep electing republican lawmakers who are unwilling to compromise on spending and taxes representative one of the few moderate republicans left in the house , made that clear on tuesday when he said he could n't take it anymore and would not seek reelection after nine terms there are people on the right and the left who think that if you compromise you 're a coward , you 're a facilitator , you 're an appeaser , he said , adding that people are more interested in fighting with each other than they are in getting the nobrainers done and governing that kind of common sense will be missed

several of s former teammates , including george hincapie , the rider who was by his side for all of his seven victories , have agreed to testify in the s case against armstrong and several of his associates , two people close to the investigation said levi leipheimer , christian vande velde and david zabriskie american riders who are now competing in the tour de france are also scheduled to be witnesses for the antidoping agency , which last week charged armstrong with doping and playing a key role in a doping conspiracy while on the united states postal service and discovery channel teams the two people with knowledge of the case insisted on anonymity because the investigation was continuing none of those riders responded thursday to efforts to contact them at the tour on thursday , hincapie neither confirmed nor denied his role in the case and said his team has nothing to do with this i feel like i 've always done the right thing for the sport , said hincapie , a fivetime olympian who is riding in his 17th tour , adding that he sympathizes with armstrong i'm sad he is going through this , he said he s done so many things for the sport his accomplishments are incredible armstrong , who retired from cycling last year and denies ever doping , has until monday to tell the antidoping agency if he is challenging or accepting the charges that carry a lifetime ban from olympic sports , according to his spokesman , mark fabiani armstrong also could ask for a fiveday extension if he contests the charges , the case will go to an arbitration hearing if he loses , he could be stripped of his seven tour titles armstrong complained on his twitter feed thursday that some of his former teammates received immunity for providing the antidoping agency with information that incriminates him come in and tell usantidoping exactly what they wanted to hear in exchange for immunity , anonymity and an opportunity to continue to race the biggest event in cycling , he said he added that the riders in question are also victims of usantidoping s unfair process and antics travis tygart , chief executive of the antidoping agency , would not comment on the case s potential witnesses , which the agency has said include more than 10 cyclists who have firsthand knowledge of armstrong s doping and involvement in a doping conspiracy also charged are armstrong s former team manager , johan bruyneel armstrong s former trainer , michele ferrari two team doctors and a team trainer tygart said in a statement that any potential witnesses could face unnecessary scrutiny , threats and intimidation it is important to remember that the truth would often be suppressed without witnesses who at great cost to themselves are willing to tell the truth under oath about what they saw and experienced , and any attempt to circumvent the proper procedures in order to bully or silence people who may or may not be witnesses cannot be tolerated , he said tygart said that no individual cyclists had yet been punished in connection with the armstrong case , contrary to a report thursday in the dutch newspaper de telegraaf that report said that hincapie , leipheimer , vande velde , zabriskie and jonathan vaughters , a former armstrong teammate who now runs the garminsharp team , arranged a deal with the antidoping agency to serve sixmonth suspensions for their own doping in connection with a suspected conspiracy those suspensions would begin in september , the newspaper said the garminsharp team , which is known for its stalwart stance on antidoping , said in a statement that reports of suspensions are untrue hincapie , leipheimer , vande velde and zabriskie , who all were on the 2008 olympic cycling team , last month pulled their names from usa cycling s pool of riders being considered for the london games because of their involvement in the case , the two people close to the investigation said floyd landis , who was stripped of his 2006 tour title for doping , and tyler hamilton , who admitted to doping and said he played a part in the postal service doping conspiracy , will also be a part of the antidoping agency s case , the two people said but neither has the credibility of hincapie , leipheimer , vande velde or zabriskie , riders who also were once a part of armstrong s inner circle hincapie , vande velde and zabriskie have never tested positive for doping or admitted to any doping \( leiphemier tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine at the 1996 united states amateur national criterium championships and said it was because of the use of allergy medicine he was stripped of his victory \) of all those riders , hincapie s testimony might be the most damaging in cycling circles , he is called big george , a man who stands out in the peloton for his 6foot3 frame , and more so for his loyalty to the cyclists he has helped reach the top of the sport he has made his living as a domestique , a worker bee who helps the team leader win by protecting him from the wind , from attacks by other teams , and from anything else that could get in the way of the top rider s success he has ushered three riders to nine tour victories if he appears on the witness stand against lance , i'm sure it will be terribly conflicting for him , but it is going to be historic because cycling s code of silence will truly be broken , said joe papp , a former pro cyclist and convicted steroid traffickerturnedantidoping advocate he has the reputation as an allamerican cleancut guy who defines everything that is good about this country he just carries that much weight as far as the credibility he has with respect to lance , he is unimpeachable hincapie s word would be especially harmful for armstrong , considering the two have said they are as close as brothers like andy pettitte , who testified against his friend roger clemens at clemens s perjury trial , hincapie is likely to be a reluctant witness , and thus might seem even more credible hincapie also cooperated with the federal authorities in their nowdefunct investigation of armstrong and dopingrelated crimes , according to two lawyers involved in the case who did not want their names published credibility and believability is always critical in these situations , and longtime friendship and knowledge play into that , said carl tobias , a law professor at the university of richmond if you have one compelling witness , it s much better than one or two about whom you have doubts
st paul , va like so many others in appalachia , amelia trent s vote is tied to , and when it comes to the coal industry and her economic future , ms trent does not trust  obama is scary he s a muslim , ms trent said matteroffactly , but incorrectly , outside the small law firm here where she works as a secretary on the other hand , she said she could never vote for he does n't know what poor is or the struggling middle class , which is what we are around here but ms trent , 59 , knows and likes former gov , the democrat contending for the seat of senator jim webb , a fellow democrat who is retiring she said she would vote for him over former senator , a republican trying to win his seat back in a neckandneck race that could decide which party controls the senate of more than a dozen competitive senate races this year , none appear as close as the contest in virginia for both mr kaine and mr allen , the search for people like ms trent who say their vote for senator is not tied to their vote for president has become imperative the state appears deadlocked between mr obama and mr romney a quinnipiac university poll released on thursday had the presidential candidates even at 44 percent support in the state , a situation consistent with recent national polls \( the poll also showed the senate race tied \) and neither senate candidate wants his fate dependent on his party s presidential standardbearer in this hunt for voters , however , mr kaine sees an edge , if only a small one he was mr obama s handpicked democratic national committee chairman , and he has made no real effort to distance himself from the president last weekend , he stood side by side with mr obama as the president barnstormed virginia still , mr kaine portrays himself as a bipartisan problem solver in the mold of virginia s other senator , mark warner , another democrat who courted both parties while serving as governor mr kaine has tried to appeal to swing voters in the washington suburbs , including moderate republicans , with his record on issues in the region and his time as a moderate mayor of richmond could still appeal to some republicans there his language is carefully chosen at a roundtable discussion in bristol , hard on the tennessee border , mr kaine told attendees from both parties i 'll make this promise to you if i'm elected , i will be a partner with the president , whoever it is mr allen , by contrast , has made mr obama and mr kaine s close connection to him issue no 1 in recent advertisements , including one first shown last week , mr allen has sought a bipartisan sheen , but his record has a harder edge than his opponent s , including his famous pledge at the 1994 state republican convention to knock virginia democrats' soft teeth down their whiny throats asked whether she could envision someone who would vote for mr romney and also for mr kaine , nancy steele , a republican bedandbreakfast manager who attended mr kaine s bristol meeting , paused and then said no asked if she could see an obamaallen voter , she laughed and said , never ! but mr kaine said he thought he could appeal to those who vote for mr romney there will be thousands of romneykaine voters , mr kaine said over a milkshake in bristol whether it will be 2 , 000 or 50 , 000 , i do n't know kaine campaign aides say the mother lode of romneykaine voters is not in the less populated country roads of southwestern virginia but in the suburbs of washington and richmond there , some voters may see mr kaine and mr romney as probusiness technocrats and mr allen and mr obama as partisan flag carriers for their parties but mr kaine is searching for them across this diverse state the trip to bristol last week was his third he has also been to the conservative southwestern towns of castlewood , wise and blacksburg , and he is planning another trip this month , to a health clinic at the wise county fairgrounds no one expects the democrat to win this area , but he cannot afford to be blown out there s some tough real estate in this state , mr kaine said , and this is some tough real estate the allen campaign believes that mr kaine is facing a rout in coal country , where many white workingclass voters are suspicious of mr obama s intentions for coal to distance himself from the president , mr kaine would have to offer vocal opposition of the sort that senator joe manchin , democrat of west virginia , displayed in an advertisement that showed him firing a rifle at an obama energy bill , said chris lacivita , a longtime virginia republican campaign adviser but that will not happen politics and campaigns are n't waged in a vacuum , and tim kaine has two years as chairman of the dnc , where he was the coal killer s biggest cheerleader , mr lacivita said mr kaine s approach is to mix his pitch for bipartisanship with localized boasts about his record as governor , a record that he hopes will differentiate him from the president a key to that record is the looming virginia city hybrid energy center , a stateoftheart 585megawatt coalfired power plant on the outskirts of st paul that started commercial operations on thursday mr kaine mentions the plant virtually everywhere he goes as an antidote to efforts to link him to obama administration policies that have been tough on coal he does not pander in bristol on friday , he said that human activity was warming the planet , and that the country needed to transition to cleaner sources of energy but he also said he helped make the huge coal plant in the mountains above bristol happen as governor the plant is proof , he said , that coal and cleanair regulations can coexist my advice is , do n't try to weaken regulations , he told voters in southwestern virginia last week sell your story say we can meet these standards there is not much evidence that such nuance will break through the hostility that regulations under mr obama have engendered here talk of an obama war on coal saturates the airwaves , and in an area already down on its luck , such talk breeds fear it s probably coal that keeps everything going , said betty mcmillan , 73 if that goes , it all goes in more than a dozen interviews in st paul , no one was familiar with any role that mr kaine had in getting the plant going as recently as march , the former governor toured the plant in a campaign swing it did not seem to make an impression i did the permitting , and i do n't remember that , jeff kite , 44 , an environmental engineer , said about mr kaine s role mr kite said that regulations by the environmental protection agency had kept him gainfully employed , because businesses hire him to help them comply with federal standards but , he said , they are just killing permitting there s no coal mining , no new transportation he s really hurt the economy , mr kite said of the president hank banner , 43 , a democrat who is the baseball coach at the university of virginia s college at wise , sat with mr kite , waiting for lunch at giovanni s pizza , one of the few restaurants still open on st paul s quiet main street mr obama will not win virginia , mr banner said , shaking his head folks he got in '08 he s not going to get this time , he said but , he was quick to add , mr kaine could win among democrats in bristol , word that not even the residents of st paul knew of mr kaine s role in the giant plant elicited concern energy produced in virginia is a mainstay of mr allen s campaign , and his drumbeat on the issue appears to be taking root among voters at mr kaine s bristol roundtable discussion , he was peppered with pointed questions about drilling off the virginia coast , natural gas exploration and coal are you in complete alignment with president obama , who said he wanted to go on and bankrupt the coal industry \? ken kistner , 77 , asked with real bite , not backing off when mr kaine said he had never heard that that led to mr kaine s embracing steps against , talking up clean energy and describing his role in starting the plant outside st paul told no one in the town knew of that role , jerry mathews , 76 , a democrat at the bristol event , said with a sigh , that s a problem bob bruce , 65 , a retired pharmaceutical representative , said , he probably needs to pound his chest a bit more
after more than a decade of having american blood spilled in afghanistan , with nearly six years lost to president george w bush s disastrous indifference , it is time for united states forces to leave afghanistan on a schedule dictated only by the security of the troops it should not take more than a year the united states will not achieve even president obama s narrowing goals , and prolonging the war will only do more harm vice president joseph biden jr said on friday that we are leaving afghanistan in 2014 , period there is no ifs , ands or buts mr obama indicated earlier that this could mean the end of 2014 either way , two more years of combat , two more years of sending the 1 percent of americans serving in uniform to die and be wounded , is too long administration officials say they will not consider a secure logistical withdrawal , but they offer no hope of achieving broad governance and security goals and the only final mission we know of , to provide security for a 2014 afghan election , seems dubious at best and more likely will only lend american approval to a thoroughly corrupt political system  this conclusion represents a change on our part the war in afghanistan had powerful support at the outset , including ours , after the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 after mr bush s years of neglect , we believed that a new president , barack obama , was doing the right thing by at least making an effort he set goals that made sense first , a counterinsurgency campaign , steppedup attacks on al qaeda , then an attempt to demolish the taliban s military power , promote democratic governance in kabul and build an afghan army capable of exerting control over the country but it is now clear that if there ever was a chance of victory in afghanistan , it evaporated when american troops went off to fight the pointless war in iraq while some progress has been made , the idea of fully realizing broader democratic and security aims simply grows more elusive meanwhile , more than 2 , 000 american troops have died in this war , more than 50 of them recently in growing attacks by afghan forces , and many thousands more have been maimed the war has now cost upward of 500 billion representative paul ryan , the republican vicepresidential nominee , said at the debate on thursday we do n't want to lose the gains we 've gotten we want to make sure that the taliban does n't come back in more fighting will not consolidate the modest gains made by this war , and there seems little chance of guaranteeing that the taliban do not come back in , at least in the provinces where they have never truly been dislodged last month , militants struck a heavily fortified nato base officials say the pakistanbased haqqani network is behind many of the attacks on americans americans are desperate to see the war end and the 68 , 000 remaining troops come home president obama has not tasked military commanders with recommending a pace for the withdrawal until after the election he and the coalition partners have committed to remain engaged in afghanistan after 2014 at reduced levels , which could involve 15 , 000 or more american troops to carry out specialized training and special operations mr obama , or mitt romney if he wins , will have a hard time convincing americans that makes sense let alone afghans the military may yet ask for tens of thousands more troops , which would be a serious mistake to increase the odds for a more manageable transition and avert an economic collapse , in economic aid through 2015 that is a commitment worth keeping , but the united states and its allies have tried nation building in afghanistan , at least for the last four years it is not working  the task is to pack up without leaving behind arms that terrorists want and cannot easily find elsewhere \( like stinger missiles \) or hightech equipment \( like predator drones \) that can be reverse engineered by pakistan or other potential foes the military can blow those things up if it must it is hard to be exact about a timetable since the pentagon and nato refuse to discuss it the secretary of defense , leon panetta , told us last week that decisions about the timetable would be made after the military command reported to mr obama in december he would not say much of anything beyond that whether the withdrawal would be frontloaded , or backloaded , or how many troops would be needed to secure the election some experts say a secure withdrawal would take at least six months , and possibly a year but one year is a huge improvement over two it would be one less year of having soldiers die or come home with wounds that are terrifying , physically and mentally suicides among veterans and those in active service reached unacceptable levels long ago a recent article by the associated press quoted studies estimating that 45 percent of returning veterans from iraq and afghanistan are claiming disability benefits a quarter of those veterans 300 , 000 to 400 , 000 , depending on the study say they suffer from some form of posttraumatic stress disorder this is far too high a price to go on asking of troops and their families four years ago , mr obama called afghanistan a war we have to win his strategy relied on a newly trained afghan army and police force that could take over fighting the taliban a government competent to deliver basic services and pakistan s cooperation here is what happened nato and the pentagon built an afghan army and police force of nearly 352 , 000 that is now nominally in the lead for providing security in most of the country attrition rates are high and morale is low the attacks on coalition forces have eroded trust and slowed the training afghan leaders have to work harder with washington to weed out corrupt troops and taliban infiltrators , but the nation cannot hang its hopes on that happening there is an agreement to finance the army to 2017 with kabul paying 500 million , washington about 25 billion and other donors about 13 billion if kabul keeps its commitments , the donors should make good on theirs the taliban have not retaken territory they lost to coalition forces , but kandahar and helmand provinces , the taliban base and the main focus of the 2010 surge , remain heavily contested a pentagon report in may said taliban attacks in kandahar from last october through march rose by 13 percent over the same period a year earlier william byrd , an afghan expert at the united states institute of peace , said , the most that probably can be hoped is that the army continues to hold kabul and other major cities it is not likely to ever become an effective counterinsurgency force president hamid karzai s weak and corrupt government , awash in billions of dollars , continues to alienate afghans and make the taliban an attractive alternative mr karzai recently chose asadullah khalid , a man accused of torture and drug trafficking , to take over the country s main intelligence agency dozens of karzai family members and allies have taken government jobs , pursued business interests or worked as contractors to the united states government a recent report by afghanistan s central bank said the afghan political elite had been using kabul bank as a piggy bank in 2010 , word that the bank had lost 300 million caused a panic , and the number later tripled to win pledges of continued aid at an international donors conference in july , president karzai promised to crack down on corruption and make political reforms , but he has done little the aid sustaining his government is at risk if he fails we doubt that he will exercise real leadership for now , he has proved himself to be not only unreliable , but a force undermining american goals and afghans' interests in 2009 and 2010 , mr karzai s supporters tried to defraud the national elections with elections scheduled for 2014 , the question is whether mr karzai will keep his vow to abide by the constitution and leave when his term is up he needs to make sure the parliament and the government put in place an electoral system that encourages competent candidates to run and enables a broadly accepted election with international monitors all sides are lagging \( there has been even less progress in restoring local governance , the bedrock of afghan society , where the taliban exert enduring influence \) mr obama wants to use american troops to provide logistical assistance and security at the elections there were real threats to voters' lives in the first posttaliban elections , but the real threat to democracy is from corruption , not bombs mr karzai stole the last election , and he got away with it with american forces in place after giving him 10 years and lots of money , things keep going in the wrong direction why would this now change \? after some bitter disputes , pakistan began cooperating with the united states again in june by reopening a critical supply route to afghanistan american officials say the pakistanis may have decided that sowing chaos in afghanistan by supporting taliban proxies is not in their interest after all this could be wishful thinking last week , the pentagon blamed the pakistanibacked haqqani network for some of the recent green on blue attacks islamabad s collusion with the taliban and other extremist groups is the biggest threat to afghan stability the united states has a huge interest in a less destructive pakistan , a nucleararmed country of 170 million that supports jihad in afghanistan , kashmir and indian cities but there is reason to argue that america s leverage with pakistan on security matters is limited by its need for pakistani bases , border crossings and intelligence on the taliban if tens of thousands of american troops were removed from landlocked afghanistan , that might actually allow the united states to hang tougher with islamabad pakistan officials might not listen , but at least the united states could be more honest about what the pakistanis were doing to worsen the threat of terrorism and insurgency  we are not arguing that everything will work out well after the united states leaves afghanistan it will not the taliban will take over parts of the pashtun south , where they will brutalize women and trample their rights warlords will go on stealing afghanistan will still be the world s secondpoorest country al qaeda may make inroads , but since 9 11 it has established itself in yemen and many other countries america s global interests suffer when it is mired in unwinnable wars in distant regions dwight eisenhower helped the country s position in the world by leaving korea richard nixon by leaving vietnam president obama by leaving iraq none of these places became jeffersonian democracies but the united states was better off for leaving postamerican afghanistan is likely to be more presentable than north korea , less presentable than iraq and perhaps about the same as vietnam but it fits the same pattern of damaging stalemate we need to exit as soon as we safely can
when representative rick crawford this week broke with his republican party and proposed a millionaire s surtax , it was hailed in some circles as a crack in the ice that could turn into a significant breach so far not so much , he says mr crawford , a freshman from arkansas , offered democrats a deal a 5 percent surtax on incomes greater than 1 million in exchange for passage of a balanced budget amendment but it has been republicans who have been responding , and mr crawford conceded that it has not been pretty the response thus far has been mostly negative with many conservatives calling for my head , he said in an email i ve had donors threaten to stop giving , and my staff has received a few acerbic emails but this does not deter me because the alternative is economic calamity , taxes that will be much higher than they are today , and most likely a compromise that includes tax increases coupled with temporary spending cuts mr crawford said that a few republicans had privately told him they liked the idea , but that none would go public i think they want to see how well i fare in the fiery furnace , he said mr crawford s proposal comes just days before republicans on the house budget committee are set to unveil a spending and tax blueprint that they say will head off fiscal calamity the committee chairman , representative paul ryan , republican of wisconsin , offered a bit of a drum roll on thursday with a video of himself walking the halls of a house office building , assuring viewers that republicans were taking the tough decisions to head off what he called the most predictable crisis in the nation s history what if your president , your senator and your congressman knew a crisis was coming \? he asks solemnly what if they knew why it was happening \? what if they knew what they needed to do to stop it from happening \? what if they had the time to stop it \? and what if they chose to do nothing about it \? what would you think of that person \? democrats snapped back that mr ryan and his party had caused the crisis with deep tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 that they now refuse to reverse , even in part it was that impasse that mr crawford said he hoped to break , with 400 billion in deficit reduction through tax increases on the very wealthy , coupled with the longsought amendment to the constitution requiring a balanced budget he conceded that there is zero chance his proposal will make it into the house budget , nor does he much care , since the budget is a nonbinding document and he wants a law he also said bipartisan groups like the socalled gang of six in the senate were working on deficit reduction plans that would ultimately raise taxes anyway without a balanced budget amendment conservatives can howl at me if they choose , he said in his email but ultimately they will end up with higher taxes and no permanent spending reform mr crawford s northeastern arkansas district , like much of the state , may be trending republican , but it is not the safest of congressional seats he took it in 2010 after the retirement of representative marion berry , a democrat the seat had been in democratic hands since 1875 , but for a single year when it went to the labor party of lewis p featherstone the democratic congressional campaign committee has already begun advertising against him

found his initial love for new york exactly the way you would expect a young boy from the paris suburbs might through an abiding affection for the rap group nwa and an emotional connection to a shiny coat growing up in les ulis in the late 1980s and early 1990s , henry and many of his friends were enamored with the rap group that included ice cube , dr dre , eazye , dj yella and mc ren music videos of groups from the united states were popular internationally , and henry was especially fascinated with the los angeles raiders paraphernalia that the members of nwa often wore he distinctly recalls being intrigued by the logos on the snapback jackets , made by starter , that fast became an urban trend when henry was 13 , his father , antoine , came home one day with a jacket for him antoine henry had seen his son salivating over mc ren s look but did not find a raiders jacket instead , he offered one that was blue , white and red it was a new york giants jacket at first i was like , what is this \? ' and then i was like , i wanted the black one like nwa has ! ' henry said but then at school , someone asked me about it , and of course i acted like i knew all about it and then the giants won the that year , and suddenly , it was an amazing present from that point on , henry adopted the giants as his american football team , and he followed them casually as his soccer career blossomed a curious soul , henry traveled the world because of his ability to make magic with a ball at his feet , playing first for teams in monaco france and turin , italy , then for juggernauts in london and in barcelona , spain he scored more than 300 goals in europe , won two golden shoe awards as the continent s top scorer and earned a world cup champion s medal with france in 1998 always , though , he thought of new york henry first visited the city in 1996 and found himself continually coming back during offseasons or breaks in his schedule each time , he would try to stay in a different part of manhattan , experimenting with hotels on the upper west or east sides for one trip , then going downtown the next time he returned for a man with a professed love for the smell of concrete , the city was intoxicating i knew i would live here someday , he said in july 2010 , he made the leap at 32 , henry left behind a european career that many believe would have continued to thrive , exchanging it for a place in , a contract with the red bulls and , perhaps most of all , the ending he always craved henry has lived in or near big cities his entire life , has walked trafalgar square and the avinguda diagonal he speaks so many languages that sometimes , when he is trying to order his pasta al dente , he will lapse into spanish instead of italian when asked , he usually finds it hard to rank one city ahead of another but with new york it is different now , two years settled in the city he long desired , henry is , in his own words , at peace london will always be special because that is where his daughter lives , but new york has been everything he wanted a stage , a cave , an alley and a palace , all at once it is home in a lot of ways , he said but it is more than that i have seen a lot of places , and for me , it is the best city in the world one weekend afternoon this spring , henry left his soho apartment , headed west on his bicycle and rode uptown along the hudson river no one , besides his doorman , recognized him no one ran up asking for an autograph no one bothered him for henry , it was the latest example of his personal bliss he slips in and out of his place on crosby street , able to disappear into the chaos of the village if he wants and to take his 7yearold daughter to sarabeth s for cupcakes when she is in town without creating a major media incident these things would never happen in europe , henry said , never in a million years never , never , never it was not always this way playing for arsenal , henry lived in a mansion in north london and , like all soccer stars in britain , could not avoid the limelight even recently , when he decided to renovate his house there a sizable construction that included the installation of a fourstory aquarium it drew copious news media attention in barcelona , it was worse one of his first nights there after he joined the team in 2007 , henry went out to dinner with a friend the next day , he picked up the newspaper , and his meal had been recounted , in excruciating detail , for all the world to see they had what i ate , who i was with , what i drank , what time i arrived , what time i left all of it , henry said did i have cheese or no \? what kind of cheese was it \? he laughed i do n't know how i can put into words what it was like to play in barcelona , he said it s like if i said , imagine that there are only the yankees in new york' just the yankees none of the other teams , just that team and only those players for people to care about henry s overall new york existence is hardly run of the mill after all , he s got a car , a parking space and a reportedly 1485 million triplex , each of which puts him in a relative manhattan minority but his daytoday life is gloriously typical he orders in he peoplewatches he sits in a coffee shop or a bar he goes to as many shows as he can \( two of his favorites chicago and the lion king \) , and he lounges on the couch watching sports on television the nba is a passion , particularly the san antonio spurs spurs guard tony parker , another frenchman , is one of henry s close friends , and the two have occasionally played basketball together in their most recent oncourt meeting , henry became irritated because he thought parker was taking it too easy on him i was trying to play , and he was toying with me , henry said i said , come on , play properly , ' and i had n't even finished my sentence and he was already making a layup behind me henry , like many new yorkers , is also passionate about food his preferred cuisine is from the west indies \( his mother is from martinique , his father from guadeloupe \) , but he has struggled to find a consistently good representation of mom s food , as he called it , in new york the closest thing might be cuban food for us , he said still , henry has an expansive palate asked for his preferred plates , he ticked them off italian , dim sum , caribbean , tapas , spanish before stopping suddenly ohhh , mexican , he said how could i forget \? the corn on the cob at la esquina might be my favorite thing in the entire city i do n't know what they put on it , but even if they told me it s something bad , i will still eat it his fondness for elote aside , perhaps the moment when henry truly became a new yorker is when he felt genuine sadness after learning about the closing of his beloved korean barbecue restaurant , woo lae oak he loved the bibimbap there and the kimchi , too but like any manhattanite , he was also attracted to the restaurant because of its location it was right across from the mercer hotel and right near my apartment , he said it was beautiful go , eat , two minutes and you are right back home to those less familiar with the global soccer landscape , the strangest part of henry s existence in new york may be the backlash he endured after deciding to come here unlike in baseball or banking or acting , new york is hardly the center of the universe when it comes to the world s most popular game in truth , it is barely in the universe at all henry played for monaco , juventus and arsenal , and won six trophies with barcelona in 2009 his speed and scoring touch were in good form at the end of the 2010 european season , and even if he left barcelona , there was no reason to believe he would not continue to have success somewhere else in europe but henry did not want to stay in europe he even told his agent not to listen to any offers from european clubs , however lucrative they might be some observers speculated that henry s decision had to do with the heaping criticism he took after his memorable handball that was not called in a critical french qualifier for the 2010 world cup , while others guessed that henry was fed up with the racism he and other black players sometimes encountered from european fans there was also a theory that henry was simply anticipating his own decline and attempting to fade away in a relatively quieter place when these theories were presented to him recently , henry shrugged why does it have to be so complicated \? he said i just wanted to carry on playing football , but i had enough of being in europe i wanted to finish my career and also have a life why is that difficult \? earlier this year , henry returned to arsenal on a twomonth loan during the mls offseason and scored two goals in seven appearances , dazzling british fans again to many , the spell gave credence to henry s assertion that he was hardly finished as a european player rather , he was just finished , by choice , as a player in europe with the red bulls , henry has done his best to be a leader he is the team s captain and , while clearly possessing a vastly different history , and financial position , than his teammates , he does his best to fit in he does a good job of showing what has made him so successful , said midfielder dax mccarty , who is in his seventh mls season he s very casual he s a funny guy he likes to joke around , and i think that s something everyone in the locker room appreciates i think if he was introverted , guys would be intimidated henry generally welcomes banter and bonding barbs about his accent and reliance on british idioms are often fodder for teammates something like , do you fancy lunch \? and henry is unafraid to defend himself they 'll get on me , and i 'll say how do you want me to say it to you \? it s english learn it , ' henry said i lived in england , and the language is called english , yes \? so do n't have a go at me because i am saying it right henry is similarly blunt when discussing his impact on soccer in the united states unlike other international players who have come here , henry makes no grand statements about imminent transformations in the sport s popularity yes , he would like to help grow the game and yes , he would like desperately to lead the red bulls to their first league title winning is always first with me , he said always but he remains realistic overcoming the popularity of the nfl or major league baseball is something that even a transplanted new yorker like henry knows is virtually impossible after all , he plays in a market where one night earlier this season the red bulls played a game on the same night that the yankees , mets , knicks and rangers all had games on television , too there were five new york teams on television at the same time what can you do about that \? henry said how do you compete with 100 years of history in these other sports \? in the other sports , people can say , do you remember that series from years ago \? that big hit \? ' what can they say about mls \? do you remember yesterday \? still , he seems pleased with the progress henry said that the quality of play in mls was improving immensely and that the increase in soccerspecific stadiums was a critical development henry would not reveal how many more years he wanted to play , but he made it clear that he was very content that the final chapter of his career was taking place in new york at one point , he was asked if he ever worried that people would view his legacy negatively , focusing on the hand ball against ireland or the way he bolted europe for the united states unruffled , henry sounded like a new yorker with his response sure , they will remember those things , he said but i think they 'll remember the 300 goals , too , do n't you \?
you 're just jealous at least that s how mitt romney sees it the millionaire with the boys at bain capital with the long green clinched between their teeth and poking out of their collars and jackets now says that people who question what he did there , and what rich people do now , are just green with envy in his new hampshire victory speech on tuesday , romney lambasted his republican opponents \( who have raised real issues about his role at the private equity firm bain capital \) for following the lead of president obama , whom he described as a leader who divides us  the next day on today on nbc , romney defended the statement , rejecting the notion that there were questions about wall street behavior , saying the whole discussion was about class warfare he even went so far as to suggest that such talk should n't even be openly entertained when the interviewer asked , are there no fair questions about the distribution of wealth without it being seen as envy , though \? romney responded , i think it s fine to talk about those things and discussions about tax policy and the like in quiet rooms \? that s the problem too many have been too quiet for too long and , on this point , we must applaud the efforts of the occupy wall street movement it took income inequality and corporate responsibility out of the shadows and into the streets a report released on wednesday by the pew research center found that about twothirds of americans now perceive a strong conflict between the rich and poor in this country that was up 19 percentage points from 2009 in regard to the report , conflict between rich and poor now eclipses racial strain and friction between immigrants and the nativeborn as the greatest source of tension in american society and this has nothing to do with envy and everything to do with fairness elizabeth warren , who is now running for the senate seat that romney ran for in 1994 and did n't get , probably rebuts this myth of class warfare best by reframing the discussion in terms of a social contract between the rich and the rest of society at one of her campaign events ,  there is nobody in this country who got rich on his own nobody you built a factory out there , good for you but , i want to be clear you moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for you did n't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory and hire someone to protect against this because of the work the rest of us did now look , you built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea god bless keep a big hunk of it but part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along that is the corporate contract with america societal symbiosis we create a society in which smart , hardworking people can be safe and prosper , and they in turn reinvest a fair share of that prosperity back into society for posterity everyone benefits but somewhere along the way this got lost greed got good the rich wanted all of the societal benefits and none of the societal responsibilities they got addicted to seeing profits go up and taxes go down , by any means necessary , no matter the damage to the individual or the collective those maseratis were n't going to pay for themselves and the resulting income inequality helped to stall economic mobility as , many researchers have reached a conclusion that turns conventional wisdom on its head americans enjoy less economic mobility than their peers in canada and much of western europe the times report speculated that one reason for the mobility gap may be the depth of american poverty , which leaves poor children starting especially far behind another may be the unusually large premiums that american employers pay for college degrees since children generally follow their parents' educational trajectory , that premium increases the importance of family background and stymies people with less schooling indeed , a november report by the pew charitable trusts' economic mobility project pointed out , in the united states , there is a stronger link between parental education and children s economic , educational , and socioemotional outcomes than in any other country investigated pew has found that most children raised at the top of the income spectrum stay there and most raised at the bottom stay at the bottom an equal opportunity to success is central to this country s optimistic ethos , but income inequality and corporate greed are making a lie of that most basic american truism the rich and their handmaidens on the political right have consolidated america s wealth on the evernarrowing peak of a steep hill and greased the slope and they want to cast everyone at the bottom as lazy or jealous , without acknowledging the accident of birth and collusion of policies that helped grant them their perch income inequality is a threat to this country and the middle class that made her great if romney wants to be president , he needs to understand that as alan krueger , the chairman of the white house council of economic advisers , , i think it is clear that we ca n't go back to the type of policies that exacerbated the rise in inequality and threatened economic mobility in the first place if we want an economy that builds the middle class not envy mr romney opportunity
as the debate moves appropriately ! to a discussion of romney s career at bain , one thing i ve noticed is that everyone on the right , and a fair number of people who should know better , basically believes that gordon gekko was right before the gekkos came along , they assert , american business was sluggish , unproductive , and uncompetitive then came the lbos and all that , and our economic energy was unleashed as i said , everyone on the right knows that this happened needless to say , none of it is at all true let s look at how trends changed after 1980 or so , when the underlying rules of american business \( and politics \) shifted start with productivity i use a log scale , so that the slope of the trend represents the rate of growth see the big acceleration \? neither do i productivity growth has actually been slower since the rise of baintype operators ah , but competitiveness we began selling competitively on world markets instead of running big trade deficits , right \? well , no so did anything change \? why , yes income distribution became radically more unequal and that , i think , explains why everyone on the right knows , just knows , that great things happened after the forces of greed were unleashed great things did indeed happen to their patrons for ordinary americans , not so much
indianapolis a common question being asked of players on the giants and the new england patriots this week is an obvious one what are the similarities between this season s teams and the ones that played each other four years ago in super bowl xlii \? if you ask running back brandon jacobs , the current giants are quite different none at all , jacobs said wednesday when asked about the similarities to the 2007 squad it s tempting to compare the way the giants , who not that long ago were 77 , made their surprising run through the playoffs this season , and the way they advanced in the 2007 season , when they pulled off upsets against the dallas cowboys and the green bay packers before slaying the biggest beast of them all , the 180 patriots that team in 2007 we made it there and we played , and we played hard , jacobs said we took advantage of opportunity this time , we knew we could win the games that we won , and we knew we could make it here , and we re confident in saying that we re going to win this one , too he added , it s just a different team
the lost the first two games at home , barely scoring four runs in 21 innings , their captain and hits leader , , is moving on crutches , and they next face justin verlander , perhaps the best pitcher in baseball , in a critical game 3 in detroit the yankees' immediate prospects , to put it succinctly , are weak it s definitely not an ideal situation , alex rodriguez said you 'd rather be up 20 and facing a triplea pitcher that would be nice but we 've done it all year a lot of people counted us out , and we 've thrived on coming back and come back they must if they hope to advance to the world series after losing to the , , in a contentious game 2 on sunday at yankee stadium , the yankees trail detroit , two games to none , in the bestofseven american league championship series on sunday they wasted a brilliant performance from hiroki kuroda , whose stuff was absolutely wicked while he pitched on short rest for the first time in his career kuroda pitched valiantly , but the yankees managed only four hits and struck out 10 times in their last five games they have struck out 51 times , and now they will go up against verlander and max scherzer , who were nos 1 and 2 in the majors in strikeouts in the regular season the yankees are hitting only 205 in the playoffs and have scored two fewer runs , 20 , than the cincinnati reds , who were eliminated two games earlier we have to make adjustments , joe girardi said after sunday s loss they are not going to put it on a tee for us , we know that we are more than capable of scoring runs and have not done it a number of times this year girardi was already at the boiling point after the game in part because of his frustrations over the offensive difficulties , led by robinson cano , who is in an 0for26 slump , a singleyear postseason record but girardi was also fuming over a botched call by the secondbase umpire , jeff nelson , in the eighth inning that led to two tigers runs , and the ejection of girardi on his 48th birthday the tigers were leading , 10 , with two outs in the eighth omar infante was on first base when austin jackson singled to right off kuroda nick swisher scooped up the ball and threw behind infante to cano as infante tried to scamper back to the bag cano clearly applied the tag to infante s chest well before he touched the base , which should have ended the inning but even to infante s surprise , he was not called out i did something with my hand , infante said i think that s why he thought i was safe girardi argued briefly , to no avail , and one batter later avisail garcia singled to right off boone logan , scoring infante during a pitching change one batter later , girardi , who had watched the play on tape , argued more vehemently , saying , it was right there , how can you miss that \? and was ejected miguel cabrera then singled off joba chamberlain to extend detroit s lead to 30 there will undoubtedly be howls and protestations over the call but the bottom line , as girardi likes to say , is that the yankees still did not score a run , so it would be difficult to blame the missed call for the loss girardi , who made an impassioned plea for expanded instant replay after the game , did not see it that way , though there is more pressure on the pitchers when it is 10 in the eighth inning and your club is hitting than 30 , he said i would like to take my chances he was already taking his chances with a lineup that did not include jeter for the first time in the playoffs jeter , who led the majors with 216 hits in the regular season and had nine more in the playoffs , fractured his ankle in the 12th inning of the tigers' game 1 victory and is gone for the season he stayed away from the stadium on sunday so he could elevate his foot the impact of his loss seemed to be felt immediately the yankees had barely a sniff at scoring a run they had the same problems in game 1 until ichiro suzuki and raul ibanez hit tworun homers off the struggling closer jose valverde in the ninth inning valverde , who watched sunday as phil coke pitched the final two innings , is the only tigers pitcher to have given up a run in the series but kuroda matched the tigers pitch for pitch for a while there , i thought he was going to throw a nohitter , catcher russell martin said he had great stuff you really ca n't ask for anything more than he did with a plunging splitfinger fastball and a slider that skidded away from righthanded hitters , kuroda was perfect through five innings , and allowed only one hit through six he said he never thought about the fact that he was pitching on short rest because if he did , it might have affected him i felt kind of numb out there , kuroda said rather than feeling good or bad , i just wanted to be aggressive and get the next hitter numbness also seemed to be a prevailing sentiment for the frustrated fans filing out of yankee stadium , frustrated as the highest runproducing team in the regular season continues to look so inept in the playoffs as rodriguez had said , it is definitely not an ideal situation
omaha it takes gumption to walk up to someone you do not know and initiate a conversation that has never been a problem for the norfolk state assistant coach wilson washington , a former nets forward as an undergraduate at old dominion in the 1970s , the 6foot9 washington knew how to block shots but could not keep the ball inbounds so when the boston celtics great bill russell came to campus for a speaking engagement , washington , a transfer from maryland who had yet to play for the monarchs , approached him and asked how to do it he said the first thing you do is take emotion out of it , because you 're not trying to throw the ball to somebody in the stands you want to keep the ball in play , washington said it resonated with me i tried it , and my shot blocking went up there was more to the conversation the rugged washington relied on russell s insight through three productive seasons at old dominion , where his 363 blocks are second on the program s career list , behind mark west a secondround pick of the philadelphia 76ers in 1977 , washington played two seasons in the nba and nine in europe before coming home to work for 25 years in sales and management at a nissan dealership in chesapeake , va he never saw russell again but washington , 56 , is the conduit from russell to kyle o'quinn , norfolk state s 610 center o'quinn is one of eight players from new york city , with five more from new jersey prep schools , who propelled the spartans to their first ncaa tournament berth after 15 seasons in division 1 with o'quinn as the defensive catalyst , norfolk state \( 259 \) won its first mideastern athletic conference title for friday s ncaa second round the 15thseeded spartans drew no 2 seed missouri \( 304 \) , which runs a fourguard offense and starts only one player taller than 66 so norfolk will lean on o'quinn , a twotime conference defensive player of the year who averages 16 points , 10 rebounds and 3 blocks a game we can post up a little bit , norfolk coach anthony evans said but we think kyle is our best chance of creating mismatches against them hopefully , he can kick it out to shooters to make shots last season , before evans asked washington to join his staff parttime , washington walked up to o'quinn at a game , they had never met , and said you 're a good shot blocker but i can make you a better one o'quinn recognized washington , whose height , saltandpepper hair and goatee give him a bearing of authority he gave me a couple of tips about going into it with confidence , little tips he gave me that keep me in the game longer , o'quinn said o'quinn actually has fewer blocks this season \( 94 \) than last \( 110 \) , which washington attributed to o'quinn picking his spots better washington sat courtside after practice thursday and explained it one could almost hear russell s cadence in his voice you ca n't block everything , and you need to know which ones you can , washington said some blocked shot attempts leave the rest of the team vulnerable because you 're not where you 're supposed to be when you go after it you have to be very smart about it when it comes to kyle , he s extremely smart about it proper technique came from russell , too flick your wrist at the ball instead of hammering like a volleyball the best way to block a shot is to do it by surprise , washington said you take the guy who shot it out of the picture , and you just put your hand between a and b you know where it came from you know where it s going you put your hand somewhere up between there and hopefully things work out for you it s a very simple skill once you learn how to do it the brooklynborn evans and the assistant head coach robert jones who played at suny new paltz when evans was an assistant , and later coached at st mary s high school in manhasset , ny scoured the new york new jersey area for players while welcoming junior college and division 1 transfers norfolk s time here may be short only four no 15 seeds have beaten a no 2 since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985 , and none have done so since hampton beat iowa state in 1991 if it happens , washington could thank russell , if he knew how to reach him i would love to see him , washington said who knows \? if we go far enough in this tournament , maybe i 'll run across him somewhere that would be neat
tehran the first outbreak of public anger over s collapsing currency and other economic maladies jolted the heart of the capital on wednesday , with the riot police violently clamping down on blackmarket money changers , hundreds of citizens marching to demand relief and merchants in the sprawling bazaar closing their shops in protest iran s official news media said an unspecified number of people , including two europeans , had been arrested in the turmoil , which was documented in news photographs , at least two verifiable videos uploaded on youtube and witness accounts economists and political analysts in iran and abroad said the anger reflected the accumulated impact of harsh western economic sanctions over iran s disputed , as well as the government s inability to manage an increasingly acute economic crisis it came a day after iran s president , , said at a televised news conference that the plunge in the value of iran s currency , the rial which has fallen by 40 percent against the dollar this past week was orchestrated by ruthless currency speculators , the united states and other unspecified internal enemies of iran he urged people to stop selling their rials for dollars , a currency he once characterized as and warned that speculators faced arrest and punishment but mr ahmadinejad , whose stewardship of the economy has been increasingly challenged by other iranian politicians in the last year of his term , offered no new solutions to arrest the slide in the rial , which is a major inflationary threat and has become the most visible barometer of iran s economic travails because of the sanctions , iran is facing extreme difficulties in selling oil , its main export , and in repatriating dollars and other foreign currencies , because iran has been cut off from the global banking system unscripted protests in iran are highly unusual , particularly since the political opposition in the country was crushed after mr ahmadinejad s disputed reelection in 2009 iran experts said the outbreak on wednesday was significant because it appeared to offer an insight into the degree of public weariness it may not be widespread yet , but it demonstrates not just unhappiness with the ahmadinejad government , but also dissatisfaction with the islamic republic s failure to stem the economic crisis brought about by incompetence , mismanagement and sanctions , said alireza nader , a political analyst at the rand corporation , a research and consulting firm he said that the regime is going to face much greater instability in the future , especially if it loses the support of iran s business and merchant class gary hufbauer , a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington , said in an audio commentary on the group s that the sanctions had effectively halved iran s oil exports , choked its ability to import essential goods and left its currency worth a fraction of its value compared with early this year these are hard times for ordinary and upperclass iranian people , he said the unrest caught the attention of secretary of state hillary rodham clinton , who , speaking from washington rejected mr ahmadinejad s explanation for the rial s plunge she suggested that conditions would improve if iran engaged in meaningful negotiations over its nuclear program , which western powers and israel suspect is meant to develop , but which iran says is for peaceful purposes i think the iranian government deserves responsibility for what is going on inside iran , she told reporters and that is who should be held accountable mr ahmadinejad s warning to currency manipulators appeared to be the reason for the deployment of riot police officers in and around manoucheri street in central tehran , where the blackmarket money changes had been doing a thriving business , particularly in recent days , as hundreds of iranians sought to trade their rials for other currencies , fearing even worse times ahead witnesses described catandmouse chases between riot police officers on motorcycles armed with tear gas and batons , and money changers and their customers , who had to scatter anger spread to tehran s grand bazaar , where many merchants closed their stores some were cheered by shoppers in denouncing the government for its financial support of syria s embattled government instead of investing that money at home they spend billions of dollars to keep syrian president bashar alassad in power , but now they say they have no money ! one clothing merchant screamed , according to witnesses a team from iran s state television was nearly attacked when its reporter turned to the camera saying that the people behind him had been upset over a robbery abdullah , a young man selling textiles , loudly complained that it had become extremely difficult to do business when the value of the rial was so unpredictable the checks our customers give us bounce , we do n't know what prices will be tomorrow , how can we earn a living \? he asked one of the videos that witnesses verified as genuine showed hundreds of demonstrators marching peacefully and chanting , leave syria alone , think of us ! but other videos , apparently uploaded by iran s underground and exiled opposition movement to exploit the moment for political advantage , appeared to be fake , blending clips from wednesday with old footage from the antigovernment protests that followed the disputed election more than three years ago the secretary general of the tehran bazaar and trade union , a powerful official close to the government , accused unspecified outside instigators of pressing bazaar merchants to close their shops the official , ahmad karimi esfahani , was quoted by the iranian labor news agency as saying that most merchants had wanted to remain open those now present are trying to show the bazaar as closed , he was quoted as saying they are guided by foreigners other bazaar traders hinted that the closing had been organized by powerful opponents of mr ahmadinejad , who were trying to make him look weak the bazaar is firmly in the hands of conservative businessmen who once supported mr ahmadinejad s rise to power but now strongly oppose him members of parliament and shiite muslim clerics have been calling for an end to the blackmarket currency trade , accusing the money changers of driving down the rial s value others have called upon the government to buy rials and sell dollars , presumably from the central bank s reserves , to stabilize the rial but it is unclear how large a cash reserve the central bank has at its disposal the head of iran s central bank and mr ahmadinejad regularly say that iran has more than 100 billion in cash , but government contractors , state employees and even members of the revolutionary guards have complained of late payments in recent months and sometimes of none at all with many trying to blame mr ahmadinejad for the wide range of problems plaguing iran , he seems to be gearing up for a political fight on tuesday he attacked the head of iran s parliament , ali larijani , accusing him and other politicians of trying to bring him down , after mr larijani said the government practiced robin hood economics
video describing a digital history textbook created by students , a project begun in two ohio middle schools , but continued with help from others around the globe if you re an educator who is interested in technology , we re pretty sure you ve come across the work of will richardson at some point in the last five years the first edition of his blogs , wikis , podcasts and other powerful web tools for classrooms was the first techspecific education book i read in 2006 when , fresh out of the classroom , i took the job as editor of this site back when i barely knew the keyboard shortcuts for cut and paste , much less how blogs , wikis and podcasts could change learning mr richardson has a new book out , and its themes echo so much of what we try to do on the learning network that we asked him to write a guest post tell us your thoughts , below katherine schulten three starting points for thinking differently about learning by will richardson when i was a classroom teacher just over a decade ago , just when the web was starting to become inherently social and participatory , i had a feeling it was going to change things in a big way i could see it in the ways my high school students were blogging and connecting with authors and professionals and other students from around the world \( the times even made note of it \) i could see it on my own blog , where suddenly i was learning with really smart people whom i had never met face to face , people who quickly became a part of a network of educatorlearners to whom i felt deeply connected it was exciting and fascinating and somewhat daunting all at once  today , there is no doubt that the web has changed things more than most of us could have imagined way back there at the turn of the century every day we have access to more information , more knowledge and more people in many ways , i can t imagine there has been a more amazing time to learn i also , however , can t imagine a more challenging time for schools the last 15 webfrenzied years have upended the basic premise of school the idea that content and knowledge and teachers are scarce and have to be collected into a local classroom during a certain time period in order to educate our children is no longer true those things are now abundant for most of us , and for the 95 percent of our 12 to 17yearold students who carry the collected knowledge of the web around in their pockets the fact that our students can access most of the traditional school curriculum without us requires us to rethink almost everything about our role as teachers and our value in schools khan academy is just the beginning over the next couple of decades , schools , like media , music , business , politics and other industries grappling with similar disruptions , will have to change as one of my favorite authors , clay shirky , has observed , the change we are in the middle of isn t minor and it isn t optional but , as mr shirky also notes , the contours of that change are not set in stone none of us can be sure exactly what schools or classrooms will become , although as educators it is imperative we all add our voices to the discussion so what can we be sure of \? well , we can be sure that abundance brings a host of opportunities for learning , and we can be sure that if we are going to make sense of those opportunities in ways that benefit our students , we re going to have to unlearn and relearn much of our own practice in short , it has to start with a willingness to reflect on what the larger changes mean in our own learning to that end , i would like to suggest three starting points for thinking differently about our roles as connected educators and about the classrooms we inhabit at this moment of profound shift 1 thin the walls of your classroom one of my favorite connected educators , clarence fisher in snow lake , manitoba , has been blogging for years about how the web has given his classroom thin walls via the internet , his students have gone beyond the cinderblock walls of their building to discuss books and collaborate on projects with classrooms in the united states and south america and across canada mr fisher serves as a connector for his students , taking advantage of the web to bring learning into his classroom in ways that didn t exist when many of those students were born tens of thousands of educators are doing this now using tools like skype , google hangouts , google docs and more , they are taking advantage of all of the experts and professionals and artists and other passionate learners who are out there online to inform and educate in 2010 , the times s bits blog asked teachers how the use of technology was changing how they teach , then showcased eight video answers to that question click on the image below to see them as these teachers show , thinwalled classrooms are about more than simply connecting they are also about creating and sharing real work for real audiences it is not about doing work that hangs on bulletin boards or hallway walls it is about sending work out into the world like the writing and videos of kathy cassidy s first graders in moose jaw , saskatchewan , where students post on their own blogs and get comments from their global audience here is ms cassidy s class in a halloweenthemed video it s about work like the digital history textbook that the ohio teachers garth holman and mike pennington are creating on their class wiki with the help of other classrooms all over the place but thin walls can also apply to assessments if we see our classrooms as nodes in a much bigger network of learners , why wouldn t we allow students to answer the questions we ask of them using those networks as well \? why should schools remain the only place where our young people can t take the access they are carrying around in their pockets and use it to complete the test \? don t we want to know that our students can use this access safely , effectively and ethically \? 2 talk to strangers learning today is not just about connecting your students to other classrooms or experts that you find it is about teaching them to make their own connections as well and that means teaching them how to find , vet and learn with people they don t know , people whom they may never meet face to face in fact , i would argue that is an essential part of being literate at this moment of abundance as a parent , i want my own teenagers to be able to take advantage of the same types of powerful learning opportunities that i ve had in online networks and communities over the last decade by looking online for others who share the same passions , i ve come to know educators from across the united states , australia , china , norway , brazil , canada and elsewhere who are also trying to sort out how technologies can change our thinking about teaching and learning it is not necessarily difficult to make these types of connections , nor is it inherently risky in fact , research has shown that the safety issues that we hear about on the web are in many cases overblown but that is not to say our students wouldn t be best served by a little help from us assuming , of course , that we ourselves are connecting with strangers the best place to start \? i would have to say twitter at this point while it may seem at times that twitter is the wild west of nonsense and thoughtlessness , it can be almost the exact opposite if you know where to look \( you might start with this free guide to twitter from powerful learning practice , of which i m a cofounder , or read about how these teachers use twitter for their own professional development you might also follow the many educators suggested by a learning network post for connected educator month \)  the key to twitter is simple it s who you follow i have the benefit of about 175 really smart , passionate educators and others \( like joe bower and edutopia and patrickmlarkin \) who filter and curate the world for me daily by sharing links and ideas that i normally wouldn t come by being able to connect and learn with strangers is an important skill for all of us , and especially for a generation that will be learning online for the rest of their lives 3 be transparent we need to model the types of skills and dispositions that our students will need in order to take advantage of all of the abundance at their fingertips that includes going out and connecting with others , but it also means sharing our own work , learning transparently and actively participating in online spaces where our students can find us i know that is a difficult proposition for many who may feel uncomfortable putting their work out there for the world or their students to see but the returns can be profound the first return is that our students get to see how this weblearning thing is done well when they can see their teacher \( like shelley wright \) or their principal \( like chris lehmann \) connecting and creating and learning with the world , they gain a much better sense of the possibilities for themselves here are recent twitter messages from these educators for folks who asked for my slides from the weekend iste leadership forum keynote on slideshare http tco 1dbjntl6  chris lehmann \( chrislehmann \) 23 oct 12 looking for an elementary class in australia to partner with my daughters grade 3 class  shelley wright \( wrightsroom \) 2 oct 12 second , if you are sharing your work and ideas online , you develop that very necessary lens for bringing the web to your classroom in safe , effective and ethical ways in this new world of abundance , our students will have to be adept at knowing what and what not to share they will have to manage their reputations online and they will have to become googled well the reality is that every child in your classroom is going to be googled over and over and over again in his or her life , by potential employers , college admissions officers and potential mates i actually think we should make it an expressed outcome from high school that all of our students are googled well , under their full name , on graduation day i mean , why wouldn t we want to know that they are prepared \? finally , while finding strangers is an important part of lifelong learning these days , it is even better to be found by strangers online i know sounds weird but give it time the only way for people who share your interests and passions and experiences to find you is if you are findable that won t happen if you re not participating online it is a different time for teaching and learning the unfortunate reality is that much of what we do in schools and in our own teaching practice is still grounded in thinking that has ruled the day for more than a century more troubling is that the waves of reform that are spreading are more focused on just doing what we ve been doing better rather than rethinking our roles as schools and teachers and doing things differently if our focus remains on numbers and scores and rankings and assessments , our kids are not going to get the learning outcomes they need for this new era of information and knowledge the good news \? all of us can begin that change process in our own practice today and if we do , our opportunities to learn deeply and passionately will only grow related the learning network s resources teaching with and about technology
akhil reed amar , a professor of law at yale , begins his new book , america s unwritten constitution , by calling our attention to two places in article 1 , section 3 of the constitution the first declares that the vice president of the united states shall be the president of the senate the second reads , when the president of the united states is tried , the chief justice will preside it doesn t say why but the reason , says amar , emerges upon a moment s reflection even though these words say nothing explicit about the vice president it quickly dawns on us that the central purpose of the passage was to oust the vice president from the chair in presidential impeachment trials for were he not so ousted , the vice president would have an intolerable conflict of interest given that in the event of a conviction , he would ascend to the presidency the example illustrates amar s main thesis the written constitution cannot work as intended without something outside of it america s unwritten constitution to fill its gaps and stabilize its meaning the meaning of the inside the text s literal words cannot be specified independently of the outside the set of assumptions and values that hangs over the enterprise and gives the deeds and words that occur within it shape and point the text may not enumerate those assumptions and values , but , explains amar , they go without saying , and because they go without saying the words that are said receive their meaning from them the unwritten constitution helps make sense of the text , a sense that would not be available if an interpreter were confined to a clausebound literalism in fact , the case is even stronger than that , amar tells us a clausebound literalism , a reliance on the textually explicit , rather than delivering a coherent document would yield only a series of discrete observations amar s authority for this assertion is none other than chief justice john marshall , who acknowledged in mcculloch v maryland \( 1819 \) that there was no express proviso for the conclusion he reached , but argued that it was sustained on a principle which so entirely pervades the constitution , is so intermixed with the materials which compose it , so interwoven with its web , so blended with its texture , as to be incapable of being separated from it , without rending it into shreds marshall , explains amar , insisted on reading between the lines to vindicate the document s spirit , rather than focusing solely on the letter in a way that would fragment and atomize the document but couldn t the letter be enlarged so that the unwritten principle became a written one \? couldn t the proviso be made express \? couldn t the spirit be made explicit \? no , says amar consider the unwritten principle that no man may be a judge in his own case you might think that a number of interpretive puzzles would have happily disappeared had the framers simply been more explicit by inserting it into the written constitution but think again , amar advises the scope and meaning of the principle would still have to be specified , and that could not be done without reference to some other unwritten principle in the light of which the meaning of judge and his own case could be stabilized and if you inserted that second previously unwritten principle into the text , it itself would have to be stabilized by another , and on and on and on no matter how many words you added , there would still be left open a range of questions whose answers could not simply be deduced from the words themselves it is not , says amar , a matter of poor draftsmanship or of draftsmanship at all the unwritten principles that preside over constitutional interpretation should not be thought of as items in a list they are , rather , part and parcel of a general project the implementation of americanstyle democracy that is not defined and limited by the implications and considerations it gives rise to if there is a list , it is one that keeps expanding in the face of new phenomena and new fact situations , in response to which the project at once reaffirms itself and adds to its storehouse of rules and principles , most of them unwritten the whole is always more than the sum of its parts no matter how many of its parts have been enumerated and any effort to enumerate them will always be outrun by the generative power of the whole and will quickly turn a terse text \( amar s phrase \) like the constitution into a monster that , in chief justice marshall s words , has the prolixity of a legal code explicitness , it turns out , is not a possible human achievement , which is no big deal because communication and understanding do not require it what they do require is a grasp of the enterprise within which a particular utterance or writing is encountered here is an example \( mine , not amar s \) from the enterprise called higher education it may say in an online schedule of courses or on the bulletin board of a classroom building , classes begin on the hour what could be simpler \? but the simplicity and easy understanding will be experienced only by those who know , and know without reflection , what a class is \( know that it is not a socioeconomic population \) , know why classes are held \( what is the end point to which they contribute \) and know what counts as an hour \( no one , except in rare and special circumstances , will think that one of the hours being referred to is 1 002 00 am \) it might seem that going to college or teaching in one is an activity less complex than the activity of engaging in constitutional interpretation but neither activity can be engaged in by someone who had not internalized a vast array of assumptions and presuppositions , each of which is an ingredient of an understanding that can not be gained by rehearsing or cataloging them whether negotiating the course schedule or the constitution , quicksand awaits all who insist on reading every clause of the document literally what are the implications of amar s argument \? well , one implication , which he draws out , is that textualism or clausebound literalism of the kind championed by justice antonin scalia is a nonstarter not going outside the text leaves the text a document profoundly unresponsive to our goals and aspirations because our goals and aspirations the huge number of unwritten ones have been edited out another implication , one that amar does not draw out because he is not performing as a philosopher of language , is that we have unwritten constitutions in every area of our discursive life whether it is the law , or higher education , or politics , or shop talk , or domestic interactions , utterances and writings are meaningful only against the background of a set of assumptions they do not contain textualism is not only a nonstarter in constitutional interpretation it is a nonstarter everywhere when your spouse or partner says , we don t go out anymore , what does he or she mean \? well , it depends on within which unwritten constitution which understanding of the protocols and hazards of the domestic project you are hearing the words parsing them lexically and grammatically isn t going to help you what might help or at least put you in the ballpark is a sensitivity to everything that has happened in the course of a continuing relationship the last thing you want to do in a situation like this is be a clausebound literalist and start researching the number of days the two of you have gone out that s not what is at stake and you will have a chance of knowing what is at stake only if , as you listen to the words , you are hearkening to the unwritten constitution of your life together an earlier version of this article misstated the source of two quotes from the constitution they are not from article 3 , but rather from article 1 , section 3 this has been corrected

more has been written about baseball s unwritten rules than about most of the sports world s written ones in the wake of tuesday night s narrowly averted  beanball battle of cole hamels s admission that he threw at bryce harper last week and of the increased awareness of player safety issues in other sports , some are calling for baseball s unwritten rules to be rewritten or written , then rewritten or reunwritten , or something when dealing with a set of longstanding traditions of suspicious provenance and dubious wisdom , things are bound to get confusing the unwritten rules are back in print after the seventhinning shenanigans in the mets' 80 loss to milwaukee on tuesday night mets reliever d j carrasco hit the brewers slugger ryan braun in the shoulder one pitch after allowing a home run to rickie weeks , then threw up his arms in the international gesture for how dare you accuse me of anything but the most innocent intentions \? carrasco pleaded innocence but was immediately ejected mets manager then pulled his star third baseman , , for a pinchhitter in the bottom of the inning , fearing retaliation by the brewers wright responded to collins s helicopter managing with a dugout outburst if someone s going to get hit , let it be me , wright told collins pinchhitter jordany valdespin , the back of whose jersey should now read expendable , then grounded out without incident the carrasco episode illustrated several controversial elements of baseball s unwritten rule book first , there is the posthome run plunking , best written about in the baseball codes , a 2010 book by jason turbow with whole chapters on intimidation and retaliation second , there s the retaliatory strike , which is actually rule 26 in baseball digest s unwritten rules of baseball , a magazine article from 1986 do n't worry after a while , the crippling irony of these writings' very existence eventually starts to fade a profound majority of baseball s policing emanates from the pitcher s mound , and covers numerous code violations shows of disrespect or acts of showboating , like watching a home run , turbow wrote , recounting examples like nolan ryan s knockdown of lenny dykstra during a 1986 astrosmets series dykstra celebrated too cockily after scoring a gamewinning run the night before ryan s start that boy just asked for a bow tie , ryan told a teammate , referring to satchel paige s charming term for a neckhigh fastball there were no signs of dykstrastrength disrespect in the brewersmets game weeks did not admire his shot , and once he realized it was a home run , he jogged the bases quickly , with his head down to behave any more humbly , weeks would have needed to sweep the ground in front of him to protect the lives of innocent insects the unwritten rules lost something in translation from paige to ryan to the likes of hamels last week , hamels reinterpreted give the bow tie to someone who showboats as throw a fastball at the game s brightest young star for no apparent reason hamels hit harper in the first inning of the third game of the nationals series , after the struggling phillies lost the first two games you know what , it s something that i grew up watching , hamels explained so i'm just trying to continue the old baseball two points first , the 28year old hamels grew up watching oldtimers like andy pettitte ply their craft , not satchel paige or don drysdale his idea of oldschool baseball comes in part from ken griffey jr presents major league baseball for the super nintendo second , harper stole home two batters later , which is the best kind of retaliation there is the unwritten rules were undergoing editorial revision before hamels was even born turbow recounts an incident from the 1970s , when the red sox slugger jim rice walked to the mound and told pitcher jim colburn he would tear your head off after an attempted brushback by the 1970s , baseball was a different game , played by men with different attitudes , turbow wrote brushbacks were no longer taken for granted as part of a pitcher s repertoire no one has informed the pitchers themselves of this over the last four decades unwritten rule 26 on the baseball digest list was the sole reason collins benched wright on tuesday i 've got news for you in this game there are unwritten rules and one of the unwritten rules is , you hit my guy i'm hitting your guy , ' collins said , revealing as news an allegedly unwritten principle first written about in 1986 fascinatingly , none of the other unwritten rules in the baseball digest list cover beanings , bow ties , or quidproquo acts of aggression they cover benign bits of strategy like do n't hit and run with an 02 count or if you play for one run , that s all you get suddenly , rule 26 demands frontier justice if one of your players gets knocked down by a pitch , retaliate it s like thumbing through an etiquette guide and discovering a sudden , disturbing tone shift salad fork to the left of dinner fork , address a duchess by her title , and if someone rings the doorbell during high tea , bludgeon him in the face with a garden shovel the unwritten rules say little of wright s predicament , or more precisely valdespin s , since he was the one sent to face the possible chin music neither baseball digest nor turbow has anything to say on the appropriateness of beaning a pinchhitter as a sluggerbyproxy even if they did , it would be of little help in a world where pitchers like hamels make up old school rules as they go along perhaps publishing thou shalt not brush back a pinchhitter in retaliation for beaning a slugger as punishment for the previous batter s home run in a paper of record might help future players in valdespin s predicament , but writing one unwritten rule only opens unspoken loopholes as for wright , his laudable desire to take one for the team \( and possibly increase his onbase percentage ! \) lost nobility and machismo points when he turned his back on collins and huffed across the dugout in a snit a calmer wright flipped the script during postgame interviews , hinting that carrasco misinterpreted the unwritten rules by throwing at an inappropriate time in other words , he violated a nonrule by doing the wrong thing for the notquiteright reason like any oral tradition , especially one that has been explicitly written down numerous times , the rules have undergone slow evolution turbow tells of an incident from the 1980 world series , when phillies pitcher dickie noles knocked down the royals superstar george brett noles was guilty of several code violations , including the worst one of all he threw intentionally at brett s head i was trying to take his head off , and i'm not proud of that , noles said a rule about not throwing directly at an opponent s skull \? someone should really write that one down
i caused some commotion when i claimed that alabama pass rusher courtney upshaw is a second or even thirdround talent \( \) , but i see a short , slow player who gets blown off the ball and has a poor pass rush repertory today s featured player , whitney mercilus of illinois , has more upside than upshaw , in my view , possessing superior quickness and strength scouting report at 64 , 265 pounds , whitney mercilus \( 85 \) is in the perfect range to play either defensive end in a 43 scheme or outside linebacker in a 34 mercilus spent time rushing from both a traditional threepoint stance and from a standup position at illinois he is quite quick off the edge and generally takes good angles to the quarterback , keeping his pad level low around the corner he uses his hands as well as any rusher i have studied thus far , slapping away blockers arms to reach the quarterback \( see the 59second mark in the video below against ucla \) mercilus is a bit tricky to evaluate because he is athletic yet stiff in the hips he has the quickness and agility to chase down the quarterback \( see the 2 36 mark against ucla \) and sidestep blockers \( 3 43 mark against ucla \) , but he also fails to change direction quickly and looks as if he would struggle in coverage if asked to drop into a zone in short , he is athletic in that he is explosive but not overly coordinated mercilus broke out in 2011 and collected 16 sacks without much of a pass rush repertory he generally used superior quickness and leverage to get to the quarterback the one move he displays quite nicely is the bull rush , which you can see at the 5 02 mark against ucla his bull rush is powerful and effective , but he will need to find a complementary move in the nfl at the 6 18 mark , you can see the opportunity for a spin move open up when the offensive tackle oversets if mercilus has that move , he has a sack when he does attempt a spin move \( such as at the 1 52 mark in the penn state video below \) , it is ineffective one of the things i really like about mercilus is his run defense he generally keeps his outside shoulder free to contain ballcarriers \( such as at the 1 50 mark against ucla \) , and he can fight through double teams \( 2 28 \) he is one of the stronger prospects i have watched in 2012 , and his motor is second to none perhaps mercilus s largest weakness is his play recognition when he locates the ballcarrier , mercilus can be a terror against the run about five plays a game , though , he looks baffled as to the location of the ball \( see 2 57 and 3 07 against penn state \) in the film i watched , mercilus had trouble finding the ball and rushed hard after the quarterback on every screen pass the big game for mercilus was against ohio state he was matched up against the potential firstround tackle mike adams for much of the game the best play i have seen from mercilus came at the 44second mark , when he split adams and another blocker for a sack and forced fumble mercilus had another great play at the 3 08 mark when he tossed adams to the side and took down the ballcarrier you can see a similar type of thing on the other side of the defense at the 3 52 clip over all , mercilus played very well against top competition a question nfl teams will be asking is , where was mercilus before 2011 \? in 2009 and 2010 , he totaled two combined sacks two is mercilus a fluke , or was he a raw player who is finally putting together his tremendous natural skills \? i think it is the latter projection mercilus figures to go anywhere from the midfirst to the earlysecond round because of his versatility and potential , i think you ll see his name called on the first night of the 2012 draft most likely destinations jets \( 16 \) , san diego \( 18 \) , green bay \( 28 \) , san francisco \( 30 \) previous scouting reports jonathan bales is the founder of   and will help analyze draft prospects for the fifth down in his scouting the draft preview series

last week the european commission confirmed what everyone suspected the economies it surveys are shrinking , not growing it s not an official recession yet , but the only real question is how deep the downturn will be and this downturn is hitting nations that have never recovered from the last recession for all america s troubles , its gross domestic product has finally surpassed its precrisis peak europe s has not and some nations are suffering great depressionlevel pain greece and ireland have had doubledigit declines in output , spain has 23 percent unemployment , britain s slump has now gone on longer than its slump in the 1930s worse yet , european leaders and quite a few influential players here are still wedded to the economic doctrine responsible for this disaster for things did n't have to be this bad greece would have been in deep trouble no matter what policy decisions were taken , and the same is true , to a lesser extent , of other nations around europe s periphery but matters were made far worse than necessary by the way europe s leaders , and more broadly its policy elite , substituted moralizing for analysis , fantasies for the lessons of history specifically , in early 2010 austerity economics the insistence that governments should slash spending even in the face of high unemployment became all the rage in european capitals the doctrine asserted that the direct negative effects of spending cuts on employment would be offset by changes in confidence , that savage spending cuts would lead to a surge in consumer and business spending , while nations failing to make such cuts would see capital flight and soaring interest rates if this sounds to you like something herbert hoover might have said , you 're right it does and he did now the results are in and they 're exactly what three generations' worth of economic analysis and all the lessons of history should have told you would happen the confidence fairy has failed to show up none of the countries slashing spending have seen the predicted privatesector surge instead , the depressing effects of fiscal austerity have been reinforced by falling private spending furthermore , bond markets keep refusing to cooperate even austerity s star pupils , countries that , like portugal and ireland , have done everything that was demanded of them , still face skyhigh borrowing costs why \? because spending cuts have deeply depressed their economies , undermining their tax bases to such an extent that the ratio of debt to gdp , the standard indicator of fiscal progress , is getting worse rather than better meanwhile , countries that did n't jump on the austerity train most notably , japan and the united states continue to have very low borrowing costs , defying the dire predictions of fiscal hawks now , not everything has gone wrong late last year spanish and italian borrowing costs shot up , threatening a general financial meltdown those costs have now subsided , amid general sighs of relief but this good news was actually a triumph of antiausterity mario draghi , the new president of the european central bank , brushed aside the inflationworriers and engineered a large expansion of credit , which was just what the doctor ordered so what will it take to convince the pain caucus , the people on both sides of the atlantic who insist that we can cut our way to prosperity , that they are wrong \? after all , the usual suspects were quick to pronounce the idea of fiscal stimulus dead for all time after president obama s efforts failed to produce a quick fall in unemployment even though many economists warned in advance that the stimulus was too small yet as far as i can tell , austerity is still considered responsible and necessary despite its catastrophic failure in practice the point is that we could actually do a lot to help our economies simply by reversing the destructive austerity of the last two years that s true even in america , which has avoided fullfledged austerity at the federal level but has seen big spending and employment cuts at the state and local level remember all the fuss about whether there were enough shovel ready projects to make largescale stimulus feasible \? well , never mind all the federal government needs to do to give the economy a big boost is provide , allowing these governments to rehire the hundreds of thousands of schoolteachers they have laid off and restart the building and maintenance projects they have canceled look , i understand why influential people are reluctant to admit that policy ideas they thought reflected deep wisdom actually amounted to utter , destructive folly but it s time to put delusional beliefs about the virtues of austerity in a depressed economy behind us

the unpredictable nature of this season s stanley cup playoffs asserted itself yet again last week when the nashville predators , who were trailing phoenix by two games to none and being solidly outplayed , suspended their top two scorers for game 3 of their secondround series , and were better off for it without alexander radulov and sergei kostitsyn in the lineup , the predators shut out the coyotes , 20 even with the suspension lifted for game 4 , radulov and kostitsyn did not dress friday and their team was shut out , 10 , in nashville the two were discovered to have broken curfew on the eve of game 2 they were reportedly seen in a scottsdale , ariz , bar , 45 minutes away from the team s glendale hotel , as late as 5 am the team confirmed the time of their arrival at the hotel by checking the hotel s computer records for when the room keys were used radulov is not a drinker kostitsyn had previously made headlines in montreal for latenight partying kostitsyn scored in game 2 , but radulov s play was so uninspired that he was singled out for criticism on postgame telecasts in the united states and canada the radulovkostitsyn episode , along with the discussion surrounding alex ovechkin s diminished ice time in washington , revived old tropes in north american hockey circles about enigmatic russians and how , despite their natural talent , they supposedly do not work hard or sacrifice for the team such stereotypes used to be proffered in english canada about players from quebec , or , in american sports like baseball and football , about nonwhite athletes nevertheless , breaking curfew during hockey s postseason is exceedingly rare , as players almost invariably dedicate themselves to the best interests of their teams the remaining predators supported the decision of coach barry trotz and general manager david poile to exclude the two as a leadership group , we talked to trotzy and said whatever you decide , we 'll stand by you , the alternate captain ryan suter said we 're in the playoffs we do n't need distractions the incident was particularly embarrassing to poile , the popular manager who called the behavior selfish poile addressed nashville s longstanding offensive shortcoming by trading with montreal for kostitsyn in february , then getting radulov to join the club in march after the season ended in russia s kontinental hockey league for his team , salavat yulaev ufa radulov is a twotime khl most valuable player and the league s leading career scorer he led salavat to the 2011 khl championship and helped lead russia to gold medals at the world championship tournament in 2008 and 2009 radulov jumped to the khl in the summer of 2008 while still a member of the predators his deal with salavat called for substantially more than the entrylevel deal in nashville , which is capped by the league at less than 1 million annually his defection sparked a long period of ill will between the nhl and the khl over respecting each other s contracts after the postseason , radulov will be a restricted free agent and kostitsyn an unrestricted free agent , but their actions last week may have damaged their futures in the nhl offseason moves begin as the playoffs proceed , some teams that did n't make the tournament or were eliminated early are pondering moves for the future , or already making them while the dethroned champion bruins do n't seem inclined to dismiss anyone in their hockey department , the team s president , cam neely , disclosed a need to upgrade boston s power play the bruins managed only two goals with the man advantage in losing to washington , and each game in the sevengame series was decided by one goal mike gillis , general manager for last season s other finalist , vancouver , has supported the return of coach alain vigneault but neither man has received a vote of confidence from ownership the canucks were thought to be a serious cup contender after finishing first over all in the regular season , but their early departure cannot sit well with the owner francesco aquilini he and vigneault are set to meet monday to go over the club s direction , and some believe the coach

early on in his new book , college what it was , is , and should be , andrew delbanco of columbia university quotes the economist richard vedder and the former university president william brody to the effect that little has changed in higher education despite enormous changes in technology , demographics , funding models , and student habits and attitudes vedder notes that with the possible exception of prostitution , teaching is the only profession that has had absolutely no productivity advance in the 2 , 400 years since socrates brody is less wry , but the point is the same if you went to a college class circa 1900 , and you went today , it would look exactly the same in many of the books on higher education now flooding the market , statements like those would be preliminary either to a denial of the point \( everything is not the same here are the new things we re doing \) , or to an affirmation of it followed by detailed recommendations \( here s what we should do to catch up \) delbanco , however , not only accepts the fact that little has changed in the classroom most of what we see in the past looks a lot like the present he celebrates it in the course of answering his title s question college , he tells us , is a hedge against utilitarian values that slakes the human craving for contacts with works of art that somehow register one s longings and yet exceed what one has been able to articulate by and for oneself it is typical of delbanco s mode of presentation that he doesn t hit you over the head with an argument , but leaves you to work it out if humans do indeed crave such contact , that craving is the same in all ages , and the kind of experience that satisfies it will also be the same t he questions we face under the shadow of death are not new , and no new technology will help us answer them that includes the technology of science delbanco pays tribute to science s progressive power , but its principle of progress , he says , does not translate well into other areas of human life science tells us nothing about how to shape a life or how to face death it not only fails to answer such questions it cannot ask them delbanco knows that some scientists have predicted that in time neuroscience will define and ensure happiness and biochemistry will distinguish truth from falsity among what today are mere opinions about sex and gender , but he doubts it will happen even if it does , none of us will be around and it s not clear that we would want to be notice that delbanco doesn t say that we surely wouldn t want to be around it s not clear strikes just the right note of questioning the point is made , but it is not pressed indeed , i have somewhat misrepresented the book by collecting some of its more polemical moments the book does have a thesis , but it is not thesisridden it seeks to persuade not by driving a stake into the opponent s position or even paying much attention to it , but by offering us examples of the experience it celebrates delbanco s is not an argument for , but a display of , the value of a liberal arts education the display comes in two forms first there is the felicity of the author s prose mirabile dictu , there are no charts and few statistics but there are sentences worth reading reminding us that professor means someone professing a faith , delbanco exhorts us to keep the etymology alive surely this meaning is one to which we would still wish to lay claim , since the true teacher must always be a professor in the root sense of the word a person undaunted by the incremental fatigue of repetitive work , who remains ardent , even fanatic , in the service of his calling the ardency is not only reported it is communicated , both by his words and the words of those he marshals in a parade of inspiring , even fanatic , exemplars \( this is the second form of display \) henry james , mark twain , edgar allan poe , philip roth , harriet beecher stowe , matthew arnold , john henry newman , walt whitman , jonathan edwards , john cotton , seneca , ralph waldo emerson , max weber , henry adams , william james , nathaniel hawthorne , lionel trilling , emily dickinson , benjamin franklin , john witherspoon , groucho marx , philip larkin , homer these worthies do double duty they illustrate observations delbanco is making , and they are themselves illustrations of why books like this are written in the first place humanism has always been about imitation and the belief that if the song of virtue is sung well , listeners will be moved to join in in an apology for poetry \( 1595 \) , philip sidney asks \( rhetorically \) , who readeth aeneas carrying old anchises on his back that wisheth not it were his fortune to perform so excellent an act \? delbanco recalls the effect the art historian meyer schapiro had on students as he spoke about cezanne they would say , whatever he s smoking , i ll have some i recall the renaissance scholar jackson cope telling me the story of how , just out of the navy , a street kid from chicago , he wandered into a class on iconography and emblems taught by the great don cameron allen at the university of illinois i didn t know what he was talking about , cope said , but , he added , i did know that i wanted some of that  delbanco writes as he does by introducing you to the voices of those who embody the values he would preserve in the hope that his readers will want some of that and may even be moved to do something about it
cephalonia , greece for a nation like ours that is seeking its way home from 10 years of war , maybe there s a dash of inspiration in the oldest tale of homecoming ever the odyssey and in new findings that shed stunning light on it homer recounts odysseus s troubled journey back from a military entanglement abroad , the decadelong trojan war the odyssey is a singular tale of longing for homeland , but it comes with a mystery where exactly is odysseus s beloved land of ithaca \? homer describes odysseus s ithaca as lowlying and the westernmost island of four that does n't fit modern ithaca , which is mountainous and the easternmost of the cluster of islands in the ionian sea a british businessman , , working in his spare time , thinks he has solved this mystery and his solution is so ingenious , and fits the geography so well , that it has been embraced by many of the world s top experts university and university both told me that they largely buy into bittlestone s theory peter green , an eminent british scholar , wrote in the new york review of books that bittlestone is almost certainly correct bittlestone , who loves the classics but has no special qualifications , noted that the westernmost area in this cluster of islands is paliki , a peninsula that sticks out from the major island of cephalonia he wondered what if in ancient times the isthmus connecting paliki to the rest of cephalonia were submerged \? in that case , paliki would be an island fitting homer s description with that insight , bittlestone found a 2 , 000yearold account by a geographer , strabo , who described the isthmus as so low that it periodically was under water moreover , the collision of two tectonic plates is forcing the land mass up a single earthquake in 1953 raised paliki another 2 feet above sea level everybody tends to look at a landscape and assume that it s always been like that , but in this part of the world that s not true , bittlestone told me as he gave me a tour of paliki john r underhill , a british geoscientist who is , has overseen a geological examination of paliki underhill says that his core samples and other research , so far , support the idea of an ancient channel separating paliki , although the study is continuing there are still plenty of skeptics some experts still are partial to modern ithaca as the homeland of odysseus others favor the main part of cephalonia , where an excavation has turned up the ancient tomb of a major king for that matter , it s not even clear that there really was an odysseus maybe he and ithaca were imaginary then again , the descriptions of homer s ithaca are detailed and offer terrific matches with paliki bittlestone led me to a beach on the north end of paliki where he believes odysseus landed on his return from his long journey home from troy odysseus s last stop before home was probably corfu , and anyone sailing from corfu to paliki would likely land on this beach it also matches homer s description of precipitous promontories that jut into the sea yes , i know this is a flight of fancy but it was magical to stroll the beach and imagine odysseus landing here one shortcoming of this beach is that homer describes a great cave nearby with two entrances , and there is none now is there a silver bullet test as to whether this is where odysseus landed \? bittlestone mused yes , a silver bullet would be to find the cave geologists are investigating a nearby limestone hill , a kind that is home to caverns elsewhere the surface of the hill has been covered with more than 200 feet of rubble from landslides , but they are hoping to find the cavern buried underneath you often find things in caves , bittlestone said , adding with a twinkle that his dream is to find the cave sheltering an early manuscript of homer s epics from the beach , he led me to an area that matches the description of the ancient pig farm \( now a goat ranch \) where odysseus rested a bit beyond is kastelli , which bittlestone describes as a candidate hill for the palace of odysseus professor snodgrass examined the hill , finding ancient fortifications and shards of pottery , and he confirms that it is a prehistoric site there s more that i do n't have space for bittlestone has written a 598page book , , published by cambridge university press , that explores the evidence for paliki as homer s ithaca the odyssey is particularly relevant to us today as we recover from our own decade of war how sweet it would be to discover , after three millenniums , that odysseus was not imaginary but a product of these rocky hills , olive trees and beaches on an obscure greek peninsula an example of how the ordinary can inspire the extraordinary

beirut , lebanon marie colvin recognized the significant story unfolding in the rebellious syrian city of homs the problem was how to get at it she had been hoping for an official visa to visit syria s capital , damascus , but with none forthcoming , she decided to sneak over the border despite strong misgivings about her safety in homs , which is suffering a constant battering from government tanks and heavy artillery i cannot remember any story where the security situation was potentially this bad , except maybe chechnya , ms colvin told me over a dinner of traditional lebanese fare on her last night in beirut a week before she was killed in homs on wednesday in her first dispatch from that besieged city , printed in the latest sunday times of london , she detailed the dangers in merely reaching her destination , which lies just across the lebanese border but now exists in a grim , deadly world apart her welcoming party in homs was ecstatic that a foreign reporter had braved the odds to reach them so desperate were they that they bundled me into an open truck and drove at speed with the headlights on , everyone standing in the back shouting , allahu akbar god is the greatest , she wrote inevitably , the syrian army opened fire she then transferred into a small car which was again fired upon , speeding into a row of abandoned buildings for cover but she found her story she described the widows basement crammed with women cowering in the only shelter they could find in a city where there is only sugar and water to feed a newborn baby among the 300 huddling in this wood factory cellar in the besieged district of baba amr is 20yearold noor , who lost her husband and her home to the shells and rockets , ms colvin wrote , etching in stark detail how the woman s husband and brother died when they went out into the streets to forage for food it is a city of the cold and hungry , echoing to exploding shells and bursts of gunfire , she wrote , her overall description evoking some of the worst sieges of world war ii there are no telephones and the electricity has been cut off few homes have diesel for the tin stoves they rely on for heat in the coldest winter that anyone can remember , the story said freezing rain fills potholes and snow drifts in through windows empty of glass no shops are open , so families are sharing what they have with relatives and neighbors many of the dead and injured are those who risked foraging for food fearing the snipers merciless eyes , families resorted last week to throwing bread across rooftops , or breaking through communal walls to pass unseen escape was virtually impossible the syrians have dug a huge trench around most of the district , and let virtually nobody in or out , ms colvin wrote she herself left lebanon for syria on feb 14 on her final night in beirut , she had been waiting around for a telephone call from the smugglers telling her where and when they would meet her and her irish photographer , paul conroy at first , the rendezvous with the smugglers had been set for monday night , feb 13 , outside the great mosque in beirut s main square , and then switched to later at her hotel then silence when i called her around 9 30 , she said she was sitting in her hotel room in black winter long johns borrowed from a male colleague joking about how the yfront would not do her much good if i take off the long johns and go out to dinner with you , they will definitely call , she told me sure enough , as soon as she changed clothes , the smugglers taking her across the border called to postpone the trip until the next morning ms colvin , 56 , was intimately familiar with risk , wearing a distinctive black eyepatch since she lost an eye while crossing between enemy lines in sri lanka in 2001 she had been raised in the town of oyster bay on long island , graduated from yale in 1978 with a degree in anthropology , and began her journalism career as a overnight reporter covering the police beat in new york for the upi news agency at 30 , she was recruited by the sunday times to report from the middle east one always bumped into her angling to get into places whose residents and almost anybody else were desperate to escape the list of wars she had covered over 25 years ringed the globe the balkans , the middle east , somalia , afghanistan , southeast asia and east timor nothing seemed to deter her , john witherow , editor of the sunday times , said in a note to the newspaper s staff on wednesday jon swain , an experienced foreign correspondent at the paper when ms colvin started work there , said that early on she showed gutsy determination , a sense of humor and the bravery that would mark her career in her commitment to document conflict , especially the horrors visited on civilians , the arab world inspired in her a particular sense of purpose she delved into the arab uprisings with zeal , and her last journalistic coups included being one of three reporters granted an audience with the libyan leader , col muammar elqaddafi , who avowed that his people loved him even as the country erupted in flames we can and do make a difference in exposing the horrors of war and especially the atrocities that befall civilians , she said in a speech last year in london honoring correspondents killed in the line of work our mission is to report these horrors of war with accuracy and without prejudice , she said we always have to ask ourselves whether the level of risk is worth the story what is bravery , and what is bravado \? the many difficult choices made while covering a war , she noted then , sometimes resulted in the ultimate sacrifice remi ochlik , 28 , a french photojournalist , died alongside ms colvin when bombs pulverized the building within an embattled homs neighborhood where they had been working during our beirut dinner , ms colvin reminisced about the time when we had both been stuck in the intercontinental hotel in amman , jordan , under similar circumstances in september 1996 , waiting for official visas to get into iraq while waiting , ms colvin had interviewed some iraqi refugees who went into gory detail about how the sons of president saddam hussein had killed their two brothersinlaw when the two men unexpectedly returned to baghdad after seeking asylum in jordan  when official visas for the press corps came through to baghdad several days later , ms colvin was one of the few reporters denied one i remember people griping that the story was much too bloody , but it turned out that was barely the half of it , ms colvin recalled last week the photographer she was to travel with , mr conroy , showed up late for the dinner they talked briefly about their plans and about the coming danger they recalled living under shell fire for six weeks last year in the besieged libyan city of misurata mr conroy had just received a facebook message from one of the libyan doctors who had helped them find a place to shelter in the hospital the doctor grousing that it had taken him forever to work through all the irish paul conroys on facebook before finding the right one but ms colvin told me that she had an new appointment with the smugglers in the morning , and this time she had a telephone number to call , giving her the sense that the trip to homs on feb 14 would happen before i was apprehensive , but now i m restless , she said , as we walked up the stairs back into the hotel for the night i just want to get in there and get it over with and get out read ms colvin s final report from syria   full coverage of the deaths of ms colvin and , a french photographer , and on
washington american negotiators , heading into a crucial round of talks with over its next week in baghdad , are allowing themselves a rare emotion after more than a decade of fruitless haggling with tehran hope with signs that than it has been in years to make a deal , senior obama administration officials said the united states and five other major powers were prepared to offer a package of inducements to obtain a verifiable agreement to suspend its efforts to enrich uranium closer to weapons grade these gestures , the officials said , could include easing restrictions on things like airplane parts and technical assistance to iran s energy industry , but not the sweeping sanctions on oil exports , which officials said would go into effect on schedule in july the oil sanctions , which the iranians are seeking desperately to avoid , are one of several factors that american officials believe may make tehran more amenable to exploring a diplomatic solution in addition , the recent decline in oil prices has magnified the pain of the existing sanctions on iran a has strengthened the hand of its hawkish leader , prime minister benjamin netanyahu and americans believe that recent blustery statements from iranian officials are laying the groundwork for concessions by tehran none of this guarantees success several officials played down the prospect of a major breakthrough from the meeting on wednesday , which will include britain , france , germany , russia and china , in addition to the united states mr netanyahu on friday repeated his skepticism that there would be any progress but american officials said that at a minimum , the baghdad meeting should be a genuine test of iran s willingness to do more than talk they 're nervous enough to talk , said a senior administration official , speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the negotiations whether they 're nervous enough to act , we do n't know yet another senior official said , we have a tail wind going into this for , the stakes are huge a successful meeting could prolong the diplomatic dance with tehran , delaying any possible military confrontation over the nuclear program until after the presidential election it could also keep a lid on oil prices , which fell again this week in part because of the decrease in tensions lower gasoline prices would aid the economic recovery in the united states , and mr obama s electoral prospects in a sign of the increased diplomatic efforts , the said friday that its director general , yukiya amano , would travel to tehran on sunday to try to negotiate access to a military site where iran is suspected of having conducted tests on nuclearweapons triggers it would be the first visit by the agency s head to iran since 2009 , and it could add to the momentum in baghdad the iranians are in the position of needing to pursue diplomacy , if anything , even more than they did before , said dennis b ross , one of mr obama s senior advisers on iran until last year and now at the washington institute for near east policy it s not like they have any other good news right now moreover , mr ross said , iran s recent statements signal that its leaders are preparing their domestic audience for concessions iranian officials have declared that the west has effectively endorsed iran s right to enrich uranium , a step they portrayed as a major strategic coup american officials insist the united states has not done that and has been deliberately ambiguous about whether it would ever grant iran the right to enrichment still , as mr ross said , if you 're looking for a way to present a compromise , you want to present it as a victory like other experts , he added a cautionary note after an initial meeting in istanbul last month that served mainly to test if iran was willing to talk seriously about its nuclear program , the united states and its partners must now get into the kinds of nittygritty issues that torpedoed previous negotiations with iran the major powers' initial goal is to halt the activity that most alarms israel the spinning of thousands of centrifuges to enrich uranium to 20 percent purity , which is within striking distance of the level needed to fuel a nuclear weapon that would buy time for negotiations over the ultimate fate of a program that iran claims is for peaceful energy purposes , but that the united states and israel fear is in pursuit of at least a capability in addition to halting enrichment , officials said , iran must agree to ship out its stockpiles of 20 percent uranium and to cease operations at an enrichment facility buried in a mountainside near the holy city of qum , which israel says could soon be impregnable to an airstrike if iran agrees to those interim steps , officials said , the talks could shift from highprofile meetings once a month to more regular meetings , at working levels , where officials could delve into technical details , like how to ship out the uranium or monitor iran s suspension of operations at the plant near qum , known as fordo european union and iranian officials have already met in geneva to prepare the agenda for the meeting in baghdad you could really use the summer to have weekly , if not daily , meetings to get to the point where the us could say , we think there is a deal out there to avoid war , ' said r nicholas burns , who led talks with iran under president george w bush and is now a professor at harvard but , he added , the obama administration has also got to be willing to walk away from it on tuesday , the american ambassador to israel , that the united states not only was willing to use military force to prevent iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon , but had made preparations to do so and mr netanyahu s public position on the negotiations has remain unchanged , while his ability to order military action may actually be enhanced by his new , broader coalition , analysts said in his comments on friday , mr netanyahu reiterated his demand that iran cease all enrichment , even to 35 percent purity ship out all stockpiles of enriched uranium and dismantle , rather than simply switch off , the fordo facility when this goal is achieved , i will be the first to applaud , he said during a visit to prague until then , count me among the skeptics analysts said it was hard to gauge what kinds of concessions from the western nations , russia and china would draw a positive response from iran , beyond lifting the oil embargo european officials have suggested that the european union could suspend that has had a far swifter effect on iran s sales elsewhere in the world than originally intended the major powers , officials said , are also likely to offer a variation on an earlier proposal to enrich uranium removed from iran and ship it back into the country for use in medical research
reno , nev apple \? the outdoors \? bowling \? as reno , that other city in nevada , seeks to move beyond an economy and a downtown dominated for decades by mammoth casinos , it is grasping at various possibilities that have little to do with the industry that defined it apple announced in late june that it would build a 1 billion data center here , even as reno was cementing its reputation as one of the country s bowling meccas by hosting several tournaments at the 78lane national bowling stadium meanwhile , an advertising campaign promoting the area s outdoor activities is aimed at a diverse array of tourists , including , for the first time , samesex couples what s your passion \? asks the campaign , which has nearly no mention of gambling the arrival of indian casinos and the spread of statesanctioned gambling across the nation have cut deeply into the revenues of former monopolies on legalized gambling like las vegas and atlantic city but none was as devastated as reno , whose customers came mostly from the bay area and other corners of california instead of driving a couple hundred miles and crossing the sierra nevada , californians just headed for slot machines at indian casinos close to home in what many here considered a sign of the times , downtown reno s showcase gambling establishment , the a 35story , 1 , 700room giant whose opening in 1995 was supposed to usher in a new golden age for the city filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late may its owners have said the filing will not affect operations , a pledge seemingly reinforced by announcements of the coming acts , including cheap trick on aug 3 , on a billboard next to its 120foot replica of a mining rig other fading casinos and some empty buildings loom over a small downtown that has been largely abandoned by residents reno , which was also hit particularly hard during the housing crisis , has struggled to reinvent itself precisely because it has been a singleindustry city , experts say even before gambling , reno made a name for itself by offering quick divorces , but it also lost that business in the 1960s after other states loosened restrictions on divorce reno has had it easy until recently because it had a monopoly on things that were illegal in the other states , said alicia barber , a historian at the university of nevada , reno , and the author of reno s big gamble but now it s facing tough questions for the first time it s like a child star that still wants the world s attention after peaking in 2000 , when indian casino gambling took off in california , gambling revenues in reno have fallen by a third what is more , gambling revenues per square foot of floor space are down nearly a quarter , according to the center for gaming research at the university of nevada , las vegas city officials and experts say that gambling will not disappear from reno , but that its importance to the city , as well as its influence , has been waning wanting to keep gamblers inside their buildings , hotel casinos did not support and sometimes opposed the development of other city attractions , businesspeople say they had little interest in the university of nevada , reno , whose campus lies just a few blocks north of downtown , because students have little money to gamble in the past , we had hotels turn down our business because they did n't want bowler groups , said joe kelley , the general manager of the national bowling stadium until around 2000 , mr kelley said , a dozen tour buses would arrive daily at the silver legacy or the eldorado next door as the patrons got off the bus , he said , somebody would hand them a roll of quarters and a coupon for the buffet every morning and the buses , they do n't come here anymore so they look to us to fill their property also completed in 1995 , the bowling stadium is scheduled to undergo a 15 million renovation , including the addition of 10 lanes last month , the united states bowling congress agreed to hold championship tournaments here through 2030 christopher baum , the chief executive of the renosparks convention and visitors authority , which owns the stadium , said bowling would be a cornerstone of the new reno the emphasis on bowling was in keeping with the what s your passion \? campaign to rebrand reno as a destination for activities other than gambling , said mr baum , who was recruited here half a year ago from the detroit metro convention and visitors bureau reno is much easier to sell than detroit because you do n't have a negative to overcome as much as a lack of information , he said but like detroit , reno is also wrestling with the future of its downtown the construction of several giant hotel casinos in the 1970s pushed residents out of the area , a trend that culminated with the closing of its last supermarket when the silver legacy was completed , said ms barber , the historian downtown has become a major issue in local politics the reality is that the casinos are never going to be as successful as they once were , so what do you do with those big buildings downtown \? said bernie carter , a candidate for the city council mr carter is the biggest developer in midtown , a district just south of downtown where young entrepreneurs have opened restaurants and cafes in the last couple of years the emerging district , formerly dotted with xrated shops and checkcashing businesses , is fueling hopes that residents will gravitate downtown to patronize nongambling establishments commrow , a major downtown developer , is transforming three former casino buildings into a hotel and restaurants , said dean hanson , the general manager only a fourth building will be renovated into a small new casino but city officials and businesspeople say that only new jobs downtown will attract locals in recent years , they say , most casinos that were converted into condominiums have done poorly because of the housing crisis and a lack of incentives for living downtown andrew clinger , the city manager , said apple would help besides a data storage center on the city s outskirts , apple will open an office downtown in a new building that may house other technology companies the city is wooing critics have said that overly generous tax breaks were given to attract apple , but mr clinger said the benefits could extend beyond future revenues and jobs by changing reno s image attracting an international icon to reno puts us on the map , mr clinger said , adding that the new building would also help change downtown s landscape by replacing seedy motels that are there now but others say it will take more than apple to change downtown , much less reno the recent announcement by apple is a positive sign , said mark nichols , the acting chairman of the economics department at the university of nevada , reno but , frankly , it s not really obvious what reno s new direction will be
the comedian jeffrey ross says that the tradition of the celebrity roast is one of the last bastions of free speech but he s not looking to go to battle over a bit he performed at a recent tribute to roseanne barr that invoked the deadly shootings in an aurora , colo , movie theater material that comedy central will not show when the tribute event is broadcast on sunday i didn t intend for that joke to be part of the broadcast , mr ross said in an interview on monday evening those roasts are very bawdy there s a lot of my comedy friends in the audience , and my experience is that they put the biggest jokes in the show i m ok with that the comedy central roast of roseanne , the latest in that cable channel s series of loving if insultladen commemorations of celebrities like donald trump , charlie sheen and joan rivers , was taped last saturday in los angeles there , mr ross , a longtime roast performer , delivered a couple of jokes that compared seth green , the actor and fellow roaster , to the accused aurora gunman james e holmes congratulations , mr ross told mr green , according to an account of the roast at ewcom this is actually a really big night for you you haven t gotten this much attention since you shot all those people in aurora when that line drew an uncomfortable response from the audience , mr ross said he was kidding and added you re not like james holmes at least he s doing something in a movie theater that people remember industry trade publications like the hollywood reporter and deadline hollywood said that comedy central would not show these jokes when the roast of roseanne is shown on television \( in an email , a representative for the cable channel confirmed the reports \) mr ross , 46 , said in the interview that he was comfortable with comedy central s decision , noting that the material had already got a lot of play on the internet asked how he decides before a roast what is or is not an appropriate joke to tell , mr ross answered i think if it s done thoughtfully it s appropriate if it s done carelessly , it s inappropriate , and i always put a lot of thought behind these roasts i work weeks on my speech and my performance i go in gunsablazing you don t bring a knife to a gunfight at this same event mr ross dressed as joe paterno , the disgraced former penn state football coach who died in january \( at the roast of mr sheen last year , mr ross showed up as the libyan dictator muammar elqaddafi \) explaining the paterno costume this year , mr ross said , my intention certainly wasn t to glorify joe paterno i think about mel brooks and the way he ridicules the nazis in his movies you re not going to get back at anyone you can never kill the nazis but you can get your revenge through making fun of them nonetheless , mr ross said that in advance of the roast he had consulted with his sister , who he said works as a specialeducation teacher , because he was having second thoughts about the outfit as mr ross recalled the conversation she said , when we were growing up in new jersey , how many people did we know were victims of abuse \? and i thought about it and i said none and she said , because nobody talked about it and now people are talking about it and comedians have a responsibility to shine on a light on it he added when i see something that s sensitive , i go , you ve got to put that out there you need to keep the dialogue going and shine a light on the bad guys if you sweep it under the carpet , people forget about it people stop talking about it \( deadline hollywood said that comedy central had not yet decided whether to show his closing joke now i m going to take seth green and hit the showers ! \) mr ross will continue to be a prominent personality on comedy central in the weeks ahead in addition to his appearance on the roast of roseanne , he has a new special , jeff ross roasts america , making its debut on saturday , and a sixepisode series , the burn with jeff ross , starting aug 14 for these projects , he has filmed himself flinging oneliners at celebrity pals like sarah silverman and john stamos , as well as people he encounters around los angeles \( mr ross recounted telling a meter maid , why don t you write something useful , like a suicide note \? \) the tradition of the roast as a place to tell potentially offensive jokes would endure , mr ross said , because people love to see public figures get taken down a notch , and by the same token , everyone loves to be the center of attention , even when there s a target on their forehead any uproar over his excised jokes about the shooting would probably be shortlived , mr ross predicted society should be more focused on guns that kill instead of jokes that sting , he said i m not hurting anybody comedy s all about innuendo i m putting out there just like anybody else that he could not actually get these particular jokes out to a television audience was beside the point , mr ross said he pointed to an incident that occurred at a 2010 comedy central roast of david hasselhoff , where , while mr ross was wearing a minimal baywatch style bathing suit , he accidentally exposed himself bad taste is not a crime , mr ross said that doesn t mean it has to be broadcast
beirut , lebanon spillover from the syrian conflict hit lebanon in a frightening new way on wednesday with the abduction of more than 30 syrians inside lebanese territory , which their captors called revenge for the kidnapping of a relative inside  members of a powerful lebanese shiite family who captured the syrians , displayed in a video shown on lebanese television , threatened to cause havoc in the streets and conduct an extended kidnapping spree in lebanon until their family member , taken hostage by syrian rebels , was set free the next few hours and next few days will determine what will happen , one masked captor said outside a family property in a shiite suburb of beirut another member of the family that captured the syrians , hatem almikdad , brother of the lebanese hostage in syria , said that if he was not released soon , we will kill all of them anxiety quickly spread through lebanon about instability , and extra security precautions were taken in beirut lebanese officials said additional guards had been assigned to the embassies of qatar , saudi arabia and turkey , the main allies of the syrian insurgency saudi arabia , qatar and kuwait advised their citizens to leave lebanon while the circumstances of the kidnappings were in dispute , the events reflected lebanon s vulnerability to violence reverberating from syria s nearly 18monthold uprising against president extended families with differing allegiances straddle both countries , and the use of hostages signaled the rise of abduction as a tactic by antagonists in the conflict lebanon s divided government , often unwilling to confront private militias , has already been shaken by clashes between supporters and opponents of the syrian government , especially near the border neither the police nor the army responded to the abductions , and officials remained silent even as shiite militias blocked beirut s airport road fears of further abductions increased as lebanese television reported that shelling and airstrikes by the syrian military in azaz , north of aleppo , syria s largest city , had killed some or all of the 11 lebanese pilgrims kidnapped by rebels in may activists said many more people might have been killed in azaz those assertions could not be independently verified the families of the 11 lebanese pilgrims , angered by reports from azaz , also began kidnapping syrians they delivered three men to the mikdad family compound here , parading them before lebanese television cameras all three , looking stunned , said they had worked for a shipping company owned by a businessman from aleppo two said they had helped the syrian opposition by sending media reports from lebanon the third accused israel of creating unrest in syria and said , i have nothing to do with all of this in interviews with reporters , the relatives of the lebanese man kidnapped on monday , hassan salim almikdad , said that they had taken the hostages to avenge his abduction mr mikdad s captors , in an posted monday night , said he was a sniper from hezbollah , the lebanese shiite militant political organization , sent to support loyalists of mr assad , a hezbollah ally hezbollah denied that mr mikdad was a member , and his family said he had moved to damascus to escape personal debts they said he had settled the matter and was en route home when he was kidnapped hatem almikdad , his brother , carrying a pistol in the back of his black pants , said he had communicated with the kidnappers and believed his brother was safe some mikdad relatives , members of a powerful shiite tribe in the bekaa valley near the syrian border where the captives appeared to have been caught and held said that they did not intend to spread syria s war we just want to get him released , one relative said in an interview with al mayadeen , the panarab television network based in beirut , as a dozen camouflaged men with automatic weapons surrounded the hostages the captors called them members of the free syrian army , the main armed group fighting mr assad s forces the free syrian army has denied any role in mr mikdad s abduction , but soon after the mikdad family announced its own kidnappings , another lebanese family said its son had been kidnapped in syria the mikdad family said it had also kidnapped a turkish man , and warned that saudis in lebanon would be targeted several analysts said the abductions might just be the beginning we could be heading toward chaos and an uncontrollable security situation , said talal atrissi , an analyst in beirut the kidnappings came as fighting in syria was punctuated by shellings and clashes in several cities a diesel tanker exploded outside the dama rose hotel in damascus , used by the dwindling united nations mission insurgents claimed responsibility and said the intended target was a military depot nearby none of the united nations staff members were hurt , a spokeswoman said the ability of the insurgents to plant the explosives appeared to reflect a breakdown in security unthinkable in the syrian capital before the revolt it was at least the third bomb attack of the past two weeks in aleppo , reporters saw an l39 fighter jet and mi8 helicopters of the syrian air force firing rockets at a central neighborhood of the city , a battleground for the past three weeks artillery blasts could be heard all day the casualties and damage in azaz , near the turkish border , appeared to be extensive the syrian observatory for human rights , an activist group based in britain , said at least 20 people were killed , including women and children video showed mangled bodies buried under rubble , and activists said many of the wounded were ferried to turkey i could n't count the number of dead , but we brought trucks to dig and to pick up the bodies , said aswad , an activist in azaz who spoke on the condition that her full name not be used for security reasons aswad also denied claims that the 11 lebanese pilgrims were among the casualties , saying their captors had relocated them three days earlier that message did not appear to resonate through much of lebanon as families of the 11 pilgrims prayed for positive news in beirut , the mikdad family told reporters at its compound to leave several men carrying kalashnikov rifles could be seen removing the license plates from their cars , and driving into the city
we don t yet know whether our economy will take the icy plunge off the fiscal cliff , but do we know this at present course and speed , any budget deal that emerges from the intense brinkmanship now under way would fall short of every sensible ambition for fiscal reform forget about balancing the budget forget about paying down any of the government s 11 trillion of obligations \( the debt owed to the public \) nor will the package currently being discussed achieve the minimal target of centrist deficit hawks \( myself among them \) , that of stabilizing the rate in which the national debt is growing in relation to the economy battered by four years of trilliondollarplus deficits , this debttogdp ratio has climbed from 36 percent in 2007 to 73 percent at present halting its rise would require at least 4 trillion of revenue increases and spending reductions \( including the nearly 1 trillion of savings enacted last year \) over the next decade president obama has put on the table a package that should be commended for its willingness to both increase taxes on the wealthy and at least dent the mushrooming costs of entitlement programs , most importantly medicare but scored fairly , the obama plan would contribute about 3 trillion to lower projected deficits , at least 1 trillion short of what s needed the republicans are much further from the mark , having not yet even put forward a formal plan however , none of the intimations from their leaders suggest that their plan will exceed the white house s in size while the republicans have importantly conceded on the need for tax increases , they ve vociferously objected to mr obama s proposed 16 trillion in added revenue as excessive on sunday , the house speaker , john a boehner , said that he would support around 800 billion of new revenue over the next decade , similar to what he offered during budget negotiations with mr obama in july and on the spending side , while criticizing mr obama s proposals as too timid , the policy changes that the republicans have endorsed such as raising the medicare retirement age and slowing costofliving increases for social security fall well short of mr obama s both sides appear more interested in reaching an understanding that avoids the cliff than in achieving the full range of necessary reforms and forget about the huge overhaul of our rube goldberg tax system and government spending priorities dreamed about by fiscal reformers what s likely to emerge will be better described as tweaks , and maybe not so many of those the bible of deficit hawks the report of the simpsonbowles commission now feels quaint , with its talk about rewriting the tax code to eliminate loopholes and lower rates , not to mention its call to revamp federal spending to emphasize investment programs that will aid american competitiveness and growth perhaps a surge of courage will inspire congress and the white house to embrace more sweeping change but the brutal process of stabilizing america s fiscal problem is so charged with political peril , for congress and the white house alike , that the willingness to go big and to go bold seems likely only to diminish as the cliff steadily approaches
pressures from unexpected quarters continued to build on congress to strengthen the country s porous gun laws progun legislators expressed support for stronger rules a prominent private equity firm of the company that makes the bushmaster rifle , which was used in the mass shooting of 20 children and seven adults in connecticut on friday bit by bit , it began to seem possible , at long last , that lawmakers who say they do not want guns to wind up in the hands of criminals , the mentally ill and others who cannot be trusted with them will do the one thing that would be most effective at achieving that goal , and the one thing the gun lobby does not want requiring background checks for all gun sales the brady gun control law , named for the white house official who was shot during an assassination attempt on president ronald reagan , requires licensed gun dealers to screen all prospective gun buyers through a federal database of convicted felons , drug abusers , people with a serious mental illness and others in addition , the law requires licensed dealers to collect information about buyers that can be used later to trace guns that were used in crimes from 1994 to 2009 , those checks have prevented nearly two million gun sales , according to the justice department but the law does not cover private sales of guns , including transactions by occasional sellers at gun shows and flea markets , in what has become a gaping loophole that has allowed teenagers , ordinary criminals , terrorists , mexican drug cartels and arms traffickers to have easy access to weapons for instance , firearms bought at gun shows in the columbine school shooting they in a shipment of arms supplies to the lebanese terrorist group hezbollah and they have made their way to mexico but none of those examples have stopped the national rifle association and its supporters in congress from blocking legislation that would require private sellers to run buyers through background checks , which take just a few minutes to process on the telephone the nra , emboldened by a supreme court ruling asserting an individual constitutional right to bear arms , has turned its attention to further broadening the market , lobbying state legislatures to allow concealed weapons in churches , schools and other public places and to restrict the discretion of local police in granting gun permits in the case of background checks on private sales , the nra has argued that checks are not needed because surveys of criminals suggest that just 2 percent of them buy their weapons from gun shows this is a highly disingenuous argument because criminals most often purchase firearms from relatives , friends and associates many of those people , in turn , get their supplies from gun shows and elsewhere , including on the internet where anybody with a credit card can order semiautomatic weapons for overnight delivery requiring background checks for private sales will obviously not , on its own , keep people like adam lanza , the 20yearold who perpetrated the massacre in newtown , conn , away from deadly weapons for starters , only buyers of guns , not members of the families who own them \( as was true in his case \) , are screened against the database known as the  moreover , many state governments and federal agencies have provided to the system for various logistical , legal and financial reasons but those flaws and limitations should not be a reason for lawmakers to exempt sales at gun shows , flea markets and at other venues from background checks , which are a simple and effective way to prevent many violent individuals from getting access to guns since the newtown shootings , the influence and power of the nra may have diminished as some of its usual allies have distanced themselves from its hardline position cerberus capital management , a private equity firm , that it would sell its stake in freedom group , the maker of the bushmaster rifle and a democratic state lawmaker in california , kevin de le n , that would require people buying ammunition to go through background checks these are small but promising shoots it is up to congress and president obama to nurture them
i have to confess i have spent the last nine months having a series of crushes on absolutely the wrong people hypocrites , philanderers , zealots the more inappropriate their behavior , the more i would swoon sure , it felt funny to say you go , girl when michele bachmann announced that she d heard that the antihpv vaccination causes mental retardation i tried to explain to my friends that newt s colony on the moon would make our country great again , bring down gas prices , or cure unemployment \( surely a few of those nineyearold janitors could get hired up there someday \) as each candidate dropped by the wayside , i would flit capriciously to the next , hoping that this would be the one , a relationship that could flourish on its own terms and not be turned into roadkill by the romney money machine my first campaign crush was michele bachmann , winner of the iowa straw poll so very long ago she said she shared the same hometown with john wayne , mistaking him for john wayne gacy jr , the pedophile mass murderer she saluted the founding fathers for working tirelessly to end slavery god told her to be a tax lawyer for the irs , one of the oddest deific decrees on record she declared that americans are tired of seeing congress spend their hardearned tax dollars as though it were monopoly money , but presumably her husband got genuine federal greenbacks for his moral counseling business , which appears to be mainly preoccupied with curing gayness unmoored from facts , history or logic , michele bachmann was my dream girl she was fun she was dangerous she was everything my parents had warned me against i had hoped she would rescue the republicans from mitt , but it was not to be once michele ended it , i made a quick rebound to rick perry i know you re not supposed to do that , but perry was an aggie yell leader , a texas governor , a prodigious death warrant signer who was it in my past that he reminded me of \? of course , it was 2000 all over again , but without all that compassionate conservative sweet talk then perry started letting it rip he made bachmann sound like hannah arendt he declared turkey an islamic terrorist state he was going to cut three agencies , but he could only remember 1 , maybe 2 he thought the voting age was 21 and that the election was held on a wednesday rick made fun of himself and i hoped the republicans would be good sports , but they weren t if only he had just stood there combing his hair , like elvis my next unlikely crush was on herman cain we need not linger remember the 999 plan you had to love its elegant simplemindedness the other voters did too and for a few weeks , herman surged to the front cain was proudly ignorant of who might be the leader of \( our strategic ally in the afghan campaign , but never mind \) uzbekeebekeestanstan but a crazy plan and a willful indifference to world politics didn t do him in it was a string of groped women that kept on growing whether the number of women made it up to to his talismanic nine , we will never know the ranks were thinning ron paul scared me i was looking for adventure , but going back to the gold standard was a little rich for my blood jon huntsman tried to appeal to my intelligence he never spoke to me , in chinese or otherwise if jon huntsman were the answer , then why not just go all the way to making your parents happy with mitt romney suddenly , the libidinous , hypocritical grandiosity of newt gingrich started to look pretty interesting left wife number one when she got cancer left wife number two when she got ms asked for an open marriage didn t get it willing to spend heavily at tiffany s for wife number three became a catholic and a champion of family values got testy when anyone asked him about whether there might be an issue there perfect newt was inevitable he said so himself i kept hoping that after south carolina , newt would trim his sails , keep quiet and behave like a normal person for just a few weeks but flush with success , newt had to be newt he wanted that colony on the moon , but no one knew why he looked forward to a series of marathon lincolndouglasstyle debates with president obama so did i it was not to be his campaign ended with a whimper , with gingrich bitten by a penguin in the zoo and inundated by campaign debts finally , i turned my lonely eyes to the little engine that could , rick santorum , the world s happiest medieval man sweater vests have never been sexy , true , but fashion is fickle i used to get a bit mistyeyed about his obstinate , quixotic belief that deeply held principles , like opposing contraception , can defeat a mountain of money , a nearunanimous republican establishment and eight years of organizational infrastructure you have to love the dreamers , but it never works out five headoverheels flings in less than a year looking back , do i feel that i exercised poor judgment \? i suppose should it have been obvious that none of these people was appropriate \? of course did my friends all warn me \? they did now that it is time to get back to my real life , i ask myself , was it all worth it \?

washington in what could prove to be one of their most farreaching decisions , psychiatrists and other specialists who are rewriting the manual that serves as the nation s arbiter of mental illness have agreed to revise the definition of addiction , which could result in millions more people being diagnosed as addicts and pose huge consequences for health insurers and taxpayers the revision to the manual , known as the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , or dsm , would expand the list of recognized symptoms for drug and alcohol addiction , while also reducing the number of symptoms required for a diagnosis , according to proposed changes posted on the web site of the american psychiatric association , which produces the book in addition , the manual for the first time would include gambling as an addiction , and it might introduce a catchall category behavioral addiction not otherwise specified that some public health experts warn would be too readily used by doctors , despite a dearth of research , to diagnose addictions to shopping , sex , using the internet or playing video games part medical guidebook , part legal reference , the manual has long been embraced by government and industry it dictates whether insurers , including and , will pay for treatment , and whether schools will expand financing for certain specialeducation services courts use it to assess whether a criminal defendant is mentally impaired , and pharmaceutical companies rely on it to guide their research the broader language involving addiction , which was debated this week at the association s annual conference , is intended to promote more accurate diagnoses , earlier intervention and better outcomes , the association said the biggest problem in all of psychiatry is untreated illness , and that has huge social costs , said dr james h scully jr , chief executive of the group but the addiction revisions in the manual , scheduled for release in may 2013 , have already provoked controversy similar to concerns previously raised about proposals on autism , depression and other conditions critics worry that changes to the definitions of these conditions would also sharply alter the number of people with diagnoses while the association says that the addiction definition changes would lead to health care savings in the long run , some economists say that 20 million substance abusers could be newly categorized as addicts , costing hundreds of millions of dollars in additional expenses the chances of getting a diagnosis are going to be much greater , and this will artificially inflate the statistics considerably , said thomas f babor , a psychiatric epidemiologist at the university of connecticut who is an editor of the international journal addiction many of those who get addiction diagnoses under the new guidelines would have only a mild problem , he said , and scarce resources for drug treatment in schools , prisons and health care settings would be misdirected these sorts of diagnoses could be a real embarrassment , dr babor added the scientific review panel of the psychiatric association has demanded more evidence to support the revisions on addiction , but several researchers involved with the manual have said that the panel is not likely to change its proposal significantly the controversies about the revisions have highlighted the outsize influence of the manual , which brings in more than 5 million annually to the association and is written by a group of 162 specialists in relative secrecy besieged from all sides , the association has received about 25 , 000 comments on the proposed changes from treatment centers , hospital representatives , government agencies , advocates for patient groups and researchers the organization has declined to make these comments public while other medical specialties rely on similar diagnostic manuals , none have such influence the dsm is distinct from all other diagnostic manuals because it has an enormous , perhaps too large , impact on society and millions of people s lives , said dr allen j frances , a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at duke , who oversaw the writing of the current version of the manual and worked on previous editions unlike many other fields , psychiatric illnesses have no clear biological gold standard for diagnosing them they present in different ways , and illnesses often overlap with each other dr frances has been one of the most outspoken critics of the new draft version , saying that overly broad and vaguely worded definitions will create more false epidemics and medicalization of everyday behavior like some others , he has also questioned whether a private association , whose members stand to gain from treating more patients , should be writing the manual , rather than an independent group or a federal agency under the new criteria , people who often drink more than intended and crave alcohol may be considered mild addicts under the old criteria , more serious symptoms , like repeatedly missing work or school , being arrested or driving under the influence , were required before a person could receive a diagnosis as an alcohol abuser dr george e woody , a professor of psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine , said that by describing addiction as a spectrum , the manual would reflect more accurately the distinction between occasional drug users and fullblown addicts currently , only about 2 million of the nation s more than 22 million addicts get treatment , partly because many of them lack health insurance dr keith humphreys , a psychology professor at stanford who specializes in health care policy and who served as a drug control policy adviser to the white house from 2009 to 2010 , predicted that as many as 20 million people who were previously not recognized as having a substance abuse problem would probably be included under the new definition , with the biggest increase among people who are unhealthy users , rather than severe abusers , of drugs this represents the single biggest expansion in the quality and quantity of addiction treatment this country has seen in 40 years , dr humphreys said , adding that the new may allow an additional 30 million people who abuse drugs or alcohol to gain insurance coverage and access to treatment some economists have said that the number could be much lower , though , because many insurers will avoid or limit coverage of addiction treatment the savings from early intervention usually show up within a year , dr humphreys said , and most patients with a new diagnosis would get consultations with nurses , doctors or therapists , rather than expensive prescriptions for medicines typically reserved for more severe abusers many scholars believe that the new manual will increase addiction rates a study by australian researchers found , for example , that about 60 percent more people would be considered addicted to alcohol under the new manual s standards association officials expressed doubt , however , that the expanded addiction definitions would sharply increase the number of new patients , and they said that identifying abusers sooner could prevent serious complications and expensive hospitalizations we can treat them earlier , said dr charles p o'brien , a professor of psychiatry at the university of pennsylvania and the head of the group of researchers devising the manual s new addiction standards and we can stop them from getting to the point where they 're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants some critics of the new manual have said that it has been tainted by researchers' ties to pharmaceutical companies the ties between the dsm panel members and the pharmaceutical industry are so extensive that there is the real risk of corrupting the public health mission of the manual , said dr lisa cosgrove , a fellow at the edmond j safra center for ethics at harvard , who published a study in march that said twothirds of the manual s advisory task force members reported ties to the pharmaceutical industry or other financial conflicts of interest dr scully , the association s chief , said the group had required researchers involved with writing the manual to disclose more about financial conflicts of interest than was previously required dr o'brien , who led the addiction working group , has been a consultant for several pharmaceutical companies , including pfizer , glaxosmithkline and sanofiaventis , all of which make drugs marketed to combat addiction he has also worked extensively as a paid consultant for alkermes , a pharmaceutical company , studying a drug , vivitrol , that combats alcohol and heroin addiction by preventing craving he was the driving force behind adding craving to the new manual s list of recognized symptoms of addiction i'm quite proud to have played a role , because i know that craving plays such an important role in addiction , dr o'brien said , adding that he had never made any money from the sale of drugs that treat craving dr howard b moss , associate director for clinical and translational research at the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism , in bethesda , md , described opposition from many researchers to adding craving as a symptom of addiction he added that he quit the group working on the addiction chapter partly out of frustration with what he described as a lack of scientific basis in the decision making the more people diagnosed with cravings , dr moss said , the more sales of anticraving drugs like vivitrol or naltrexone
we continue our presidential geography series , a onebyone examination of the peculiarities that drive the politics in all 50 states and the district of columbia here is hawaii , the aloha state fivethirtyeight spoke with , a former political science professor at the university of hawaii , and , a democratic consultant and adviser to the senate campaign of representative mazie hirono , a democrat representing hawaii s second district mr winer was also the campaign manager for senator daniel k akaka , of hawaii , in 2006 the republican party has an unusual opportunity this year in hawaii , a state where democratic prospects are usually as predictably sunny as the weather but it s not mitt romney s opportunity president obama , who was born in hawaii , won his home state in 2008 by 45 percentage points , his largest margin in any state and mr obama remains an overwhelmingly popular figure here , mr winer said instead , it is the senate race in hawaii that is seen as competitive the cook political report rates the race a tossup , as does the new york times  linda lingle , a former republican governor , is mounting a wellfinanced campaign for the seat held by democratic senator daniel k akaka , who is retiring ms lingle s opposition will be one of the two major democratic candidates , mazie hirono or ed case , and will be determined in their primary election on aug 11 how unusual would a victory in november be by ms lingle \? hawaii s last republican senator was one of its first two senator hiram fong served from 1959 , when hawaii joined the union , until 1977 the senate contest in hawaii is a useful lens through which to view the state s political landscape the state is somewhere between exceedingly and overwhelmingly democratic the democratic party has controlled politics in hawaii for the most of the state s history the 2011 state of the states survey published by gallup , which measured the partisan lean of residents , pegged the democratic advantage in hawaii at 284 percentage points , behind only the district of columbia the extent of democratic dominance is embodied in the state senate , which currently has just a single republican but every now and again , a republican will win in hawaii , including ms lingle in 2002 and 2006 this is possible because in addition to being among the most democratic states , hawaii is also one of the most elastic states when the political conditions are just right , independent voters are numerous enough that , along with just enough republicans and conservative democrats , they can combine to overcome the state s leftward lean but that lean is strong democrats are aided by the state s diversity hawaii is one of just four majorityminority states , with a large \( 39 percent \) asian community and a substantial native hawaiian population \( 10 percent \) hawaii s japaneseamericans \( 14 percent of the state population \) are especially democratic , mr winer said , while the state s chineseamericans tend to be more probusiness and republican hawaii is also the fifth most urban state in terms of population ninetytwo percent of hawaii residents are in cities more than twothirds of voters live on the island of oahu , mostly in honolulu like all of hawaii , the area is democratic , but honolulu democrats are a bit more bluecollar , a bit less socially progressive and a bit more prodevelopment than democrats on the other islands , mr winer said democratic voters outside of honolulu , on the islands of maui and hawaii \( the big island \) particularly , tend to be more environmentally conscious and , accordingly , mostly opposed to significant development , mr winer said the main pocket of republican support in hawaii is the southeast corner of oahu , to the east of honolulu beginning around waialaekahala and kailua , where residents tend to be more affluent the republicans generally need three ingredients to overcome the democratic advantage in the aloha state first , they need lots of money when ms lingle was elected the state s first female governor in 2002 , she outspent her opponent by nearly a threetoone margin and so far in the 2012 campaign , ms lingle has raised plenty of cash  also , republicans need a strong candidate this is more difficult than it sounds , both mr milner and mr winer said , because promising young politicians will usually join the democratic party as the most likely route to electoral success ms lingle is certainly a strong campaigner , although she is not as wellliked as she was in the 2002 campaign , or when she won reelection in 2006 in states with a more balanced partisan makeup , money and a good candidate are often enough for victory , or at least a competitive race but in hawaii , a republican will usually need something extra you need personality , money and some further catalyst , mr winer said , something has to go wrong with the democrats in 2002 , when ms lingle was first elected , the democrats had plenty go wrong jeremy harris , the democratic mayor of honolulu , was the preferred candidate to run against ms lingle , and the field was kept mostly clear for him , mr winer said but after questions were raised about his fundraising practices , mr harris declined to run , leaving democrats discombobulated in addition , democratic members of the honolulu city council had been convicted of taking bribes and misusing campaign funds and a state senator pleaded guilty on tax evasion and campaignfinance abuse charges the bellwether honolulu county because over twothirds of voters usually cast their ballots in honolulu county , it is almost guaranteed to be a decent barometer of the statewide vote since the 2000 election , the honolulu county vote has consistently been just a few percentage points more republicanleaning than the state as a whole the bottom line the current fivethirtyeight forecast gives mr romney a 0 percent chance of winning hawaii even if mr obama were from another state , he would still be a prohibitive favorite but as a native son , mr obama will likely win around 70 percent of the vote again perhaps only the district of columbia is more assured of voting for him mr obama s coattails will likely hurt ms lingle , unless she can persuade a significant number of voters to split their ballots fivethirtyeight s official senate projections are coming soon , but at the end of 2011 we published senate odds guesstimates , and guesstimated ms lingle s electoral chances at 25 percent that seemed about right to both mr milner and mr winer although a few partisan polls have shown a close race , or even ms lingle leading , the last nonpartisan poll of the contest , conducted in midjuly by ward research for the honolulu staradvertiser and hawaii news now , found the two top democrats , ms hirono \( the congresswoman \) and mr case \( a former congressman \) , trouncing ms lingle by nearly 20 percentage points if ms lingle does win , however , there could be a big reward for her many decades in the senate hawaii voters are often more deferential to incumbents than voters in other states in 2004 , when president george w bush was seeking reelection , hawaii looked competitive enough that vice president dick cheney flew 3 , 225 miles to campaign there just days before the election the tendency to give incumbents the benefit of the doubt whether as a patriotic byproduct of the large military presence in hawaii or evidence of the state s many japaneseamerican voters is one reason that hawaii has had just five senators in its 53year history as a state and of those five senators , none were ousted at the ballot box four retired and one died 1 neat ethnic categories tell only some of the story in hawaii nearly one in four hawaii residents as two or more races , a proportion higher than any other state and exemplified by mr obama , a child of a white mother and a black father 2 it was in this area , at sandy beach park , where mr obama was during the 2008 campaign 3 ms hirono and mr case will face off in the democratic primary aug 11 4 deference to incumbents has also been observed in japanese elections the liberal democratic party in japan ruled with few interruptions from 1955 to 2009
i'm pretty certain it was six years ago i know i was in a restaurant i know , too , that i was a little tipsy that s the only way the impulse could have come to me , the only way i would have acted on it i went through the names programmed into my cellphone , looking for moms tina she was one , so she got a text message happy mother s day barbara she was one , so she got a message as well so did adelle , lisa , sylvia happy mother s day , happy mother s day , happy mother s day saying it to all those other mothers , as if that would make up for not being able to say it to my own for anyone who has lost a parent long before he or she expected to , mother s day and father s day are unsettling occasions , prompts to show appreciation that become prods to revisit grief they 're also proof that the world is full of accidental actuaries i do n't know how else to explain it the number of people who look at you and seem to calculate , correctly , that when you 're 33 years old , your mother should not yet be gone , and that there s a good chance , according to median life expectancies , that she s still around when you 're 37 and even when you 're 40 , unless she had you late did you send flowers to mom \? some acquaintance or stranger will ask a meaningless conversation filler , a verbal tic and you wo n't give the right or full answer , because no offense was intended , and none was taken you 'll smile , vaguely or nod , misleadingly or lie , politely , saying yes , then changing the topic someone else will tell you to be sure you do n't forget mom today to that , at least , your response will be honest i never do my mother did not have me late , not by today s yardsticks she was 29 and she did not leave me all that early , not by the standards of tragedy or even the bathetic tv melodramas that she 'd halfwatch on nights when the cancer or the chemo left her feeling weak , her eyelids fluttering closed as some comforting indignity was visited upon meredith baxter or veronica hamel or jaclyn smith she was 61 that s but a lot fewer than some people get she died on dec 2 , 1996 , having held on just long enough for one last boisterous family thanksgiving and , two days before , her second grandchild s birth she missed out on the births of seven more , who know her only from the stories my two brothers and and i tell them and only because we make sure of it soon after she was gone , i became acquainted with one of the oddities of not having two living parents at an age when you 're statistically likely to people assume do you kiss your mother with that mouth \? snapped a bouncer with whom i had an ineloquent dispute i did , back when i could , just often enough that it was n't among my many regrets your mother must be proud of you , said a letter from a reader who liked something i 'd written if i permitted myself a certain religious faith or degree of mysticism , i could persuade myself that she indeed was mother s day , i quickly learned , was the feast of the assumptions i say that without any rancor , but with some bafflement in a world of so many broken and untraditional families and of so much heartache , why should there be a bouquetprimed mother in the picture \? there s no point to guessing as much if i never knew exactly what to say to the people who guessed , i was even less sure how to mark the day , when i 'd always had a if logistically possible , talked with her if not usually i just moped and it s wrong , the notion that feeling sorry for yourself is counterproductive sometimes it s just the ticket but on this mother s day , i 'll trade moping for a testimonial i was i am one of the four luckiest children i know , my siblings being the other three we had a mother who held us in esteem and held us to account told us we were magnificent and told us we were miserable exhorted us to please her but found ways to forgive us when , all too frequently , we did n't and made certain that we knew she was there for us until , unimaginably , she was n't i'm 47 now , and i 've noticed that in the last few years , the actuaries out there are less prone to reminding me of her absence by wondering idly and aloud about the gift that i did or did n't remember to purchase , the call that i will or wo n't remember to make at this age and this point , there s a much diminished probability that i 'd have both parents \( i'm grateful for one \) that certainly makes mother s day easier to navigate but not easy i'm still hoping and trying for that if you 're a mom and you get a text message from me , you 'll know that the effort endures and that this testimonial did n't quite do the trick and that i 've probably opened a bottle of wine my own mother always appreciated a glass or two
davenport , iowa the 48hour flyaround campaign marathon extravaganza , as president obama called it , began today with his crowdpleasing romnesia routine and familiar pledges of more teachers and bridges but the real theme of the final two weeks , as the president and his aides made clear , is going to be trust as in , you can t trust mitt romney , and you can trust me trust matters , mr obama told the crowd of more than 3 , 000 , gathered at the mississippi valley fairgrounds this morning and here s the thing iowa , you know me you know i say what i mean and mean what i say the plea for trust \( as opposed to just a vote \) is a tough sale even to the crowds of supporters he will address in iowa , colorado , nevada , florida , virginia and ohio today and thursday most of the country is in a permanent showme mood , burned by politicians too often , and the president s biggest challenge is stimulating enthusiasm and turnout from a disillusioned base that doesn t want to hear about washington s gridlock but the obama campaign is convinced that the public will be more alienated by mr romney s wild inconsistency than by the president s own inability to fulfill all of his promises you have never seen a major party nominee this close to an election try to fudge what he is going to do as president , said david plouffe , one of the president s senior campaign aides , speaking of mr romney to reporters while cruising down an iowa interstate this is about the presidency of the united states of america it s as big as anything gets to have someone say , don t pay attention to what i said before these are huge things he added this is about trust and you cannot trust governor romney mr obama argues that he holds the same values he espoused 10 or 12 years ago , and has come through on the biggest promises he made in 2008 health care reform , millions of new jobs , a greener economy , an end to the iraq war and the coming withdrawal from afghanistan , and a focus on al qaeda that has significantly reduced its power he s hoping voters will forgive him for the growing poverty rate , the slow progress on educational achievement , and an unfulfilled immigration agenda , among other disappointments and of course there s been no discussion at all of a few other things he used to talk about , including campaign finance reform and a reduction in gun violence there will be plenty of discussion of romnesia , though , as mr obama closes out his case in the swing states he desperately needs it makes people laugh , but more importantly it helps persuade listeners that he s right on something important he has core values that are largely unchanged , while mr romney appears to have none
beginning this fall the will disperse its entire collection of warhols , donating some and selling others through christie s auction house as it shifts almost exclusively into a grantmaking organization , foundation officials said in interviews the sales will take several years to complete and are expected to garner about 100 million , increasing the foundation s endowment , from which it makes grants to nonprofit arts organizations though the foundation no longer holds any bigticket works by warhol , it still possesses a bevy of paintings , prints , photographs and drawings , some of which the public has never seen they include three targets , a large horizontal blackandwhite canvas of paint and silkscreen depicting three targets with gunshots , expected to sell for 1 million to 15 million a jacqueline kennedy collage from the 1960s , estimated at 200 , 000 to 300 , 000 and a from a '70s polaroid print , estimated at 15 , 000 to 20 , 000 under its unusual exclusive deal with christie s , to be announced thursday , the foundation will sell some of the works through live auctions , the first on nov 12 , supplemented by online auctions that will begin in february and private sales alberto mugrabi , whose family holds one of the world s largest collections of warhols , said that despite the lack of blockbuster pieces , he was concerned about the impact a sale of such scope would have i do n't think it s going to hurt prices because none of the stuff is of great significance , he said but still , it s irresponsible it s like sending masses of cattle to be slaughtered with the online auctions christie s expects to expand its internet presence as well as the geographical and demographic scope of its audience artist foundations have become an increasingly popular way for estates to control the artists' affairs after death , and they typically sell a few works a year to finance their operations , as the warhol foundation has done since its inception in 1987 in selling its remaining inventory , it has decided to focus on making grants , typically about 13 million a year with proceeds from the sales the foundation expects to increase its 225 million endowment and hopes to help fill the void left by declining private and government arts support christie s will earn a varying percentage on each sale the work will be sold at a variety of price points , with some in the milliondollar range , many under 100 , 000 and a few under 10 , 000 as a result christie s expects to attract a wide spectrum of buyers , including those who cannot easily get to new york for specific live sales remove the barrier of location and time , and you open it up to the broadest buying public possible , said amy cappellazzo , the chairwoman of postwar and contemporary development at christie s i think if andy were alive , he would have very much liked that with a mission to advance the visual arts the warhol foundation has awarded nearly 250 million in grants to hundreds of museums and other nonprofit arts groups nationwide over the last 25 years precisely how many works remain in the foundation s collection is unclear because the foundation does not make public its inventory joel wachs , the president of the foundation , said the number was in the thousands this year the foundation got out of the authentication business , partly because legal disputes over its verification process for works whose owners said they were by warhol were a financial drain that s not the way we think our time and assets should be spent , said michael straus , the foundation s chairman we 'd rather see our money go to artists than lawyers foundation executives said they settled on christie s because of its long history with the foundation its warhol expertise and its creative proposals they have a deep knowledge of warhol and his market , mr straus said there s an innovative spirit that seemed upbeat , contemporary , global in keeping with warhol s spirit for christie s the arrangement represents an attractive way to showcase its efforts to sell art over the internet , a process it has used in sales like the one of elizabeth taylor s belongings and that it hopes to expand we are looking forward to being able to make this over time available for other types of works from other sources , said steven murphy , chief executive of christie s online is now its own medium for interaction with art purchasing some people may minimize the sale as a way for the foundation to clear out warhol s lesser works the cache to be sold at the live auction in november is expected to bring about 20 million by contrast warhol s double elvis \( ferus type \) alone at sotheby s for 33 million , or 37 million with commission but christie s said that some gems remain in the collection , and that many of the smaller items have historic value , like warhol s collection of blackandwhite polaroids there is so much work that has really not been seen by most people , mr wachs said they do n't have to be the most expensive to be the best while acknowledging that there are no soup cans or marilyn in the collection , ms cappellazzo said each photograph , painting , print and drawing offers a window into warhol s creative process it is like a hologram , she said when you break it apart , even the small parts are still pure andy and have total warholismo though some might worry that such a concentration of sales will flood the market , depressing the value of warhols , christie s officials said they did not think that would occur there is an unusually great appetite for warhol worldwide , they said , and they will be measuring the pace of sales and the availability of works on the market as they decide how much of the inventory to bring forward ms cappellazo said she believes christie s now sells more warhols per year than any other artist andy is singularly one of the most important artists of the 20th century and arguably the most important artist in our market , ms cappellazzo said , adding of the many works , we feel confident that the market will absorb them
if held an alumni game for its former basketball players who went on to play in the nba , it would have to settle for a game of twoontwo and all but one of the players would be shooting a set shot that is because the list of former harvard players who have played in the nba since the 195354 season begins and ends with point guard jeremy lin , who scored 25 and 28 points for the in his last two games on his way to attaining culthero status at madison square garden when , for the golden state warriors on oct 29 , 2010 , he became the first to suit up for an nba team in the regular season since matt maloney of penn played for the atlanta hawks and chris dudley of yale played for the portland trail blazers in 20023 there have been great nba players with , like geoff petrie of princeton , who averaged 218 points a game for portland in six seasons in the 1970s bill bradley of princeton , who played on the knicks' two championship teams and jim mcmillian of columbia , who won an nba title with the los angeles lakers in 1972 but the only harvard players besides lin to play in the nba were saul mariaschin , who averaged 77 points in 43 games for the boston celtics in 194748 edward smith , the sixth pick over all in the 1951 draft , who averaged 25 points in 11 games for the knicks in 195354 and wyndol gray , an allamerican at harvard in 194546 who played the next season for the celtics , then finished his twoyear career in providence and in st louis mariaschin and gray played for the last harvard men s basketball team to make the ncaa tournament , but that is another story , lin broke the previous high for points in an nba game by a player from harvard , which had been 20 , set 64 years ago by mariaschin , according to the elias sports bureau it s really quite amazing what he s done , said glenn a fine , the former inspector general of the justice department , who was drafted out of harvard in the 10th round by san antonio in 1979 but did not try out because he won a rhodes scholarship and after these two games , it looks like he has a pretty good chance to stick at least 10 harvard players have been drafted by the nba , according to university records five were drafted in the 1970s , including the sportscaster james brown , one of the nation s top high school prospects in 1969 brown was taken by the atlanta hawks in the fourth round in 1973 , but did not earn a roster spot in 1985 , forward joe carrabino was drafted in the sixth round by the denver nuggets and guard bob ferry , the brother of the duke star danny ferry , was taken in the seventh , by the hawks and in 1987 , keith webster was drafted in the seventh round by the utah jazz none of them made a roster , and for some time , it appeared that harvard s lasting contribution to the nba would be a nonstudent , tom thibodeau , the current coach of the chicago bulls , who was an assistant at harvard from 1985 to 1989 webster came close he tried to make the jazz as the team s third point guard , behind the starter rickey green and john stockton he was one of the last three players cut , a victim of stiff competition and guaranteed contracts , but not before playing the entire preseason the first time webster saw lin play , against cornell in lin s senior season , his seat was near a group of coaches the consensus among them was that lin was not nba material i stuck my neck out and said , i think he s going to make it , ' webster said he s 63 , really athletic , has good hops and long arms and his best attribute is his vision fundamentally , he leaves his feet a lot and his jump shot s kind of funky , but he gets to the rim with his crossover and he s a great finisher in some sense , it does n't surprise me that he made a team and he s doing well it just goes to show what you can do if you work hard no harvard player has been drafted since webster , not even lin , most likely because the nba reduced the number of rounds in the draft to three in 1988 and to two in 1989 with webster , the harvard pipeline , such as it was , had run dry or so it was thought
moscow president s press secretary spent much of thursday denying a new round of rumors about mr putin s health , explaining that he has been working from home lately rather than commuting to the kremlin to avoid causing traffic congestion , a daily newspaper , reported on thursday that has postponed a series of foreign trips to turkey , bulgaria , india and turkmenistan until late november at the earliest , meaning that his december travel schedule will be jampacked last week , the postponed trips , and quoted unidentified government officials who said mr putin was suffering from back problems that might require surgery on wednesday came the news that mr putin was postponing his trademark marathon televised questionandanswer session , an event that usually takes place in december , until the spring or summer dmitri s peskov , mr putin s spokesman , said the president pulled a muscle in his back while exercising in early september , and suffered from a painful reaction for a couple of days during the asiapacific economic summit meeting in the eastern city of vladivostok he said the president was not suffering from any continuing ill effects from what he said was not an injury , it s just a mismovement he is not getting treatment , he is doing sports , every day , like always , mr peskov said in an interview he s got no injury there is nothing to heal he said the timing of the foreign trips had never been finalized or announced by the kremlin , so it was not correct to say they had been delayed clearly exasperated by the battery of questions , mr peskov tried to maintain his good humor , saying the rumors were a good thing , because it means that we do n't have serious problems journalists are trying to make a picture a nonexistent picture and they are asking questions , and of course we are a little bit tired of answering this thing , he said really i see him when he is not under television cameras , and he is 100 percent normal mr putin s health is , of course , no casual matter now 60 , he is following a term as prime minister with his third term as president in a political system that hinges on his personality while there are powerful interest groups within the russian government , none of them can act without mr putin s consent , leaving him at center of a complex system that must balance disparate demands statecontrolled television made much of mr putin s good health and vigorous lifestyle last month , when he officially reached s retirement age a documentary that was broadcast on his birthday focused largely on his daily workout routine , and showed him tucking into healthy foods like oatmeal and an energy drink containing beets and horseradish it is undeniable that he leaves his residence less frequently these days , and political observers have begun to scrutinize mr putin s body language closely on thursday , aleksei a venediktov , the editor in chief of ekho moskvy , an influential radio station , described watching mr putin grip the lectern while standing at a long awards ceremony in early september , then leave midceremony , allowing sergei b ivanov , the head of the presidential administration , to finish this does not happen , at least it has not happened , mr venediktov said during a morning talk show after that i understood that there were in fact problems and the problems were serious , because putin is a patient person in this sense and endures all his sports injuries quite well that means it s serious mr venediktov also said mr putin s aides groveled at his feet to entreat him not to take part in a september stunt , in which a motorized hang glider to guide endangered cranes on their first migratory flight , lest he further injure his back thursday s newspaper report said his injury flared up after the flight mr peskov rejected that idea in a morning radio appearance , saying nothing was aggravated after the flight with the cranes the chatter is reminiscent of the scrutiny that followed soviet leaders , whose posture and skin tone were the subject of chatter among journalists , diplomats and analysts who pored over photographs in western capitals president boris n yeltsin regularly took part in rallies during his 1996 presidential campaign despite heart troubles so serious that , around four months later , he underwent a sevenhour operation to circumvent five clogged arteries
simon wrenlewis has two posts on macroeconomists that get at a lot of what is concerning me about my profession to put it bluntly faced with a severe economic crisis the very kind of crisis macroeconomics was created to deal with it often seems as if the profession is determined to make itself useless wrenlewis s first post concerns the obsession with microfoundations as he says , this obsession is at this point deeply embedded in the academic incentive structure if you think that only modelling what you can microfound is so obviously wrong that it cannot possibly be defended , you obviously have never had a referee s report which rejected your paper because one of your modelling choices had no clear microfoundations one of the most depressing conversations i have is with bright young macroeconomists who say they would love to explore some interesting real world phenomenon , but will not do so because its microfoundations are unclear so where does this come from \? the lucas critique has been a big deal in the profession for more than a generation this says that even if you observe a particular relationship in the real world say , a relationship between inflation and unemployment this relationship may change when policy changes so you really want to have a deeper understanding of where the relationship comes from microfoundations so that you won t be caught off guard if it does change in response to policy and this is fair enough but what if you have an observed fact about the world say , downward wage rigidity that you can t easily derive from first principles , but seems to be robust in practice \? you might think that the right response is to operate on the provisional assumption that this relationship will continue to hold , rather than simply assume it away because it isn t properly microfounded and you d be right , in my view but the profession , at least in its academic wing , has largely chosen to take the opposite tack , insisting that if it isn t microfounded and with all i s dotted and t s crossed , no less then it s not publishable or , in the end , thinkable now we re having a crisis that makes perfect sense if you re willing to accept some realworld behavior that doesn t arise from intertemporal maxiimization , but none at all if you aren t and to a large extent the academic macroeconomics profession has absented itself from useful discussion in the second post wrenlewis responds to another tired attack on fiscal stimulus , based on basically nothing as he says , it s hard to imagine a clearer case for action than what we re seeing overwhelming evidence that fiscal policy does in fact work , zero real interest rates yet a substantial number of economists seem determined to find reasons not to act some of this is ideology , but i suspect that part of this also represents a carryover from academic careerism , where differentiating your product claiming that the big guys are wrong at something is part of what you do to get noticed this kind of petty stuff doesn t matter when it s just academic games , but when it clouds the discussion in the face of mass unemployment , it becomes very bad indeed my bottom line is that we as a profession faced the crucial test of our lives and by and large we failed and continue to fail it s not a happy story
bradenton , fla came to spring training last year several pounds overweight , and the were unhappy but according to hughes , none of the team s officials expressed their displeasure directly to him hughes said they did not have to this year , he arrived at spring training in much better shape , knowing he had a lot to make up for after a season in which , raising doubts about the , hughes is competing for a spot in the rotation that is a long stride in the wrong direction for a pitcher who won 18 games in 2010 , so the minimum he could do to get his career realigned was to arrive early , and with a leaner body he did that , which was smart , because even if the yankees did not tell hughes directly , they questioned whether he had the proper mental focus a year ago there s a concern , manager joe girardi said in an unusually candid analysis of a player the thing is , i 've seen him work very hard before it does question where their mindset is you know , where s your mindset \? ' now , girardi thinks that hughes s approach is where it should be , although with the laidback hughes , the casual observer may not notice it as much as the manager i think you can tell by the way he came into camp that there s a little bit more of an edge , girardi said with his personality , if you were just to look at him , you would n't necessarily think that he s changed very much but i think that it s in there i definitely notice it with his early groundwork established , hughes pitched in his first game of spring training tuesday , and the results were mixed , but satisfactory many of his pitches were too high in the strike zone , but he did not walk anyone perhaps most important , his fastball was measured at 93 miles per hour that made hughes smile one hundred would be nice , he said i 'd take it but to be successful , 92 , 93 would be nice obviously , the first time in spring , i'm not expecting 100 percent inseason velocity just to have some life on the fb , see some swings and misses , some late foul balls , maybe would be nice that would be a good thing for me right now hughes conceded that he probably never hit 90 mph on the radar gun last spring training then , as the season progressed and his fastball remained inadequate , hughes was eventually found to have tendinitis in his shoulder and placed on the disabled list he acknowledged that he was overweight in camp last year , but denied that it had anything to do with his fastball he said it was not the result of complacency or a sense of entitlement sure , you can call it that , he said i do n't care what you label it that s fine i came in , i was pitching , and it was n't coming out like it normally does i tried to battle through it , but something was n't right , and finally they said , let s get this checked out , ' and i had shoulder inflammation so i rested that , had a cortisone shot and felt a lot better i worked hard this offseason unless things change drastically , hughes , 25 , is competing with freddy garcia for the fifth spot in the rotation the yankees would love to see the younger hughes take control of the competition and return to his 2010 form that would give them a greater asset than if the 35yearold garcia won the job even garcia seems to understand that after his first outing sunday , garcia said he would do whatever the team asked , even pitch out of the bullpen neither pitcher looked particularly sharp , but they were not expected to this early in camp hughes had to be removed in his second inning of work in because he had reached his limit of 38 pitches in an inning and a third , he allowed two runs and four hits , and struck out one he attributed the elevation of his pitches to the anxiousness of his first outing , and girardi and the pitching coach larry rothschild said they were pleased with the outing , particularly the velocity obviously it was better , this year s first outing than last year , girardi said much better inside pitch c c sabathia made his first start of the season tuesday and said he had now entered into his fiveday schedule for the rest of the year sabathia put in a day s work over two innings and was unconcerned that he allowed a run and three hits mark teixeira jammed his left thumb making a tag but said he would not miss any time
you are two under par through five holes you have never been two under par in your life , not counting the miniature golf course an 18handicap , you 're playing way over your head , and you know it at that moment , you 're filled with dread why \? because you know it ca n't last this is n't your usual game you might as well be on mars in fact , you start telling your playing partners i do n't know what s going on i never play this well when you par the next hole , you even apologize we all know what happens next you hit a squirrelly drive off the next tee then you dribble a 3wood double bogey something similar happens on the next hole i told you i stink , you say , although secretly you think , i just have to remember what i was doing during the first six holes when you end up shooting a 101 , you walk off the 18th green more confused by golf than ever if this has n't happened to you , i guarantee you 've seen it happen to someone in your foursome in golf , we spend most of our time talking about what to do when we 're playing poorly , but here s a littleasked question what do you do when you 're playing too well \? in theory , there is no such thing as playing too well , but in golf s reality , handling success can be as important as handling the more common obstacle of adversity to put it another way what do you do when you 've got nothing to complain about \? the simple answer might be to smile and enjoy the game s bountiful , copious good graces right only a nongolfer would say that playing really well puts us out of our comfort zone , said joe parent , who coaches pga tour pros and amateurs on the mental aspects of golf it makes us selfconscious we start questioning why this is happening we analyze it even if we do n't quite believe it people start wondering when the wheels will come off , which almost always means the wheels will come off or they get technical , trying to do everything correct in their swing since they now think they 're a different golfer somehow none of that will work parent said golfers should instead try as hard as they can to change nothing and that includes their prospects for the day whatever swing keys or pieces to your routine you have been using , keep using them , he said mentally , do n't have expectations that you 'll continue to play as well , but do n't have expectations that it will all go bad , either and most of all , do n't get out a crystal ball do n't think ahead to a final score of whether this will be a personal best jim suttie , one of the nation s toprated golf teachers , preached simplicity in the face of unusual , even unnerving , accomplishment to be a good player , you sometimes have to have the mind of a child , said suttie , who teaches at the cog hill golf and country club outside chicago sometimes the best advice is , 'there s the ball , and there s the target now just hit it' if you 're going well , maybe that s all you need accept the present , and stay in it i do n't think suttie was making a play on words when he used the word present , but it is apt as mike bender , another top teacher , suggested , good golf is a gift be happy with it , albeit to a point it s great when it happens , and enjoy it , but know at the same time that in golf we ca n't really control the outcome , bender said strange things are going to happen all you can control is your performance commit 100 percent to your performance , and give 80 percent effort 100 percent is too much and see what happens you never know the good karma and good outcomes might stick around if you do n't focus on the results parent warned of one other typical response to playing well people get delusions of grandeur , he said they think they can do anything they try to hit a 40yard hook like bubba watson or they start hitting flop shots when they 've never been able to hit flop shots then when things fall apart , they 're so rattled they ca n't find their old game in the end , if it makes you feel any better , pro golfers do n't always know how to handle it when they 're playing over their heads , either parent , who has worked with hundreds of upandcoming pros , as well as vijay singh , david toms and cristie kerr , said he had to counsel players on how to finish a good round this might not be true of guys ranked in the top 20 , but i 've had rookies on the tour get to four under with five holes to play , and all they start thinking about is how to finish 18 holes at four under , parent said they get defensive and start playing not to make mistakes instead of playing as they had been playing it s similar to what happens to the recreational golfer either way , you have to put away what has already happened and treat each hole as an isolated event so that s the secret even though you 're having the best day of your golfing life , make sure you forget about it at least until you 're done then you can revel in it and buy everyone at the 19th hole a drink unless , of course , somewhere on the back nine it became something other than the best day of your golfing life then you can spend hours dissecting every moment until it s burned in your memory for a month no wonder people think golfers are crazy this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print drawing \( drawing by bob eckstein \)
where is europe \? you might as well ask what is europe \? for it is a concept as well as a continent , and the borders of both oscillate wildly for the ancient persians , it was that small stepping stone separating them from greece in the middle ages , it became virtually synonymous with christendom a relatively recent and generally unaccepted theory sees europe spanning half the globe , from iceland to the bering strait , nearly touching alaska take the most common presentday usage of the term europe , shorthand for \( and synonymous with \) the european union the external borders of this supranational project are welldefined , and in some cases welldefended but they remain movable , having consistently shifted outward over the last half century from a core of six founding members in the continent s west 1 , this europe has expanded to comprise 27 states , as far east as cyprus that still leaves quite some wriggle room between concept and continent , which by some estimates 2 includes as many as 51 countries for those in between , the difference is clear and uncontested even noneuropean union members like switzerland and croatia , close to the continent s geographic core , will readily admit that they re outside europe \( but only if you include the quotation marks \) the interesting difference is that the swiss overall are happy to remain outside , while the croats generally can t wait for july 2013 , when they re slated to join the union this gap in euroeuphoria is a symptom of a curious kaleidoscopic quality of this supranational europe everybody is looking at the same thing , but everybody sees something different for the swiss , who have a long history of nonalignment \( and a shorter one of being confidently rich \) , joining europe would entail few benefits by contrast , for the non european remainder on the balkans 3 , similarly encircled by member states , joining would be almost more of a moral vindication than an economic relief like the countries of the former eastern bloc before them , membership would confirm their europeanness as a frequent visitor to the balkans recently put it to me in the croats own eyes , they are the last bastion of europe against the barbarians , the first of which are the serbs the serbs too view themselves as europe s ultimate bulwark , against the albanians and so on what s interesting is that such kaleidoscopic assessments of what is and isn t europe exist within the union , too but instead of positive images , the eu kaleidoscope refracts nothing but horrors here , europe has become the convenient scapegoat for anything too unpopular , expensive or painful to be defended by the individual member states we don t like it either , they can tell their electorates , but europe is making us do it europe , long the defining inclusive quality uniting people from spain to finland , is now , ironically , the oppressive other this europe is a misassembled , headless monster , owing less to charlemagne than to frankenstein it stalks the bureaucratic labyrinth of brussels , beying for tribute from the peoples of europe but this modern minotaur is also a petty , powerless bureaucrat , issuing directives on the correct curvature of cucumbers 4 , but unable to save the euro from collapsing to the british , europe and the continent are increasingly one and the same , and they find increasing consolation in their splendid isolation from it strictly geographically speaking , they re not wrong a continent may be defined as a large , contiguous land mass , sans the islands off its coast of course , the choice of terminology is suggested more by the rise of antieu sentiment in britain rather than by concerns for geographic rectitude an equally acceptable definition of a continent does include socalled continental islands 5 situated on the continental shelf , as britain and ireland are an even broader definition includes islands off the shelf \( so to speak \) , if they are geographically and culturally proximate cyprus , malta and iceland are all considered european because of historical , political and cultural links , even though none of them is entirely located on europe s continental shelf yet if we leave the islands out of the equation for a moment , most of europe s borders are selfevident they are the waters that border it on three sides the arctic sea to the north , the atlantic ocean to the west and the mediterranean and black seas to the south ah , but then the ultimate problem becomes painfully clear where to draw europe s eastern border \? and does it even have one \? let s return to our earlier definition a continent is a large , contiguous land mass and not half of one many geographers see what we call the european continent as a mere peninsula of a gigantic continent of eurasia , spanning halfway across the world , from the strait of gibraltar to the bering strait there is no good reason to divide that continent in two no good geographic reason for , etymologically , eurasia might well be a union of opposites some linguists suggest that europe and asia derive from words in phoenician and assyrian for sunset and sunrise respectively , similar to the latin concepts of occidens and oriens , or simply our west and east in fact , in its earliest incarnation , europe was merely that bit of land on the continent that the persians had to cross to get from the hellespont 6 to greece proper ironically , 25 centuries later , the perception of that region has totally reversed greece is now firmly part of europe \( both the concept and the continent \) , while that former persian stepping stone is now known as turkish thrace 7 its existence embarrasses those who would deny turkey eu membership on the basis that it is not a european state it is and what s more based on ancient history , turkey \( or at least this part of it \) can claim to be the original europe turkey s detractors have another europe in mind this one took shape in the early middle ages , as europe became a constituent third of the world in simplified ecclesiastical geography , together with africa and asia converging on jerusalem the center of the world from the 13th century onward , encroachment by the tartars \( in russia \) and the turks \( in anatolia \) shifted the definition to a more spiritual one europe came to be identified with christendom specifically , western christendom in this definition , europe ended where turkey began , even when turkey extended deep into the continent proper when the turks controlled large parts of the balkans , those areas were considered to be beyond europe 8 , the eastern edge of which was the border between the austrian and ottoman empires to be fair , this viewpoint wasn t absolute as their power declined , the ottomans were pushed out of almost all of europe this allowed the classical definition to prevail , placing the border at the narrow waterway that connects the mediterranean and black seas 9 it remains there to this day with only turkish thrace remaining as a reminder that europe may stop where continents divide , but also where empires collide the northern border with asia posed a different problem for geographers because , as knowledge of and selfconsciousness in that part of the world increased , it turned out that europe was not connected to asia via a narrow isthmus , but rather via the widening expanse of russia the problem being that any definition of europe will divide russia in two the question is thus how much of russia is european \? or , even how european is russia \? as seen from the west , the earliest answer always seemed to be , not much , or not at all the french minister sully \( 15601641 \) , when dreaming up his grand design 10 for a very christian council of europe , objected to russia s inclusion in his scheme t here scarce remains any conformity among us with them besides they belong to asia as much as to europe we may indeed almost consider them as a barbarous country , and place them in the same class with turkey 11 sully s opinion sounds awfully modern for centuries , the urge was to include moscow and its lands within the european continent , even though doing so made for some rather arbitraryseeming distinctions in the renaissance , geographers solved the problem of europe s eastern border by being creative ortelius , in his theatrum orbis terrarum \( 1570 \) , started from the ancient border , the river don \( even though it was less impressive than its semimythical pendant , the tanais \) , then drawing a straight line north towards the white sea , near the city of archangel by the end of the 17th century , the eastern border of europe had shifted , following the courses of the rivers don , volga and kama , and then leaping in a straight line across the northern ural mountains to join the river ob north into the arctic ocean this border , championed by the geographer philipp cl ver , made the gulf of ob , at 600 miles the world s longest estuary , the border between europe and asia had this extension of europe east of the urals persisted , the northernmost part of europe would now be the tip of the yamal peninsula 12 , poking 400 miles into the arctic and home to russia s largest remaining reindeer herds \( and largest remaining natural gas reserves \) those reindeer might have benefited from the media attention that being threatened in europe s northernmost wilderness might have brought but alas for them the ob as europe s northeastern border became obsolete by the late 18th century the reason for this was the expansive growth of the russian state east and southward , so that geographers felt annoyed by the fact that russia in its entirety could no longer be treated under the header europe one solution was to discard muscovy entirely from europe , another to extend the borders of europe to keep up , somewhat , with russian expansion to be fair , the russians themselves considered europe to be elsewhere , hence the mission of of st petersburg , founded in 1703 , to be a window on europe the ultimate compromise between russia in and russia out was found when western geographers became aware of the mountain range the russians themselves called kameny poyas \( stony girdle \) the swedish military geographer philip johan von strahlenberg , after years of captivity gave him the benefit of close observation of the russian geography , proposed these ural mountains as the new european border in 1730 the strahlenberg border soon found acceptance throughout europe and russia itself strahlenberg s southern bend back via the volga to the don \( always the don \) was more controversial many geographers chose , where the ural mountains ended , to follow the ural river south to the caspian sea by the early 19th century , conrad maltebrun and other french geographers had successfully promoted the caucasus mountains , connecting the caspian to the black sea , as the southern border of europe this is still considered the most conventional border for the continent of europe but the uralsuralcaspiancaucasus border was \( and is \) by no means a generally accepted convention several geographers have , over the centuries , tried to place europe s eastern boundary well beyond the urals one notable example being the 18thcentury german botanist johann georg gmelin , who proposed the yenisey river , running from the mongolian border to the arctic ocean near the 70th meridian east , or about 2 , 000 miles east of moscow the most expansive vision of europe was one of many expounded by the founder of the paneuropean union , the austrian count richard von coudenhovekalergi , in 1935 it solved the problem of finding an adequate geographical boundary to europe by substituting a political one all of the soviet union would be considered part of europe asia would be to its south that would have made european cities out of vladivostok and irkutsk , but also samarkand and dushanbe during the cold war , however , the opposite tendency triumphed more often all of the soviet union , including vilnius , riga and other cities that today lie within the european union , were excluded from europe entirely at times even the soviet satellite states in the warsaw pact were left out as well , so much had europe come to be synonymous with the west and its associated political values today , of course , the border of europe is rebounding , thanks to the expansive semistate run out of brussels indeed , if turkey ever does join the eu and while its prospects look dim today , who knows what a decade or two will bring it will push the border of europe further east than anyone but a few daydreaming geographers had ever imagined from the volcanic shores of iceland to the mountainous frontier that divides turkey from iran frank jacobs is a londonbased author and blogger he writes about cartography , but only the interesting bits 1 by signing the treaty of rome \( 1957 \) , the three benelux countries , italy and most crucially the former archenemies france and \( west \) germany constituted the european economic community , which would later become the european union 2 that s a maximalist figure , including countries partly or wholly outside the accepted geographic borders of europe , and thus often excluded russia , turkey , georgia , armenia , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and one country well within most geographic definitions of europe , but still not recognized by many as a sovereign state kosovo 3 of the former yugoslav countries , only tiny slovenia has joined \( in 2004 \) albania , never a part of yugoslavia , is also still in the eu antechamber 4 only 10 mm per 10 cm otherwise an equal number of cucumbers wouldn t fit into standard packaging , which would require them to be counted individually more background here  5 the opposite being oceanic islands , which are often volcanic , like hawaii 6 currently better known as the dardanelles , this narrow strait connects the aegean sea with the sea of marmara it was a favorite fording place for the ancients it is not to be confused with the bosporus , to the north at istanbul , which connects the sea of marmara to the black sea both socalled turkish straits separate europe from asia 7 representing about 3 percent of turkey s total area , and , as the location of historical istanbul and its densely populated european hinterland , 12 percent of turkey s total population 8 hence , perhaps , the balkan attitudes described above 9 respectively called akdeniz \( white sea \) and karadeniz \( black sea \) in turkish , perhaps in accordance with the ancient , transcultural habit of associating colors and directions see

chicago the rain started to fall long before kickoff and did not stop the soldier field turf turned muddy , the wind gusted , and the usually bright lights of the lakefront skyline were muted through the mist the and the each came into sunday night as a 71 team built on defense they played a defensive game in defensive conditions , and over four sloppy , soggy and hardhitting quarters , the bears lost their quarterback , jay cutler , and the texans' arian foster proved why he may be the nfl s best running back as houston emerged with a win at our stadium , we 're not used to all this , the former bear danieal manning , who had an interception and forced fumble , said of the rain the thing is we got heads up early i said bring all the sevenstud cleats you can bring and let s go out there and play sunday s game with the texans , one of the afc s top teams , taking on the bears , one of the nfc s best was billed as a preview adding to the anticipation was that it was the first time since 2007 that teams with one or fewer losses had met this late in the season the texans boasted the league s thirdranked defense , and the bears were the nfl leader in turnovers forced neither defense disappointed , but the texans were just that much better the conditions quickly combined with opportunistic defenses to turn the marquee matchup into a grinditout game a slippery ball and defenders flying all over the field led to six firsthalf turnovers kellen davis fumbled on the bears' first play from scrimmage and michael bush fumbled to end their second drive cutler threw two firsthalf interceptions , and texans quarterback matt schaub matched him during one stretch in the first half , four consecutive possessions ended in turnovers cutler never got the chance to atone for his rough start , leaving the game with a concussion late in the first half , a scrambling cutler was leveled on a helmettohelmet hit by linebacker tim dobbins cutler was flagged on the play for a forward pass across the line of scrimmage , and dobbins was penalized for hitting cutler above the shoulders cutler finished the drive but did not return for the second half he finished the game 7 for 14 for 40 yards and 2 interceptions whatever the symptoms are for a concussion , that s what he had , bears coach lovie smith said i try not to be dr smith foster was the game s lone offensive star , piling up 102 yards on 29 carries the texans' zone blocking schemes and misdirection runs opened holes against an aggressive chicago defense that preaches getting all 11 players to the ball it was just one of those games you knew you 're not going to have great yards per carry average , foster said it s going to be one of those that you need to have every now and then as a running back for your team , and coach kubiak trusted me and the offensive line to get it done when it s crunch time foster scored the game s only touchdown , making a diving catch on an out route for a 2yard score it capped a secondquarter drive of seven plays and 66 yards , one of the game s few sustained offensive possessions schaub was 14 for 26 for only 95 yards to go along with the touchdown and two interceptions little changed for the chicago offense with the backup jason campbell taking over for cutler robbie gould kicked field goals of 51 and 24 yards but missed a 48yard attempt early in the fourth quarter that would have cut the texans' lead to 109 shayne graham added his second field goal of the game a few minutes later to stretch the texans' lead to 136 , and the bears never threatened again it s tough when you sit on the sidelines , campbell said it s not like we were playing against the 31stranked defense despite their records , both teams talked this week of proving themselves and earning the mantle of super bowl contender for the texans , it was their first primetime test since a 4224 loss in week 6 to the packers at home on sunday night against the bears , they passed the test , using the timetested formula of running the ball and playing sound defense the bears' lone loss of the season was also to green bay , a 2310 defeat on a thursday night in week 2 at lambeau field , where cutler threw four interceptions the bears had reeled off six straight wins , but none against a team with a winning record super bowl fever gripped chicago , as the bears' defense racked up turnovers and scored touchdowns at a recordsetting rate during their winning streak even as questions remained about a shaky offense as the bears , soaked and beaten , trudged off the field sunday night , those questions became more apparent , but remained unanswered  the bears' lone loss of the season was also to green bay , a 2310 defeat in week 2 at lambeau field , where cutler threw four

hale center , tex a burly , goateed police lieutenant knocked on a door in this windswept farming town of 2 , 200 tuesday morning he was looking for daniel castillo , who had become a wanted man there was a good chance that mr castillo knew the law was after him his picture was posted on a community bulletin board at the post office and on the plateglass windows of the police station , and his name was published last friday in a local newspaper , the american the lieutenant , brandon richardson , held the warrant for mr castillo s arrest as he knocked but the manhunt lacked a certain tension mr castillo was hardly a desperate killer on the run in fact , he was wanted for failing to take care of a traffic violation lacking proof of and his fine was 868 in another state , perhaps , mr castillo s failure to address this problem might have been a private matter or might have been a low priority for law enforcement but this is texas , and this is the week of the great texas warrant roundup , an annual statewide event that functions as a sort of america s most wanted for an unromanticized subset of the texas outlaw the misdemeanor kind each year in late february and early march , dozens of law enforcement agencies and municipal courts in big cities and small towns across the state take to the airwaves and to the streets seeking out , apprehending and otherwise rounding up texans who have ignored their unpaid speeding tickets and other minor infractions for too long none are wanted for violent offenses like murder or robbery the focus , instead , is on those with outstanding warrants for misdemeanor traffic , parking and city ordinance violations going 80 miles per hour in a 70mph zone , writing a bad check who failed to resolve their ticket or case by paying a fine or appearing in court no other state holds an event quite like the weeklong warrant roundup , now in its sixth year more than 260 agencies and courts are taking part in the roundup , which in most jurisdictions started last saturday and ends march 4 by the end of a typical warrant roundup , thousands of people will have been arrested and millions of dollars in fines and court fees will have been paid across the state last year , the houston police arrested 4 , 110 , and the city s municipal courts collected 25 million this year , waco arrested 32 on saturday , and san antonio apprehended 39 on monday abilene has collected 49 , 966 so far if everyone gets a ticket and says to hell with it , that defeats the purpose , said j c mosier , the chief deputy for harris county s constable precinct one , which made 42 arrests on saturday as part of the event our files are full of traffic warrants and hotcheck warrants the only people that gripe are the ones getting arrested few towns or cities have been conducting as enthusiastic a roundup as hale center , a city about 35 miles north of lubbock that has one restaurant \( owl s caf \) and no bars \( alcohol sales are banned \) it spent roughly 600 on the twopage ad in friday s sixpage paper a list of the names of nearly 600 men and women with outstanding misdemeanor warrants in hale center , along with their offenses the chief of police , dennis d burton , covered his office windows with fliers bearing pictures and names of those wanted in the roundup since no mug shots were available for many of them , chief burton used their driver s license photos , so a number of the lawbreakers look out with unusually bright smiles on main street and the bare flagpoles outside the municipal building the city has collected nearly 25 , 000 in fines this month , more than double the monthly average chief burton said he sought to motivate , not humiliate we 're not saying these people are bad people , he said we 're not judging these people we 're just reminding them outside the house where lieutenant richardson believed he would find mr castillo , relatives said he was not there the next warrant lieutenant richardson focused on belonged to patricia salas , 21 she owed 42 for a dogatlarge offense no one answered at the residence where the lieutenant thought he could find ms salas , but later in the afternoon , she showed up at the court clerk s desk in the municipal building to pay up i just think he takes it a little bit too far , especially with all the pictures , ms salas said of chief burton she had no idea her name was on the list , and said she had paid a portion of the fine but did not realize that 42 remained she was happy about one thing , though it was just her name , and not her picture , that had been posted around town

stark shadows empty streets a lone figure clutching a horn the conventions for depicting a hardboiled jazz hero have been firmly established for decades , in fiction and in film the implicit toll of the music , according to this code a clutch of obsession , leading to one or another form of ruination would register as hollow clich were it not for the exception that proves the rule somebody like  mr morgan , who died in 2007 at 73 , was an alto saxophonist with a quiet but penetrating sound , limpid and centered and beautifully personal as a shining upandcomer in los angeles , he followed in the footsteps of bebop s paragon , charlie parker , right down to a narcotics addiction that had him in and out of prison \( but mostly in \) for 30 years , which began with the release of his second album in 1985 , added a grace note to a career that courted tragedy at every turn his story and sound have inspired many listeners over the years , none more demonstrably than the author michael connelly in the bestselling series of crime novels that established his reputation , mr connelly has used mr morgan s music as a leitmotif for his hero , the los angeles police detective harry bosch now , in a more direct tribute , mr connelly is the executive producer of a forthcoming documentary film , sound of redemption the frank morgan project , that aims to shed light on mr morgan s resilience as well as his hardship i'm a disciple of raymond chandler , who said in his essays that there s a quality of redemption in anything that can be called art , mr connelly said last week speaking by phone from los angeles , where he was putting the finishing touch on his latest harry bosch novel , the black box , he characterized the film as a bit of unfinished business five years ago not long after he dropped mr morgan s name in the opening scene of the overlook , a bosch novel originally he appeared with mr morgan at the berklee college of music in boston , in a talk about the relationship between words and music i 've been on 20 book tours , i 've been on a lot of stages , and that was the single best thing i ever did , mr connelly said at dinner afterward , mr morgan suggested that they arrange a series of similar appearances at other college jazz programs across the country to reach more aspiring musicians they agreed to pursue the idea after fulfilling some other obligations , including a for the overlook , with a solosaxophone score but then mr morgan s health declined precipitously he died months later of colon cancer , and mr connelly began to think about how to tell his story that story , with its path from hopeful prodigy to grateful prodigal , certainly offers no shortage of drama born in minneapolis , mr morgan started his musical training on guitar , his father s instrument , but changed course at age 7 after seeing parker in jay mcshann s band by the time he was 15 , having moved with his father to los angeles , mr morgan was working the nightclubs on central avenue by 17 he was using heroin many of his subsequent years were spent in places like san quentin , where he played in a prison jazz combo with his fellow alto saxophonist and inveterate addict art pepper mr morgan would later recall his slide into addiction and felony forgeries , fraud and robbery with all the weary fatalism of a figure out of crime fiction in an interview with gary giddins , published just after his debut at the village vanguard in 1986 , he said , i knew enough about heroin to know that it was certain failure that if anything would ensure failure , becoming a heroin addict would be it he had already been in prison by the time he made his first , selftitled album , in 1955 his second album wryly titled easy living and released 30 years later rippled through a jazz world obsessed at the time with vintage modes of playing , bebop chief among them mr morgan was an emissary from a lost world , with a cautionary tale evocative enough to generate mainstream coverage it was through a profile in a newsmagazine that mr connelly , then a crime reporter for the los angeles times , first heard about mr morgan mr connelly went to hear him at a club and felt a connection , though he had always regarded jazz as his father s music as it happened , mr connelly was working on what would become his first novel , the black echo , and in mr morgan he felt he had found a muse being a writer who describes his process as filmic , mr connelly was responding on some level to cinematic portrayals of crime fiction , from the film noir era and beyond he has a special reverence for the scene in the 1974 film that depicts gene hackman s character an outsider working inside the system , first name harry playing tenor saxophone along to a record in his existentially lonely apartment mr connelly fixated on one performance by mr morgan , from the 1989 album mood indigo , as harry bosch s theme for some reason that song lullaby , ' i played it like raising the flag every day , he said it would drop me into harry bosch mode , for lack of a better description it would help me do what i do , in playing the keyboard i play in the 2003 novel lost light , one scene actually finds bosch attempting to play lullaby on the saxophone the song was n't even a minuteandahalf long , he muses , but to me it said all that ever needed to be said about being alone in the world the idea of a film , which mr connelly began exploring soon after mr morgan s death , finally began to move forward after he saw kimjongilia , a 2009 documentary by n c heikin , the wife of his longtime french translator ms heikin agreed to sign on as director , shooting interviews and other footage with mr connelly s help the film has a , with a goal of 60 , 000 more than 46 , 000 was raised by tuesday , with 10 days to go the kickstarter funds will go toward licensing fees and other costs , including filming at san quentin , where a tribute band featuring mr morgan s former pianist , george cables , and one of his prot g s , the 20yearold alto saxophonist grace kelly was recently cleared to perform if all goes according to plan , the film will be released next year at this stage it is impossible to know how deftly it will deal with the melodrama in mr morgan s story in any case , it will be another form of tribute from mr connelly , and mr morgan will have about as much to say about it as he did about the bosch series he would always say he was told about them , mr connelly said but i'm pretty sure he never read the books
before a game during the ' last homestand , emerged from the dugout , picked up a baseball and began warming up his arm as he walked toward second base to watch batting practice three decades earlier , collins , 63 , would have performed a similar routine , when he was a utility player in the minor leagues collins , a 255 hitter , amassed 2 , 009 atbats over 10 seasons in the ' and ' organizations he played parts of six seasons at the class aaa level for the albuquerque dukes , but he never received the call to report to the majors when rosters expanded every sept 1 as the mets prepare to call up several players some of whom have been with the mets before and probably one or two who have not it would be understandable if collins felt a familiar pang of disappointment over all the times he was overlooked as a player but he said recently that the september callups had become an uplifting moment for him , because every young player who walks into the major league clubhouse is a symbol of hard work that paid off by managers and coaches and even minor league coordinators , a job that collins used to hold for the mets it is the ultimate , it is why we coach , collins said it is why you spend those times traveling through the minor leagues being on those buses , getting early to work at 8 o'clock in the morning during spring training , to see those guys get better when they finally make it , deep in your heart someplace , you know you had a piece of it the heralded rookie pitcher matt harvey , who was unaware of the years collins toiled as a minor league player in cities like waterbury and albuquerque , said his manager made no mention of his past as a player when he himself made it to the mets on july 26 collins kept his initial speech to harvey short , telling him to just be himself and continue to pitch the way he did to get to this point in fact , none of the mets players who were recently asked said they knew anything about collins s playing career mike baxter was taken aback when he learned that his manager had plugged away for so long in the minors without ever getting a taste of the major leagues a lot of players , when they play that long , you can tell they have a passion for the game , and you can tell he has that , said baxter , who has spent parts of eight seasons in the minors he s a grinder , a fighter collins said that one reason he did not talk about his playing career with his younger players is the generation gap they do n't really care if you played , collins said you got guys who are managing who were great players and you know what , a young player today , if you 're 60 years old , they do n't know who you are anyway it s no disrespect to anybody else , but one of the things i try to tell them to understand is i 've managed in the minor leagues , i 've sent players to the big leagues , i 've watched those players go up and come back collins , who as a minor leaguer played shortstop , third base , first base and outfield and even pitched in six games \( 00 , 100 earned run average , two strikeouts \) , said he stuck around the minors out of passion more than a belief that he would ever reach the majors i had one year where the big club , the dodgers , had some injuries and i thought maybe , due to the fact that i played all over the place , i had a shot , but i did n't and that was fine , he said my years in triplea , i was not an everyday player backup players in triplea , you got to be in the right place at the right time during his last few years with albuquerque , in the early 1980s , collins was a playercoach the dodgers had initiated a system for developing older players into managers , who could also fill in for a game or two if a player was injured collins was recruited i loved to play , collins said i used to show up at the ballpark every day and just wanted to see my name in the lineup , did n't care what slot it was in but there was also a time where i said i would love to try and coach here , i 'd love to be a minor league manager or whatever it may be to get my chance , so i think the transition was pretty easy collins put down his bat without any regrets instead , what sticks with him now were all those moments as a minor league manager when he had to decide if a prospect really was ready for promotion when you 're in the minor leagues you tell your players , look , go out and play as hard as you can play , have a good year , and your opportunity may come in september , ' collins said so it s a great time for those guys you can reward those guys but that is also a very anxious moment , he said , adding i 've been in the situation where the major league team had three or four guys on the disabled list , they were having a bad year , and they decided they did n't want to call anybody up they did n't want them exposed to a bad environment so now as a triplea manager you had to walk in and actually tell some of those guys that deserved to be called up in september , that they were n't going up three decades have passed since collins accepted his fate he does not pine for the one atbat , like moonlight graham in field of dreams , or sit on the back of the bus relaying old war stories , like crash davis in bull durham collins has much more important tasks at hand than replaying what could have been getting the young players who are here now , who have the shot he never did , to stay at this level
after two decades of militancy , the kashmir valley has been relatively calm during the past two years tourists from india and around the world flooded into the scenic valley last summer , and the chief minister of jammu and kashmir , omar abdullah , has called for troop reductions and  but military officials say the peace remains fragile and that the infiltration of militants from pakistan continues , albeit in smaller numbers the army has said that kashmir isn t ready for any drastic dilution of security india ink recently discussed the situation in kashmir with lt genbaljit singh jaswal , who from october 2009 to december 2010 led the northern command , which currently controls more than 300 , 000 troops in the state general jaswal was in charge the last time , in 2010 decorated five times , general jaswal has a family history of military service his father was a britishcommissioned officer who fought in north africa and burma during world war ii his brother was killed in the 1965 war with pakistan his son is currently serving in the indian army the retired general spent most of his career conducting counterinsurgency operations in kashmir and the northeast during a long conversation at the assam rifles mess in delhi cantonment on thursday , he discussed the challenges of guarding the line of control , the lingering threat from pakistan , the armed forces special powers act and the life of a soldier in kashmir how much infiltration of militants from pakistan is happening now \? infiltration has come down a hell of a lot this year , it has come down to just about 50odd people earlier , it used to be 700 to 800 people in 2010 , there were 110 but you see , it s extremely , extremely difficult to stop you have to be on ground to see how difficult it is to say that you can hermetically seal the borders sorry , you can t people sitting in delhi say , why can t the army stop this \? you go and sit there , night after night , and see the psyche of a soldier i mean , he is doing his best but the strain is there there is so much pressure on him he will not like even the wind to go past him it is very , very difficult we have now improved the fences , but you see what happens in the gulmarg sector there is 30 feet of snow the fence gets covered how do you then protect \? so the first thing we do is aerial rekkies reconnaissance , or we see from the post if there are any footprints we know that if someone has crossed at night , the travel time would have been this much , so we carry out an assessment that he will be in an area so we cordon off that area and take appropriate action it s very difficult if you want to feel the heat , be in it then you will realize what threat do these militants still pose in kashmir \? even if there are five terrorists , well , they can do something kill the chief minister , kill a cabinet minister that itself is hell of a lot they have the potential there are about 450 to 500 terrorists in the whole of jammu and kashmir , and a group of five , they can do anything a fedayeen militant attack can take place anywhere it could be a fedayeen attack on the jammu and kashmir assembly what is your assessment of the recent murders of the sarpanches , or village heads , in kashmir \? the assembly elections were held in 2007 and about 56 percent of voters turned out in the 2008 general elections , 66 percent turned out and now the jammu and kashmir government has decided to empower the panchayats village councils so that people have more power in 2011 elections , 73 percent of people voted now this does not auger well to pakistan for pakistan , if governance is coming back again , well , their whole aim has been defeated the sarpanches who were trying to once again to revamp the state and make it surge forward , the best way to stop this is to go and kill them or threaten them so that the panchayati raj endeavor of the state is totally decimated that s why the killings took place there are about 30 , 000 sarpanches in the whole of jammu and kashmir you can t provide security to everyone so the answer is that we should have village defense committees , which have been formed in a number of villages , and arm them there are exservicemen all over in jammu and kashmir otherwise , there are villagers train them they will provide protection to the sarpanches when you say pakistan do you mean the government or the inter services intelligence , the isi \? if i m a general and something goes wrong in the northern command , i m responsible similarly , if something is wrong in pakistan , the government is to be blamed its tools are the isi whether they are allpervasive over the pakistan government or otherwise they call the shots , we all know it but the ultimate responsibility is that of the pakistan government why are they not being able to rein in the isi \? why are they so scared of the army \? democracies don t get scared of the army why are they so scared \? it s a democratic country you can t have the army dictating terms to the government what do you see happening after the us troops withdraw from afghanistan \? will pakistan turn its attention to kashmir again \? the first thing for pakistan is to be able to have a major role to play in afghanistan and that s the reason they are not keen for india to come in , except for commercial ventures and that too they object at one point in time , people were saying that pakistan will turn al qaeda and some of these people from that area towards kashmir there were views that al qaeda people were operating in srinagar and the valley to my knowledge , there are none initially , a lot of afghans came in to kashmir the majority were pakistanis who were trained in afghanistan and they used to call themselves afghans that has died down for the time being but should pakistan , in the long term , be able to have a hold on afghanistan , they re going to ready a kitty of insurgents available to them who can come down to kashmir and carry on the job of fifth columnist in times of war chief minister omar abdullah is calling for a phased withdrawal of troops from kashmir as well as the repealing the afspa the armed forces special powers act but the army says it s too early is kashmir ready for these changes \? i m the first proponent of saying that afspa should not be removed firstly , why are the terrorists not being able to operate \? because we ve been able to provide ideal trooptoground density and restricted their space of operations why did afspa come in \? it was because of the intent of pakistan has the intent of pakistan changed \? if it has not changed , why change the provision \? let the military realize where the situation is slightly improving , we could thin out troops from there , but a certain amount of troops will be there the demonstration of the troops on the roads , that can be reduced and can be taken over slowly by the police and the paramilitary forces if you repeal afspa , for it to come back you know , it s an act of parliament you know the kind of difficulty which is there to pass in parliament i have a lot of respect for mr omar he is a personal friend and we have a lot of professional respect for each other i mean in his wisdom he has to make political statements , but i do hope he sees the ramifications the state government has made its position quite clear about the removal of afspa and reduction in troops are the central government and the army divided on this \? no way the ministry of defense is totally with us i remember a discussion with mr chidambaram the former home minister i said that if you remove troops from here , you are creating voids it will provide space for terrorists to be able to regroup once again and wisdom did prevail and the ministry of defense just put its foot down can militancy be eliminated entirely \? we are confusing the situation in jammu and kashmir my wisdom as an army commander is to always say the situation in j and k is due to the nonresolution of the kashmir issue if the kashmir issue is resolved at the diplomatic level and political level , insurgency will automatically come down like i said , even if five terrorists are operating , well , they can create any strife anywhere it happened in bombay mumbai , in 2008 the nation almost went to war so the intent of pakistan has to be decimated and that can only be decimated when the kashmir resolution takes place it has to be at the government level we are just tools we are controlling the situation , we are managing the situation , but to ultimately decimate the situation it has to be dealt with at the government level has the number of troops in kashmir decreased \? i wouldn t like to give the figure because they are outside the public domain some troops have moved out it is not a continuous process in srinagar , a lot of people express resentment when they see security forces posted on almost every street corner how do you think the army has done in terms of winning the hearts and minds of the people \? we have an operation called sadbhavna , and the americans have copied us in afghanistan they are doing the same it is empowerment of the women , providing education , integration of the population with india , providing goodwill schools i , in northern command , started a new venture providing free service selection board coaching to anyone and everyone who wanted to join the army in the first packet , 23 people got through it s a great achievement in the valley some girls also wanted to come there is a girl from ladakh who is becoming an officer so we are integrating them we have 51 goodwill schools there , providing free education you go and ask any parents of these students , they will swear by the indian army is it easier for a soldier to serve in kashmir now that the situation is relatively peaceful \? no , the operations are still on he still goes for his ambushes he still goes for his convoys he still guards the fence operationally , he actually in a week gets two nights to sleep on his bed he still gets two nights of full sleep and he has to go out with patrols you re patrolling not just for the sake of measuring the length and breadth of the ground but you should be expecting an encounter so the whole drill is the same \( this interview has been lightly edited and condensed \)

moscow i am writing to say i am sorry i cannot speak for all russian citizens , but i can tell you this much the government that on saturday blocked the un security council s resolution on syria does not represent the people of russia it holds power in my country because it has rigged elections and has used money and fear to keep tens of millions of people in line for years you know how that goes russians were far too complacent for far too long , and for that i am sorry but we are not complacent anymore inspired in part by what has come to be called the arab spring , we have been taking to the streets since december i am one of the hundreds of people who helped organize the protest this past saturday the night before i had insomnia , brought on by a migraine , itself probably brought on by my fear of the cold the forecast promised 5 degrees fahrenheit \( it turned out to be accurate \) i contemplated not joining the march , but in the morning i put on every piece of clothing in the apartment , collected my gear i was responsible for organizing chanters along the route and supplying them with megaphones and went out and so did many , many others  exactly how many is a matter of contention knowing that the police would issue an absurdly low estimate as they have done after every protest we tried to figure out a way to get a verifiable tally of our own a young computer scientist wrote a program capable of counting people in a video , and we arranged to shoot continuous footage of the march from a 10thfloor apartment in a building along the way at 2 am on sunday the computer scientist instantmessaged me 208 , 025 people ! the police had said 36 , 000 the kremlin has tried ignoring this and other protests , discrediting the organizers and countering us with rallies of its own none of this has worked the demonstrations are getting more numerous and more pointedly political considering how limited prime minister vladimir putin s political repertoire is , using force against the protesters cannot be far from his thoughts now so it is not surprising that the russian government would refuse to back the arab league s peace plan for syria putin s identification with president bashar alassad has never been stronger and the bizarre insistence of sergey lavrov , russia s foreign minister , that the security council resolution place part of the blame for the violence in syria with the opposition there can be read as a warning of sorts to the opposition here , in russia i do not mean to equate our plight with yours we have not faced violence , at least not yet and with every new march our hope grows that the army and the police would refuse an order to use force against the protesters what i mean to say is this the world including us , the real russian public is watching the russian government s callous and cynical indifference to the fate of your people discredits it further and moves it ever closer to its inevitable demise it also moves all of us closer to a world where governments will be unable to use force against their own people without retribution
in the end , it all looked so logical , preordained even the thunder winning the nba s western conference felt like a coronation , a changing of the guard that could not have been more official if the spurs had passed them a baton this was the way it was supposed to be when this loopy , lockoutdelayed season started , the thunder coming of age , the talented young team finally working its way to the top but the thunder truly worked hard for this , even in the clinching game wednesday night , the one that ended up looking like a track meet but started out more like mud wrestling the whole series was like that , just as much of that loopy , delayed season was , right up until the lakers' metta world peace tried to turn james harden s head into a speed bag for his elbows no one rolled out a carpet for them and lined it with a rope they did n't proclaim themselves ready to win a championship they just worked their way there what a concept so , the thunder are deserving of the applause that now comes their way in waves as , this is a dynastytobe that built itself out of adversity , and how the thunder worked their way through a process they understand applies to them too both and predict big things for the thunder in the finals , which will provide a big stage for kevin durant co the nice part , , is that the thunder are easy to root for they are the team you 'd have picked to be the next big thing durant even thanked his mother they 'll be serving apple pie at the victory party the thunder s crowning game was a testament to their sticktoitiveness because the players carried the expectations like a burden at the beginning only to find the joy as the game went along , one the flip side , the spurs , for all of their dominance earlier in the playoffs and in this series , had no answers for that , just the stinging feeling that their last , best shot had been yanked away , but if this was the old dynasty finally giving way to the new , it was a worthy exchange for both sides the thunder took the best san antonio had left and did them one better the coronation was earned the same could not be said of the los angeles kings wednesday night , whose little fun run to the stanley cup just turned a bit more marathonlike , the kings' pesky habit of losing when they are up , three games to none , means the devils get to drag them back to new jersey for their next chance to dance with the cup they certainly deflated the party the kings' fans had planned for staples center , , and it did add a bit of justice to a series that was too close to be a sweep , the devils pulled this off thanks to their oldest player , martin brodeur , and one of their youngest , adam henrique , and the people who brought brooms and replica cups to the game are realizing those things are kind of silly when your franchise has not won a championship in forever it has n't been forever since a horse has captured the triple crown , it only seems that way so yes , it is wise to be skeptical about i 'll have another s chances to add the belmont to his kentucky derby and preakness victories because , as , he has to beat not just the field but a quirky track that has been a minefield of adversity for horses more pedigreed than this one not only does i 'll have another face those odds , but he has to endure the fuss created by his handlers , so while the oddsmakers have finally climbed on board and made him the favorite , writes sam gardner on foxsportscom , that position should not make anyone feel comfortable at belmont , where you learn to expect every type of chaos short of a horse galloping off on the cross island parkway for all the chaos at the french open , the men s semifinals still include the power triplets , novak djokovic , roger federer and rafael nadal sure , david ferrer crashed his way in there to add another dose of spanishness , but he earned it , , and it hardly qualifies as a surprise when andy murray flops again even concedes the quarterfinals were about as much as murray could expect here the odds are still leaning heavily to the steamrolling nadal , who faced his greatest challenge so far by losing a set to nicholas almagro djokovic and federer expended more energy in the quarters than nadal has in the entire tournament by a factor of 10 the women have a familiar face in the semifinals , and is maria sharapova , but she faces petra kvitova next in a rivalry that is , stunningly , all about the tennis ,  in the nba s western conference , it s all about the basketball which means it is right that the thunder have taken their place at the top and admirable how they got there
for john isner , the 2012 united states open will be remembered for its major missed opportunities converting only 2 of 11 breakpoint opportunities , the ninthseeded isner fell , 64 , 36 , 46 , 63 , 64 , to no 19 seed philipp kohlschreiber kohlschreiber , in sharp contrast , went 3 for 3 on his breakpoint chances , capitalizing ruthlessly on his looks at cracking isner s booming serve it was unforced mistakes on isner s serve , however , that ultimately cost him the match isner doublefaulted down break point at 34 in the fourth set to allow the german to force a fifth then after failing to convert on any of four game points on his serve in the opening game of the fifth set , isner doublefaulted at deuce after his first serve \( a wouldbe ace \) was negated by a foot fault kohlschreiber converted on the ensuing break point , an advantage he successfully maintained throughout the deciding set isner , normally one of the most evenkeeled american players , became incensed by the foot fault call he fired a ball into the stands , drawing a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct , and at the changeover berated the chair umpire , carlos bernardes i haven t footfaulted this whole year , and this guy calls one on me , isner said incredulously isner s anger continued into the next changeover two games later after holding serve for 12 , he smashed his racket \( earning him a second code violation and therefore a point penalty \) , and continued to complain to bernardes about the lines judge who had made the call who is this guy \? isner said how is he going to call a foot fault \? worst call ever isner would have two break points in the fifth set one at 21 and one at 43 but could not convert on either on his first match point at 54 , kohlschreiber hit a jamming body serve that isner hit into the net the two shook hands at 2 26 am , tied as the latest finish in united states open history with mats wilander s secondround victory over mikael pernfors in 1993 lots of horrible calls , isner said to bernardes as he walked toward his chair after the handshake you were bad you were bad the guy , philipp , played a good match , played a smart match , isner said after the loss , much calmer than he had been on court and he deserved to win , simple as that i wasn t unlucky or anything he was better than me but i do know that i need to rest , for sure , because i was pretty beat out there he added i didn t play the right way , and that s been the story when i ve lost at slams i ve played too passively it doesn t work out when i do that all four of isner s losses in grand slams this year have been of the fiveset variety , and all to lowerranked players he had lost in australia to feliciano lopez , in france to paulhenri mathieu , at wimbledon to alejandro falla though he is known for his marathon matches , his record in fivesetters is now 49 despite his top10 ranking , isner failed to reach the second week of any of the four grand slam tournaments yeah , it s bad , he said of his year at the slams terrible it s not good at all but more than the loss itself , what might sting more for isner is the lost opportunity ahead isner , who is the highestranked american by some distance at no 10 , had landed in the quarter of the draw that lacked roger federer , novak djokovic or andy murray had he advanced through the relatively open section , he could have made the semifinals of a grand slam for the first time one of kohlschreiber , janko tipsarevic , david ferrer or richard gasquet will now reach the semifinals with roger federer heavily favored to eliminate mardy fish monday afternoon , it is now likely that the last american man remaining in the singles draw could be none other than the departing andy roddick
do you know how to unclasp this \? asked the jeweler on west 47th street in manhattan , holding a gold bracelet instantly , i flashed back to my childhood yes , i knew how to unclasp it because i was inquisitive and clumsy as a boy , my mother taught me how to open her favorite bracelet without breaking it lately , i 've been carrying the bracelet around manhattan , looking for the best possible price , but if i break it now , no one will care my mother s gold bracelet is just melt stuff , one merchant told me bluntly my mother was of the same generation as elizabeth taylor , whose jewelry was sold at christie s last month , with a portion of the proceeds from the exhibition going to her aids foundation none of elizabeth taylor s items were melt stuff i watched the auction as even her everyday pieces commanded hundreds of thousands of dollars my mother s baubles , which she bought at fortunoff on long island , in the 1970s and '80s , generally cost around 200 then , which was a lot to her she never had money to burn , but every once in a while she would buy something to make her suburban existence a bit more elizabeth taylorish then she had her bouts with cancer when chemotherapy swelled her fingers , her rings were banished to a safe deposit box , where they remained for 25 years , along with about a dozen necklaces and bracelets last month , with the price of gold at a record high , i decided to find out how much i could get for my mother s jewelry not to fund aids research , but for my children s education , a charity my mother would surely have endorsed knowing nothing about selling jewelry , i started with a necklace a thick chain with charms hanging from it that i did n't remember from my childhood and therefore did n't mind giving up on 47th street between fifth avenue and the avenue of the americas , the diamond district , i entered a brightly lighted store , one of many , without even noticing its name i produced the necklace from the lining of my coat \( a hole in my pocket lining gave me a perfect hiding place \) a young man told me he liked the necklace so much that he would give me 1 , 200 for it but you 'll have to sell it to me now , he said i want to give it to my grandmother for her 80th birthday , and the party is tomorrow night i was in no mood to be hustled i took the necklace to another store , where i received an offer of 1 , 250 and then to another , where , when i mentioned the 1 , 250 , i was offered 1 , 400 \( not one jeweler i talked to believed the grandmaturning80 story it was , they said , a fiction to warm my heart and cloud my business judgment \) still , i walked back to the first store i visited , where i invited the young man to match the 1 , 400 offer he said he could n't afford to spend more than 1 , 200 for his grandma s birthday present i went back to the dealer who offered me 1 , 400 , and took it could i have gotten more \? who knows \? the price of gold is no secret , nor is the weight of the jewelry \( every jeweler i visited had an electronic scale \) the purity of the gold in a piece of jewelry is hard to know but a jeweler looking at an item through a loupe and testing it with acid from an eyedropper can make an educated guess still , offers for one piece of jewelry will vary sometimes significantly from shop to shop , even on one block and then there s the x factor the cachet that led frenzied bidders to buy elizabeth taylor s jewelry items for hundreds of times their intrinsic value for my mother s jewelry , the x factor is 1 my only hope was to play jewelers against one another a few days after my first outing , the 1 , 400 safely in the bank , i decided to see what i could get for the bracelet with the tricky clasp just two blocks from christie s , i tried three stores , where offers ranged from 1 , 100 to 1 , 900 i returned to the highest bidder , who walked into a vault and emerged with 19 cnotes he asked for my driver s license , and gave it to an assistant to photocopy a procedure that reduces the risk that he s buying stolen property , he said we chatted for a while , and he told me that the piece weighed about 30 pennyweight \( a pennyweight is a 20th of an ounce \) if i brought in 200 pennyweight of gold , he said , i could go with him to watch it being melted down would i be intrigued or repelled , i wondered , watching my mother s prized possessions turned into pure lucre \? i promised to return with some more pieces what i did n't say was that i would take each item to at least three stores before selling just like christie s , i was running a jewelry auction
the attack on fort sumter didn t start the civil war in 1861 the war began 10 years earlier , with the publication of harriet beecher stowe s antislavery novel uncle tom s cabin at least , that s what abraham lincoln claimed , when he met stowe in 1862 and reportedly greeted her as the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war two decades later , mark twain faulted another writer for the war s outbreak , when he attributed its cause to sir walter scott s historical novels , whose popularity among southern readers had instilled in them misguided notions of chivalry exaggerated or downright laughable as these comments may seem to us today , they are in keeping with the way lincoln and his contemporaries experienced the connections between literature and history lincoln quoted poetry at cabinet meetings , wrote letters and speeches that are landmarks of american eloquence and fatally attended the theater throughout the war today , we distinguish between history and literature , viewing them as opposites when we insist on separating fact from fiction for 19thcentury americans , the two were intricately bound if we want to recover a sense of how americans experienced the civil war , we need to understand how american literature shaped civil war history it is difficult for us as modern readers to appreciate the power of this literature because it does not conform to our expectations walt whitman claimed the real war will never get into the books for the past 150 years , we have believed him but whitman s comment has led to three false assumptions one , that nobody wrote literature during the civil war two , that civil war literature was invented 30 years later , by stephen crane s 1895 novel the red badge of courage and three , that books , rather than magazines or newspapers , are the proper place to look for civil war literature in other words , we have never been taught how to read civil war literature , and it is hard to even know where to begin in schools and universities , the civil war was central yet absent when the first courses in american literature were designed in the 1940s as the scholar richard slotkin has noted , survey classes were organized chronologically , and the civil war functioned as a dividing line between the first and second part fall classes generally focused on the great literature written during the socalled american renaissance of the 1850s by walt whitman , nathaniel hawthorne , henry david thoreau and herman melville , while spring classes examined literary movements , like realism and modernism , that grew out of the civil war even as the curriculum changed in the 1980s to include more women and minority writers , the war years remained absent this gap is not easy to fill what counts as civil war literature remains an open question must an author have had combat experience for his work to count as civil war literature \? none of the major canonical american authors were centrally engaged in the civil war s military action , leading the critic daniel aaron to refer to it in 1973 as the unwritten war yet the war loomed large in american authors imagination whitman recorded his encounters with wounded soldiers in specimen days drawing on newspaper and magazine accounts of the war action , melville composed battle pieces and aspects of the war this list grows significantly if we include southern writers like william gilmore simms or james r randall , and grapple with the task of reading poetry meant to boost the southern cause the picture becomes even more complicated when we consider women writers mary chesnutt elevated diary writing to an art form when she recorded and eventually published her memories of the war louisa may alcott fictionalized her nursing experiences in hospital sketches emily dickinson s most productive years fall into the early 1860s , and her seeming isolation in amherst , mass , belies , so the literary scholar shira wolosky argues , her poetry s deep engagement with the war and while africanamerican writers often did not have the same access to writing that their white contemporaries enjoyed , newspapers like the new york angloafrican provided important commentary on the political landscape alongside poetry and fiction as these examples indicate , the war years did indeed yield a vast outpouring of literature , as ordinary people and authors alike turned to writing as a way of coping with the war their works are becoming newly available to us in digital form , scholarly research and anthologies but this popular writing is difficult for us to read often , it does not reflect an individual voice and unique experience , and defies our expectations of good literature but we cannot impose our tastes on the past without losing historical knowledge in the process nineteenthcentury readers found comfort in repetition and in cookiecutter forms of writing , much the way we might enjoy the endlessly recycled formulas of television drama because we measure writing from the past by modern standards , we have yet to discover civil war literature that discovery will require us to set aside our expectations that civil war literature should tell us in realistic terms about the devastations of the war taking into account the literature people read and wrote during the conflict does not just paint a fuller picture it changes our understanding of how people experienced the real civil war the unrealistic nature of this literature is a failure by our standards for 19thcentury readers , it was a mark of its success as the historian drew gilpin faust shows in this republic of suffering , literature provided solace fiction offered meaning to otherwise incomprehensible facts as the manner of death changed during the civil war , and soldiers died far from their homes and loved ones , stories that tied the horrors of the war to the comforts of the hearth helped people cope with their losses literature did not just offer consolation as we see in a poem like james r randall s maryland , my maryland , literature also actively shaped the way in which people experienced the war , and affected political events as they unfolded randall was a college tutor with limited previous writing experience he wrote the poem which today is the state song of maryland in one night in response to a specific event , when the 6th massachusetts regiment fired on civilians while marching through baltimore the poem did not just record what happened it gave voice to the state s secessionists when it called on them to avenge the patriotic gore that flecked the streets of baltimore the poem fueled antiunion sentiment , and forced gov thomas hicks to call the assembly for a vote on secession published in the new orleans delta newspaper on april 26 , 1861 , and reprinted in newspapers throughout the region , the poem became a powerful anthem of the southern cause mary chesnutt copied the poem into her diary in january 1862 , and a cadet named william galt of the virginia military institute wrote the poem into a wartime notebook we tend to think of literature as printed text , and strictly distinguish among genres , but during the civil war texts moved freely and with dizzying speed from newspaper accounts into published verses that were copied into private journals , made into song lyrics , turned into parodies and adapted for the stage my maryland was set to music and became known as the marseillaise of the confederate cause oliver wendell holmes sr , described it as the south s equivalent to the battle hymn of the republic it was sung to the melody of the christmas song o tannenbaum , which was also the tune for the popular college song lauriger horatius the emotional appeal of the literature was not just in the words , but also in the melodies that spoke to people s feelings about college friends and family holidays yet the poem could quickly reclaim its political meaning , and serve as a comment on military events when lee s troops marched into frederick on sept 6 , 1862 , they sang my maryland as a victory tune by oct 11 , 1862 , harper s weekly was publishing accounts of the battle of antietam alongside a parody of randall s poem declaring ah me ! i ve had enough of thee , maryland , my maryland ! the parody combined the humor of sweethearts breaking up with ominous references to the vengeful ire pounding the northern war effort we don t often think of the civil war in relation to humor , and yet literature not only repeated images familiar to readers , it also played with them and mingled the silly with the serious the ease with which literature was adapted and even parodied reflects its generic nature maryland , my maryland gained much of its power from appeals to maryland as a motherfigure with a blush on thy cheek it asked this personified figure to gird thy beauteous limbs with steel and reveal her peerless chivalry as mark twain recognized , such lines are taken as much from ivanhoe , sir walter scott s vastly popular 1819 novel of medieval england , as they are from newspaper accounts of the war but the serious political consequences of conventional literary imagery become evident when we consider the following lines in a stanza that begins dear mother , burst the tyrant s chain , maryland ! , the poem also hauntingly includes the line sic semper ! that john wilkes booth uttered when he shot lincoln at ford s theater we usually don t think of literature as changing the course of history , and if we do , we look for a specific cause and effect but often , literature runs like a conversation through the civil war rousing to action one moment , giving rise to parody the next , tying news events to established images and appealing to feelings as much as to reason we won t be able to understand how people experienced the war if we look for it only in realistic descriptions and through later lenses of literary taste my maryland might not shed light on the events at antietam , but it gives us a unique perspective on how contemporaries experienced the american civil war follow disunion at

i hate bullies , said demaurice smith smith , a former whitecollar criminal defense lawyer with the highpowered law firm patton boggs , has been the of the national football league players association since 2009 that is to say , he runs the union that represents professional football players last year , he wrestled with the bullies running the nfl , who the players when they could n't reach a labor agreement now he is setting his sights on an even bigger bully the ncaa it s about time over the past few months , as , i have been struck by the fact that the players , exploited by everyone else in the system , have no one to advocate for them the ncaa likes to say it exists to protect studentathletes , but it s a laughable claim the ncaa exists to rationalize the tawdry fact that the labor force of a 6 billion business the of college football and men s basketball receives no compensation \( that s what amateurism in bigtime college sports really is unpaid labor \) coaches , athletic directors , conference presidents , the ncaa itself they all take advantage of the teenagers who are making them rich , knowing their young charges have no recourse worst of all are university presidents so quick to espouse the rights of the student body rights of privacy , of free association , and of due process should they get in trouble they allow the ncaa to strip college athletes of every one of these rights they look the other way as athletes receive a substandard education , or no education at all an athlete can be defamed by the ncaa , even have his career destroyed for no good reason , and the school , fearing retaliation , will never step forward to defend him publicly it is shameful i had traveled to washington to see smith because i had heard through the grapevine that he , too , had begun to poke around the ncaa and had been shocked by what he had discovered the week before we met , smith had been in indianapolis for the where it works out college players who are likely to be drafted it struck him these players were our future members and whether they made it to the pros or not , they deserved better treatment in college that s why unions exist to fight for better treatment for the work force all of these practices , smith said , whether it is compensation , due process , privacy , and the significant racial aspect , given that so many of these athletes come from disadvantaged backgrounds they all come under the heading of fairness he continued part of the problem is that everyone in the system starts by thinking of the players as athletes first that is the wrong starting point an athlete is a person first when you start there , it changes the way you think about everything of course , it is n't just the adults who think of the players primarily as athletes the same is true of the athletes themselves that is why it has been so difficult for them to stand up for themselves they have been playing their sports since they were small children , practicing for hours every day they have come to define themselves by their athletic proficiency they often arrive at college with stars in their eyes but they are also fearful of anything a coach s disapproval , an ncaa investigation that might derail their dream even after they have been abused by the system , they often remain silent not long ago , the producers of hbo s reached out to marc bailey , who runs an organization called , to see if he could help them find college players who had been victimized either by their school or the ncaa bailey contacted three athletes he had recently helped none were willing to speak out my high school coach used to say , selfinterest makes cowards of us all , ' bailey wrote to me in an email now i know he is right change will not come easily reminded me recently that it took nine years for the baseball players' union , which he headed , to achieve free agency just like college players today , baseball players were fearful of what would happen if they stood up for their rights it is unclear how smith will approach this crusade he knows that the ncaa will fight to the death to keep the players in their current shackled state and given the turnover in the college ranks , he conceded that it is virtually impossible to unionize the players using the triedandtrue techniques of union organizing the one thing he is sure of is that change will come when college athletes start to see themselves as people first , with rights like everyone else that s where he plans to start
huntsville , tex kenneth wayne davis died at 54 as not so much a man but a number inmate no 327320 mr davis was charged , convicted , sentenced and incarcerated for capital murder by the state of texas after taking someone s life on nov 19 , 1977 but when he died in november 2011 , texas seemed his only friend his family failed to claim his body , so the state paid for his burial on a cold morning in this east texas town , a group of inmates bowed their heads as a prison chaplain led a prayer for mr davis , his silverhandled black metal coffin resting on wooden planks above the grave the prisoners had dug for him wearing sunglasses , work boots and dirtsmeared white uniforms , they might have resembled painters were they not so solemn , holding their caps and gloves in their folded hands they were mr davis s gravediggers but also his mourners no one who knew mr davis bothered to attend his funeral , so it was left up to damon gibson , serving 14 years for theft , and the rest of the prison crew to stand in silence over the grave of a man they had never met then mr gibson and the others put their gloves on and lowered the coffin into the ground using long straps , providing him eternal rest in the one place in texas where murderers and other convicts whose bodies are unclaimed can be interred , remembered and , if but for a few moments , honored on this day , mr davis s funeral was one of seven at the , the largest prison graveyard in the country , 22 acres where thousands of inmates who were executed or died while incarcerated are buried all of them went unclaimed by their relatives after they died , but the cemetery is not a ramshackle potter s field it is a quiet green oasis on a wide hill near the campus of sam houston state university , with rows of small crosses and headstones , at the center of which stand a decorative brick well and a whitepainted altar bearing a cross the last years of these inmates' lives were spent under armed guard behind bars and barbed wire , but there is no fence along bowers boulevard here , and no one keeps watch walking along the hill beneath the pine trees , stepping between the rows of hundreds of identical white crosses and tablet headstones , you think of arlington national cemetery but if arlington is for heroes , the byrd cemetery is for villains the concrete cross marking the grave of duane howk lists his name , inmate number and date of death in june 2010 but says nothing of the offense for which he was serving a life sentence , aggravated sexual assault of a child the serial killer kenneth allen mcduff , executed in 1998 for strangling a 22yearold pregnant mother of two with a rope , had gained notoriety for being the only inmate in united states history who was freed from death row and years later after killing again , but he lies beneath a nameless cross reading 999055 the state s prison agency , the texas department of criminal justice , has been the steward of the cemetery since the first inmates were buried there in the mid1800s , maintaining and operating it in recent decades as carefully and respectfully as any religious institution might an inmate crew from the nearby walls unit prison cleans the grounds , mows the grass and trims trees four days per week the inmates dig the graves with a backhoe and shovels , serve as pallbearers and chisel the names on the headstones by hand using metal stencils and black paint the cemetery was named for an assistant warden at the walls unit who helped clean and restore the graveyard in the 1960s , and even today , the warden or one of his deputies attends every burial it s important , because they 're people still , said the warden , james jones of course they committed a crime and they have to do their time , and unfortunately they end up dying while they 're in prison , but they 're still human beings in a state known for being tough on criminals , where officials recently lastmeal requests on death row , the byrd cemetery has been a littleknown counterpoint to the mythology of the texas penal system one mile from the walls unit , which houses the state s execution chamber , about 100 inmates are buried each year in ceremonies for which the state spends considerable time and money each burial costs texas about 2 , 000 often , as in mr davis s case , none of the deceased s relatives attend , and the only people present are prison officials and the inmate workers though all of those buried here were unclaimed by relatives , many family members fail to claim the bodies because they cannot afford burial expenses and want the prison agency to pay the costs instead the same relatives who declined to claim the body will then travel to huntsville to attend the statepaid services at the cemetery i think everyone assumes if you 're in a prison cemetery you 're somehow the worst of the worst , said franklin t wilson , an assistant professor of criminology at indiana state university who is writing a book about the cemetery but it s more of a reflection of your socioeconomic status this is more of a case of if you 're buried there , you 're poor prison officials have verified 2 , 100 inmates who are buried at the cemetery , but they say there may be additional graves professor wilson recently photographed every headstone and estimated that there were more than 3 , 000 graves in some ways , the cemetery and the funerals held there lack precision and formality coffins are transported from the altar at the center of the cemetery to the gravesite on a trailer hitched to the back of a green john deere tractor names and words are misspelled on a few headstones and markers relatives have brought portable stereos to play music during the funerals , blaring rap songs and ac dc s hell s bells most days , after the inmate crew has returned to the prison , the cemetery is a deserted , lonesome place of the thousands of graves , only a handful have flowers on them you 've got guys here who died in prison and were buried out here , and they could have made a difference someplace , even if it was only in a small community somewhere , said jim willett , director of the nearby texas prison museum and a retired walls unit warden who attended nearly 200 graveside services these guys did n't just mess up their lives there s their family and other families that got messed up because of some screwup that they did , and then they wind up like this on the day of mr davis s interment , three burials had family members present , and four did not vandals had entered the cemetery and set a large brush pile on fire , filling the morning air with smoke neither mr gibson nor the inmate workers knew any of the men they were burying it has made me a better person , said mr gibson , 38 , a father of two from houston it has made me reflect on the things i 've done i do n't want this to be me two of the seven inmates who were buried , including mr davis , were serving life sentences for murder , and the others had been imprisoned for drunken driving , theft , assault , sexual assault of a child or burglary when they died mr davis spent nearly 34 of his 54 years behind bars in the ground in huntsville , he was finally free of his prison uniform the funeral home that handles inmates' burials put him in dark pants , a white shirt and a tie
charlotte , nc president obama , seeking to quell a storm of criticism from republicans and proisrael groups over his support for israel , directed the democratic party to amend its platform to restore language declaring jerusalem as the israeli capital the change , approved in a voice vote wednesday that had be taken three times because of a chorus of noes in the arena , reinstates the line , jerusalem is and will remain the capital of israel in a section that describes mr obama s policy toward israel that sentence had been in the 2008 platform , but the democrats removed it this time , saying they wanted to spotlight other elements of mr obama s policy and that the platform should reflect a sitting president rather than a candidate for office after a day of protests , however , and a likely onslaught of republican attack ads , the president and the democrats abruptly reversed course the chairwoman of the democratic party , debbie wasserman schultz , said in a statement that the change was made to maintain consistency with the personal views expressed by the president and in the democratic party platform in 2008 a senior administration official said , the president expressed his view in 2008 and it hasn t changed the party platform has not changed from 2008 and the position of the united states government hasn t changed in decades as it relates to israel s capital and peace negotiations delegates also voted to put god back in the platform , amending a section about the government s role in helping people reach their godgiven potential the removal of godgiven had left the platform without any references to god , giving republicans a target to paint the party as out of touch with family values the changes were meant to be a routine bit of business , conducted by the convention chairman , mayor antonio villaraigosa , of los angeles but they turned into a minor spectacle after the hall seemed equally balanced between yes and no votes , providing an unruly start to an evening meant to showcase attacks on mitt romney by former president bill clinton and others the romney campaign pounced , noting , mitt romney has consistently stated his belief that jerusalem is the capital of israel claiming that mr obama has refused to state his position , andrea saul , a spokeswoman , said , now is the time for president obama to state in unequivocal terms whether or not he believes jerusalem is israel s capital the restoration of jerusalem puts the platform , a largely symbolic document , at odds with the official position of the united states government , which is that the city s status should be determined in a negotiation between israelis and palestinians the american israeli public affairs committee , the nation s most powerful proisrael lobbying group , proposing including language about jerusalem s status as the israeli capital in written testimony to the platform drafting committee people close to the group said they were troubled by the omission of jerusalem we welcome reinstatement to the democratic platform of the language reaffirming jerusalem as israel s capital , aipac said in a statement after the vote the political status of jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues in any potential peace settlement between the israelis and palestinians , with both the israelis and the palestinian authority asserting that the holy city is their capital among those shouting no on the convention floor was a delegate from washington , majid albahadli , who said , jerusalem is arab and jewish and christian , it cannot be for one country mr albahadli , an iraqiamerican who said he had been in a prisoner of war camp under saddam hussein , said the vote process undemocratic a friend of lebanese descent who also protested the amendment , gus mansour of lynnwood , said this is not because i m against israel jerusalem is for all of us the drafting committee held two public hearings on the text , a democratic official said , and none of the jewish and israel advocacy groups in attendance , including aipac , proposed inserting language on jerusalem people close to the advocacy groups say the committee shared only flashes of the language with them the democrats have accused republicans of making israel a political football in this election by painting mr obama as an unreliable partner but it is the democrats who have tripped up on israel at their convention this week on tuesday , ms wasserman schultz , got into a dispute with israel s ambassador to the united states , michael b oren , when she told a democratic training group that mr oren accused republicans of endangering israel by criticizing mr obama s record on it mr oren issued a statement saying , i categorically deny that i ever characterized republican policies as harmful to israel bipartisan support is a paramount national interest for israel , and we have great friends on both sides of the aisle jim rutenberg contributed reporting
phoenix the coiled concreteandsteel house built by here , since its sale in june to a pair of luxury home developers , may have found its savior in an anonymous buyer who has agreed to pay the asking price of 2379 million , all of it in cash the agreement , struck late on wednesday , offers exactly what preservationists , elected officials and the wright family have fought so diligently to accomplish it keeps the house from being razed it is , however , only the first step in a transaction that needs to withstand the scrutiny of a home inspection and the volatile relationship between the city and the current owners , who have vociferously opposed the city s efforts to give the house landmark status on thursday , mayor greg stanton pledged to stay the course , saying , we 're going to ensure the house is designated historic , as it should be the push to sell the house began almost as soon as it was purchased by steve sells and john hoffman , partners in 8081 meridian , a development company once they had a permit to split the lot , the , based in chicago , intervened , asking the city to consider turning the house into a landmark , which would protect it for three years the city council is scheduled to vote on the designation on nov 7 councilman sal diciccio , who represents arcadia , the neighborhood where the house is located , said he wanted to hear from the new buyer first we do n't want to be in a position of dictating what should happen to the property , he said mr stanton said he was going to work to keep the vote on the calendar or , if the date changed , not too far in the future mr sells and mr hoffman paid 18 million for the house three years after it had been sold by wright s greatgranddaughters for 28 million one of them , anne wrightlevi , who spent much of her childhood at the home , built by wright for her grandparents , said the heirs had no other choice , given the cost of maintaining the house , which none of them could have afforded on their own ms wrightlevi said the house needed about 300 , 000 worth of restoration there were bills to pay , there were taxes that had to be paid , there were things that had to be done , but the money was n't there to maintain it , she said they sold the house , she said , knowing that the buyers would follow through in what they had promised to do , to preserve the house a change in circumstances forced those buyers to sell it , which is how 8081 meridian came into the picture janet halstead , executive director of the wright building conservancy , said that over the summer , when the house was listed for 21 million , the conservancy brought forth one potential buyer who made three offers , but all of them were rejected the group played no role in wednesday s agreement , which she said had left her cautiously optimistic ms halstead added , we wo n't know if the house will be saved from the threat of demolition and irresponsible development until we know the intentions of the new owners the prospective buyer does not want his name revealed until the sale is final , a process that could take three weeks , said robert joffe of russ lyon sotheby s , a broker working on the deal \( the other broker is johnathon de young , also of sotheby s \) he s doing this not for notoriety but for the love of the property , mr joffe said that s really the kind of person that we needed
the tutorial in 8 th grade biology that republicans got after one of their members of congress went public with something from the wackosphere was instructive , and not just because it offered female anatomy lessons to those who get their science from the bible take a look around key committees of the house and you ll find a governing body stocked with crackpots whose views on major issues are as removed from reality as missouri s representative todd akin s take on the spermkilling powers of a woman who s been raped on matters of basic science and peerreviewed knowledge , from evolution to climate change to elementary fiscal math , many republicans in power cling to a level of ignorance that would get their ears boxed even in a medieval classroom congress incubates and insulates these knuckledraggers let s take a quick tour of the crazies in the house their war on critical thinking explains a lot about why the united states is laughed at on the global stage , and why no real solutions to our problems emerge from that broken legislative body we re currently experiencing the worst drought in 60 years , a siege of wildfires , and the hottest temperatures since records were kept but to republicans in congress , it s all a big hoax the chairman of a subcommittee that oversees issues related to climate change , representative john shimkus of illinois is you guessed it a climatechange denier at a 2009 hearing , shimkus said not to worry about a fatally dyspeptic planet the biblical signs have yet to properly align the earth will end only when god declares it to be over , he said , and then he went on to quote genesis at some length it s worth repeating this guy is the chairman on the same committee is an oilcompany tool and 27year veteran of congress , representative joe l barton of texas you may remember barton as the politician who apologized to the head of bp in 2010 after the government dared to insist that the company pay for those whose livelihoods were ruined by the gulf oil spill barton cited the almighty in questioning energy from wind turbines careful , he warned , wind is god s way of balancing heat clean energy , he said , would slow the winds down and thus could make it hotter you never know you can t regulate god ! barton barked at the house speaker , nancy pelosi , in the midst of discussion on measures to curb global warming the catholic church long ago made its peace with evolution , but the same cannot be said of house republicans jack kingston of georgia , a 20year veteran of the house , is an evolution denier , apparently because he can t see the indent where his ancestors monkey tail used to be where s the missing link \? he said in 2011 i just want to know what it is he serves on a committee that oversees education in his party , kingston is in the mainstream a gallup poll in june found that 58 percent of republicans believe god created humans in the present form just within the last 10 , 000 years a wealth of anthropological evidence to the contrary another georgia congressman , paul broun , introduced the socalled personhood legislation in the house backed by akin and representative paul ryan that would have given a fertilized egg the same constitutional protections as a fully developed human being broun is on the same science , space and technology committee that akin is yes , science is part of their purview where do they get this stuff \? the bible , yes , but much of the misinformation and the fables that inform republican politicians comes from hearsay , often amplified by their media wing remember the crazy statement that helped to kill the presidential aspirations of michele bachmann \? a vaccine , designed to prevent a virus linked to cervical cancer , could cause mental retardation , she proclaimed bachmann knew this , she insisted , because some random lady told her so at a campaign event fearful of the genuine damage bachmann s assertion could do to public health , the american academy of pediatrics promptly rushed out a notice , saying , there is absolutely no scientific validity to this statement nor is there reputable scientific validity to those who deny that the globe s climate is changing for the worse but bachmann calls that authoritative consensus a hoax , and faces no censure from her party it s encouraging that republican heavyweights have since told akin that uttering scientific nonsense about sex and rape is not good for the party s image but where are these factenforcers on the other idiocies professed by elected representatives of their party \? akin , if he stays in the race , may still win the senate seat in missouri bachmann , who makes things up on a regular basis , is a leader of the tea party caucus in congress and , in an unintended joke , a member of the committee on intelligence none of these folks are without power they govern , and have significant followings a handful of republicans have tried to fight the knownothings i believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming , said jon huntsman , the former utah governor , during his illfated run for his party s presidential nomination call me crazy and in an onair plea for sanity , joe scarborough , the former gop congressman and msnbc host , said , i m just tired of the republican party being the stupid party i feel for him but don t expect the reality chorus to grow for if intelligence were contagious , his party would be giving out vaccines for it
huntsville , utah the national championship trail run was held on a course both grueling and beautiful , more than 13 miles through the mountains near the great salt lake most of it was an unrelenting upanddown , the path often hugging ridges along a steep plunge , curling through a forest of scrub oak , white pine and red maple the elevation hit a lungbusting 7 , 300 feet the race began in the parking lot of a ski lodge , and there was reason to do a double take as hundreds of men and women gathered near the starting line in the front row , among some of america s best endurance runners , were two scrawny girls barely tall enough to reach the elbows of the others from afar , they looked like twin pixies , tinker bell one and tinker bell two , though the sisters were actually two years apart kaytlynn , 12 , and heather , 10 , had long blond hair tied back with elastic , and the younger girl had a tiny stuffed animal a raccoon pinned to the front of her sports bra each of them weighed about 60 pounds their thighs were not much bigger than saucers , and the full loop of their hips was only 21 inches these children sweetened the scene with a dollop of cuteness , but curious onlookers were unsure whether to be intrigued or appalled the trail s ascent was an exhausting slog , and the precarious downhill required careful balance as swift feet inevitably slid on the loose and stony ground the dry , thin air could suck the strength out of even the fittest runners were these girls really capable of competing with elite athletes \? and even if they were , was it a good idea for children this young to be in a race this tough \? the announcer certainly made a fuss over them kaytlynn and heather welsch were from alvin , tex , he said , happily promising , these girls are n't just here to run they 're here to win kaytlynn maneuvered herself into a spot at the starting line next to max king , 32 , who had won the race four years in a row and placed sixth in the steeplechase at this year s united states olympic trials the girl s father had told her she needed to start out fast with the best of the men do n't you get caught way in the back , he admonished her run out front , run smart king was astonished to be standing beside someone so tiny kaytlynn was only 4 feet 5 inches towering above her to the left was the broadshouldered b j christenson , a champion triathlete from utah he stood 67 the race traditionally begins with an explosion from a small cannon cover your ears , king advised the girl but kaytlynn simply stared straight ahead , her angular jaw locked tight she leaned forward with her left hand cupped around her left knee , ready for a quick first step with the right the announcer yet again delighted in the sight of the blond sprites at the front good gosh , look out for the welsch sisters , he called out cheerfully then the cannon blasted with an enormous boom during the previous two years , kaytlynn had competed in more than 90 endurance events , about a dozen more than her little sister some were children s races of modest distances , but most often they covered mileage meant to challenge adults kaytlynn had finished two marathons both girls competed in triathlons , an amalgam of limbexhausting skills where they typically swam 500 meters , cycled 13 miles and ended with a 31mile run the sisters were better on their feet than in the water or on bikes and they preferred trail runs to road races , bored with long jaunts on city streets all you see is house , house , lamppost , lamppost , kaytlynn complained for them , running trails along rivers and ravines was the most fun , though they sometimes fretted they would be lost in the woods or attacked by a bear the fear was like something out of a children s story , half imaginary and half real kaytlynn thinks there s a giant sea monster at the bottom of every lake , her younger sister said , and both girls giggled the championship race in utah was organized by xterra , a company that puts on a popular series of trail runs and triathlons a month before , in late august , kaytlynn won the women s division of a major 13mile xterra race through cameron park in waco , tex heather finished third will ross , an event codirector , said he had never seen the girls before , and he recalled chuckling as they darted out in front soon they would come to jacob s ladder , a 100foot ascent on steep and uneven steps some of those stairs were thighhigh on these girls , and ross was used to watching foolhardy runners jackrabbit to the top only to use themselves up and pay for it later but the girls ran with the steady motion of metronomes some of the men passed them later , but the favorite among the women , claudia spooner , caught up to heather only at mile 5 and finished two minutes behind kaytlynn i was astounded they could run like that , spooner said a 13mile trail run is much harder than a halfmarathon , its road race equivalent the course in waco swoops and twists through cedar groves and bamboo forests , passing along limestone cliffs above the brazos river although loose dirt is easier on the legs than pavement , the trail presents the ankletwisting hazards of rocks and bulging roots and fallen branches runners needed to be wary and spry , and this favors seasoned athletes women often peak in their 30s or even 40s spooner , 42 , had won the cameron park race in 2010 and placed second in 2011 a triathlete and a coach , she said she felt conflicted about these beautiful but teeny girls they were smaller than her 8yearold son , and she would never put him in such a race it was too hard on young bodies , she said it could harm their growth afterward , spooner spoke to the girls' father , who said they had driven to waco from the junior national triathlon championships in ohio she sized him up as a pushy sort , a distancerunning version of a little league dad he told me he 'd been very hard on the older girl for finishing only sixth in ohio , spooner recalled i said , really , is it that big a deal \? she s 12' kaytlynn s win in waco was celebrated on outside magazine s web site the headline called her a 12yearold trail running phenom , and the story provoked a long string of comments on twitter many readers found the girls awesome and inspiring , but others predicted trouble for their developing bodies and an early burnout of their competitive fire wayward parenting was mentioned the welsches were familiar with such rebukes kaytlynn said , sometimes in a race , people will say good job , ' but a lot tell me i should n't be running and i'm going to hurt myself heather added , they do n't like it when we pass them up , and some of them say the s' word niki welsch , the girls' mother , said the online carping made her feel sick she wondered why some folks were so sure of the best way to raise other people s children i thought about answering them , she said but i decided these people do n't know us they 're on the outside and ca n't see the inside rodney welsch , 42 , the girls' father , is an analytical chemist for a company that makes plastics used in containers and wrappings basically , we make garbage because that s where it ends up , he said in his halfjesting way niki , also 42 , works weekends as a registered nurse for hospice patients the welsches' house is in a quiet neighborhood in alvin , 25 miles southeast of houston the girls each have a bedroom stuffed animals and trophies and medals are positioned just so kaytlynn is also a consistent winner at science fairs rodney and niki expect their daughters , one in seventh grade , the other in fifth , to keep at least a 93 average in each subject at school a large treadmill sits beside the sofa in the family room television has been banished from the house , though the girls are not in a pop culture lockdown kaytlynn has an iphone , heather an ipad who are you facebooking with now \? rodney asks kaytlynn when her thumbs are hyperactive on her phone friends , she replies which friends \? friends i know the origin of the girls' running prowess is portrayed as a genetic mystery both parents are athletic , but neither was any kind of star rodney played high school soccer , and his coach forced the team to run crosscountry but i never won a ribbon , never even placed , he said the welsches enjoy the outdoors camping , hiking , biking and they wanted their two children to be active in sports kaytlynn tried soccer , basketball , gymnastics and softball , but none of them captured her heart her puny size often placed her at a disadvantage during soccer , people would run right over me like i was the ball , kaytlynn said in school , some kids called her midget if she wore green , they called her leprechaun kaytlynn was 8 when rodney read something in a magazine about children s triathlons sponsored by the kiwanis club competitors could be as young as 7 the distances were not very long rodney thought kaytlynn would enjoy it , which she did , sort of early on , she was not only undersize but underequipped she had neither goggles nor a swim cap for the pool she pedaled a clunky singlespeed bicycle kaytlynn wanted a chance to win , so the welsches gave her swimming lessons and bought her a faster bike , first a threespeed , then an eightspeed her performance improved , though it was only in the running that she truly excelled , passing others one by one as they struggled toward the finish line in 2010 , rodney began entering his daughters in road races 1k , 5k , even 10k they usually beat anyone their age and outran most women in their 20s and 30s he wondered if his daughters were some kind of endurance freak kids , and late that year , he entered them in a halfmarathon the girls handled the 13 miles well enough , but the more memorable part of the day came afterward a woman introduced herself as a pediatrician and gave rodney a scolding your daughters should n't be running in events this difficult , she told him do n't you know you 're hurting your kids \? unsettled by that berating , the welsches began researching the risks of running and took the girls to a series of doctors a podiatrist and an orthopedist checked their bones and joints an endocrinologist said that although the girls were small , their growth patterns were perfectly normal the welsches nevertheless remained cautious kaytlynn and heather were taken to a doctor whenever they complained of pain dr daniel o'neill , a houston orthopedist specializing in sports medicine , has seen them repeatedly for aches common in young athletes he has treated them with antiinflammatories and has recommended strengthening exercises o'neill , like dr mark sands , the girls' podiatrist , said there was no medical reason to keep the sisters from running as they did you have to evaluate every case one by one , but these girls are monitored for injuries , and their parents watch their nutrition , sands said running has no more risks for them than for anyone else he added and the girls really love it you can tell by how they talk kaytlynn and heather , though two years apart , were both born june 28 the older girl is the more serious of the two for some reason , running is really fun , even though it hurts sometimes , kaytlynn said i enjoy it i can go on and on without getting tired it makes a purpose in my life there are drawbacks , she realizes kids at school tell me man , kaytlynn , you 're no fun you never come over on the weekend you ca n't spend the night' and i say , i have races on the weekend , so of course i ca n't spend the night' i do n't have that many friends at school because of that reason in january , after kaytlynn completed the houston marathon , there was an announcement at school congratulating her she had covered the distance in 3 hours 45 minutes 15 seconds , the secondbest time that day for female runners younger than 19 a few days later , some kids discovered that her name was not listed in the marathon s official results they called me a liar , kaytlynn said actually , her name had been expunged because she was later disqualified rodney had finessed her registration the minimum age was 12 , and kaytlynn was only 11 i guess a lot of people complained i was too young and i was going to break my bones , she said age minimums at endurance races vary runners must be at least 18 to enter the , but more than 500 runners younger than that finished this year s los angeles marathon the youngest was 9 in triathlons and trail runs , age requirements are often set by the race director however , many of them leave the decision to parents as long as the mother or the father signs a waiver of responsibility dr mininder s kocher , an expert on sports medicine at boston children s hospital , said there was not enough solid research to make acrosstheboard judgments about children and endurance events certainly , there are risks when children put stress on their growth plates , he said this can lead to longterm consequences distance running can also delay the onset of puberty in girls but there are cases when kids compete at a high level in endurance sports and come through it just fine , kocher said dr w douglas b hiller , an orthopedic surgeon at north hawaii community hospital , expressed reservations in general , kids should stick to kids distances and then race at adult distances when they are adults , said hiller , who has been the chief medical officer for the triathlon at the olympics but he , too , said there were exceptions the distances run by the welsch girls sounded excessive to him but if these kids feel it s a mission to do this and they are n't having adverse effects , i guess it s ok , he said bottom line i would n't recommend it , but i would n't forbid it , either medical issues are not the only concerns i always ask what is this doing to the child psychologically and socially \? said the psychologist daniel gould , the director of the institute for the study of youth sports at michigan state university parents can get kids to do most anything at young ages so there is this who wants it more , the grownups or the children \? but that s not so easy to tell if the girls wanted to quit , that 'd be ok , niki welsch said without hesitation rodney did not seem so sure kaytlynn has too much talent to quit , he said besides , the girls say one thing one day and another thing the next kaytlynn said she wanted to quit the triathlon , and i said , you 're not quitting , you need to stay with it , ' rodney recalled two months later , after she gets a new bike , she says , i love the triathlon now' niki agreed children go through phases we know the girls well enough , she said we can tell when they 're just having a bad day the girls do not train much on weekdays but usually compete in one endurance event , and often two , on the weekends they may run a 10k on saturday and follow that with a triathlon on sunday because niki works weekends , rodney takes the girls to their races events occur all over texas , and sometimes , that means a middleofthenight departure , with rodney at the wheel of the family pickup and the girls , in pajamas , asleep in the back seat , buried beneath blankets so much needs to be remembered socks , shirts , sweat pants , fresh fruit , rapidpower energy gels , glutaminefortified recovery drinks heather needs her stuffed animals raccoon , skunk , beaver , owl and squirrel she carries them in a knit casing that looks like a knotty tree trunk these are her furry amulets she pins one to her shirt in each race , and that animal , she says , cheers her on as she runs and sticks out its tongue at other competitors heather sometimes cries during races she looks miserable people assume i do n't want to run and my parents are forcing me , she said that s not it at all sometimes , when people pass me , i get frustrated and start crying rodney suggests she repeat the words go go go whenever she feels tearful if you 're crying , you ca n't breathe right , he tells her the welsches own 100 acres in the country , and rodney would like to build a house there and tend his pomegranate orchard but there is little time for that instead , he has become a student of the art of running , or at least the coaching of it by necessity , he has also turned himself into a skilled bicycle mechanic kaytlynn s bike was bought on ebay for 945 , but he rebuilt it for more speed changing the rims , shifters , crank set and handlebars while spending about 5 , 500 heather s bike , a gift from santa claus , is worth about the same the girls are natural rivals kaytlynn will never let heather beat her , and rodney wishes the older girl felt as competitive against everyone else he says she never pushes herself to the limit , never finishes a race with a strong kick his assessment kaytlynn is 100 percent talent and heather is 100 percent hard work rodney s coaching style includes what could be called lowintensity nagging before a race , he dispenses favorite aphorisms remember , quiet feet swing your arms let momentum do the work listen to your good voice do n't let your mind ruin things for your body these instructions are repeated without harshness , and the advice is so repetitive , it is unclear how much the girls pay attention yet they obviously adore their father , climbing on him as if he were a personal set of monkey bars they leap into his arms , sure he will catch them and twirl them around during a race , rodney moves about frenetically , running to places where the girls can hear his shouts he is lean and fit once , as he rode a bike along a trail , some competitors suggested he get off his rear end and run beside his daughters that tickled him i said , i could try , but i 'd be 10 miles behind' the xterra trail run in waco offered rodney a motivational opportunity he told kaytlynn that if she finished first , he would take the girls to the biggest race of their young lives , all the way to utah for the national championship the flight to salt lake city was only the second time the girls had been on an airplane they bickered about who sat beside the window , and even trips to the lavatory were an adventure heather had to hang onto the sink when the air became bumpy she was startled by the whoosh of the toilet snowbasin , a ski resort at the foot of treelined mountains near ogden , was the setting for the race the late september chill was repainting the landscape russet and amber blended into the many shades of green the day before the race , rodney and the girls scoped out the course , walking partway up a mountainside beneath the gondolas of a lift ride the trail narrowed into a path through the woodland that looked like a setting for hansel and gretel when you get to those switchbacks , you need to bank off the side , he said do you understand what a switchback is \? it s a z but the girls were not entirely focused on the race look , daddy , i'm a turtle , heather said , slowly munching on a leaf kaytlynn made a careful selection of the fallen foliage and fashioned it into a laurel for her hair on the way back , in a burst of exuberance , kaytlynn took off down a steep service road , each of her footfalls a slap on the ground that kicked up dust she was running fast , then faster , then too fast to brake , she grabbed at a plant on the roadside and slid on her rump into a small boulder the awkward landing left her with a stubbed big toe on her right foot it was red and swollen on the sides and a mix of colors at the nail it ached and throbbed that evening , kaytlynn spoke to her mother on the phone niki told her that if she did n't want to run the race , she did n't have to rodney had said the same it feels fine enough , kaytlynn said , perhaps trying to convince herself the race was to begin at 9 am , and the welsches arrived at snowbasin two hours early rodney made the girls an endurancerunner s breakfast , mixing a drink with powdered energy fuel kaytlynn tolerates the concoctions and heather hates them the younger girl mostly nibbled on an apple danish competitors were required to wear bibs with their assigned number , but the flaps were too wide to fit across the girls' chests , and rodney instead pinned them in a semicircle around their hips heather also needed her stuffed squirrel fastened near her collarbone you 're putting a pin through its head , heather snapped at her dad as he worked at this tailoring you should 've taken owl , rodney said owl pins easier than squirrel the girls warmed up with a minimum amount of prancing kaytlynn had cushioned her bad toe with a bandage and some clear tape still , it bothered her , and she strode with a slight limp , which rodney found alarming you ca n't favor it , or you 'll hurt yourself everywhere else , he warned rodney hoped she would forget about the troublesome toe once the race began she s not hurt , he told niki over the phone it s not a knee or an ankle she just has pain , and she 'll deal with pain kaytlynn dutifully edged her way to the front at the starting line , and after the cannon blast , she started fast , but her stride was not as smooth as usual within seconds a few dozen runners , including several women , passed her the course led into the mountains at a steep 12 percent grade , higher than the maximum incline on most treadmills kaytlynn s face was contorted into a grimace as each step further sapped her strength the toe obviously hurt runners went by her as if they were attached to a faster pulley while watching kaytlynn s disappointing start , rodney had lost sight of heather she was hopelessly behind and already weeping her left knee and right arm were bloody someone had stepped on her foot at the starting line she tumbled to the pavement among a thicket of moving legs the runners soon disappeared into the forest , but the route later brought them into a clearing at the fourmile mark rodney hastened up a grassy slope to be there when the girls circled by kaytlynn was already behind about 20 women , but her stride had evened she was bounding along , bad toe and all c'mon , this is downhill you know how to run it , rodney shouted he then waited for heather she emerged from the trees three minutes later , and when she saw her father , she stopped , and her weeping erupted into a wail i fell down , daddy , she cried i'm bleeding i need stitches rodney looked her over carefully skin had been scraped away , but the wounds were not deep you do n't need stitches , he told her , trying to be soothing then he asked , you want out \? no , she said decide right now you ca n't cry and run at the same time do you want to run or not \? yes , she answered and again followed the trail into the woods the day , once so promising , now seemed cursed by some double whammy of pratfalls rodney shook his head he had hoped kaytlynn s willpower would triumph over a bad toe but even if it did n't , he thought she might run a great race anyway just to stay ahead of her sister he sighed , there goes my plan b from the clearing at the fourmile mark the trail again went uphill , not as steep as before but a clamp on the legs nonetheless the sun had clawed its way through a cloudy sky dust lifted off the ground , caking around moist lips so that each runner looked to have eaten a chocolate popsicle kimberley hefner , 38 , a personal trainer from south carolina , ran with kaytlynn for about a halfhour , the two runners small enough to stride shoulder to shoulder on the tight path you 're doing an amazing job , the older woman said you are kicking butt and taking names hefner was as talkative as the 12yearold was taciturn once a terrific young runner herself , she seized an opportunity to caution kaytlynn about the dangers of teenage partying do n't go boy crazy , she said plenty of time for that later that s what my dad says , kaytlynn replied hefner finally pulled away as the trail neared its highest elevation , a rocky promontory with a mesmerizing view the altitude had a chokehold on kaytlynn by then , and she had stopped before reaching the peak and stood hunched over like a question mark carlyn peterson , a 29yearold ultrarunner , caught up to the exhausted girl her attitude about endurance was the pain never goes away , so you just have to make room for it she slapped kaytlynn on the bottom and said , you 're fine , keep going she did the rest of the way was mostly downhill , some of it on scary switchbacks that leaned into the ridge tammy tabeek , 52 , an accomplished cyclist and runner , pulled even with kaytlynn on that descent , and the two speedily wended their way together , passing others kaytlynn , weary as she was , looked strong as the course came to an end in the valley , where a crowd was gathered amplified music pulsed through the air as kaytlynn ran through the chute at the finish , the announcer said , oh , my goodness , this girl just ran more than 13 miles heads turned there was robust applause many people were amazed at the grit of this spindly girl , and some wanted to touch her you killed it , kid ! one man said as he approached give me a highfive ! kaytlynn , of course , thought differently she had expected to be among the top five women and perhaps the winner instead she finished 30th among the 75 female runners and 111th over all her time of 2 08 29 meant her pace was two minutes per mile slower than in waco i did horrible today , she said disconsolately , her chin against her chest i did n't know altitude would make it this hard my throat hurt real bad i could n't breathe my thighs ached and my toe , it hurt , too rodney had waited along the trail to root for heather on the final stretch she came in 57th among the women at 2 23 28 rodney wanted to get her to the medical tent to tend to her bloodcaked abrasions concerned though he was , he still sneaked in some affectionate needling you must have stopped somewhere along the way , he told heather either that or you were walking he had a similar pinch of sarcasm for kaytlynn did n't we talk about this \? are you supposed to follow people or pass them \? rodney made sure the girls were rehydrated he inspected kaytlynn s toe and helped her and heather into some warmer clothing they were soon ready to leave but felt obligated to stay for the awards ceremony the girls had finished onetwo in the 14andunder age group kaytlynn was awarded a blue ribbon , heather a red one look at these two young ladies , the announcer said gleefully as they mounted the steps of a podium of course , they were the only two girls under 14 entered in the race in fact , they were the only ones under 19 and two of the only four under 24 in the rental car , heading to the airport , heather was again her cheerful self she laughed about her tears i kept telling myself , do n't cry , do n't cry , ' but all these people were running by me , she said they drove past sights they had happily marveled at a day before a waterfall , a row of apple trees , a series of twisting ducts that looked like a roller coaster but the mood was different now rodney looked at kaytlynn through the rearview mirror her thumbs were busy on her phone you quit on us today , he said no , i did n't , she responded yes , you did a lot of people run with a stubbed toe , even a broken toe they put it aside and do their best did you do your best \? yes your time shows you certainly did n't deep down she believed he was right , and she kept her eyes on her phone back home , a podiatrist examined the toe nothing was broken , though there was a possibility of a hairline fracture just in case , kaytlynn did not resume racing until two weeks later , and she began recording some of her best times last sunday , the girls ran a halfmarathon through the streets of houston the temperature was only 41 degrees with halloween so close , heather insisted on running in her pocahontas costume , but her older sister was all business , even pulling off the shirt she wore for warmth kaytlynn s pace was so fast , rodney cautioned her to slow down , but she maintained her same long , swift strides to rodney , it was as if she were saying , hey , dad , look what i can do she finished in 1 28 39 five and a half minutes faster than her personal record that sealed it , rodney decided in december , he would take the girls to oahu in hawaii they would go up against the very best , running along serpentine paths through steep mountainsides at the xterra trail run world championship

on saturday morning i sat at the dining room table in frank ocean s los angeles home and , for about three hours , spoke with him about love it s the type of thing that , if you ve spent time with his music , songs he writes for others and songs he sings himself , you can t help but do he s one of the sharpest observers of broken , cancerous relationships working in popular music today , usually drawing characters who pine for people they can t have and people who create force fields around themselves to make sure no one gets too close mr ocean can be one of these people himself i d met him a few times over the past year and a half , and he was always affable but a little distant during our conversation for a profile that s online now and will also appear on the cover of this sunday s arts leisure section , though , he was warm and expansive most people loathe divulging details of their personal lives , which makes all sorts of sense and i don t think a public figure s personal life is inherently offlimits , especially in cases where it so clearly has an impact on the art that gets made but mr ocean was hyperarticulate about his love life , about a pair of relationships that had been weighing on him he spoke with the sort of insight and directness you expect from someone you ve known for years still , i noticed he was avoiding genderspecific pronouns mr ocean is studious and precise , making points through things unspoken , so this absence felt notable once during our talk , i caught myself using the word she to describe the person in one of his relationships , and mr ocean didn t blink , though he didn t exactly nod in assent either i filed it away writing the piece , i made a point of avoiding referring to the sex of the people mr ocean had been discussing it was an instinctual choice something about the quiet way mr ocean spoke about love was in fact loud enough to stick with me a couple of days later , as i reviewed the transcript of the conversation and began to write when i spoke with him again on the phone , an hour or so before finishing the article tuesday evening , the issue of whether he d been avoiding full transparency was still a cloud in my mind , not fully formed i didn t press the point there was , in fact , more in a letter written on dec 27 , 2011 , and posted to mr ocean s tumblr tuesday night , he gave details 4 summers ago , i met somebody i was 19 he was too we spent that summer , and the summer after , together it goes on from there , a story about passion and confusion and fear and forgiveness it paralleled one of the relationships we d talked about , one where he was the one left feeling stung the additional information in the story was heartbreaking he d fallen in love with a man who couldn t reciprocate he did his best , but he wouldn t do the same , mr ocean writes of the night when he first confessed his full feelings he had to go back inside soon it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs in our interview , mr ocean talked of hiding behind his work , about chasing professional success as a buffer against the frustrations of his romantic life and in his letter he writes i wrote to keep myself busy and sane i wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine channel orange \( island def jam \) , his first studio album , which will be released this month , is anything but rosy , though and there are hints of this particular struggle some of the lyrics circulating ahead of the album release suggested that mr ocean was , indeed writing about love for members of either sex on bad religion , he appears to spell it out this unrequited love to me it s nothing but a oneman cult and cyanide in my styrofoam cup i could never make him love me never make him love me in writing about mr ocean and the album , i thought seriously about that and also about the fact that mr ocean tells a great story there are no rules that say a male songwriter can t write from the perspective of a straight woman , or that all love stories are to be taken literally , or that a man singing about love for a him was really doing anything more than delivering a lyric but the unchecked and alltooeasy assumption that would have led me to fill in a she or a her , where none was specified that s something that should be rejected , a societyshaped norm that is in fact a fiction it shouldn t be an issue , mr ocean s announcement about his sexual orientation he knows from broken hearts that s enough let s learn from him
across 19 nhl seasons , has won four vezina trophies , three stanley cups , two olympic gold medals and more games than any other goalie and yet , one shot continues to vex and perplex him it is not zdeno chara s or a steven or an alexander the shot that frustrates brodeur barely even touches the stick , and that is on purpose trying to save a deflected shot is akin to playing whacamole with a toothbrush not impossible , but not a whole lot of fun a tipped puck dips and darts and decelerates , vanishes and reappears as brodeur scrambles to react in the ' goal , it creates quite an unwelcome sensation he compared himself to a jackinthebox for a second , you 're like , all right , what s going on \? ' brodeur said you do n't know what to expect that s the problem the redirection is hockey s equivalent of a jewel heist , requiring of its practitioners cunning , courage and dexterity their vault is the crease , the sanctuary protected by stubborn defensemen meting out crosschecks and slashes and elbows their payoff is a goal , having nicked the puck with their stick blades at the proper angle , at the precise moment , and watching the deflated goalie peer into the net behind him three goals in the devils' 32 victory against the in game 2 of the eastern conference finals were scored on deflections , including for the gamewinner having slipped behind the rangers' defense , clarkson anchored himself in front of goalie and , with the shaft of his stick parallel to the ice , used the blade like a scythe , knocking down a shot by adam henrique that was sailing wide and sending it into the net clarkson said that he tried to redirect every puck shot his way , sometimes by lifting the blade angle to create the effect of a ramp , but usually by batting it down i know coaches yell , stick on the ice , stick on the ice , ' but i just feel more comfortable this way , he said last month of his preferred move deflecting pucks is an art , the product of a desire to find a niche , then master it as rangers center brian boyle said , anyone can do it , but not anyone can do it supreme handeye coordination is essential so are quick hands a masochistic streak does not hurt , either , because rugged forwards like boyle and clarkson , who roam the crease working for tips , absorb a disproportionate share of punishment there s a certain element of bravery to go into that area , with pucks coming in high and defensemen tying up your stick and pushing you out of there , said the hall of fame center joe nieuwendyk , who credited his lacrosse background for making him a tipper nonpareil for people who want to score goals and get their noses dirty , that s where you have to be some players learned early that , by altering the trajectory of a puck , they could alter the trajectory of their careers boyle focused on developing the skill at boston college , where he , as now , often stationed himself by the net rarely does a rangers practice go by without boyle spending a few minutes batting pucks out of the air if you do n't work at it every day , you can lose the timing , said tomas holmstrom of the detroit red wings , who is if you 're off for a while , you have to get the touch back so you always have to be doing something with it for philadelphia flyers wing scott hartnell , that means planting himself in front of the net , his back to the goal , at the end of practices he summons kimmo timonen or matt carle , defensemen who often play the point on power plays , to fire pucks at either side of him , allowing hartnell to work on his forehand and backhand tips following the advice of paul kariya , a former teammate in nashville , hartnell anticipates a shot , not in the air if it comes in high , you just move your stick up , hartnell said it s one motion instead of going up or down in a literal sense , no shot is easy to deflect but there are those that are less difficult they come in waisthigh , so players do not have to move their sticks much , and at a manageable speed but not too slow , boyle said , because those are like changeups the pucks often travel a treacherous path , choked with players determined to block them an obstacle tippers of decades past rarely dealt with the advantage i had was that i had time to set up , nieuwendyk said when our power play in calgary would zip it around , when al macinnis would have that big windup , it was almost like a parting of the seas , and i 'd be left isolated in front you look at the nhl now , and everybody s a shotblocker the equipment s better , the protection s better and no one s afraid anymore back when i played , that puck used to hurt it still does , but many players just do n't care as the shot hurtles toward him , hartnell makes a series of decisions and calculations , none of which entail getting out of the way he judges the height of the shot , gauges its accuracy and considers the goalie s style is he butterfly , standup or a hybrid \? before deciding how hard to tip it , if he does at all if he senses the goalie tracking the puck over his left shoulder , hartnell aims to give the shooter a lane to fire it to his right , so he can try to deflect it between the goalie s legs but if the shot seems headed toward a corner , often hartnell will let it sail past if you 're going to be tipping pucks , you almost have to have a goaltender s mentality , said the rangers' backup goalie , martin biron because you want to be exactly where the goalie should be before the goalie gets there clarkson said that the most critical component to a successful deflection did not even involve a stick it involves his body , which he uses to obstruct the goalie s view if i make him duck down or look through my legs , he said , i'm doing my job brodeur does not have to contend with clarkson , but there are plenty of renowned tippers who merit extra attention holmstrom is lethal , brodeur said , but so are ryan smyth of edmonton and kris versteeg of florida , who prefers setting up higher in the slot , giving his redirections more space to travel and thus , more space to deflect off something else where it goes , who knows \? brodeur said a lot of it is luck you just hope it hits you
on a mild autumn sunday in washington a halfcentury ago , bobby mitchell dominated the st louis cardinals mitchell , a 27yearold flanker for the , caught 7 passes for 147 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 2414 victory trying to contain mitchell , the washington post sports columnist shirley povich wrote , was like trying to deal with a basketful of snakes those achievements , however , were mere footnotes for that day , sept 30 , 1962 , marked mitchell s first home game for the redskins he was one of three black players on the roster guard john nisby and fullback ron hatcher were the others all in their first season with washington , the last professional football team to integrate the integration of the redskins was 16 years in the making , brought on , at least in part , by the combined efforts of the nfl s commissioner and a member of president kennedy s cabinet and it was a historic moment in the life of the nation s capital , which had blossomed from a relatively small and segregated city populated primarily by federal employees to a large and diverse metropolis roiled by social upheaval you 're performing for a group of people and you 're not sure if they want you , so i had a lot of mixed emotions that game , mitchell , now 77 , said recently i still do n't believe i performed as well as i did , knowing how i felt all week long getting ready the redskins were owned by george preston marshall , who was born in segregated west virginia to native washingtonians he attended segregated high schools in washington his family counted a confederate flag among its heirlooms in 1932 , marshall bought the boston braves football team after five years of sparse crowds , and a loss of 85 , 000 , marshall moved the team , now named the redskins , to washington the redskins became the southernmost nfl team east of the mississippi river and the only one outside of the northeast , the upper midwest or the west coast when the redskins arrived , washington was a smaller , mostly homogeneous city fewer than a million people lived in the area many were federal employees white federal politicos ruled the city , particularly southern senators and congressmen congress segregated local public schools in 1862 , and de facto segregation existed at most public facilities during the early 20th century the redskins played at a small site , griffith stadium , which marshall rented because he depended on revenue sources besides ticket and concession sales , marshall cultivated a network of radio and television stations that carried games throughout the south by 1956 , 60 radio and 29 television stations broadcast redskins games marshall viewed the redskins as an entertainment vehicle he could market in the south and to washington socialites he staged elaborate halftime shows , created a marching band like those at southern colleges and adopted a team song when dc stadium opened in 1961 , he ordered that the seats be wide and feature backrests as for integrating his team , marshall said that many fans preferred watching white players and would reject the redskins if they had a black player in contrast to other nfl owners , marshall did not pretend there were no blacks good enough to make his team , andy piascik wrote in gridiron gauntlet the story of the men who integrated pro football in their own words unlike the others , he was honest enough to admit that he simply did n't want them around despite the owner s attitude , the crowd at redskins games featured at least a bit of diversity edwin b henderson , the black washington public schools director of physical education , observed the crowd before a game in september 1940 and wrote a subsequent letter to the washington post that 32 , 000 mass of americans standing tense , erect and fervidly at attention at griffith stadium sunday , when our national anthem was being played , was tremendously impressive and solemn , henderson wrote in this setting , we have democracy at its best crowded and packed together , jew and gentile , black and white , thrilled and slumped with the fortunes of marshall s indians that was not how it was on the field though pro football included 13 black players through the 1920s and early '30s , the integration of the sport did not truly begin until 1946 when the los angeles rams signed running back kenny washington and receiver woody strode , and the cleveland browns of the allamerica football conference signed offensive tackle bill willis and running back marion motley in 1949 , 3 of the 10 nfl teams had black players by 1955 , the redskins were the lone holdout in the 12team league at the same time , washington was enduring a rocky transition to a booming , cosmopolitan , more heterogeneous city fueled by the new deal and postwar expansion , the number of federal jobs in the area jumped to 230 , 000 in 1950 , from 62 , 000 in 1930 , and the population increased to 15 million from 600 , 000 and the increasing number of black residents began taking federal jobs in building trades , manual labor and personal services industries from 1938 to 1956 , the percentage of black federal workers in washington increased from 3 to 244 despite moves toward integration throughout the 1950s , washington , like its football team , was far from racially harmonious the truman administration barred discrimination in federal hiring in 1950 the law took three years to fully enforce , but during that time , most private restaurants and theaters desegregated in 1951 , catholic schools desegregated public schools began desegregating three years later white flight to the suburbs , as well as housing and business discrimination and continuing congressional control of the district of columbia , slowed integration enrollment in washington public schools went from 49 percent white and 51 percent black in 1950 to a 2080 split in 1960 , and many elite private schools refused to desegregate it became obvious that desegregating the city was one thing , but integrating it would be another the redskins remained popular throughout the 1950s , sometimes drawing more than 30 , 000 fans to a game , despite missing the playoffs every season marshall rebuffed calls to desegregate the team we take most of our players out of southern colleges and are trying to appeal to southern people , marshall told the new york times in 1961 those colleges do n't have any negro players in february 1957 , the naacp picketed outside a philadelphia hotel where nfl owners were honoring marshall for his service to the league pickets called for marshall to desegregate we did n't get to first base , eugene davidson , the naacp s washington president , told sport magazine a few years later as the december 1960 nfl draft approached , povich , the washington post columnist , wrote that marshall s racial prejudice was a disservice to all his coaches , and that most fans wanted the redskins to integrate marshall said the criticism did not bother him , calling povich s columns publicity yet , privately , he grew frustrated holding the second and third picks over all , washington selected a white quarterback and a white offensive tackle in modern pro football , marshall is an anachronism , as out of date as the dropkick , povich wrote in response the other club owners have passed him by marshall , with his dedication to white supremacy on the football field , is still hearing a cry that does n't exist a few weeks later , henderson , the black physical education director , wrote a letter to the baltimore afroamerican newspaper calling for black fans to boycott redskins games into this environment stepped stewart l udall , president kennedy s secretary of the interior the redskins were preparing to move into a new stadium being built on federally controlled land affiliated with the national parks system , and hence under udall s domain udall stipulated that the redskins could use the stadium only if they followed federal laws that meant not applying hiring discrimination i did n't know the government had the right to tell a showman how to cast the play , marshall responded pete rozelle had become the nfl s commissioner a year earlier , at 33 he avoided confronting marshall then , even though he intervened to prevent segregated seating at a preseason game in roanoke , va , between the pittsburgh steelers and the baltimore colts when the league signed a lucrative national television contract in 1961 , however , team owners urged rozelle to meet with marshall , which he did in august afterward , marshall said publicly that he was interested in selecting a top black player in the upcoming draft udall agreed to allow the redskins to play in dc stadium in 1961 on the condition that they would indeed desegregate after the season critics were skeptical that marshall would keep his word the los angeles chapters of the naacp and core boycotted an august preseason game between the redskins and the rams , and fans picketed outside the redskins' season opener at san francisco two weeks later , on oct 1 , the redskins opened dc stadium before the game about 100 people picketed outside the stadium , including naacp and core members some carried signs that read we carry the rifle why ca n't we carry the ball \? or people who ca n't play together , ca n't live together the redskins , meanwhile , struggled on the field , going 1121 in 1961 the draft was dec 4 , a day after washington squandered a 177 halftime lead and lost to the cardinals ernie davis , the running back from syracuse who had won the heisman trophy , was projected as the top prospect he was also black , and it was thought in some quarters that marshall would pass on him and instead select a white player like roman gabriel , merlin olsen or lance alworth the redskins , though , did indeed draft davis then , just over a week later , they traded his rights to cleveland for a package that included mitchell , who acknowledged he had initial misgivings about his new team the redskins of 1962 , including mitchell , nisby and hatcher , started 101 protesters again gathered outside the stadium again for the redskins' home opener the next week this time it was the ku klux klan , unhappy the team had integrated none of that seemed to affect mitchell late in the first quarter , washington faced a third down at the cardinals' 40 quarterback norm snead faked a handoff and lofted a pass to a streaking mitchell he reached over his shoulder , caught the ball at the 5 and cruised over the goal line in the second quarter , mitchell beat double coverage and caught a 23yard pass from snead in the end zone for about five , six games we were just about leading the league , and that was unheardof for the redskins , mitchell said we were playing over our heads the redskins finished the season 572 , their best record in five years mitchell led the nfl in catches \( 72 \) and yards receiving \( 1 , 384 \) and was third in touchdown catches \( 11 \) mitchell s first three years in washington were trying , he said , especially for his wife and two children some stores and restaurants refused to serve them , he said , and there were sportswriters who told him that their editors had ordered them not to write feature stories about him or vote for him to be an allpro the team began to add more black players , however , and also continued to improve by the mid1960s , the redskins were one of the highestscoring teams in the league the whole tenor changed , mitchell said as we got more black guys on the team and we began to split out around communities , treatments began to change as for marshall , he began retreating from the public eye before the 1962 season ended he became ill and turned over control of the team he died in 1969 nearly 20 years after marshall s death , doug williams became the first black quarterback to lead his team to a victory when the redskins beat the denver broncos , 4210 washington was a much different city from the one it had been when the team first arrived a few days after the super bowl triumph , fans lined downtown streets on a rainy midwinter day to watch williams and his teammates parade by , cheering on a team that brought pride to the city
washington members of congress feel mighty proud of themselves this week , mainly because they appear to be avoiding a government shutdown an outcome taken as an actual accomplishment in this turbulent and acrimonious legislature but by the end of this week , lawmakers plan to leave town and not return until after the election , leaving behind a staggering pile of bills , many of pressing importance to voters across the nation the 112th congress is set to enter the congressional record books as the least productive body in a generation , passing a mere 173 public laws as of last month that was well below the 906 by the body president harry s truman referred to as the donothing congress , and far fewer than even a single session of many prior congresses partisanship and process have impeded measures that have traditionally been easypeasy affairs like the , or a measure to protect women against domestic violence as well as those that have an impact on national security , for instance a bill to combat cybercrimes and a bipartisan measure to finance the military a measure to shore up the ailing postal system might as well have been marked return to sender a broadly supported measure that would normalize trade relations with russia stalled appropriations bills , once the central function of the legislative branch , have been ditched in favor of shortterm spending measures that do little more than keep the lights on after the election , when the makeup of the white house and the next congress are known , there will be a lameduck session during which myriad tax issues will be tackled , or , somehow punted into the next year both sides want to undo impending cuts to the military and other parts of government that resulted from an agreement last summer to raise the the republicanled house has passed a measure that has no shot in the senate , because it relies on cuts to other domestic programs opposed by majority democrats as such , congress is about to recess not with a victorious bang , but rather with a bleat of resignation it s very frustrating to have worked on legislation that really matters to our country like the cybersecurity bill and legislation to save the postal service and just have them gather dust , said senator susan collins , republican of maine it s also extraordinary , she said , at a time when we have a 16 trillion debt and we are facing the threat of enormous tax increases plus mindless acrosstheboard cuts , that congress is unable to even pass a budget this has been a very disappointing session with few accomplishments in the house , the republican freshmen are humbled , representative paul d ryan , their budget guru , floats around the united states on a campaign plane as mitt romney s running mate , their appropriators are handcuffed and sulking , and their speaker is still hamstrung across the rotunda , senator harry reid , the nevada democrat and majority leader , seems content to achieve little , both as a way of avoiding and embarrassing votes for incumbents up for reelection , as well long floor proceedings that serve only to keep members off the campaign trail \( to be totally fair , before leaving the senate might entertain a measure that would , among other things , make it easier to bring home polar bears shot in canada \) in that chamber , too , appropriators have been disabled , with leaders using the excuse that the house will not negotiate in good faith by using the same budget numbers they have been somewhat stymied by the white house , which also threatened to veto such bills if the house does not comply with its demands government tends to be very messy when it is divided , and much congressional activity in past decades has focused on increasing spending and the creation of government programs , both anathemas in the current republicancontrolled house further , in recent years , congress has moved to pass fewer , but more encompassing laws individually , the senate and the house have been very productive , said don ritchie , the senate historian , pointing to a bipartisan farm bill that has passed the senate and myriad antiregulatory measures in the house but constitutionally none of that becomes law if they have n't been able to agree with each other in a final version on the house side , leaders have had trouble finding support for some major legislation this year , even bills that have come flying out of their own committees with bipartisan backing for example , while the senate passed a bipartisan version of the farm bill , the house does not have the votes for its own bill , largely because many republican members do not support its level of spending many democrats have also resisted cuts to the food stamps program in the bill this inaction has led to a petition circulated by democrats but signed by many republicans willing to buck the leadership that would force house leaders to bring the farm bill to the floor anyway this demonstrates the increasing political trouble that inaction on the farm bill has caused for members from farm states , like the dakotas and iowa , and divisions within both parties over how to move forward in the senate , democrats have closed down much of the longstanding process of allowing amendments to bills , which has enraged republicans , who then often turn those bills away via filibuster the senate has produced bipartisan bills on issues from farm policy to postal reform to china currency , said brian fallon , a spokesman for the senate democratic leadership but it takes two chambers to pass a law , and the other side of the building considers compromise a dirty word democrats insist this is because many republicans , notably senator rand paul of kentucky ,

if tom coughlin wins two more games , does he deserve serious consideration as a hall of famer \? that this question can even be posed is a reflection of the nfl s rollercoaster nature because if coughlin had lost to the jets a couple of weeks ago , many giants fans \( most of them \? \) would have wanted him fired and plenty of fans have wanted him fired at several junctures in his tenure with the giants , including before the runup to his last super bowl title , in the 2007 season so this is more of a speculative exercise than anything he hasn t won anything this year but let s explore a little winning two super bowls doesn t punch a hall of fame ticket tom flores won two with the raiders so did jimmy johnson with the cowboys so did george seifert with the niners none are receiving significant consideration as hall of famers flores has a low winning percentage \( 527 \) johnson lacks longevity \( nine seasons \) seifert was handed a mercedes by bill walsh bill parcells won two with the giants and will be in the hall , maybe even this year mike shanahan has won two , with denver , and will most likely make it , although he has seemed to be trying to give it away in the last five years bill belichick will obviously be in everyone else with at least two super bowls is in the hall coughlin is tied with jeff fisher for 19th in career victories , with 142 he has 114 losses and a winning percentage of 555 he performed wonders with the expansion jaguars , taking them to the afc title game in his second season and also in his fifth if he coaches three more seasons at his current win percentage , he ll pass coaches like marv levy , bill cowher , joe gibbs , bud grant , mike holmgren , and he ll be near parcells territory \( no 11 on the career list with 172 wins \) extra point do you think coughlin has a better resume than seifert , flores and jimmy johnson and could make it into the hall if he wins this year s super bowl \? andy barall has been a voice of reason on giants matters last january , he wrote why keeping coughlin was the right call below is the list of coaches george allen 19661977 paul brown 19461962 guy chamberlin 19221927 jimmy conzelman 192130 , 194042 , 194648 weeb ewbank 19541973 ray flaherty 19361949 joe gibbs 19811992 sid gillman 19551969 , 19711974 bud grant 19671983 , 1985 george halas 192029 , 193342 , 194667 earl \( curly \) lambeau 19191953 tom landry 19601988 marv levy 19781982 , 19861997 vince lombardi 19591967 , 1969 john madden 19691978 earle \( greasy \) neale 19411950 chuck noll 19691991 steve owen 19301953 don shula 19631995 hank stram 19601974 , 19761977 bill walsh 19791988

for t i , the rapper , actor , novelist , realitytelevision star and former resident of the forrest city federal correctional complex in arkansas , existential accountings are routine and often occur in the oddest of places so he seemed unfazed to find himself , on a recent wednesday afternoon in hell s kitchen on the set of current tv s amiably fielding questions about federal weapons charges , the emotional veracity of his family s vh1 show , and the longterm romantic prospects of his fellow pop stars chris brown and rihanna the conversation veered from the aggressively personal to the patently absurd , and t i kept pace in person , as on record , he is fluent and at ease , slow to take offense , though quick to respond a question about bankhead , the rough neighborhood in atlanta where he grew up , led to a conversation about the disproportionate salaries of corrections officers relative to schoolteachers the brassy , diminutive ms behar began listing the names of her guest s six children messiah ya' majesty , she said quizzically , naming one of t i s sons that s a little long , is n't it \? producers cued up a clip of ms behar on the abc show the view , enthusiastically gyrating to his multiplatinum 2008 single you know , i still do that dance for my husband every night , ms behar said oh man , t i said , burying his head in his hands , a diamondcovered rolex on his left wrist catching the light the scene was surreal , but no more surreal than any other moment in the unceasingly public life of t i , born clifford harris at 32 he is already in the 12th year of a career in a music business where longevity is rare and second acts are nearly unheardof he has been to federal prison twice in the last four years , first on and then again on a in that time he also

definitely want to find other things outside of music and entertainment to get myself into , t i said , backstage after bidding ms behar a cheerful farewell the technology field i would love to find a way to team up with someone and collectively present something to the world that affects people in everyday life improbable tech entrepreneur or cautionary tale \? model family man or the last truly streetoriented rapper standing \? t i , perhaps more than any other musician currently working , embodies all the contradictions and weird juxtapositions that have come to define latestage rap stardom like jayz or p diddy he has become as much a walking brand as a working musician , a rap star whose presence extends far past the recording booth , onto the pages of us weekly and into the homes of millions of cable subscribers he is a remarkably deft and gifted rapper who has increasingly developed his talents in arenas that have nothing to do with rap the path of rapper turned businessman is well trod but fewer artists have transitioned as seamlessly into the larger entertainment world , and almost none have retained their credibility and vitality as musicians while doing so jeff olde , executive vice president for production and programming at vh1 , observed that t i has managed to broaden his appeal without diluting it in this media age the audience understands that people can be multifaceted and multitalented , mr olde said you can be a fantastic actor , you can have an amazingly successful reality show , you can be an incredible music artist i do n't think that it s just one thing anymore troubleman heavy is the head , is among the most vital and assured of t i s recent records it is at once a return to his dexterous early efforts and a step toward newer notions of adulthood and responsibility a fine line i calmed down for my kids and my mom , t i raps on who want some , immediately before taunting the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives , the lawenforcement agency that arrested him in 2007 fyi i never put my arms down tell the atf i got three more 380s left t i has many constituencies now , not all of them reconcilable on troubleman piquant barrages of boasts and threats alternate with more tempered songs aimed at larger audiences , which may know t i primarily as the genial patriarch he plays on television young ofthemoment rappers like asap rocky and meek mill are guests on troubleman , but so are more poporiented collaborators , including pink , cee lo green and r kelly the music he was making , you were not supposed to be able to sustain a musical career as long as this , said jermaine hall , editor of vibe magazine i do n't know if there s anybody else who has come from that genre who can still make trap music the bruising style of t i s past efforts but also make the big top 40 record the way that t i can after the joy behar show he climbed in a waiting van , emerging at a recording studio further downtown , where he was interviewed by the hot 97 radio host angie martinez his new record , he explained to ms martinez , was in part an attempt to describe my world as i envision it if i never became t i but there are also pointed reenactments on troubleman of reallife events , among them t i s illconceived attempt to buy assault weapons from a federal informant and a visceral restaging of the 2006 shooting death of his close friend philant johnson the skits , he said , were there to correct the impression that he had made his mistakes out of ignorance , rather than a regrettable combination of bad luck and worse judgment i'm a considerably intellectual person , t i said so for people to kick it like they thought i was just dumb , it s like , come on , man' you got to know there s more to it i'm not an idiot although , he ruefully added , i did make an idiot play the two prison terms cost t i more than his freedom the 2010 crime thriller that he starred in , came out the week of his second arrest , for a probation violation relating to drug charges he lost endorsement deals with r my martin , axe and chevrolet it was really bad for business , said brian sher , founder of category 5 entertainment and a manager for t i s nonmusical ventures rap stardom is an ephemeral thing it tends not to last traditionally for hiphop we 've never seen someone be an adult , be relevant and successful before , said jason geter , t i s friend and another manager fatigue sets in , trends change , audiences move on this summer t i told a radio station he was this is what everyone fails to realize , he said i want out in retrospect it was a premature statement , t i said , though he meant it at the time when i was just coming out of prison , seeing all the things around me that had changed drastically , t i said , he lost interest in continuing and once you have put yourself in a position where you can take advantage of other opportunities , like i could focus 100 percent on movies , and i 'd be straight and it would be less aggravation on a daily basis his previous record , no mercy , had been a disappointment he 'd become tabloid fodder because of his prison stints , which stung there was an increasing gulf between his private life as a family man and public life as a careless recidivist the question was whether music was still a world that t i wanted to be a part of for t i i think the challenge is , mr geter said , rap is where you 've come from and now it s time to graduate and move on troubleman , with its delicate mix of tough talk and songs about fatherhood , marriage and regret , is t i s attempt to do just that , he said the day before he had been in detroit , giving away toys with the lions star ndamukong suh the next day he would head to baltimore and then home , to atlanta he had a good feeling about troubleman , he said , adding that he felt as if he had another few records in him but it is time to begin to pull the plug of the exit strategy he leaned back in his seat i'm not going to be doing this in 10 years , i can tell you that now , he said if you see me up here at 40 , something happened
boston the river street bridge here is normally unremarkable , the kind of structure people drive over every day without a thought when it fell into disrepair , state officials knew that replacing it would normally involve two years of detours and frustration for local drivers instead , they did it over a weekend by using accelerated bridge construction techniques , a collection of technologies and methods that can shave months if not years off the process of building and replacing critical infrastructure , massachusetts is at the forefront of a national effort that is aimed at putting drivers first this will be the new normal , said victor m mendez , the head of the federal highway administration quick replacement of bridges , however , is anything but intuitive , he said if you have n't seen it , it seems kind of odd that you 'll pick up a bridge and slide it into place , he said as the sun climbed into the sky on sunday , the new river street bridge , 400 tons of steel and concrete , rode on a set of trailers and high supports that adjust to keep the span as level as a tray of drinks balanced on a waiter s hand jaiden rivera , 7 , watched the operation from the other side of a chainlink fence with his grandfather , eddie anderson mr anderson invited his five grandchildren to sleep over so they could be there to watch a bridge moved and slipped onto its abutments like the world s biggest lego block it s awesome ! jaiden said get a bridge replaced in days , not years , and there s wow , ' said theodore zoli , national bridge chief engineer for hntb corporation , who has received a macarthur genius grant for his innovative work on bridge construction nowhere have the various techniques for speeding bridge work been more enthusiastically embraced than in massachusetts , which replaced 14 bridges on interstate 93 last year over 10 weekends but similar techniques are being used around the country , from to the golden gate bridge in san francisco , which is getting 300 feet of new roadway one 25foot prefabricated section at a time , 78 pieces in all we have a bridge that we simply cannot close to traffic , said ewa bauer , chief engineer for the golden gate bridge highway and transportation district prefabrication techniques allow ms bauer s crews to close individual lanes instead of shutting down the bridge since february , they have torn out and installed one length of deck each night , and they have already completed a third of the task , she said none of the techniques is quite as eyepopping as heavy lift when a hunk of bridge is simply picked up and put into place time and the elements had not been kind to the steel and concrete of the old river street bridge , which stretches over railroad tracks used by freight and commuter trains the bridge also needed raising an additional 18 inches would allow doubledecker commuter trains to pass underneath so the massachusetts department of transportation got to work it had upgraded its own inspection and replacement processes after the august 2007 collapse of an interstate bridge in minneapolis , said richard a davey , the massachusetts secretary of transportation it put its focus on rapid replacement , which tends to cost the same as slower approaches , if not less the highway department did n't use to see the drivers as customers , said frank depaola , administrator of the highway division for the department for a while there , the highway department was so focused on construction and road projects , it s almost as if the contractors became their customers one local resident who is happy about the quick work is gov deval patrick it s their money , after all , he said and it s their broken bridge at river street , workers started on the project last year , and began building the new superstructure on an adjacent lot in recent months on friday , the department shut down the rail line , leveled the track area with gravel and covered the tracks with sheets of plywood and steel to accommodate the trailers on friday night , heavy machinery tore out the old bridge , and on saturday workers installed precast concrete caps on the old bridge abutments , shaped to accept the new , higher superstructure the trailers are known as selfpropelled modular transporters , but the workers here call them by the name of the company that makes them goldhofer gravel made a popping noise as it shifted under the tires , and the sweetish smell of diesel fumes filled the air ed stuczko stood in front of the trailers , operating them with a big yellow controller and using a team of spotters to help make sure that everything was lining up correctly the controller was strapped to him with a harness , and had joysticks , buttons and readouts he played it like a virtuoso my son says , i got xbox , ' he says i got goldhofer he stopped every few feet , checked , communicated with the team fiddled with the controls more motion it was a gradual thing the level and alignment do not require the kind of fancy laser plumb bobs and rangefinders that fill engineering catalogs mr stuczko , who also helped repair the lake pontchartrain bridge after , pointed at the underside of one of the massive girders holding the bridge , where one of several magnetized bubble levels had been slapped up old technology and good eyes keep things straight and true the bubble is perfect for us , he said as the trailers conveyed the span over the substructure , riggers were watching the progress , calling out alignment into the walkietalkies you want to come over one inch , said brendan marino , and the bridge shifted , almost imperceptibly to the right no one was looking at it more closely than luigi gioioso , one of five brothers whose family founded the p gioioso sons construction company 50 years ago the company is the prime contractor on the job he is 78 and walks with a cane he was the only person on the site not wearing a hard hat , and no one told him to put one on he eyeballed the advancing bridge and said to his nephew , it s not going to fit he had noticed that the girders supporting the superstructure were sticking out too far and would bump a utility bridge built to channel the water , gas and fiberoptic lines it was not a disaster , just a delay the workaround took another hour or so , but was easily accomplished the bridge was laid gently on the abutments about two feet from its final position , and then the supporting girders lowered , moved back and raised again for the final bridge heave , the lip of the superstructure sliding down over the outside edge of the abutment like a lid fitting onto a box by 2 05 sunday afternoon , everything was in place and by the next night , traffic had begun to cross the new span a reporter asked how the new bridge would be secured to the old substructure it s 400 tons , said walter heller , a district highway director from massachusetts department of transportation , one of the officials who came to watch the show nobody s going to pick it up and take it home
athens the owner and editor of a respected investigative magazine was acquitted thursday on charges of breaching privacy laws in publishing the names of more than 2 , 000 greeks believed to be holding accounts at a bank in switzerland the case tested news media freedom in and fueled a scandal over whether officials here failed to aggressively pursue people suspected of evading taxes the verdict came four days after a phalanx of police officers the editor , kostas vaxevanis , as his magazine , hot doc , hit newsstands with the list before a packed court , mr vaxevanis and his lawyers portrayed him as the target of a politically motivated campaign aimed at damping the public anger at greek officials the list that mr vaxevanis obtained and published was handed to the greek authorities two years ago by christine lagarde , then the french finance minister and now the head of the international monetary fund , to help greece crack down on tax evasion as it was trying to mend its economy the list held names of 2 , 059 greeks who held accounts at a geneva branch of the british bank hsbc , which includes a former culture minister , several employees of the finance ministry and a number of business leaders the court finds the defendant innocent , judge malia volika said in handing down the decision mr vaxevanis emerged from the packed courtroom to cheers from a large crowd he hailed the courage of the judge , adding journalism for far too long has been a hostage to political forces that do n't allow it to work this decision sets a precedent that allows my colleagues to do their jobs without political handcuffs in his testimony , mr vaxevanis accused politicians of sitting on the information to protect powerful interests he charged that greece was governed by a small coterie of business elites protected by politicians and by news organizations owned by a handful of influential greek magnates greek people have known for two years now that there is a list of people who are rich , rightly or wrongly , and they are untouchable , mr vaxevanis told the court at the same time , the greek people are on the other side , they are suffering cuts the political system has been hiding the truth for so long , he said at times , the courtroom took on a chaotic atmosphere , with a courtappointed interpreter botching the greek translation for a british journalist testifying for the defense , and mr vaxevanis s lawyers shouting in protest cellphones rang and cigarette smoke wafted through the standingroomonly chamber as the judge , sitting beneath a greek orthodox painting of jesus , banged the table with her hand to restore order the prosecutor , iraklis pasalidis , called no witnesses and sat stonefaced during most of the trial he submitted a blank witness list to the judge , a move that one lawyer deemed an analogy of the blank nature of the allegations mr pasalidis nevertheless argued strongly that mr vaxevanis should be found guilty for defaming people without determining their guilt these are the culprits , take them and crucify them , mr pasalidis told the court is this a solution to the country s problems \? cannibalism \? the argument did not prevail to support his case , mr vaxevanis cited one of those named lavrentis lavrentiadis , a greek oligarch and the former chairman of proton bank proton received a bailout of 129 million arranged by evangelos venizelos , a former finance minister a financial prosecutor is now examining whether mr venizelos and george papaconstantinou , another former finance minister , told greek tax authorities not to investigate those on the list on thursday , the prosecutor asked parliament to investigate whether any politicians should face criminal charges for failing to determine whether any of the individuals on the list were guilty of tax evasion defense lawyers disputed the charges that mr vaxevanis violated privacy laws , noting that none of the people named had filed a complaint over privacy violation at stake , mr vaxevanis s lawyers argued , was the larger issue of whether the greek public s right to know about potential tax evasion that harmed the greek state overrode concerns about privacy one of the lawyers , harris ikonomopoulos , said the trial could be seen as a warning shot to news organizations considering publishing articles that might embarrass the government especially as other european nations press athens to be fiscally responsible and to go harder on tax cheats as it is , greek newspapers and television stations have provided scant coverage of the case frank vogl , one of the founders of transparency international and the author of waging war on corruption , said the trial would likely tarnish prime minister antonis samaras s government internationally , the case will serve as a blunt reminder to greece s international official creditors that it is hopeless to accept the pledges of the greek authorities that they will sharply curb their budget deficit so long as they fail to act meaningfully against corruption and tax evasion , he said mr papaconstantinou , the exfinance minister who received the list from ms lagarde , said he passed the names to the chief of greece s financial crimes unit , who later gave it to mr venizelos , the current leader of the socialists the tax chief , ioannis diotis , said mr venizelos had not instructed him to investigate it , a contention mr venizelos disputes the trial also came as several other greek journalists found themselves in trouble for questioning the government s handling of delicate political issues earlier this week , spyros karatzaferis , a broadcast journalist , was arrested on charges of libel after he threatened to reveal what he said were classified documents obtained by hackers involving the bailout agreement between greece and its socalled troika of lenders the international monetary fund , the european central bank and the european commission he said the hackers broke into the finance ministry s accounting system to obtain emails between the greek authorities and foreign banks the ministry has not confirmed any such breach , and a prosecutor has opened an investigation on monday , two prominent news show presenters were suspended by staterun television after they broadcast a report backing allegations of police torture and suggested that greece s public order minister , nikos dendias , resign
offstage the much publicized story of the shanghai dancer and choreographer jin xing , is one of courage , controversy , unorthodoxy onstage her shanghai tango program , playing at the joyce theater this week , is thoroughly and harmlessly conventional the performance ends affirmatively with bright colors and bright energy to 19thcentury viennese waltz music cue applause and yet the experience becomes a sad one why has a life so extraordinary been channeled into art so conformist \? , born male in china in 1967 to parents of korean descent , joined the people s liberation army at age 9 and rose to the rank of colonel , studied dance in the chinese city shenyang and in new york , and was an awardwinning performer internationally before choosing to undergo sexchange surgery in the mid1990s after initial government opposition to her affiliation to modern dance , she is today considered a cultural leader in shanghai , married with three adopted children , has published a memoir and was the subject of a 2001 french documentary , colonel jin xing nothing in shanghai tango \( 2000 \) is as interesting as those biographical facts the choreography looks government approved , tourist friendly , ingratiatingly orthodox the program says that the 10 items form an overview of ms jin s work over 25 years despite the changes that those 25 years brought china and ms jin , they add up to a remarkably consistent picture of politely agreeable westabsorbseast idioms the music ranges from johann strauss ii \( the blue danube waltz \) and astor piazzolla to john williams \( the theme from schindler s list \) and rene aubry the most advanced item sounds like philip glass lite the sound and look are less asian than orientalist until the closing waltz the music is almost all in 2 4 or 4 4 tempo and tangofriendly , though no tango is actually danced the choreography s dullest feature is its dependence on the downbeat the strong gesture of each dance phrase always arrives , predictably , on a strong musical beat , with none of the witty rhythmic suspense or brilliance that characterizes tango it s reasonable under the circumstances to be particularly curious about what shanghai tango , performed by 14 dancers including ms jin , has to say about masculinity and femininity here too , however , the choreography plays safe the one samesex duet \( malemale \) is entirely sexless and mildly acrobatic along the lines of pilobolus another duet , for a man and a woman dressed identically , shows mutual supportiveness and tender affection the man does the lifting , and the woman shows her gratitude in general the view of women here not least when ms jin herself dances in half dream is that they wear prettier frocks and show their emotions more easily and women s emotions range from joy to suffering men , however , are occasionally unkind the title number , inspired by a chinese folk tale , is about a mother who is conflicted between her husband and lover well , that s what the program told me afterward from the dance itself , which made the story like a soap opera , i assumed that she and her eldest son were sexually drawn to each other , while also taking turns to be extremely attached to a mobile stool , on which she or he now and then zoomed around the stage anyway , the heroine grieved guiltily until , on the last beat , she fell dead in her husband s arms i am sorry to report that i forget what happened to the stool
let s begin with a fundamental premise , and one that seems particularly popular and relevant in light of the miami heat s overtime letdown in wednesday s game against the los angeles clippers lebron james is not clutch that much is a statement of fact it is absolutely , 100 percent true but kobe bryant isn t clutch , either neither are chris paul , carmelo anthony , kevin durant , dirk nowitzki , paul pierce , michael jordan , magic johnson , larry bird , jerry west , or any other player you could possibly name none of these players are clutch because no player can be the word itself describes but a tiny slice of past performance , and indicates the timing and importance of a particular play rather than a fundamental attribute of any one player jordan , for example , was a fantastic player for a wide variety of reasons , and has highlight reel after highlight reel of clutch plays but there was no secret formula running through his veins to make him into basketball s most heralded closer , and he held no magical power to finish games beyond those that made him the greatest player of all time things like ball handling and shot creation obviously matter greatly when a game s verdict is reduced to a single possession there s just no basis for belief in some indefinable , intangible , haveitornot attribute this isn t a terribly counterintuitive , postmodern perspective merely a modern one we re all logical enough to know that the basketball gods didn t reach down to give jordan his fire , and yet we of the nba world continue to kneel before the altar of clutch there was and is no innate quality that makes a player prime for the lategame spotlight or doomed to be an afterthought there are merely the realities of oncourt skills and the constructions that observers of the game have built to glorify or obscure them we love the drama and theatrics of a big shot at the end of a close game who wouldn t \? but that basic appeal alone isn t enough to turn clutch into anything more than a descriptive term , no matter the borderline religious fanaticism toward a gameender none of this makes jordan s collection of gamewinning and goahead shots any less impressive , but they re impressive for a far more basic and understandable reason than his clutch reputation suggests those examples are mere showcases of why jordan was great in the most general sense he used the final moments of a close game to prove in a fashion as convincing as ever just how great of a scorer \( or in some cases , passer \) he really was jordan wasn t a winner in crunch time he was just a winner and , contrary to popular belief , so is lebron james no player in the nba is more productive or more valuable , and though james has struggled recently at the end of close games , he still contributes more to his team s efforts than anyone else that s as true in the first quarter as it is in the fourth the time on the clock does little to change james dominant game , even if it does as zach lowe demonstrated in a post for sicom s the point forward bog down miami s offense a bit that s not an indictment of performance so much as it is a letdown in strategic competence that can be corrected it s a flaw , sure , but not one hardwired into james genome with the concrete certainty that debates over his clutchness often suggest
seven years ago , a bad decision by then hawks general manager billy knight consigned marvin williams to a career of unfair comparisons despite the fact that williams had only played one unremarkable year of college ball , knight passed on the highly touted deron williams and chris paul to make williams , a sixth man and combo forward out of north carolina , the no 2 overall pick in the 2005 draft forever it will be that williams was selected over two of the best point guards of his generation , and from that moment he was burdened with not only the pressures of being a top pick , but the demand that he justify his selection relative to the elite level talent chosen just after him that clearly never happened , as williams has played the majority of his career as an underwhelming and inconsistent starter in atlanta but the first six games of the 20112012 season have showcased a far different williams he s nowhere near the level of player that would validate his premature draft selection , but williams , still just 25 , has bolstered his production as an offtheradar contributor to the hawks 42 start on a pergame basis , williams is averaging just 122 points , 63 rebounds , and 17 assists through atlanta s first six contests decent but unexceptional marks across the board yet he s been able to accomplish that much while playing the fewest minutes since his rookie season as larry drew has worked to integrate newcomers like tracy mcgrady , vladimir radmanovic , and willie green into the rotation , williams has seen his playing time dip to 255 minutes a night , making his pedestrianatfirstglance production pop in the context of his limited opportunities break williams production down per minute , and the improvements really start to take shape his scoring is up to 172 points per 36 minutes from 130 last season , largely because williams has begun to turn one of his weaknesses spotting up for jumpers on the perimeter into a potential strength williams still takes his fair share of jumpers when the ball swings to him on the outside \( he s made nearly half of his 3pointers this season , a shooting mark that will surely regress \) , but he s also looked to put the ball on the floor against a defense scrambling to challenge his shot thus far , williams has used these driving lanes to great benefit , as he s nearly tripled the rate at which he draws fouls in spotup situations , per synergy sports technology  williams is getting to the freethrow line a careerhigh 66 times and turning the ball over a careerlow 05 times per 36 minutes we re months away from knowing if those numbers have any real staying power , but there s no question that williams has been exceptionally efficient in limited minutes early this season yet the most pronounced change in williams game has come on the glass , where his career mark of 62 rebounds per 36 minutes a statistical anchor from which he s barely strayed in his seasontoseason performance has been dwarfed by the 89 rebounds per 36 that williams has collected in his first six games of the year that s a profound difference , especially considering that the hawks play at one of the league s slowest paces if we refine the data even further and evaluate williams rebounding on a perpossession level that removes pace as a factor , he rises to the top as one of the elite rebounders at his position again this may all be a very quaint exercise in small sample size theater but williams work on the glass has been the result of genuine effort and an emphasis on boxout position , two rebounding components with the potential to help williams sustain his success throughout the season that doesn t mean he will , per se effort can fluctuate just as easily as any other area of performance but the logical foundation for continued production is certainly there even with his improved play , williams won t soon be mistaken for a star he s a role player through and through , but if he maintains some reasonable approximation of his current pace throughout the season , he d at least become a very good one unlike some of his more shothappy teammates , williams doesn t overstep his role in the hawks offense or ignore his own limitations he s smart and skilled in a way that allows him to succeed without having the ball in his hands , and recently has begun to maximize the few possessions that do end up being funneled through him he s long been a solid perimeter defender williams hangs with his man and contests shots effectively and does a splendid job of filling in gaps for the hawks on both sides of the ball nothing williams does is all that incredible , but he could be growing into exactly the kind of vanilla role player that every winning team needs he ll quietly grab his six boards a night in the minutes allotted him he ll hit shots from here and there , but none so consistently that it becomes his shot he ll work hard on defense , and use his length to challenge opponents he ll walk the fine line of nba relevance , as diehards become more aware of his contributions and the casual fan knows him , if at all , as that guy who got picked instead of chris paul there s no shame in a long career as a successful , solidified contributor , particularly one taking the steps forward that williams has appeared to take this season it s surely not what knight nor williams , i m sure intended to come of the former no 2 pick s career , but playing the part of a restrained and understated component in the hawks system seems to suit williams rather nicely
valle de vi ales , cuba here , the mountains were n't pushed up from underneath , as mountains usually are in this national park and unesco world heritage site , everything but the mountains fell down the mogotes , as the islands of karstic limestone are called , are gently domed , like loaves of crusty bread , but the sides seem to have been cleaved off , leaving terrain that drops precipitously to the valley floor in the late 1990s , rock climbers found a paradise where the walls of the mogotes are too steep for the otherwise ubiquitous crawling vines and striving trees huge overhangs , some 500 feet tall , are covered with chandeliers of stalactites and intermittent blobs and pockets , all perfectly formed for human hands and feet to climb from the bottom of a cliff to its top soon , local residents caught on , and a flourishing climbing scene took hold vi ales became a top destination for climbers from europe , canada and the united states hundreds of routes went up the major mountain faces in the valley , and for years visiting climbers had essentially free rein no longer in late march , even as pope benedict xvi called for authentic freedom in cuba before an estimated 200 , 000 people in havana , climbers here , a threehour drive west of the capital , were wrestling with the prohibition of their sport in an era when the cuban government has been easing restrictions allowing private boardinghouses , private restaurants and now the sale of real estate and automobiles it seems to have moved in a sharply different direction here , threatening the prosperity of vi ales and the future of the sport in cuba by enforcing a ban on climbing and regulating independent tourism in general in march , out in the welcome cool of nighttime , under the fluorescent lights of a plazaside bar and over rumlaced national cola , the conversation among climbers centered on the guards who have been enforcing the prohibition since early in the year where had they been that day \? did anybody get busted climbing \? what happened \? and then , why are they there at all \? jens franzke , a climber from dresden , germany , here with his wife , ina , for three weeks , was fed up it feels like east germany before the fall of the , he said there are all these rules , and none of them make any sense there are no signs no detailed maps at all you ask if you can go somewhere and do something by yourself and they say , no , it s impossible' during their trip , franzke , 46 , and his wife had been forced to stop climbing multiple times , threatened with police action by park guards and told that the cuba climbing guidebook they were using to find routes in the valley was illegal to use because the authors do not live in cuba it s a real shame because it s such a paradise , franzke said the couple managed to climb nearly every day they wished by evading the rules and the guards , but we will never come back , he said this is the main worry for residents and climbers vi ales is the hub of the valley and the heart of vi ales national park the bustling town of about 17 , 000 has more than 300 private boardinghouses that rent rooms to tourists who hike , explore the cliffs , ride horses , watch birds and climb in the national park all that has allowed the valley to overcome the poverty typical across the country armando menocal , one of the cuba climbing guidebook authors and an expert on the region , said , tourism has created a strong , vibrant economy , and it s all based on outdoor recreation the crackdown , if it continues , could be devastating to tourism and climbing in vi ales cuban climbers rely on tourists to donate shoes , harnesses and ropes to climb equipment is not available , and even if it was the cost would be prohibitive in a country where government salaries average 15 to 25 a month without new donations , shoes , harnesses and ropes wear out without replacement , the bolts in the rock that secure climbers would corrode and eventually become unsafe climbing on the mogotes would become , essentially , impossible climbing was pronounced unauthorized and thus prohibited in 2003 , four years after major climbing development started the state deemed climbing a factor in peligrosidad , a vague designation of being dangerous to the state it is an offense punishable by imprisonment the climbing ban was never formally announced , nor was it enforced for tourists at all for cubans it was often a mere hassle , but consequences could be more severe one veteran cuban climber was put on notice of being considered peligroso in 2010 , and several others were taken to the police station and had reports drawn up this seems to have been more likely if the climbers were climbing and socializing with foreigners , which the state frowns upon when questioned by a cuban climber , one official s explanation for the disparity in enforcement between cubans and tourists , according to menocal , was the tourists eat ham and cheese you and i do n't in january , state agents called a meeting reaffirming the climbing ban climbers figured it was just more words , but suddenly guards were patrolling the perimeter trails of the park , turning climbers back in march , one guard , a congenial man in a green buttondown shirt , said we do n't like to say climbing is prohibited climbing is n't prohibited , because prohibited is an ugly word but may one climb \? no , he said he said the government was busy organizing a system through which one would buy a daily pass or license to climb a version of this explanation has been circulating since at least 2003 no such pass yet exists some suspect that state security is the reason for the crackdown many of the cliffs where climbing takes place are part of the national defense plan in case of attack , and climbers say they believe that state security officials are worried that the cubans and foreigners are there organizing against the government official explanations say cubans do not support a socalled extreme sport they are worried about serious injury , and officials have said an ambulance would always have to be parked near the base of the most popular cliff in case somebody is hurt but there is no money for that it is possible , too , that the government has no interest in a sport that has no chance at international glory in the olympics at which the cuban team tends to punch far above its weight owners of casas particulares , as the private boardinghouses are called , said warnings about the rules were overblown oscar jaime rodriguez , owner of a boardinghouse that is the de facto base camp for climbers in the valley , sought to quiet fears they are always saying , it s prohibited , it s prohibited , ' but climbers still come and they still climb , he said it s worth it menocal said that the cubans were hoping it blows over he added it could blow over who knows \? you do n't know the source of this you do n't know what s going on you live in this world of ambiguity all the time \( in fact , since reporting there concluded at the end of march , climbers have said enforcement of the no climbing rule may have become more lenient \) despite the possibility of consequences , cubans keep climbing they duck guards they hitchhike and walk hours to arrive at sectors where guards do not patrol one night , over more rum at the bar next to the plaza , cuban climbers regaled visitors with stories of a steep , clean wall of difficult routes where there wo n't be anybody but us and the birds the trip there was a slow 40minute taxi ride the driver wove around carswallowing holes and enormous , belching soviet trucks whose deep beds double as public transportation the wall was exactly as the cuban climbers had described all was silence but for the birds and the occasional iguana plunging from one perch on a high tree branch to the next it was a sunny , stressfree outing the next day the climbers walked and hitchhiked back to vi ales the trip , under full sun , took three hours it s worth it , one cuban climber who preferred to be called dan said no matter how strict the rules get , i 'll keep climbing if the tourists stop coming and we do n't have any gear , i 'll go bouldering in my bare feet i do n't care it is a bit of reassurance for him that tourists continue to climb most days , too they kill mornings waiting for the guards to quit , usually around 2 pm they get to the cliffs before the guards are on duty , around 9 am they climb on cliffs the guards do not frequent and wear dull colors to blend in with the rock on sundays the guards do n't work at all still , climbing can be a tense experience on the main walls near vi ales , the farms run hard up on the base of the cliffs farmers plow red soil behind oxen to prepare for planting the world s finest tobacco , and chickens scratch in the underbrush it is beautiful , but when climbing , every motion or sound becomes a guard approaching to end the day of adventure it s stressful , said cofi jones , a canadian climber after three weeks , she said , she was tired of it and leaving i'm over it , she said i'm over waiting until the guards go home to climb i'm over the guards it does n't feel good to be here doing something that s prohibited wouldbe cuban climbers feel the same way a climber who preferred to be called nagu said the number of avid cuban climbers was probably around a dozen you have no idea how many young cubans want to climb , he said , but they wo n't , because they 're afraid of the police on their last day in cuba , after an unmolested climbing session in warm early morning sun and a coco loco cocktail in the shade , the franzkes , the german climbers , reconsidered their vow never to return maybe all of the not so good stuff about cuba will leave my memory , jens franzke said i 'll just remember the beautiful people , the red soil , the salsa he looked at the drink in his hand , smiled and said , the coco loco he craned his neck in the direction of the mogotes , and added , and the spectacular climbing
unlike the republican platform , which has mostly been ignored outside of the abortion issue , the paul ryan budget is the core document of the 2012 campaign it is the most explicit expression of the republican agenda , endorsed by the party s presidential candidate , mitt romney , and backed by decisive majorities of house and senate republicans that much is known what people have not been talking about enough is that the ryan budget contains an 897 billion sinkhole massive but unexplained cuts in such discretionary domestic programs as education , food and drug inspection , workplace safety , environmental protection and law enforcement the scope of the cuts stunning in their breadth is hidden to find the numbers , turn to page 16 of the concurrent resolution on the budget fiscal year 2013 in table 2 , fiscal year 2013 budget resolution discretionary spending , in the far right hand column , you ll see the nearly 897 billion figure , which appears on the line marked ba for budget authority under allowances \( 920 \) as 896 , 884 \( because these figures are listed in millions of dollars \) according to the house budget committee , of which ryan is the chairman the federal budget is divided into approximately 20 categories known as budget functions these functions include all spending for a given topic , regardless of the federal agency that oversees the individual federal program both the president s budget , submitted annually , and congress budget resolution , passed annually , comprise these approximately 20 functions within the 20 budget functions lurks at number 19 function 920 in a masterpiece of bureaucratic obscurantism , the explanation provided by budget committee reads as follows  function 920 allowances function 920 represents a category called allowances that captures the budgetary effects of crosscutting proposals or contingencies that impact multiple functions rather than one specific area of the budget it also represents a placeholder category for any budgetary impacts that the congressional budget office has yet to assign to a specific budget function cbo typically reassigns the budgetary effects of any legislation enacted within function 920 once a new baseline update is released the importance of the nearly 1 trillion in unexplained and unspecified cuts that ryan and the republican party are proposing , under the catchall rubric of function 920 allowances , cannot be overestimated these invisible cuts are crucial to the republican claim that the ryan budget proposal will drastically reduce the federal deficit \( eliminating it entirely in the long run \) and ultimately erase the national debt ryan s plan was passed 228191 by the house on march 29 , 2012 , with no democrats voting yes on may 16 , the senate rejected the plan by a vote of 5841 the vote among senate republicans was 414 in favor while the ryan budget does specify cuts in programs serving the poor , many of whom are democratic constituents \( medicaid , food stamps , unemployment benefits \) , it hides under the abstruse veil of function 920 allowances the cuts in programs popular with many other voters this maneuver stands in stark contrast to ryan s campaign rhetoric at a rally last tuesday in westlake , ohio , ryan declared  we will not duck the tough issues we will not kick the can down the road romney and ryan have made their willingness to stand tall and to confront forthrightly the problems facing the nation a central theme of their campaign in ryan s words , again from westlake we will lead we will not blame others for four years we will take responsibility and fix this country s problems the lack of detail in the ryan budget applies mainly to programs of importance to the voters republicans continue to angle for , including swing voters concerned about programs like education , environmental protection and food safety interviews i conducted with new hampshire voters last month reveal the political liabilities of telling potential republican voters exactly what the romneyryan ticket intends to cut two voters , both republicans , told me they could not bring themselves to vote for their party this year because the ryan budget cuts spending for veterans benefits in an interview days after romney announced on a saturday that he had picked ryan , george lemieux said , based on what romney did this weekend , i would not vote for him lemieux , a 67yearold vietnam war veteran who spent 26 years in the army , declared that ryan wants to decimate medicare he wants to decimate the va i have a brother who is dependent on va disability , and he wants to cut it out entirely the ryan budget will kill everybody , said auralee nicodemus , another woman i met , who works at the va medical center in white river junction , vt and is active in the advocacy organization , disabled american veterans i m a registered republican and i can t vote for romney his actions speak louder than words there is a clear rationale for their concerns under the ryan budget , mandatory and defense and nondefense discretionary spending which includes function 920 allowances , but excludes social security , medicare and medicaid would fall from 125 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 to 675 percent in 2023 , 575 percent in 2030 , 475 percent in 2040 and 375 percent in 2050 , according to an analysis by the congressional budget office the cbo cautiously notes how difficult it would be to cut such spending to 375 percent of gdp by comparison , spending in this category has exceeded 8 percent of gdp in every year since world war ii spending for defense alone has not been lower than 3 percent of gdp in any year during that period romney , in fact , has committed himself to keeping the pentagon budget \( function 050 \) at 4 percent of gdp by 2050 , that would leave zilch under the ryan plan for such separately funded programs as veterans benefits \( function 700 \) the administration of justice , including the fbi \( function 750 \) education , train and social services \( function 500 \) , and pretty much anything else  the big question posed by the comments of the two defecting republicans i interviewed in new hampshire is are romney and ryan so committed to the principle of deficit reduction that they are willing , in an election year , to take on veterans \? that would be extraordinary the answer is no i emailed the romney campaign here s what i asked talking to voters in new hampshire , some veterans voiced strong concerns over the scope of likely cuts to the va in the ryan budget has governor romney said what will happen to veterans benefits under his administration \? the campaign immediately disputed any suggestion that the ticket supported cuts in services for veterans here is the romney campaign s emailed response that is false here are the facts the housepassed fiscal year 2013 budget matches the president s discretionary request for veterans for fiscal year 2013 613 billion over the tenyear window , the housepassed budget is actually above the president s request on both the mandatory and discretionary side of the ledger on the mandatory side , the house republican budget calls for 270 million more than president s request on the discretionary side , the house republican budget calls for 164 billion more than president s request , increasing america s funding for services and benefits earned by veterans in an accompanying statement , andrea saul , the romney campaign spokeswoman , said gov romney opposes president obama s plan of drastic cuts to veterans benefits and the military while exploding the federal budget elsewhere president obama s own va secretary has admitted that obama s devastating defense budget cuts put veterans funding at risk for an arbitrary acrosstheboard cut gov romney and paul ryan are committed to keeping faith with our veterans and providing the care they so richly deserve hmm how does this fit with the deficitreducing claims of the ryan budget and with ryan s boast that we will not duck the tough issues \? we will not kick the can down the road \? it turns out that a reading of the ryan budget if you don t parse function 920 is deceptive in the case of veterans benefits , for example , andrea saul s claim that the romneyryan ticket is committed to keeping faith with our veterans appears , on the surface , to be legitimate , because none of the mysterious function 920 cuts show up in her computations if veterans benefits are to be protected , what programs will be on the chopping block to achieve the 897 billion in cuts listed under the mysterious function 920 allowances category \? will it be education or food inspectors , air traffic controllers or homeland security \? the ryan budget does , in fact , duck the tough issues ryan claims to be proposing major steps toward a balanced budget and longterm debt reduction , but he doesn t really tell voters how he is going to get there interestingly , the budget proposed by president obama does specify where cuts would be made , including those called for in the budget control act , the measure approved by congress and signed into law on august 2 , 2011 , as part of the deal to raise the debt ceiling and to avoid default on government debt a statement in the obama administration budget claims credit for making explicit the difficult trade offs to reach spending reduction goals in the budget control act , both parties in congress and the president agreed to tight spending caps that reduce discretionary spending by 1 trillion over 10 years this budget reflects that decision thus , for all the priority areas we are investing in , difficult tradeoffs had to be made to meet these very tight caps discretionary spending is reduced from 87 percent of gdp in 2011 to 50 percent in 2022 perhaps the most striking aspect of the omissions in the ryan budget is the failure of obama and other democrats to capitalize on it leading democrats i spoke to , who refused to be identified because they did not want to be quoted faulting their own party , cited two factors limiting their ability to mount a counterattack first , the complexity of the issue makes it difficult for reporters to understand and write about the subject after wading my way through all of this , i know what they mean second , the ryan tactic of obscuring the cuts successfully plays to a fundamental ambivalence that amounts to an internal contradiction in public opinion strong support for spending cuts in the abstract , but opposition to many specific cuts in programs that have popular support in a speech on april 3 at the associated press luncheon in washington , obama tried to make the case against ryan well before he was picked to run for vice president applying the 897 billion in cuts under function 920 allowances to domestic spending programs , obama projected a future scenario the year after next , nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than 1 , 000 each there would be 1 , 600 fewer medical grants , research grants for things like alzheimer s and cancer and aids there would be 4 , 000 fewer scientific research grants , eliminating support for 48 , 000 researchers , students , and teachers investments in clean energy technologies that are helping us reduce our dependence on foreign oil would be cut by nearly a fifth if this budget becomes law and the cuts were applied evenly , starting in 2014 , over 200 , 000 children would lose their chance to get an early education in the head start program two million mothers and young children would be cut from a program that gives them access to healthy food there would be 4 , 500 fewer federal grants at the department of justice and the fbi to combat violent crime , financial crime , and help secure our borders hundreds of national parks would be forced to close for part or all of the year we wouldn t have the capacity to enforce the laws that protect the air we breathe , the water we drink , or the food that we eat cuts to the faa would likely result in more flight cancellations , delays , and the complete elimination of air traffic control services in parts of the country over time , our weather forecasts would become less accurate because we wouldn t be able to afford to launch new satellites and that means governors and mayors would have to wait longer to order evacuations in the event of a hurricane ryan , in the meantime , remains consistent two days after his speech in westlake , on sept 6 , he reiterated his claims at a rally in colorado springs so here is our commitment we are not going to duck the tough issues and kick the can down the road we are going to lead and fix this mess in washington and we are not going to spend the next four years blaming people from the last four years we re going to take responsibility and get the job done , reach across the aisle and fix this problem , get people back to work , create jobs , growth in an interview , christopher van hollen jr of maryland , the ranking democrat on the house budget committee , told me that the ryan budget is a shell game designed to hide the damage to the country van hollen is frustrated that the damage to which he alludes has not become a campaign issue the magnitude of this budget gimmick takes your breath away thomas b edsall , a professor of journalism at columbia university , is the author of the book the age of austerity how scarcity will remake american politics , which was published earlier this year
from 2007 to 2009 , i traveled around the world searching for pickup soccer games with three other people to make a documentary centered on the game s ability to create bonds among strangers we embarrassed ourselves in a dozen languages , had a runin with a baboon in kenya , ambushed david beckham at a stoplight in los angeles , and played anywhere from the bolivian jungle to the egyptian desert we ve seen many people tap guts , rub knees and groan theatrically in most games , we heard some version of the joke , a few years ago , i would ve had that ball we drank all variety of postgame drinks saki with salarymen in tokyo , tea with firemen in iran , beer with 70yearolds in brazil and lukewarm fanta with convicts in bolivia the experience was , in all likelihood , the coolest thing we will ever do often after a screening of our film , pelada , someone will bemoan the lack of pickup games in the us there s plenty of evidence to support this when we moved to dana point , calif , i spent two weeks showing up to empty fields it was harder to find a game in the town i live than anywhere we went in the world and when we lived in koreatown , los angeles , the closest fields were locked and the closest park displayed the sign that is at left in other countries , fields aren t usually empty at sunset and there aren t signs in parks forbidding the world s most popular game maybe we do have a culture problem we aren t , however , the only country to fret about the state of pickup in nearly every place we went \( brazil included \) , people told us it was a dying art , practices and regiment replacing aimless , exploratory afternoons in the alley sometimes i do aggressively stick up for the united states pickup soccer scene in san diego seattle chicago madison , wis portland , ore kansas city , mo austin , tex minneapolis and new york , as well as so many other places , anyone within the soccer community can tell you how to find a game in olathe , kans , there s a pickup game every night of the week , including one run by 10yearold girls in pensacola , fla , where i grew up , every summer night we met in the outfield of the largest baseball field and played until the lights went dark at 11 pm in asheville , nc , a guy known to everyone as cheetah hosts bonfires and barefoot pickup games at his creekside compound after a screening of pelada in vail , colo , more than 100 people walked to the field , playing until late , youngsters unwilling to go home in south bend , ind , the professors have played a lunchtime pickup game for the past 30 years and in many us cities , we ve got that meltingpot lan in the game i played in last summer in chapel hill , nc , a dozenplus countries were represented on the turf field in front of fetzer stadium on any given night they called the japanese guy japan , the jamaican guy jamaica , the uruguayan guy uruguay \( and sometimes forl n \) , the cameroonian guy cameroon \( and sometimes eto o \) , and the saudi arabian guy arabia \( and sometimes allah \) he responded by calling everyone mexico in an email yesterday , one soccer fan said , us soccer has grown since the 1994 world cup and the advent of mls , but it does not yet enjoy a comparable spot in the folklore of american sandlot sports while it s true that we re light on the folklore few pickup games played in the united states in the 1930s or 40s i d be willing to bet that there are now more pickup soccer games than there are football and baseball games combined maybe us soccer is entering a golden era , in the midst of creating the folklore the traditions and beliefs that will continue to be passed down over the past few years , we ve received hundreds of emails at our pelada web site describing local pickup games emails written in the tone you reserve only for the sacred sure , our pickup is a little underground , a little secret but isn t that part of the magic of a sandlot sport \? in dana point , i did eventually find a pickup game , a tuesdayfriday routine mainly composed of iranians , farsi the dominant field language on friday , in celebration of a player whose cancer just went into remission , guys ate persian baklava along the sideline last tuesday night , a 50ish guy who is the semiofficial organizer of the biweekly pickup game , called us into the center of the field , announcing everyone watched the spain game we can do it just like them we laughed while there s a certain amount of delusion that s possible in any park game , none of us are deluded enough to think we can play like spain there is a little spectatorosmosis , however , the brilliance of the greats seeping into you for a while , after you witness something like pirlo s penalty kick , ibrahimovic s volley , or any spain game , your play is stronger , tributelike , everyone more keenly aware of football s aesthetic value and there s the occasional moment where your team does resemble spain imaginative and unselfish , and sort of psychic and allknowing , reading the space and each other , conjuring some alternate universe made of onetime passes and small balls just as the big games influence the small ones , there s a lot of interesting talk about how the small games influence the big ones maybe , the thinking goes , our united states national team lacks some of the pickupbred ability to improvise , to invent the brazilian onename heroes pel and neymar and robinho and ronaldinho didn t learn their jinga in a training session on the other hand , the training session may be exactly where the spaniards distinctive style came from tikitaka was a gradual conversion orchestrated by a club manager , not the street but even if spain s game didn t grow out of pickup , that doesn t mean the pickup field isn t the perfect place to recreate it , to try our hand , to see what it feels like to create a constellation of passes at chapparosa park , our game is multigenerational senior citizens in the back line , 20yearolds in the midfield , 6yearolds playing along the sideline what the 60yearolds may have lost in first step and speed , they make up for in years of accumulated nuance the young respect the old , for their vision and their touch two things that don t go away , that , in fact , get better like the games we played in trinidad , brazil and hungary , one generation passes down the game to the next regardless of whether or not pickup is good for the national team , it s good for us it s good to have a field to go to , a time you re supposed to show up it s good to have someone waiting for you , counting on you to play the ball well the argentine word for pickup is picado , which literally means picked off one argentine described it to me as your small piece of the game , and that may be something many americans have found gwendolyn oxenham is the author of you can reach her on

for a city that supposedly never sleeps , mumbai s buzzing nightlife has come to a screeching halt the reason \? recent police activity aimed at restaurants , bars and clubs wellpublicized examples of police action include a rave bust in the juhu suburb , raids on restaurants like cafe zoe in parel , shiro in worli , masala curry in andheri , on pubs like madness in khar , royalty , rehab and hawaiian shack in bandra , and on clubs like trilogy in santa cruz invoking laws and rules drafted decades ago , most unfamiliar to both proprietors and the public , the city police , led by additional commissioner vasant dhoble , have been accused of terrorizing residents , some going so far as to dub it the talibanization of mumbai citizens have turned to social media , traditional media and organized rallies to protest the facebook group sos mumbai s nightlife has more than 7 , 800 members , and an online petition lobbying for a judicial inquiry into the police raids , by the community organizers avaaz , is doing the internet rounds ordinary citizens appear to be flabbergasted at being on the wrong side of the law a 22yearold male model who attended a now infamous hotel party in juhu , a north mumbai suburb , and wished not to be identified because of the subsequent legal case , recalled , there was no rave , it was a normal party about 20 uniformed police officers arrived , shut off the music and announced that they had information that there were drugs at the party the model said that after an hour , when the police had not found evidence of drugs , one officer announced that he had found 100 grams , or almost a quarter of a pound , of cocaine on a sofa because of this , the police said they had to escort everyone to a local hospital to obtain blood samples party goers waited an hour before leaving for the hospital , the model said he believes this is because the police were calling the press when we finally left , the press was waiting outside , taking our photos , he said the press was also waiting outside cooper hospital , where the men were taken , he said cooper hospital didn t even have needles to take our blood samples , he said when they finally did , they punctured my vein so badly i had a blood clot for two weeks after the hospital , the partygoers went to the police precinct to record their statements in marathi , and they weren t released until morning you can t treat people like this are we living in the 21st century \? , he asked the mumbai police recently released the blood test results , which they say indicate that 44 people tested positive out of the 96 detained the model said that he believes the results to be doctored i did not have drugs at that party , he said private homes are also being targeted alison wodham , who produces and directs fashion shows , said her 22yearold son , ronit kanuga , was home alone when the police turned up at their door mr kanuga said 10 of his friends had come home after a night out , but had left soon after , and that no music had been played soon after they left , two police officers rang the doorbell , saying they had received a complaint mr kanuga denied the existence of a party , but the police apparently insisted on charging him since they had received a complaint when another four police officers then turned up , they attempted to enter the home to search it according to mr kanuga , one of the police officers at his doorstep told him , after this juhu rave , you have to be careful you can t have girls over after 12 o clock mr kanuga said that when he refused to let the police enter , they asked him to come to the local precinct when he refused , the police asked him to pay half of the normal fine for such complaints , about 6 , 000 rupees , or around 108 they finally agreed to 3 , 000 rupees and left , he said when his mother , ms wodham , heard about it the next morning \( she had been asleep \) , she complained at the local precinct , even though she said the police had tried to dissuade her she enlisted the local news media to write about her case , and the police have suspended one of the officers mr kanuga said that after the incident he and his friends , regular clubgoers , have stopped going out while many are complaining about the drive , it also has plenty of supporters among citizens and officials the mumbai high court issued an order supporting it , and the state administration said it will allow the police to continue clamping down on illegalities twitter supporters are also out in full force jayanta bhattacharya , on twitter as goldenarcher , wrote go acp dhoble , go ! crack down hard on the budding crims and their backers at least , i m with ya the problem seems to be the law itself some vexing rules include requiring a permit room \( for drinking \) to be separate from dining , limiting numbers to 166 people per 1 , 000 square feet , or about 90 square meters , and requiring the providing of parking in a city that has virtually none licenses required to operate a nightclub restaurant bar are also convoluted a dj license allows you to have a dj but no dancing , while a disco license limits you to just 10 couples on a dance floor an orchestra license lets you have a live act but no dancing many proprietors believe that things will not change until rules evolve to reflect more pragmatism individual drinkers must possess a valid drinking permit most people appear to have been unaware of this rule because of the crackdown , several bars and nightclubs have begun issuing onetime permits for guests upon entry fazal sheikh , the manager of a bar located in bandra , said , it is the law that everyone needs to carry a liquor license on them , so if our guests are not carrying one with them then we supply them with a onetime license clubs like the bombay gymkhana also help their members navigate the red tape rahul vora , the cashier at the bombay gymkhana , said that they provide information regarding liquor permits and applications for individual permits it is compulsory to have the permit , so we try and make it easier for our guests by getting them all the information in the meantime , mumbai nightlife is suffering according to raman macker , a director at dish hospitality , which owns popular nightspots like aurus in juhu , and sancho s restaurant in bandra , the environment has become so scary that people are just refusing to go anywhere his business at aurus is down by 50 percent , he estimated rahul akerkar , who owns indigo and tote , agreed , citing a 30percent drop in the bar business at tote as mr macker said , the laws have to evolve in the licensing of restaurants , right now there is too much gray neha thirani contributed reporting from mumbai
iran has returned to the front pages after a summer hiatus negotiations aimed at preventing the dreaded persian bomb have resumed their desultory course iran , although suffering from the international sanctions choreographed by the obama administration , keeps adding new arrays of centrifuges while insisting the program is strictly nonmilitary israel is or maybe is n't edging closer to a unilateral strike the us , we learn from the times s reliable david sanger , is considering more and bigger bouts of cybersabotage meanwhile , the mullahs are shipping arms to their embattled fellow despots in syria this strikes me as a good time to address an unnerving question that confronts any concerned student of this subject can we live with a nuclear iran \? given a choice of raining bunkerbusting munitions on iran s underground enrichment facilities , or , alternatively , containing a nucleararmed iran with the sobering threat of annihilation , which is the less bad option \? as the slogan goes in israel bomb \? or the bomb \? the prevailing view now is that a nuclear iran cannot be safely contained on this point both and agree they can hardly say otherwise to even hint that a nuclear iran is acceptable would undermine the efforts aimed at preventing that outcome but i tend to think they mean it however , there are , to contemplate a nuclear iran , kept in check by the timetested assurance of retaliatory destruction if the us arsenal deterred the soviet union for decades of cold war and now keeps north korea s nukes in their silos , if india and pakistan have kept each other in a nuclear stalemate , why would iran not be similarly deterred by the certainty that using nuclear weapons would bring a hellish reprisal \? anyone who has a glib answer to this problem is n't taking the subject seriously personally , i 've tended to duck it , taking refuge in the hope that the tightening vise of international pressure and a few cyberattacks would make iran relent and spare us the hard choice but that could be wishful thinking so i 've spent some time reading and questioning , trying to report my way to an opinion let s assume , for starters , that iran s theocrats are determined to acquire nuclear weapons western analysts say there is no evidence yet that the supreme leader has made that decision but if you ruled a country surrounded by unfriendly neighbors persians among the arabs , shiites among the sunnis a country with a grand sense of selfesteem , a tendency to paranoia and five nuclear powers nearby , would n't you want the security of your own nuclear arsenal \? let s assume further that diplomacy , sanctions and computer viruses may not dissuade the regime from its nuclear ambitions so far , these measures seem to have slowed the nuclear program and bought some time , but iran s stockpiles of enriched fuel have grown in size and concentration despite everything a disapproving world has thrown at them so far so , then what \? a preemptive bombing campaign against iran s uranium factories would almost certainly require major us participation to be effective , and would not be neat beyond the immediate casualties , it would carry grave costs outraged iranians rallying behind this regime that is now deservedly unpopular iran or its surrogates lashing out against american and israeli targets in a longterm , lowintensity campaign of retaliation a scorching hatred of america on the newly empowered arab street , generating new recruits for al qaeda and its ilk an untimely oil shock to a fragile world economy an unraveling of the united front obama has assembled to isolate iran all that , and a redoubled determination by iran s leaders to do the one thing that would prevent a future attack rebuild the nuclear assembly line , only this time faster and deeper underground there is a pretty broad consensus that , short of a fullscale invasion and occupation of iran , a preventive attack would not end the nuclear program , only postpone it for a few years now imagine that iran succeeds in making its way into the nuclear club despite the incendiary rhetoric , it is hard to believe the aim of an iranian nuclear program is the extermination of israel the regime in iran is brutal , mendacious and meddlesome , and given to spraying gobbets of hitleresque bile at the jewish state but israel is a nuclear power , backed by a bigger nuclear power before an iranian mushroom cloud had bloomed to its full height over tel aviv , a flock of reciprocal nukes would be on the way to incinerate iran iran may encourage fanatic chumps to carry out suicide missions , but there is not the slightest reason to believe the mullahs themselves are suicidal the more common arguments against tolerating a nuclear iran are these first , that possession of a nuclear shield would embolden iran to step up its interference in the region , either directly or through surrogates like hezbollah this is probably true but as james dobbins , a former diplomat who heads security studies for the rand corporation , told me , the subversive menace of a nuclear iran has to be weighed against the lethal rage of an iran that had been the victim of an unprovoked attack a second worry is that a persian bomb would set off a regional nuclear arms race this is probably an exaggerated fear a nuclear program is not cheap or easy in other parts of the world , the proliferation virus has not been as contagious as you might have feared so the saudis , who regard iran as a viper state , might be tempted buy a bomb from pakistan , which is not a pleasant thought but egypt \( broke \) , turkey \( a nato member \) and the others have strong reasons not to join the race most worrisome , i think , is the danger that a crisis between israel and iran would escalate out of control given the history of mistrust and the absence of communication , some war planner on one side or the other might guess that a nuclear attack was imminent , and decide to go first you would have a very unstable deterrent environment between israel and iran , simply because these are two states that tend to view each other in existential terms , said ray takeyh , an iranianamerican middle east scholar at the council on foreign relations , who is not an advocate of containment against this fear , history suggests that nuclear weapons make even aggressive countries more cautious before their first nuclear tests , india and pakistan fought three serious conventional wars since getting their nukes they have bristled at each other across a long , heavily armed border , but no dispute has risen to an outright war at the end of this theoretical exercise , we have two awful choices with unpredictable consequences after immersing myself in the expert thinking on both sides , i think that , forced to choose , i would swallow hard and take the risks of a nuclear iran over the gamble of a preemptive war my view may be colored by a bit of postiraq syndrome what statesmen do when faced with bad options is create new ones the third choice in this case is to negotiate a deal that lets iran enrich uranium for civilian use \( as it is entitled to do under the nuclear nonproliferation treaty \) , that applies rigorous safeguards \( because iran cheats \) , that gradually relaxes sanctions and brings this wayward country into the community of moreorless civilized nations that , of course , wo n't happen before november any us concession now would be decried by republicans as an abandonment of israel and a reward to a government that recently beat a democracy movement bloody we can only hope that after the election we get some braver , more creative diplomacy , either from a liberated obama or \( hope springs eternal \) a president romney who has a nixontochina moment because a frank look at the alternatives of \( a \) preemptive war and \( b \) a nuclear iran should be enough to focus all of our intelligence and energy on \( c \) none of the above
atlanta while reporting sunday s feature on chipper jones , his final season and his legacy in atlanta , i thought of something that hadn t occurred to me before of all the players picked no 1 over all , jones worked out the best that is not to say jones is the best player ever chosen first roger jongewaard , the former seattle scouting guru , snagged the two best , taking ken griffey jr in 1987 and alex rodriguez in 1993 both players rose to superstardom in seattle , but neither won a championship for the mariners and both left town while still elite players remarkably , since the inception of the draft in 1965 , jones is one of only four top picks to win a world series with his original club the others are the mets darryl strawberry , the angels darin erstad and the phillies pat burrell none of those players are going to the hall of fame , while jones is likely to be enshrined as soon as he is eligible , in 2018 we ll miss the guy , because he has been the face of this franchise , said the braves president , john schuerholz fans will miss him terribly he s been everything you could hope to get out of a player who is the guy for your team to give you he s given it to us and he s given it to the fans jones actually predates schuerholz in the braves organization by a few months bobby cox was the general manager who authorized the braves to take jones first in 1990 , a year before he took over as manager , with schuerholz as the gm pitcher todd van poppel was the other prominent amateur that year , but schuerholz said cox had told him that jones , then a jacksonville high schooler , was his choice all along jones , 40 , will leave behind a legacy of greatly increased popularity of youth baseball in georgia he is not alone in this the braves played in their first two atlanta world series before his major league debut but jones has been part of the organization since the braves were the worst team in the majors , in 1990 you grow up here , and this is a baseball town , said brian mccann , a local product and sixtime allstar catcher you look up there and you see all those banners , i was growing up during all that i m 10 , 11 , 12 years old , this team was doing what they re doing , and chipper was the man i think he had a big part in baseball around here being so popular jones will also be remembered in the small handful of greatest switchhitters of alltime , with mickey mantle , pete rose , eddie murray and others incredibly , his career average is almost identical from either side of the plate 305 righthanded , 304 lefthanded to be honest with you , if he asks me a question , i ll answer it , but short of that , i m not telling chipper jones anything , said the braves hitting coach , greg walker if he wanted to , he could turn around and be a hitting coach today he knows that much about hitting , and he s got a unique ability to have a feel for what guys are trying to do to him jones has no plans to take walker s job anytime soon he has four boys and plans to spend more time with them in retirement before then , of course , he will try to help the braves reach the postseason , and , if they do , reach the world series for the first time since 1999 it s a wonderful story , and this is the perfectly written script , schuerholz said we didn t write it , he more or less decided upon it we provided the backdrop
huntingdon , tenn patrick steele stood alone near the door to the locker room it was a friday night doubleheader , the girls before the boys , and the gym at big sandy was as full as any carroll academy had seen for weeks , there had been whispers of worry about the game at big sandy while blacks make up about 10 percent of the population in carroll academy s fivecounty area , none of big sandy s 574 residents were black , according to the latest census redneck city , one of the girls had said as the van turned on the winding road toward big sandy this place is racist , one of the boys on the basketball team said as the carroll academy contingent slipped into the brightly lighted gym through a side door adults had echoed the perception , but none of the whispers came from steele , carroll academy s omnipresent security director , a man of straight faces and penetrating eyes , the son of a black mother and a mixedrace father always alert to the movements of the players , particularly at road games , he was in his element he scanned the faces in the crowd he searched for hints of trouble but to him , it was not an issue of race it was an issue of keeping the students safe and right now , the girls were behind a closed door , gathered in a circle with their arms locked at the elbows , receiving lastminute instructions from their coach and bowing their heads in prayer they were safe so steele , 53 , stood near the baseline , outside the locker room minutes before the game , and looked pleased to be there he let slip a sliver of a smile those girls in the locker room \? they were not just basketball players to steele , they were something of himself the first time steele saw alleyah , she was a toddler , all energy and optimism , waving from a front yard he could never forget that face steele s daily van route to pick up carroll academy students has long taken him to the town of mckenzie for a time , about a decade ago , he dropped off a boy and a girl at a small brick home there last year , steele had a new girl to pick up he pulled up in front of that little house , and when the door opened , everything rushed back the way that little girl melted his heart the way her smile stretched like taffy the way it grew whenever he brought her a gift a toy , a doll , anything for someone who had nothing and here she was again , a tiny wisp at 14 , her wide smile covered in braces , her sweet side cloaked in sassiness and street smarts alleyah every year , around 150 students go through carroll academy , a school for troubled teenagers operated by carroll county juvenile court the school does what it can picks them up , feeds them , educates them , disciplines them , drops them back home the idea is to give their worlds some semblance of order and direction , and move them back to their home school , wiser and stronger you cannot save them all a few will bounce in and out of carroll academy a few will find their way to college some will move from juvenile courts to adult ones , then to prison most , it seems , will go back to living on society s fringes , maybe get a ged or a diploma , then live a life much like the one their parents lead history repeats of the nine girls on this season s basketball team , alleyah is the one who worries school officials most so young so eager to show the older girls her streethardened edges fighting smoking so deceptively disruptive , like a on a still night yet she remembers steele mr patrick to the students and everyone else from years ago , too he brought me a barbie , she said with an impossibly wide grin alleyah , an eighth grader , came to carroll academy because of fighting hard to believe from someone well under 5 feet tall and a threedigit weight when she arrived , she was so angry that a boy she liked chose another girl , hannah , over her that she set up a fake facebook page for hannah and peppered it with cruel comments hannah , now a basketball teammate , had no idea why so many people suddenly turned on her she does not have a computer or a cellphone almost daily , alleyah is booted from class for talking or passing notes almost weekly , she is in detention , where students stand alone in a classroom , holding a clipboard and writing , hundreds of times , that they will not disrupt class or exhibit inappropriate behavior in her soft lilt , she tries to explain away the commotion she so casually leaves in her wake and , far more than most , she finds herself participating in steele s physical training , or pt , a dreaded form of punishment for most it is oldfashioned calisthenics , done in the hallway pushups , situps , jumping jacks , deepknee bends and the like under steele s direction , the students count the repetitions , like soldiers at boot camp shirttails come untucked faces bead with sweat heavier students look ready to pass out , and some throw up not alleyah she looks as if she could do a thousand situps , a million jumping jacks and when the students are sent back to class , sheepish and sweaty , steele shakes his head , turns and smiles alleyah students do not often see steele s soft spot some know that he is a carroll county probation officer and that he runs a karate studio in town they whisper that he is a black belt , and even the biggest and oldest boys are intimidated by his reputation day to day , it can seem like steele s school he directs the security staff two other fulltimers , unarmed through a walkietalkie he directs teachers through the intercom , parents over the phone , students in the security office when situations get tense a parent becomes belligerent during a meeting , a student is caught with contraband steele gets calmer , as if his heartbeat slows students trust him in regular school , they say , discipline is doled out without evidence at carroll academy , both sides student versus student , student versus teacher receive a full hearing steele is the judge and jury he delivers verdicts face to face , in a near whisper the quieter the delivery , the greater the gravity what most students do not know is how much he has in common with them steele grew up in jackson , tenn , a city of about 65 , 000 about 45 minutes away he never knew his father his mother was an alcoholic his stepfather beat him , mostly because the boy was too lightskinned for his taste steele shoplifted food he lived in abandoned houses when he speaks to carroll academy students , he sees a bit of a mirror i know what it feels like because i lived it , steele said and he started to cry he apologized and regained his stoic composure i know what it feels like to be at school and not have money for lunch , he said my mother , she was an alcoholic all she had to do was go to school and sign the papers for me to get free lunches , but she was too drunk to do that so i know what it s like when they 're here and they have nothing to go home to and look forward to i know what it feels like to go home with no electricity and no water and no food in the house because that s how i grew up so i totally understand them i understand them in a way that the other staff do n't it s just that there s still a lot of pain in me from growing up that way and when i look at these kids , i can see the pain and the hurt in some of them it just reminds me of me it explains why , like most of the adults at carroll academy , steele finds some students grab his heart and do not let go i understand alleyah , he said soon enough , she was back in the security office , being asked about a raunchy note she traded with another girl steele spoke to her sternly and calmly he sent her back to class and shook his head constance , a quiet eighth grader with a penchant for launching projectiles in anger , drained a 3pointer to give carroll academy a quick lead over big sandy it was fleeting carroll academy lost , 4510 but it felt like a success a few parents made the trip miranda , a selfdeprecating senior from big sandy recovering from alcohol problems , corralled a firsthalf rebound and went to the freethrow line to try for her first points of the season she missed both shots but beamed when she saw her stepfather , brother and sister cheering leslee , a freshman with the charisma of a future homecoming queen , caught at school with prescription painkillers taken from her father s girlfriend , jammed a finger that left her in tears but following the game , after a trip to the snack stand with her teammates , she sat with her father and his girlfriend , her fingers taped together like a splint , smiling and alleyah received substantial playing time , too a bit like a moth , she flitted about on defense , crouched and with her arms up , as she had been taught , long after the nearest opponent had zipped past on offense , the ball sometimes seemed too heavy for her she never came close to scoring a point maybe next season if there is one girl who will return to the team in the fall , it is probably alleyah and steele will be there to pick her up and take her home
cairo an amateur video that surfaced sunday appears to show a crowd removing the motionless body of ambassador j christopher stevens from a window of the american mission in benghazi , libya , after it was attacked last week by islamist militants , adding new details to reports that mr stevens had died of smoke inhalation while locked in a safe room the video emerged as a new disagreement broke out between the recently named president of the libyan parliament and american officials over whether the attack was planned and whether al qaeda had a role labeled the work of fahd albakkosh , centers on what appears to be the same tall , narrow window that witnesses have described as mr stevens s last exit the witnesses said residents drawn to the scene had forced open the window and found mr stevens behind a locked iron gate , pulled him out and taken him to the hospital in the video , none say anything that shows ill will i swear , he s dead , one libyan says , peering in bring him out , man ! bring him out , another says the man is alive move out of the way , others shout just bring him out , man move , move , he is still alive ! alive , alive ! god is great , the crowd erupts , while someone calls to bring mr stevens to a car mr stevens was taken to a hospital , where a doctor tried to revive him , but said he was all but dead on arrival the full identity and motivation of the attackers remains a matter of dispute considerable suspicion has fallen on a local benghazi militia , , known for its intensely conservative and antidemocratic islamist politics witnesses saw the group s insignia on trucks at the scene , and attackers acknowledged they were members fighters and others present at the attack said the motive was anger at a video produced in the united states that denigrates the prophet muhammad on sunday , mohamed yussef magariaf , president of libya s newly elected national congress , said in interviews with american news media that he believed people affiliated with or sympathetic to al qaeda played a role in the assault , although he did not seem to rule out that the attackers might have been ideological allies of al qaeda without specific collaboration the regional qaeda affiliate , al qaeda in the islamic maghreb , is active near libya but has focused primarily on attacking local governments speaking on cbs s face the nation , mr magariaf said that libya has arrested as many as 50 people over the assault at least a few , he said , had come from outside libya , possibly algeria or mali and he also said that he believed the nonlibyans had been involved in planning the attack in the months since they entered the country , and that it was meant to coincide with the anniversary of the sept 11 attacks referring to ugly deeds , criminal deeds , mr magariaf insisted that the attacks do not resemble any way , in any sense , the aspirations , the feelings of libyans towards the united states and its citizens , emphasizing the role of foreigners appearing on the same program , susan rice , the united states ambassador to the united nations , said the attacks began spontaneously in benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in cairo but soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in benghazi , we believe that it looks like extremist elements , individuals , joined in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are , unfortunately , readily now available in libya postrevolution , ms rice said and that it spun from there into something much , much more violent the united states did not believe the attack was preplanned or premeditated , ms rice said , adding that whether the extremists were al qaeda affiliates , whether they were libyanbased extremists or al qaeda itself i think is one of the things we 'll have to determine

earlier , became the rallying cry for a large anticorruption movement that dominated the public debate in the country last year the supreme court also ruled thursday that a lower court would consider

the political implications of it he lashed out at the government and said they shouldn t be in power any longer a new government should be constituted in the country , he said prashant bhushan , petitioner and lawyer , supreme court he appeared satisfied by the supreme court decision during a press conference outside the court he said the public exchequer will now be able to recover losses through the fraudulent sale of 2g licenses he said the cbi will now submit reports to the cvc this judgment sends a strong signal to the entire country and in particular to the corporate world , said mr bhushan pranab mukherjee , federal minister for finance we have to examine the judgment and its implications kapil sibal , federal minister for communications and information technology the direction of the court is also consistent with this government s policy after i took over as minister for communications and information technology i had said if you remember that now we will delink the license from the spectrum , he said at a press conference in new delhi mr sibal added the prime minister was in no way responsible nor was the finance minister in any way responsible for whatever happened and whatever was done by the then minster \( andimuthu raja \) and this has been endorsed by the supreme court , stating that the then minister did not heed to the advice of the prime minster as well as the finance minister the minster also said the supreme court judgment stated that , the first come first served policy introduced by the nda \( national democratic alliance \) government was discriminatory per se this means that there should never have been a first come first served policy uninor we have been unfairly treated as we simply followed the government process we were asked to we are shocked to see that uninor is being penalized for faults the court has found in the government process it is important to note that order does not stop our operations for now we will study the order in detail and exercise all options available to ensure that uninor continues to operate in india we also expect the authorities to ensure that our 36 million customers , 17500 workforce and 22 , 000 partners are not unjustly affected rishi sahai , director , cogence advisors , a consulting firm the decision is lawfully accurate , as the disclosures made by most of these companies when they applied for the licenses were incorrect however the foreign partners came in after with valid licenses issued by the government of india this will have a hugely negative impact on future foreign investment because it sends a signal that a license issued by the government of india has no meaning and could be considered null and void because of a judgement two or three years down the line , mr sahai said also based on the telecom licenses there have been investments made into these companies , or loans given by indian banks with ten operators affected , there could be anywhere between 2530 billion dollars worth of investments made , he added mr sahai said going forward 2g spectrum may be reopened for auction , but it might not bring in the kind of revenue that the government expects there will only be three or four operators with the ability and inclination to buy , and there is enough spectrum available now the scarcity factor has gone daryl philip , senior research analyst , finquest securities pvt ltd for the industry , this decision has been a mood destroyer as far as fdi is concerned however , we have to watch how this turns out eventually the government might ask the companies to pay a penalty instead of cancelling the licenses , so as to benefit the industry and the government perhaps in the four month window provided by the ruling there will be a reauction and the companies will be allowed to pay the difference the second option is that players can continue to offer their services using other peoples spectrum on 2g roaming , since sharing of spectrum has been allowed for companies like bharti who have the 3g option , they can provide 2g spectrum on the 3g license , he said mr philip said the positive vibes coming from this judgement is that the subscribers will switch to larger players , and there will be faster subscriber acquisition in the months ahead for the telecom industry overall , competition will be marginally lower and there will be some consolidation there is a bit of a overreaction in the industry with regards to bank exposure because of this judgement none of these companies have ever defaulted , unlike companies in the power sector , so i don t see that situation arising , he added kamlesh bhatia , research director , gartner it s a step that the supreme court has taken to start setting the house in order in this sector in india there had been a virtual paralysis in terms of policy and decision making which was starting to hurt the industry , so the supreme court is trying to get in more transparency the industry was already impacted in a big way , most operators had reigned in their investments expecting some shakeout but there was no clarity about the future , he said thirteen odd operators in a country like india was not sustainable , so there had to be some consolidation either by the market or by regulatory decisions which is what this decision will bring about , he added ajay sharma , telecom head , assocham i personally feel that this will create a lot of discomfort for investors , ajay sharma said , a senior director at the associated chambers of commerce and industry of india , also known as assocham it looks to be quite a setback to the industry mr sharma estimates that these licenses have 20 billion of exposure to banks he added that the prices that customers pay for calls is likely to increase anil prakash , president , telecom users group of india , a nonprofit on the face of it , justice has been done , he said but he added that he was concerned about how consumers might be affected by the supreme court decision he said that many customers had been lured by the rockbottom prices offered by new service providers , whose licenses now stand cancelled mr prakash said the telephone services of these customers should not abruptly be disconnected and the government should be responsible for migrating them to other service providers but at the same tariffs they currently enjoy although mr prakash welcomes the supreme court decision , he said the investment climate will be adversely affected the whole world is watching this is definitely sending the wrong signal to investors sistema shyam tele services sstl is still awaiting the full text of the judgment , hence it would be a little premature to offer any detailed comments however , the company would like to state that being a law abiding organization , it reserves the right to protect its interests by using all available judicial remedies benoy c s , director of ict practice , frost sullivan , south asia middle east this verdict is good news for established incumbent operators and in short term we are likely to see some increase in tariffs as in the case of 3g licenses , the auction route may jack up the initial capex \( capital expenditure \) investment , which in turn may lead to increased cost for telecom services mr benoy added , from a long term perspective it is going to help telecom industry as a whole it will open up the opportunities for some global telecom companies who missed the race earlier to invest in indian telecom industry we will see entry of some mature mnc service providers which will bring in a healthy competition and better quality of service he also said , the foreign direct investments to india will not be affected by this judgment in a big way moving forward , the foreign investors will take a cautious approach and will do a better legal due diligence it will help big companies as the government policies will be more transparent and fair naveen mishra , cybermedia research , lead telecoms analyst the supreme court decision , could shake investor confidence in india and drive away precious capital and management expertise mr mishra said it may take more than the new telecom policy 2012 to reassure investors it may also call into question , the capacity of india as a nation to develop and implement transparent , forward looking policy and governance frameworks this could mean that investors may shy away from other priority sectors such as roads and highways , energy and power utilities
the giants finished a nothingspecial 97 last season but won their division and earned a home game in their playoff opener on their way to a championship the giants will be favored to finish with the same record this season , but if they do , they will probably miss the playoffs \( in 2008 , the patriots finished 115 and didn t make the playoffs \) the giants haven t played well the last two weeks coach tom coughlin said his team was flatlining but it s also true that they faced two difficult road challenges atlanta and baltimore were terrific and that the seeming arbitrariness of playoff qualification hasn t been as forgiving in the nfc east \( if they finish tied with dallas and washington at 97 , they will fall out because of their 33 division record \) you need a spark \( luck will do \) as well as skill coughlin acknowledged that when he said after sunday s loss to the ravens when it happened for us last year , this particular game , the 15th game , we had a spark , we really had a great spark you want to say it was the victor cruz 99yarder \? whatever it was , it really invigorated our team , and then the way that we played and we prepared ourselves for the next week , and we played very well the next week , and we gained in confidence , and we re not a very confident group right now it s one of those things in any profession that you have to earn the confidence here were coughlin s complete remarks , via giantscom opening comments i thought our week was a good week i thought last night our meetings were well done i think we came in here and we tried hard we worked hard at it we obviously have a very bad formula going on right here we re having trouble stopping people and our offense doesn t hold the ball at all to give our defense a chance to catch their breath we ve had two games in a row , pretty much the exact same scenario , with 47 offensive snaps last week , 41 this week the other guy had double , almost 40 minutes time of possession as i told the players , it s a very difficult time for all of us i take full responsibility for this team i am the head coach what has happened over the course of the last couple of weeks is very difficult to explain we had a resounding win against new orleans and felt real good about ourselves , and then i have no explanation as to why we re in the position that we re in we re playing a lot of people , we re putting a lot of people in positions where they need to make plays and frankly , right now , we re not making any we re not making any plays on defense we didn t make any plays necessarily on special teams , although we did a pretty good job of controlling a very , very good returner jacoby jones , whether via kickoff returner or punt returner so we did a decent job of that but that s all we did nothing offensively we certainly didn t do anything to help our cause on the defensive side of the ball either on whether he thinks the team deserves to make the playoffs if we get into the playoffs , we will deserve to make it that s very remote right now on defensive tackle chris canty s injury i don t know exactly what it is it s a knee and he wasn t able to go back chris canty was playing hard and he made some plays for us on the emotions down the stretch i would stay away from that i feel badly for everyone in that locker room because i m sure that none of them , they can t figure this thing out either we don t look like a welloiled machine offensively at all we ve certainly had our struggles in and out with people , but still that s not an excuse we re just a very long way from being the team that played new orleans on the ravens pass protection it wasn t anything to do with scheme i d like to say it was i think they threw , i think what they did , they came out and went strictly uptempo i think one series , or half of a series , we were scrambling around , but we adjusted to that tempo i think they tried to do the same thing on the defensive side of the ball and made it that we couldn t just go up and snap it , we had to recognize different people and identify them for pass protection that kind of slowed us down a little bit but other than that , they did pressure us as they were playing and they did a good job of it on this year compared with other years coughlin coached it s difficult , very difficult , very , very difficult there are a lot of proud guys in that locker room that are looking to me for answers the answers are not easy ones on the defense i wouldn t say it s just defense i would have to say the offense is very far from where we d hope to be on not having a lateseason surge we weren t able to get it done we don t have momentum going we came into this circumstance and we knew it very well , but we re not playing anywhere near that type of football , and when it happened for us last year , this particular game , the 15th game , we had a spark , we really had a great spark you want to say it was the victor cruz 99yarder \? whatever it was , it really invigorated our team , and then the way that we played and we prepared ourselves for the next week , and we played very well the next week , and we gained in confidence , and we re not a very confident group right now it s one of those things in any profession that you have to earn the confidence you just don t talk about it sometimes i get tired of talking , talking , talking you do have to go on the field , by yourself , 11 of you out there , because everyone else is over here , and accomplish that we re certainly not doing that otherwise , i wouldn t even offer an explanation on whether he is satisfied with the effort we spent a lot of time working on that type of the preparation , to get the great effort , to be in the right place mentally , no matter what happened there were some disappointing things happening in the game , we were going to fight our way through it , and i can tell you i wasn t disappointed in that part i really wasn t we talk a lot about playing above the x s and o s , but we re flatlining right now we re not playing anywhere near any kind of execution we want , so it s very difficult to stay above the x s and the o s we got the thirddown play that victor cruz made the catch there to give us the first down and allow us to push the ball in with this last touchdown was that a play that created a spark \? probably not on his disappointment about this season compared with last season i wouldn t even attempt to explain it emotionally , i probably don t have the wherewithal to do that you fight your whole year , literally from the time one tournament ends to the next all your sights are on getting in this thing you can t make a mark for your team unless you get in it we fought so long , and fought so hard , we had our ups and downs we were sitting where we could determine our own fate and we let that get away from us it s very disappointing on whether it is going to be a tough week i don t think so i think there s a lot of pride in that room we ll certainly have some guys nicked up that maybe the decision will be made that they wouldn t be able to go i don t know about that yet but we ve had a lot of guys with lingering stuff that hopefully is not beyond being able to line up , but i think there s great pride in that locker room , and we certainly all know that 97 is better than 88 on the playoff scenario i m not concerned about it really i want to see us play well that s always been my thing if we play well , give great effort and play well , everything else takes care of itself that s not the case right now we re not playing very well on cornerback corey webster he would probably be the first one to tell you that he wishes he was better on confidence after the wins against the packers and the saints i don t know that s a very good question i would have thought , to be honest with you and the only thing i go back to is the new orleans game but to go and score 52 points , and then turn around and get shut out , and then to score 14 , it s difficult to explain you would think that when you score those kind of points that would build great confidence , and the other guy has something to do about it , too
mitt romney continues to surge in the fivethirtyeight forecast , and friday may have featured his best set of polls all year the best way to track a change in the polls is to look for instances in which the same firm has surveyed the same state \( or the national race \) multiple times the fivethirtyeight forecast model relies on a procedure very much like this to calculate the overall trend in the race fifteen polls were released on friday that provided a comparison with another survey conducted between the democratic convention and last week s debate in denver mr romney gained an average of 46 percentage points in these surveys that is actually a bit larger than we were showing earlier in the week , when the same exercise put mr romney s postdebate bounce more in the range of three or four percentage points it is not clear whether mr romney is still gaining ground or whether he benefited from a couple of outlying results the median change in the polls , which will be less sensitive to potential outliers , was a threepoint gain for mr romney , more like earlier in the week but unlike earlier , mr romney is now seeing some of his best results in swing state polls six of the seven polls published on friday from such states had him ahead thus , just as the hypothesis of a fading romney bounce was damaged on friday , so was the idea \( which we critiqued in an earlier post \) that his gains would be more modest in the swing states it might be noted that some of the state polls released on friday were from firms that have had republicanleaning results , and they might slightly exaggerate his standing it is unlikely , for instance , that mr romney would win new hampshire by four percentage points right now , as implied by an american research group poll of the state but even polls that are republican or democraticleaning can still be useful in detecting the race s trend , and it is one that clearly favors mr romney because our forecasts are made on a probabilistic spectrum , we do not place a major emphasis on the idea of calling states , but mr romney s probability of winning florida crossed the 50 percent threshold earlier this week he got two more strong polls there on friday , bringing his chances to nearly two in three mr romney became the slight favorite in colorado in the forecast on thursday , and the slight favorite in virginia with friday s update the forecast model is being very aggressive about pricing in mr romney s gains in our nowcast , he s added a net of 48 percentage points since the debate he will need to have more strong polling days like friday to maintain his current standing in the model but the fivethirtyeight forecast of mr romney s chances 389 percent is nearly identical to the one at the betting market intrade , which put them at 385 percent as of early friday evening other prediction markets and bookmakers give mr romney slightly lower chances , in the range of 30 or 35 percent were there any bright spots at all for president obama in friday s data \? he did gain ground in two national tracking polls , from ipsos and investor s business daily , although he lost ground in two others , from gallup and rasmussen reports the ipsos poll is interesting in that it was the only one to include a substantive number of interviews after the vicepresidential debate on thursday night \( ipsos conducts some of its online sampling late in the evening and early the next morning \) that poll showed mr romney s national lead narrowing to one point from three still , the clear majority of its interviews preceded the vicepresidential debate it will take a couple of days to determine whether it had any impact on the polls the only really good news for democrats is that mr obama had built up a large enough cushion that he could withstand a lot of damage without becoming the underdog the forecast model still has him clinging to narrow leads in ohio , iowa , wisconsin and nevada , states that in some combination would give him 270 electoral votes mr obama may also be just slightly underperforming the fundamentals in the election his approval ratings remain near 50 percent , which would ordinarily predict a narrow reelection victory some of the more visible economic numbers , like monthly and weekly jobs reports and consumer confidence figures , have also been stronger lately none of this is to say that a rebound is certain it is late enough in the race that the polls need to be taken more at face value the forecast model adjusts mr obama s numbers up slightly based on its economic index and his incumbency status , but only by about 04 percentage points it may also be that he will need to earn those lost points back rather than expecting them to return automatically with , for example , a stronger performance in the last two presidential debates in the same way that mr romney had a wind at his back before the denver debate , in that the four or fivepoint lead that mr obama held at that point was higher than might be expected based on economic conditions , mr obama might have more to gain than to lose in the final two events yet some of the plausible arguments that democrats were making earlier in the week about mr obama s standing like that his position would be more robust in the swing states are looking weaker now although we prefer to describe the race in quantitative rather than qualitative terms , the nomenclature that we use in our senate forecasts is to describe a race as a tossup if each candidate has at least a 40 percent chance of winning mr romney is on the verge of that threshold
the first critical move of ' transformational summer came in the waning days of winter it came in a curious trade , made at the nba deadline , for a player who had little chance of affecting the present but who would conceivably brighten their future eight months later , gerald wallace is still the most intriguing element in the nets' chemical composition , a free radical with the power to shape their stillevolving identity wallace is the nets' hustle , their strength , their grit and their versatility he can guard three positions and anchor a small lineup when the time comes , he will check lebron james , carmelo anthony and paul pierce he is the best hope the nets have of becoming a respectable defensive team if deron williams is the nets' most indispensable player , wallace is a close second coach avery johnson said as much monday morning , calling wallace 1b to williams' 1a hours later , the point was made vividly when the nets without the injured wallace blew a 22point lead in a painful loss to the minnesota timberwolves the defeat was inexcusable , with or without wallace , given the sad state of the timberwolves but it was noteworthy that the nets' own postmortem was filled with allusions to energy and the lack thereof wherever he has played in sacramento , charlotte or portland wallace has been a boundless source of vitality when the nets' stars wore down at key points of the second half monday , they had nowhere to turn no excuses about gerald wallace being here , johnson said afterward , before adding , but those are situations why we feel so strong about wallace it is frightfully early to draw any conclusions after a week of nba games , and tougher still to assess the nets , who have played just two games with an overhauled roster but their first road game , wednesday night in miami , presents a fascinating gauge , especially if wallace , who has a sprained ankle , is able to play no one expects the nets to challenge the heat for the eastern conference crown , but they were built with the heat in mind indeed , the nets' lineup looks specifically designed to make miami work the nets are strongest at point guard \( williams \) and center \( brook lopez \) , the two positions where the heat have been weakest in joe johnson , the nets have a strong , skilled shooting guard who will challenge dwyane wade at both ends of the court and in wallace , the nets have a muscular , agile forward who can wrestle with james none of this is a coincidence my thought was looking at miami , because they were the team , said billy king , the nets' general manager , who added , i had to build a team that i thought could compete the strategy was to win the battle at a given position , if possible , or to at least neutralize the battle , in king s words , at the spots where miami had a clear advantage \( ie james \) wallace gives the nets a shred of hope , not only against the heat , but against the knicks \( anthony \) , the boston celtics \( pierce \) and the indiana pacers \( danny granger \) you 're not going to stop those guys , king said you just got to try to take things away from them and force them to do things they 're not comfortable doing the nets' future depended on resigning williams in july but king had to build a case for williams to stay , and that portfolio began with wallace in 11 seasons , the 30yearold wallace had quietly established himself as a supreme defender with a nose for the ball and a body built for contact folks call him crash for a reason that this reputation was built mostly on a series of bad teams in charlotte , a forgotten nba outpost , masked wallace s value to many fans , even as he endeared himself to coaches and scouts there were seasons when wallace averaged 18 to 19 points , 7 to 10 rebounds and 15 steals a game , and a handful when he averaged at least a block yet the statistics were never sufficient when wallace finally made the allstar team in 2010 , bobcats coach larry brown dispensed with basketball terminology god gave him great motivation , brown told sports illustrated then every drill we run , every possession we have , every practice we have it s always the same these were the intangibles the nets were pursuing when king , who was mentored by brown , made the deal to acquire wallace from portland it was a controversial transaction , costing the nets a lottery pick that the trail blazers used to select damian lillard , a gifted point guard king s rationale was that he already had a star point guard but he had a gaping hole at small forward , a position of strength in the top tier of the eastern conference and though wallace would be a free agent , the nets had no guarantee they could sign him outright in july it s easier when they 've been there , king said of resigning a player you get to know them , and they get to know you the value placed on smart , defensiveminded swingmen also came from brown , who had a habit of acquiring them derrick mckey in indiana , george lynch in philadelphia the 76ers , with brown and king at the helm , wanted to draft wallace in 2001 the kings snared him with the 25th pick one spot ahead of the 76ers eleven years later , king has his man now all he needs is a cloning machine
washington is not a hugger , crier or someone who gets all gaga every time he walks into his west wing office , just a few feet from that of the president he disdains doomsayers as bedwetters , press hordes as jackals and the political noise machine as a profanity that begins with cluster fiercely datadriven , mr plouffe revels in the company of spreadsheets , lists , maps and the baseball almanac fiercely competitive , he once decked a colleague in a friendly touch football game for taunting him fiercely unsentimental , he expends zero amazement over his career climb from selling knives door to door to a firstamongequals status in the white house s closed circle mr plouffe , 44 , who managed s campaign in the relatively dewyeyed days of 2008 , rejoined his team last year after a lucrative hiatus since then , he has asserted himself as the main orchestrator of the white house message , political strategy and daytoday presentation of the candidate if the campaign of four years ago sold mr obama as a force for what mr plouffe called a politics of unity , hope and common purpose , this one is rooted firmly in the grinditout imperatives of reelection today , mr obama seems every bit primed for brassknuckle time , as mr plouffe once termed campaign brawling , with mr plouffe leading an effort that has shown every sign of doing whatever it takes to succeed this month , with mr plouffe s support , mr obama ditched his long opposition to directing his campaign donors to super pacs outside groups whose bankrolling of negative advertising against his republican rivals has done much to change politics , and not in a unity , hope and common purpose kind of way mr plouffe \( pronounced pluff \) has also pushed for a more combative white house stance toward congressional republicans and an aggressive early tack against former gov mitt romney of massachusetts , whom the obama team still views as its most likely and most formidable opponent in november it was mr plouffe who declared on meet the press last fall that mr romney had no core intense and selfcontained , mr plouffe , who declined to be interviewed for this article , is a temperament alter ego to a president who has always been drawn to loyal fixer types mr obama , whose favorite movie is the godfather , has compared mr plouffe to a character a relentless cop played by mark wahlberg in the more recent mob film the departed mr obama s aides are hesitant about discussing the frequency of mr plouffe s dealings with the reelection effort led by jim messina in chicago , presumably not wanting to suggest he is running the campaign from the white house likewise , they are reluctant to characterize mr plouffe s relationship with the president as special , or suggest that it trumps that of other top lieutenants , particularly jacob j lew , the new chief of staff \( mr plouffe is a stickler for hierarchy \) but people inside mr obama s political apparatus say mr plouffe is most in tune with the president s thinking in terms of his unsparing focus on the middle class and his abandonment of the bipartisan bridgebuilding efforts that have mostly failed through his first term the president probably took david s opinion with more certitude than he did anybody else s , said william m daley , who left as chief of staff last month after a year in the white house if david said x , i think the president would more often believe x than challenge it mr daley added that mr obama would be more likely to heed mr plouffe s advice than his or that of other longtime confidants , the senior advisers valerie jarrett and pete rouse mr plouffe s history with the president ensures him a rarified place in any obama endeavor he became a folk hero within the grassroots network in 2008 , his sleepdeprived face and deadpan delivery evoking urgency \( and twiggy frame crying out for cheeseburgers \) mr plouffe approaches campaigns with a tribal sense of goodvsevil , rarely seeing much humanity in opponents \( he assumed that hillary rodham clinton s crying episode before the new hampshire primary in 2008 was deviously contrived and staged , he wrote in his campaign memoir , the audacity to win \) in keeping with the highminded rhetoric of 2008 , mr plouffe railed against the corrosive political culture in washington , even though he has worked there for years mr obama himself would talk about those who entered politics for the right reasons and those who wanted to make money and mr plouffe , in his memoir , denigrated republicans as a party led by people who foment anger and controversy to make a name for themselves and to make a buck after mr plouffe made a name for himself in the campaign , he made a buck he signed on with the washington lawyer robert barnett , a longtime clinton loyalist whom mr plouffe had privately denigrated during the campaign as a consummate washington insider , according to several campaign aides considered the prime facilitator in washington for those seeking to monetize their political service , mr barnett negotiated a reported sevenfigure book advance for mr plouffe and set him up for speaking gigs mr plouffe earned 15 million in 2010 , according to white house disclosure statements , which included management consulting work for boeing and general electric , and close to 500 , 000 for speeches around the world , including 100 , 000 from mtn nigeria , an african telecommunications firm in early 2009 , mr plouffe agreed to speak in baku , the capital of azerbaijan , for 50 , 000 without realizing that the event s sponsor had ties to the authoritarian government there after complaints from human rights groups , mr plouffe donated his fee to the national democratic institute , a prodemocracy nonprofit organization partly financed by the american government speculation about mr plouffe s status in the white house is precisely the kind of kremlinology that the obama team abhors none more than the no drama archetype himself , mr plouffe , who lives in northwest washington with his wife , olivia morgan , and their young son and daughter he occupies the same role previously filled by david axelrod , his former business partner , who remains a main adviser to the campaign in chicago mr axelrod , who compares his yinyang with mr plouffe to that of oscar and felix in the odd couple , is the expansive slob to mr plouffe s fastidious detail man at a goingaway party for mr axelrod last year that was attended by numerous white house officials \( including the president \) and axelrod pals \( including the jackals \) , mr plouffe looked as if he would rather be cleaning a litter box he slipped out early the skills and sensibilities of the two davids appeal to mr obama for distinct reasons mr axelrod , a former journalist known as axe , is an idealist inspired by robert f kennedy who helped fulfill mr obama s ambition for lofty messages and oratorical sweep strategic and unemotional , mr plouffe comports with mr obama s exacting style and natural reserve \( very , very , very , very , very , very private , mr daley said of mr plouffe and mr obama six verys \) if axe is the person most in tune with the president s voice , said dan pfeiffer , the white house communications director , plouffe is the one most in tune with the president s personality mr plouffe grew up in wilmington , del , the third of five children his father worked on the factory floor at dupont and eventually moved into marketing david joked in his high school yearbook that he planned to join the mob but instead enrolled at the university of delaware he dabbled in beer pong and earned tuition money by selling kitchen knives and sweeping chimneys he studied political science but craved a realworld exposure to campaigns that led him to bolt in his senior year for a career as a political gym rat he worked on dozens of campaigns , including senator tom harkin s presidential run in 1992 and mr obama s senate race in 2004 \( he completed his college credits online in 2010 \) he walked out of his job interview and i said , he s too nice , ' said former senator robert torricelli , a new jersey democrat who hired mr plouffe to run his 1996 senate campaign against representative dick zimmer , a republican i thought he was going to be eaten alive he hired him anyway , and mr plouffe was not eaten alive the torricellizimmer race is recalled as carnivorous unrestricted chemical warfare , as a rutgers political scientist , ross baker , put it it featured charges of racebaiting , mob dealing , terrorist ties and even accusations \( never proved \) that mr zimmer s campaign had rummaged through mr torricelli s trash hope and change , not so much stories of mr plouffe s competitiveness abound like when a former business partner , john del cecato , scored in a touch football game , talked trash at mr plouffe and got thrown to the ground next time he got the ball after a doctor told mr plouffe he could not run a marathon because of a knee injury , mr plouffe did so anyway , and wound up on crutches if mr plouffe has an ideological bent , other than being a democrat , it is not evident i do n't know that he has a passion for the middle class , or the environment , or whatever it is , said steve elmendorf , a democratic lobbyist and close friend he has a passion for winning and a passion for putting together the operation to do so in his memoir , mr plouffe recounts what sounds like an ideal evening for himself alone with his laptop in a hotel room in decorah , iowa , running election scenarios in 2008 what if the turnout of voters under 30 was 17 percent of the electorate \? what if it was 22 percent \? i ran through these exercises frequently , he wrote , sometimes at 4 00 am , according to my wife , while flailing in my sleep often it gave me comfort

, granting refugees full civil rights and hosting radical militant groups like hamas but the brutal crackdown on the opposition by president bashar alassad s government , with more than 10 , 000 killed since the uprising began in march 2011 , has put the palestinians in a difficult spot , forced to choose between the popular mood and their benefactor the top hamas leadership chose to leave , while other groups stayed behind , laying the groundwork for an emerging battle for the palestinians the palestinian situation in syria is very sensitive , said ali baraka , the hamas representative in beirut anything we say might jeopardize the fate of palestinians in syria , so we do n't want to interfere hamas experienced firsthand just how volatile the situation had become when on wednesday the hamas official , kamal ghanaja ,  while some in hamas reflexively blamed the israeli spy agency , mossad , many say the most likely suspect is a homegrown one this time syrian opposition activists say that mr ghanaja was probably killed by the assad government , which has been angry that hamas s leadership pulled out of syria early this year and has spoken out on behalf of the opposition the assad government has been silent on that case , but it was quick to blame armed terrorists , its usual term for the opposition , for the killing of col ahmed salih hassan on tuesday he was shot in his car in sahnaya , about six miles south of damascus , becoming the sixth palestine liberation army officer assassinated in syria since january , according to opposition activists inside the country the highestranking victim was a brigadier general , anwar alsaqa , killed on june 5 the government says that opposition gunmen killed them because of their role in supporting the syrian military although technically a military wing of the palestine liberation organization , the palestine liberation army in syria is incorporated into the syrian military opposition activists say the officers were killed because they refused to participate in syrian crackdowns ahmed salih hassan was killed in a proregime town , and there were no armed opposition fighters , said abu jihad , a palestinian activist with fatah some people said that he refused to fight with the assad forces palestinians say they are feeling increasingly squeezed by the government and by their own neighbors like many of the older generation of leaders , abu jihad , who is 60 and lives in the sprawling yarmouk camp in damascus , says palestinians should avoid supporting either side the assad regime wants us to express our support for his regime , and the opposition wants us to demonstrate against the assad regime , he said palestinians are only too aware of what happened when they picked sides in other host countries hundreds of thousands were ejected from kuwait for having supported saddam hussein during his invasion in 1990 , for instance , and a smaller number from iraq after he fell in every war , we 're blamed for what happens whether we 're involved or not , said abu maher , a fatah official in lebanon we do n't want to bet on who will win or who will lose the deaths of three palestinians , shot late last sunday in the nayrab camp in aleppo , offer an example of this at first it seemed like a clear case of a syrian opposition killing accused of working as paid shabiha , or armed thugs , in support of the government , they were killed by an armed group whose members called themselves revolutionaries , according to other palestinian refugees however , omar , a syrian activist in damascus interviewed by skype , said that government officials wanted palestinians to fear the popular uprising they invented the story that palestinian refugees were attacked by antiregime armed groups so as to stir antagonistic feelings , but none of it is true , said omar , who uses only one name out of concerns for his security syria prides itself on being one of the few arab countries to offer palestinians full civil rights they can own property and hold government jobs , for instance it is hard for us to forget that syria deals with us as ordinary citizens , said abu mohammad , 40 , another refugee , who runs a candy store in the yarmouk camp if assad is gone , no arab or foreign state will host us , he said we want to live in peace and look after our sons , not to live in tents again many other palestinians in syria , especially younger ones , disagree with so many civil rights , they were raised essentially as syrians , and they find it hard not to be swept up in the fervor on the streets palestinians are not neutral , said noor bitar , the spokesman for the revolutionary council leadership in damascus , interviewed by telephone at the individual level there has been a participation in protests , blocking roads and other revolutionary activities nidal , 23 , a palestinian refugee and a university student in damascus , who gave only one name out of security concerns , said he and his friends were reluctant at first to support the syrian uprising day by day , palestinians began to see and hear by their eyes and ears what the assad regime does , and this pushed us , slowly , to change in addition , most palestinians are sunni muslims , as are most syrian opponents of mr assad s alawitedominated government now , nidal said , he and his friends have joined the cause we know that a regime comes and goes , but people stay forever at the same time , there have been some palestinians who have been quick to pick up weapons for mr assad , particularly followers of the popular front for the liberation of palestine general command this radical group , regarded in the west as a terrorist organization , has long been sheltered in syria by the assads , as has its leader , ahmed jabril activist palestinians complain that the general command has become so supportive of the syrian government that its armed cadres are used as auxiliaries by the secret police , or mukhabarat every palestinian in syria knows that the pflpgc s fighters are working for the mukhabarat and running security patrols for the regime , abu jihad said i worry that their bad actions will hurt us in the future with the syrian people

the theft of tax information from a south carolina computer system appears to have been the largest cyberattack ever on a state government and has put other states on high alert , computer security experts say the state late last month that an international hacker had stolen 36 million numbers and 387 , 000 credit and debit card numbers now tax departments across the country are inspecting their own security systems when one employee s laptop gets stolen , it s a big deal , said verenda smith , the deputy director of the national federation of tax administrators so you can imagine the reverberations when this news came out since 2005 , at least 11 state tax agencies have faced security , according to the privacy rights clearinghouse , a consumer rights group but most were caused by internal accidents , not attacks , and none were on this scale as a cyberattack , this appears to be in a league of its own , said beth givens , the group s director the hacking has raised questions about whether south carolina was unprotected or simply unlucky most of the stolen credit cards were encrypted , but the social security numbers were not the computer system that was hacked did not have a free layer of security monitoring offered to all south carolina agencies , according to the state budget and control board in a lawsuit filed last wednesday , a former state senator , john hawkins , said the state had failed to protect taxpayers and had not reported the attack promptly the tax agency detected the attack on oct 10 and , after notifying federal authorities , alerted the public on oct 26 obviously these hackers picked south carolina because it was vulnerable , mr hawkins said i equate it to a burglar going into a neighborhood he s going to break into the house with no alarms and the door open but south carolina is hardly the first state to suffer a largescale security breach in texas last year , social security records for 35 million people were inadvertently disclosed to the public on a computer server in georgia in 2007 , a computer disk containing personal information on 29 million people disappeared at the federal veterans affairs department in 2006 , an employee lost a laptop and an external hard drive containing the social security records of 265 million activeduty troops and veterans gov nikki r haley said that south carolina had a stateoftheart security system but that the hacker nevertheless found a way around it her office said on friday that it was encrypting all tax files to reduce the harm if any were stolen , and that the process would be completed within 90 days the state is paying up to 12 million to provide a free year of credit monitoring and identity theft prevention to anyone affected last wednesday , the state disclosed that tax records for 657 , 000 businesses had also been hacked anyone who has filed a tax return since 1998 has been urged to contact state law enforcement officials by last thursday , 653 , 000 people had called the state s emergency hot line , and 521 , 000 had signed up for identity protection within state governments , tax agencies face the highest risk for hacking , said larry ponemon , the founder of a , the ponemon institute if stolen , their data can be used for tax fraud , credit card fraud and identity theft this is the crown jewel for a cyberattacker having the social security numbers , personal information and credit card for the same person , he said after the attack , state tax agencies , including in california , said they were monitoring their security particularly closely michael hicks , the director of the at the university of maryland , said states needed a clearer understanding of the attack in south carolina the only way states can raise the level of vigilance , mr hicks said , is if they really get to the bottom of what really happened in this attack
five people from delhi were sentenced to death on friday for the honor killing of a couple , the latest in a series of death penalty judgments in india for the murder of young people who wish to marry outside their caste or religious group the victims , who belonged to different castes and hoped to get married , were reportedly tied with ropes and beaten with sticks and pipes before being electrocuted to death in 2010 such cruel and barbaric acts cannot be allowed to take place in developed metropolitan cities , the sessions judge , ramesh kumar singhal , said while sentencing socalled honor killings take place in many parts of india , particularly in the northern states of haryana , bihar , rajasthan and uttar pradesh , where caste continues to be a decisive factor in marriage young men and women who violate the traditional rules that prohibit marriage outside their own castes and religious communities are regularly ostracized , tortured and sometimes even murdered by members of their family , village or community on some occasions , selfappointed caste councils , called khap panchayats , pass diktats ordering such attacks , claiming they hope to protect the honor of their communities in recent years , india s highest court has taken a strong position against this practice there is nothing honorable in such killings , the supreme court said in 2006 , and in fact they are nothing but barbaric and shameful acts of murder committed by brutal , feudal minded persons who deserve harsh punishment last year , the court went one step further and prescribed the death sentence to punish those guilty of honor killings , saying it was time to stamp out these barbaric , feudal practices which are a slur on our nation all persons who are planning to perpetrate honor killings should know that the gallows await them , the court said but not all institutions in india agree with the court s stance in a report released in august this year , india s law commission , an advisory body of legal experts , criticized the court s directive , saying that the death sentence in india is to be used only in very exceptional and rare cases , when aggravating and mitigating circumstances are found the commission found that since the decision was given , the lower courts of uttar pradesh and delhi had sentenced almost all accused in cases of honor killings to death disapproving of this trend , the commission said that each case needed to be judged on its own facts and circumstances and criticized what it called the supreme court s blanket direction to give the death penalty in all instances of honor killings no hard and fast rule can be laid down , the report said , in sharp contrast to the court s decision prescribing the death penalty for honor killings committed for whatever reason in the 2011 case decided by the supreme court , a man strangled his daughter to death for having a relationship against his will the court said that if a person is unhappy with the behavior of a relative or a member of his caste , the maximum he can do is to cut off social relations , but he cannot take the law into his own hands by committing violence or giving threats of violence india has retained the death penalty , but since the 1980s this extreme form of punishment has been used only in the rarest of rare cases statistics show that even where the death penalty is given , execution is uncommon according to amnesty international s recent data , 435 people were sentenced to death in india between 2007 and 2011 , but none have been hanged honor killings , which have been under intense media scrutiny , now fall within the rarest of rare category in a bid to combat the practice more effectively , the government began considering various legal proposals in 2009 , including an amendment to the country s penal code to explicitly mention honor killings the law commission , tasked with evaluating this proposal , advised against it , saying the amendment would cause interpretational difficulties instead , the law commission proposed a law to ban the now infamous khap panchayats , which are different from the country s gram panchayats , or local selfgovernments the bodies of community elders have been called undemocratic by the government , and the report labels them a pernicious practice often young couples who fall in love have to seek shelter in the police lines or protection homes to avoid the wrath of kangaroo courts , the report said the proposed law seeks to prohibit any group from gathering to deliberate on , or condemn any legal marriage , on the basis that the marriage has dishonored the caste or community tradition or brought disrepute to the family , village or locality the intention of the law , the report said , is to curb the social evil of caste councils or panchayats that endanger the life and liberty of young persons
although mitt romney is the clear favorite to win the republican nomination after his victory in florida , the evidence is mixed as to how robust his advantage is below , we will draw on the florida results and historical precedents to consider five different scenarios for the republican race going forward interpretation no 1 it s all over but the concession speeches what happens next the short version mr romney gets some real and sustainable momentum from florida and wraps up the nomination quickly and easily what happens next the long version mr romney gets a lift in national polls and takes a considerable lead in most surveys he easily wins next week s caucuses , building further momentum he begins to roll out more endorsements , including some important and surprising ones from conservative leaders who are trusted by the republican base rick santorum drops out and either endorses mr romney outright or otherwise makes clear that he considers mr romney the most acceptable choice newt gingrich either drops out or reverts to running a halfhearted campaign popular attention to the nomination race dwindles , and the news media s focus shifts to the general election the outcome of super tuesday is a foregone conclusion any further losses that mr romney takes are a result of special circumstances for instance , to mr gingrich in mr gingrich s home state of georgia precedent the 2000 republican race is the best example of a contest in which the frontrunner , george w bush , lost a couple of early states but was perhaps never in any real danger of losing the nomination the evidence for this is a fairly common path , historically speaking nominations are generally not won without at least a few twists and turns in the modern primary era , al gore was the only nonincumbent to sweep all 50 states there is also theoretical evidence for this scenario in the political science scholarship a nomination race is a delegatecounting contest in theory , but if at all possible , the nominee is picked by consensus , with influential party leaders nudging the process along if it seems to go astray mr romney is the clear choice of party leaders , having far more endorsements than any other candidate he was also the only candidate deemed to be acceptable by a majority of republicans in a january gallup survey the evidence against if there is evidence for this case in past nomination races , this cycle has not followed the pattern the polling has been much more volatile than in the past , and primary and caucus wins have produced fleeting momentum at best  in addition , republican voters already passed on one opportunity to wrap up the race early , turning against mr romney after his win in new hampshire in contrast to candidates like mr bush , mr romney lost his national polling lead after new hampshire , something that is usually the hallmark of a prolonged nomination campaign moreover , mr romney is potentially a flawed standardbearer for his party , having once held a number of positions that republican voters now regard as unacceptable and if republican opinion leaders are clearly against mr gingrich , their embrace of mr romney has been lukewarm  evaluation this scenario is plausible , but the evidence for it is more theoretical than empirical if it is to occur , we should begin to see some clear sign of it almost immediately , especially in national polls however , it should be noted that a candidate does not necessarily need to be a worldbeater to take advantage of this pathway to the nomination john kerry did so in 2004 he just has to be better than the alternatives interpretation no 2 florida is the new normal what happens next the short version florida is the best benchmark for the republican race going forward mr romney has a clear but not overwhelming advantage the race may continue for some time , particularly depending on the preferences of mr gingrich , but in such a way that the ultimate outcome is not seriously in doubt what happens next the long version mr romney endures a few more losses along the way , including in some midsize states , especially in the south however , he wins the clear majority of contests his advantages are accentuated by his performance in caucus states and his support among automatic delegates \( the republican equivalent of super delegates \) volatility in the race decreases mr romney holds a stable if not overwhelming lead in national polls there may be a point or two at which mr romney loses a state unexpectedly , but this is not accompanied by a pronounced decline in his national poll ratings meanwhile , some swing voters grow impatient with mr gingrich , especially as his path to the nomination becomes more mathematically implausible some of them begin to support mr romney just to get the contest over with precedent the 1992 democratic race featured a gadfly candidate , jerry brown , who was never any real threat to win the nomination bill clinton , the frontrunner that year , did endure a handful of losses to mr brown , but he never lost his lead in national polls and was able to place most of his focus on november the evidence for mr romney s 14point win in florida a large and diverse state bodes well for his chances going forward his win was fairly sweeping demographically somewhat less so geographically \( he actually lost a majority of counties \) but overall about at the level of a candidate who might expect to win about 40 of the 50 states there is some evidence based on my research into state and national polling that volatility tends to decrease as the race progresses and as candidate preferences solidify finally , this is arguably the path of least resistance the republican party has some real differences to work out if the tea party has had less presence in the republican race than might be expected , the underlying sentiments behind it have not necessarily eroded and it can be hard for a party to settle on a nominee quickly when a better one might be imagined at the same time , mr romney is probably the party s most rational choice he may have the best chance of defeating president obama , and in this campaign he has been careful not to stray from the party s general policy positions the evidence against although florida may be more populous than the other earlyvoting states , it does not necessarily follow that it has more predictive power and some of mr romney s advantage came from groups like cubanamericans that do not have a large presence in other states also , this scenario implies reduced volatility in the rest of the nomination contest but volatility has been so high that you could cut it in half and it would still be well aboveaverage evaluation this inbetween path tends to occur when a candidate who has little mathematical chance to win the race nevertheless refuses to drop out arguably , that could be true for mr gingrich , as it was for mr brown mr gingrich is disliked enough by party elites that he probably has little to lose by staying in the race and he may feel aggrieved enough by mr romney s campaign that he will continue on even if the odds are against him in addition , ron paul is likely to stay in the race for some time regardless of mr gingrich s decision in other words , this scenario is highly plausible but mr romney would only be in danger if he committed some gamechanging gaffe , with the risk diminishing as his mathematical advantage mounted interpretation no 3 anybody but romney \? certainly not newt what happens next the short version support for mr gingrich erodes more than support for mr romney builds there is a limited window of opportunity for mr santorum , but he needs considerable luck to take advantage of it mr romney probably wins , perhaps fairly easily , but there is some drama along the way what happens next the long version mr gingrich experiences a significant decline in national polls and does poorly in the caucus states he gets no more support from his super pac , and his campaign becomes increasingly unfocused however , republicans are not necessarily ready to gravitate to mr romney instead , they give mr santorum another look , and he is buoyed by some modest success like a strong finish in the minnesota caucus or a win in the missouri beauty contest primary  mr santorum is competitive in several super tuesday states , including ohio , and proves to be a reasonably strong match for mr romney in the debates mr gingrich is not eager to drop out , but some of his supporters gravitate toward mr santorum as he comes to be seen as more viable , perhaps forcing the issue still , mr santorum faces some considerable disadvantages he lacks resources , and is always running from behind in the delegate count he has a chance to win if everything breaks just right , but more likely concedes after a failed last stand in a state like texas or wisconsin on april 3 mr romney takes some limited damage for the general election , but of the kind that would make a difference only in an extremely close race precedent in recent nomination races , there has not been a good example of a third wheel candidate coming from behind to emerge with the nomination instead , this scenario bears more resemblance to the period between about 1968 and 1976 , when the nomination process was in a transitional phase jimmy carter in 1976 , for instance , was not an ideal democratic nominee , but prevailed after anybody but carter efforts fizzled the closest thing to an exception is probably 1972 , when george mcgovern came from behind to win the democratic nomination , but mr mcgovern took considerable advantage of the party s new delegate allocation rules , which he had helped to design the evidence for mr santorum s favorability ratings are fairly good , and in some ways he could complicate mr romney s calculus on the electability front , for instance , mr santorum has the best net favorability rating among general election voters , although it is still in netnegative territory and mr santorum is a reasonably good debater who has less baggage than mr gingrich meanwhile , mr gingrich has a number of clear flaws as a candidate \( one reason that mr romney has been able to limit mr gingrich s momentum is because of his monetary advantages , but another is because things like mr gingrich s associations with freddie mac are inherently hard to defend \) mr gingrich s campaign is not terribly wellorganized and is unlikely to do well in the caucus states , perhaps creating an opening for mr santorum the evidence against this scenario depends on the notion that there is a strong desire for an anybody but romney candidate and the evidence for that is mixed some polls suggest , for instance , that supporters of mr santorum prefer mr romney to mr gingrich , and that supporters of mr gingrich prefer mr romney to mr santorum in the florida exit polls , 65 percent of voters said that they would be satisfied with mr romney as their nominee , and 77 percent said that they liked mr romney personally mr santorum , meanwhile , was unable to take advantage of his momentum after a strong showing in iowa , despite some concerted effort by some key republican constituencies to get behind him one issue that mr santorum faces is that he is not of the tea party generation of republicans , instead having won his senate seat in 1994 and having taken a position in the party leadership another is that his emphasis , more conservative on social policy than on fiscal policy , cuts somewhat against the mood of the republican base right now finally , this scenario would be much more plausible if mr gingrich were to drop out and endorse mr santorum , but for the aforementioned reasons , mr gingrich may be unlikely to do so evaluation this scenario relies on a number of things coming together for mr santorum none of the individual elements are entirely implausible , but the odds are strongly against his pulling everything together and during the time that voters might be flipping to mr santorum from mr gingrich , mr romney would be expanding his delegate advantage , making mr santorum s path harder interpretation no 4 rinse , lather , repeat what happens next the short version there continues to be considerable volatility in the republican race and any advantage that mr romney has is tenuous but he retains a slight edge in national polls and a clearer one in the delegate math mr gingrich remains his main rival what happens next the long version mr romney gets little bounce in national polls from florida or if he does , it fades quickly he loses a couple of states in february , and a number of them on super tuesday still , mr romney also wins his share of states and remains reasonably wellprepared for a war of attrition the race remains volatile , and mr romney endures some potential general election damage but he is something like a 75 percent or 80 percent favorite to emerge with the nomination , with the victory probably occurring well before the convention precedent the 1984 democratic race was reasonably close between walter mondale and gary hart that race bears some resemblance to this one , in that mr mondale was an establishmentbacked nominee whom rankandfile voters had limited enthusiasm for still , mr mondale had a reasonably clear edge throughout the race in the delegate count , benefiting from this organizational advantages in caucus states , and he wrapped the nomination up before the convention the evidence for this is arguably the least assumptiondriven scenario it posits that the volatility so far in the republican race implies continued volatility it does not ignore the data from florida but it also does not ignore the evidence from south carolina instead , it suggests that the former was something of a highwater mark for mr romney and the latter a lowwater mark , and that the race will continue to oscillate between these two poles the news media could assist this outcome the news media tends to root for volatility , which can produce better storylines and mr gingrich might be able to exploit free media coverage in such a way that mitigates his disadvantage in paid media to mr romney the evidence against even if you take the first four earlyvoting states as a whole , they look reasonably good for mr romney he has received 40 percent of republican votes so far , versus 31 percent for mr gingrich , his nextclosest competitor one can argue that this analysis puts too much weight on florida , which was more populous than the other earlyvoting states but if you instead just average the vote share from the first four states , mr romney is not really any worse off he received 34 percent of the vote , on average , between iowa , new hampshire , south carolina and florida , versus 24 percent for mr gingrich therefore this scenario , like no 3 , tends to default the notion that there is a desire for an anybody but romney candidate , something for which the evidence is mixed and even if there is such a desire , mr romney s advantage in delegates is nontrivial , especially considering his likely win in virginia , where mr gingrich failed to qualify for the ballot evaluation highly plausible but this scenario does not necessarily result in mr romney being defeated instead , he could win ugly but probably by a clear enough margin to spare himself the spectacle of a brokered convention still , this interpretation would imply that there was some genuine doubt about the outcome and that it is early enough that the wrong sequence of events could put mr romney in a lot of danger interpretation no 5 florida was a fluke what happens next the short version a fight to the finish mr romney s win in florida resulted from idiosyncratic circumstances and has little predictive power for future states he might win the nomination nevertheless , but he and mr gingrich have assets and liabilities that roughly balance each other out what happens next the long version national polls continue to point toward a highly ambiguous result mr romney takes some hardtoexcuse losses in february perhaps he wins nevada because of his advantage among mormon voters , but he loses either arizona or michigan on feb 28 then his performance on super tuesday is underwhelming , and he loses ohio mr romney has a number of opportunities to rebound but may or may not take advantage of them mr santorum drops out of the race and although he might not endorse mr gingrich , most of his voters wind up in mr gingrich s camp there is some chance of a brokered convention under this scenario , and an outside chance of a compromise candidate who is not running for president currently precedent evenly matched fights to the finish have been rare the closest thing to an exception was the 2008 democratic nomination race the evidence for a large number of republican voters are unhappy with their field of candidates and in contrast to years like 2008 , the numbers have been worsening rather than improving the nominal frontrunner , mr romney , has arguably not had his vulnerabilities tested but in a prolonged race voters will come to weigh things like his health care bill against him national polls continue to show an even race , with mr romney struggling in some important states like missouri and ohio meanwhile , it can be argued that mr romney won florida because of his advantage in advertising dollars there is some suggestion that the regions in which mr romney performed the most strongly in florida are those where he ran an especially large percentage of advertisements in most states , the argument goes , mr gingrich would be able to overcome mr romney s advantage with a strong performance in the debates , but mr gingrich was uncharacteristically off his game in the two debates in florida the evidence against it is not as though mr romney s edge in advertising dollars is likely to evaporate instead , he should have the resources to counter any potential surge by mr gingrich , as he successfully did in both iowa and florida the national polls are a lagging indicator and reflect voters that have not been exposed to the campaign , but there is reasonably clear evidence for what happens once they are and there is no reason to simply ignore florida , which gave mr romney a decisive win and which is far more representative of the republican primary electorate than the other states which have voted so far evaluation this is essentially the progingrich spin on the outcome in florida , and its flaw is that it tends to assume that mr romney s advantages are transient when in fact they are more robust moreover , even if mr romney s flaws cut quite deeply , mr gingrich has an equal number of vulnerabilities and the math so far suggests that a race that goes backandforth in public sentiment may still leave mr romney with a considerable advantage in the delegate count
steve pearlstein is a good guy that s why the piece he posted on ezra s blog fills me with such despair what steve says is that there are a lot of indications that the economy is getting stronger , which is true \( although not everything is rosy \) so , he says , no more stimulus in fact , let s have more cuts in state and locals spending to get things in line with longrun revenues also , stimulus would get in the way of needed structural adjustment first of all , we ve been here before in early 2010 maybe this time is different , and lucy won t snatch away the recovery football again but why act before we re sure \? second , even if recovery is solid this time , our economy is likely to stay depressed for quite a while use the atlanta fed jobs calculator to reach an unemployment rate of 55 within four years four years ! we would need 179 , 000 jobs a month are you sure we ll do that well \? third , steve s rhetorical question why postpone needed fiscal adjustments \? has a very good answer because we re in a liquidity trap , and the fed can t offset the economic downside this is a very bad time for austerity fourth , there have been many calculations about the extent to which this really is a structural slump , the result of workers in the wrong places or industries none of them support the view that this is more than a minor factor why does it play such a central role in conventional wisdom about what has to be done \? finally , it just isn t true that structural adjustment , to the extent that we do need it , proceeds faster and more easily when the economy is depressed workers won t leave jobs if they aren t reasonably sure of finding others firms won t invest even in useful new technologies unless there s adequate demand keeping the economy weak is a way to postpone good changes , not accelerate them so i find this very depressing once again , at the first hint of good news , the usual crowd , even good guys like pearlstein , is itching to pivot away from jobs oy
there should be no mystery as to why has been speaking of his absent and ethereal point guard with palms upturned and eyes heavenly cast he needs steve nash his spiritual other to hurry up and play point god or everyone connected to the will soon face the wrath of lord  while the nashless lakers may never be stamped a poorly constructed disaster , an abject failure or simply what the earlyseason standings reveal them to be in the mediocre middle of the western conference pack there is no darker latenight television than basketball s boardwalk empire , west coast chapter the clock is ticking kobe is steaming few other lakers are shooting did n't lebron james and the miami heat struggle for fluidity in their first season together before galvanizing and torpedoing the east on the way to the 2011 finals \? well , not quite the way the lakers have begun the season , killing off their coach \( mike brown \) after five measly episodes , losing 10 of their first 19 games , looking like a wouldbe behemoth on the verge of a nervous breakdown nash , who fractured his left fibula in the second game of the season and said the other day that he still could not run , may yet become the lakers' offensive glue , the link to a harmonious relationship between bryant and  but the more howard struggles with freethrow shooting , the more teams intentionally foul him in the fourth quarter , the more bryant takes the game upon himself and increases the odds of internal fracture he shot 31 times in a 107105 defeat in houston on tuesday night , compared with howard s 9 shots in the previous game , against orlando , another dispiriting setback , logic dictated that the lakers would want howard to have a big night against his former team but bryant recorded 27 shots to howard s 13 \( though the hackahoward strategy put him on the line for 21 free throws , of which he missed 12 \) we need to share the ball again , howard said after the lakers blew a 13point fourthquarter lead in houston , a nonetoosubtle shot at bryant , who has begun taking subtle swipes at d'antoni s spreadthefloor offense and the treatment of the suddenly tendinitisridden pau gasol in replacing brown with d'antoni , the lakers exchanged a defensiveminded coach with an offensive genius but the lakers have remained disjointed at both ends , to the point on defense where even d'antoni complained after the houston game , we had so many breakdowns nash certainly will not fix the problem that hubie brown first identified while calling a televised game against the clippers at staples center early last month while people had wondered whether the lakers' aging legs could hold up against younger and more athletic teams getting up and down the floor , brown noticed right away that the lakers' defenders were slowfooted and vulnerable off the dribble in halfcourt sets howard was supposed to compensate for age and vulnerability on the perimeter by shutting down the lane , but even bill russell would have had difficulty covering dribble penetrators from all directions at home against the magic , the lakers surrendered 40 points in the fourth quarter in houston , they gave up 34 they allowed the rockets to pound them for 21 offensive rebounds toney douglas stepped in for a struggling jeremy lin and put up 22 points forget nash , d'antoni probably wished he had lin to run his bryantdominated offense , the 20 version of what he endured early last season with carmelo anthony in new york bryant , at least , fires away with the selfassurance of a man with five championship rings d'antoni s scheme works best when the ball is in the hands of a trusted distributor assuming that nash , 38 , makes a healthy return before long , will the lord cede the ball in crunchtime to the savior \? if not , and howard s shot attempts continue to lag while his free throws misfire , how long before his survival instincts and his penchant for rash behavior convince him that hollywood is not where he wants to be for the long term \? after what howard put everyone through last season , nobody , except perhaps the nets , wants to hear him familiarize himself with the new chant brooklyn , with extra o s that fills the barclays center as the trade deadline approaches in february there is plenty of time for the lakers to straighten out , go on a run , vault over 500 with wednesday s 10387 win in new orleans , they had two road victories \( against five defeats \) for the season eight of their next 11 games are away , including a madison square garden matchup with the knicks a week from thursday night several of those games are against sub 500 teams but can the lakers count on beating anyone after losing to the magic at home \? and how might they fare friday night in oklahoma city against the thunder in what shapes up as a statement game \? it all bears close watching , bordering on mustsee tv
menzie chinn is having a dialogue , or something , with the heritage foundation he pointed out that their arguments against stimulus , aside from being primitive and wrong , would also imply that the fiscal cliff is harmless they respond in part by claiming that all they re worried about is the incentive effects yeah , right and also by claiming that famous economists made the same arguments the latter claim , unfortunately , is completely true but it doesn t absolve heritage all it shows is that much of macroeconomics , especially but not only at chicago , has retrogressed intellectually , to such an extent that famous economists repeat 1930vintage fallacies in perfect ignorance of the hard intellectual work that showed , three generations ago , that they are indeed fallacies by the way , heritage after totally misrepresenting keynesian economics \( keynesians never think about investment \? really \? \) asks , when the government borrows a trillion dollars on global financial markets for a stimulus package , does chinn believe that zero dollars of that is diverted from investment \? i don t know for sure what menzie s answer would be , but mine is , no , i don t believe that zero dollars are diverted under current conditions , negative dollars are diverted that is , stimulus spending would lead to more , not less , private investment why \? because we are in a liquidity trap interest rates won t rise and higher sales would induce businesses to invest more , not less oh , and if you go back to what heritage analysts were writing back in 2009 , they were predicting that government borrowing would lead to soaring interest rates how s that going , guys \? meanwhile , brad delong points out that heritage has company , not just in its intellectual degradation , but in its duplicity four years ago there were quite a number of economists of reputation and thought to be of note who stridently and aggressively argued that the increases in federal spending in the recovery act would not boost employment and production if extra federal spending and reduced tax collections in the recovery act could not boost production and employment , the reduced federal spending and increased tax collections from going over the fiscal cliff cannot reduce production and employment and does not risk sending the american economy into renewed recession yet not a one not a single one of the economists who were so strident in their condemnations of the ineffectiveness of the recovery act is out there now saying that the fiscal cliff is not of concern none of them zero nada shunya sifr which prompts cosma shalizi to write in comments , our gracious host would really like to be just a little bit to the left of a technocratic center , and to debate those just a little bit to his right about optimal policies within a shared objective function , and pretending that it is a technical and not a political discussion but because stuff i can t put in the grey lady and because everyone at all on the right has spent forty years \( at least \) doing their damndest to make sure more stuff , even the smallest gesture in that direction is not so much reconciliation as collaboration and so our host has sads \( so , for that matter , did uncle paul , before he learned to relish their hatred \) the realization that this applies to economists that much of the discipline is not a branch of science or even of dialectic , but merely of rhetoric \( and not in an inspirational , d mccloskey way either \) cannot come too soon i wish i had an easy refutation
public financing of presidential elections , the greatest reform to come out of the postwatergate era , died this year after a long illness it was 36 years old , and was drowned by big money and starved by the disdain of politicians who should have known better from 1976 until 2008 , every majorparty presidential candidate took public money for the general election , adhering to spending limits that significantly reduced the influence of money on american elections candidates began dropping out of public financing for primaries in 2000 , and then in 2008 , barack obama entirely , preferring to raise more money from small donations , and the public program he has made almost no attempt to fulfill that promise this year will be the first since richard nixon s day that neither major candidate will accept public financing both mitt romney and president obama plan to raise hundreds of millions of dollars , far more than they could get from  public financing could still be resuscitated , but first , someone in power has to care about it the republicanled house has voted to kill the system outright a few house democrats have proposed a good bill to fix it , but no one in the senate has picked up the bill and the two major candidates are too busy grubbing for the unlimited donations that now dominate politics the era of super pacs and secret donors has made public financing more urgent a system that greatly magnified small donations with high matches would give ordinary citizens a shot at competing with corporations , unions and wealthy donors it would allow candidates to campaign more instead of constantly begging among the rich and it would give a challenger a chance to be competitive without the help of a super pac ronald reagan president gerald ford for the republican nomination in 1976 without accepting public dollars the system also made campaigns possible for such diverse candidates as jimmy carter \( 1976 \) , george h w bush \( 1980 \) , jesse jackson \( 1988 \) and pat buchanan \( 1992 \) , all of whom had essentially run out of cash against opponents with much more money there is nothing conservative or liberal about public financing , which allows any kind of political voice to be heard above a roar of cash if lawmakers are willing to spend more here are several ways that congress could revive the system raise the grant the biggest reason candidates are dropping out of the system is that they can raise much more money outside of it this year , mr romney and mr obama could get 912 million each from the treasury if they participated in the system for the general election , and that is all they could spend in 2008 , mr obama and his party raised about 750 million he and mr romney both expect to do better than that this year , and that does not include the 200 million or so to be spent by super pacs and other independent groups the grant needs to be doubled or tripled proposed by two democrats , david price and chris van hollen , would give generalelection candidates 50 million , plus up to 150 million more based on a 4to1 match of donations of 200 or less there would be no spending limit , but individual donations would be limited to 500 \( currently , for candidates not participating in the system , donations can go up to 2 , 500 in the primaries and 2 , 500 in the general election \) the 200 million in the bill may not be attractive enough to candidates while it would never equal private fundraising , a grant of 300 million for each party could allow very competitive campaigns , and might appeal to candidates eager to spend less time raising money increase the primary match primary candidates now receive a government match of up to 250 for each donation , not nearly enough none of the candidates this year applied for matching money except for buddy roemer , the former louisiana governor , because they would have had to adhere to strict spending limits in return the democratic bill would eliminate the spending limits and provide a 4to1 match for donations of 200 or less , up to 100 million instead of the current 45 million it would also start matching money six months before the first primary or caucus , instead of making candidates wait for jan 1 as they do now mr obama s campaign is justly proud of its many small donations , but so far this year , a third of the 350 million he and the party have raised has been collected by bundlers , usually wealthy friends who collect cash from their friends to raise their influence higher matches for small donors mean less influence for bundlers eliminate the checkoff around 7 percent of taxpayers now check the box on their tax returns allowing money to be used for the presidential system , even though polls show far more people support it that limits the amount the government can spend to make the system more robust the checkoff was part of the political compromise that created the system , but taxpayers are not asked if they support wars or farm subsidies , and a program this vital should be no different asking people to support a program like this every april 15 , when they are most annoyed at the government , was never a good idea with the economy still struggling and deficits still high , giving even more money to politicians may be a hard sell to taxpayers but it is actually a small price to pay to preserve a democracy in which ordinary citizens are not shouted down by those who have bigger bank accounts
linschoten , the netherlands years ago , the story goes , dutch farmers crossed the canals dividing their fields by vaulting over them with a pole , since bridges were few and far between this apparently never translated into olympic glory in the pole vault , but it did give rise to a sport here that has been gaining popularity in recent years canalvaulting it is one of several littleknown dutch sports that are enjoying a revival here canalvaulters do not seek to go high , like polevaulters , but long hence they dig the point of their giant poles , a maximum of 43 feet , into the muddy bed of the canal near the bank they then take a running start , leap onto the pole and climb up it before , if all goes well , throwing themselves to the other side of the canal it is even harder than it sounds , and it sounds pretty hard when erik bos took his second of three tries in a recent competition in this rural dutch village one recent evening , he suffered a common fate of canalvaulters , gradually losing his grip on the pole and tumbling into the cold water below jaco de groot , 26 , the farthest of anyone that evening , but only after plunging twice into the canal normally about 30 percent of the jumpers wind up in the water , said pieter hielema , who was waiting his turn to jump the origins of the practice are lost in the misty past , but records of competitions go back to the mid18th century the competitions thrived for a while after , then waned again until recent years people understand now that it s part of our culture , said mr hielema , 40 , a project manager who has been vaulting since he was 12 now his son kenzo , 7 , is taking part in children s competitions twenty years ago , there were very few competitions most participants , like mr bos , who started vaulting canals when he was 6 , bring extra changes of clothing because of the risk of landing in the canal , which is 46 feet wide vaulting was his father s hobby , mr bos said , adding that he vaulted from pasture to pasture as a boy i already did it between the cows , he said so competition was a logical step for me in 2008 , he won his second national championship with a leap of 64 feet this is a cultural event as well as a sport , said mr bos , 37 , a lighting consultant i'm very proud of the last 20 years we saw a lot of growth about an hour s drive north of linschoten in the village of wormer , once an affluent whaling town but now a bedroom community of amsterdam , a dozen men and women gathered on a recent afternoon , all enthusiasts of another venerable dutch sport kolf or kolven , which has elements similar to french p tanque and to golf the idea is to use a kolf club to hit balls at two posts at either end of a court nearly 60 feet long and 16 feet wide to get the highest possible score , 60 , is as hard as throwing a nohitter in baseball it is not a great spectator sport , unless one s idea of entertainment runs to watching paint dry or grass grow yet , 300 years ago , kolf was everywhere , with 217 courts in amsterdam alone today , there are none in amsterdam , and in all of the netherlands , just 14 but the number may be on the rise when he joined his local kolf club last november , mark aberkrom said , my aim was to press for 10 new courts in two years mr aberkrom , 48 , a financial consultant , discovered kolf after he bought a former tavern and found the remains of a kolf court there he has since developed a passion for the sport in the 19th century , he said , what killed kolf was the french game of billiards five or six billiard tables could occupy the space of one kolf court , and tavernkeepers preferred the french novelty the club now has 48 members we are an example for other clubs that you can grow , he said in the old days , kolf was played in winter , on the frozen canals , often accompanied by shots of dutch gin and bets of smoked eel now , it is mainly a game of older people , with the average age of players about 65 as a teenager , dirk spijker loved billiards , yet he became fascinated with the kolf players at the far end of his local tavern i wanted to try , i found a club , a rubber ball , i like to whack it , he said , crouching to aim his ball by last year , mr spijker , now 58 , did what was thought impossible , no one remembers this ever being done before neither canalvaulting nor kolf has caught on outside the netherlands , but one eccentric dutch sport has found a home abroad for the past 18 years aruba , the caribbean island that remains part of the kingdom of the netherlands , has been holding a local championship for paalzitten , or pole sitting this sport arose from the habit of dutch canal boat hands' resting on the poles that lined the canals to moor barges this year s competition in oranjestad , the capital of aruba , involved four people who climbed onto poles to see who could sit the longest , toilet breaks every few hours being the only interruption allowed after 87 hours and 52 minutes , liesbeth cornes , 31 , a cafe employee , climbed down victorious , sharing the honor with another islander , shurman milliard the group of four settled atop their poles on a thursday morning in may at 6 30 am , and the winners climbed down on sunday night at 10 22 hundreds of spectators came to see the four and danced to the tunes of a local band , tsunami after this victory , ms cornes decided to retire this is the last year for me , she said by phone i do n't have to prove myself
i m in shock , said adepero oduye , the young star of pariah , who was given a shoutout by none other than meryl streep during the golden globes on sunday night meryl streep said my name , ms oduye said , still reeling in the lobby of the beverly hilton afterward i got to meet her , and she kissed my hand she s one of my idols ! octavia spencer , wearing flipflops under her lilac gown she kicked off her louboutin heels in the press room rushed by from the instyle party , where everyone from tilda swinton to paris hilton cut a rug \( not , sadly , at the same time , though the bagger was on the dance floor with the cast of modern family and we can report that ty burrell has some moves \) downstairs , the poolside hbo party , always enjoyable for the right mixture of glam and casual , drew a lot of stars from tv shows past and present , including lisa bonet and the cast of the office ricky gervais chatted with a few people , then slipped out a side door around 10 30 pm next to a heat lamp , adam levine of maroon 5 wiggled a bit to the 60s soul the dj was spinning , not fully busting out any moves that would make you have a certain song stuck in your head for the rest of the day nearby , a comedy nerd table was taking shape , with judd apatow greeting john stamos , and jeff garlin from curb your enthusiasm chatting with mike white , the creator of enlightened the bagger spoke with mr apatow , who last year was vocally against mr gervais s hosting style , which he called unduly meanspirited but this year \? he was a fan it was a great monologue , he said i really thought it was funny i just enjoyed it he called out a joke about helen mirren being an inspiration for the raunchy girls of bridesmaids , which he produced , as one of his favorites equally important , he added i felt like i skated through without injury in the press room , george clooney said that mr gervais had a much tougher gig this year than last there s so much buildup to it , it s almost as if , how rough can you go \? he said it s always hard picking your targets , mr apatow agreed you want your jokes to have a point of view about something that is insightful the biggest frustration for a show like this is , you wish he had 10 more minutes you feel him just revving up i d rather watch ricky gervais do 45 minutes than the show

in fifth grade , i knew i wanted to study computer science when i grew up my school did not offer much in that subject , so i spent my time building web sites and silly apps on visual basic , and exploring random software in high school , when i could finally take programming classes , i fell in love with programming it was the perfect mix between art and science i knew just what i wanted to do in the past three years of high school , i have been one of the few people with unwavering answers to the neverending questions about college what do you want to study \? computer science where do you want to go to college \? i m applying to colleges in the united states many people found that hard to believe , for many reasons for instance , i did not know a single soul in the united states until recently it is halfway across the world from my home in india , and a universe away from the life i have always known also , being the only daughter of protective parents doesn t help there are other factors the colleges in which i want to apply are known for being extremely selective also , my family cannot afford to pay for them considering these odds , i have often been subjected to discouraging talks the acceptance rates are low my test scores are supposedly not good enough for international students international students do not get financial aid someone my neighbor knew was denied a visa thankfully , the stories do not discourage me i grew more confident when i was accepted for a selective science program this summer in new mexico in which the costs were minimal for my parents i learned not to take statistics too seriously but after that monthlong science program , i began to doubt my inclination toward science and technology i did not want to spend my days staring at a digital screen but how could that be \? i had dreamed of it for as long as i can remember with college applications finally here , i am unsure of my once resolute choices staring at my commonapp profile , i think maybe i should give linguistics and foreign languages as my tentative , intended major i am multilingual , i grasp new languages easily , and i want to learn more of them that would also give me opportunity to travel the world and experience other cultures i have always wanted to do that or how about journalism \? i love writing and have strong opinions on current affairs i have never been more indecisive maybe undecided makes sense then i look at the colleges in which i want to apply it s not easy to accommodate all of these amazing schools on my list of eight one day , i strike a college off my list , and the next day , it s back there i am applying to many selective colleges what if none accept me \? what if i don t get enough financial aid anywhere \? maybe i should consider that less selective college but do i really want to go there \? every decision is an endless debate between dreams and reality i am certainly not the girl with the answers anymore but in the next few months , i hope to rediscover those answers as i take my final steps toward college ms krishnamoorthy , a student at in new delhi , is one of eight high school seniors around the world blogging about their college searches for the choice to comment on what she has written here , please use below
in 2009 president obama signed a federal bias crimes law named for the victims of two gruesome 1998 atrocities the young gay man who was tortured , lashed to a fence and left to die and the black man chained to the back of a pickup by white supremacists and dragged until he was dismembered the matthew shepard and james byrd jr hate crimes prevention act joined a 40year accumulation of statutes declaring that crimes committed with a mind full of racial spite or antisemitism or homophobic hatred should be punished more severely than identical crimes committed for greed or vengeance today the notion is embedded in our culture almost every state has some variety of hate crime law the most recent fbi count , for 2010 , reports instances where local authorities judged that the offender was motivated by hatred of a particular group the in 1993 the a hate crime bill in 2005 but the fact that it is constitutional and commonplace does not quiet the nagging sense that hate crime legislation resembles something from an orwell dystopia horrific crimes deserve stern justice , but do n't we want to be careful about criminalizing a defect of character \? because our founders believed that democracy requires great latitude for dissent , america , virtually alone in the developed world , protects the right to speak or publish the most odious points of view and yet the government is authorized to punish you for those vile things , if you think them in the course of committing a crime the issue is back with us thanks to the heartbreaking deaths of two teenagers one is tyler clementi , the rutgers student who jumped to his death from the george washington bridge after his roommate surreptitiously , briefly , videostreamed him kissing another man the other is trayvon martin , the black florida youngster shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer clementi s roommate , dharun ravi , was convicted not only of invading clementi s privacy and intimidating him , but of acting with an antigay bias that could add up to 10 years of prison to his sentence the shooter in the trayvon martin case , george zimmerman , has not been charged with anything , but politicians are already slinging the hword if the idea of criminalizing hatred makes you queasy , as i think it should , these two cases will not settle your stomach anyone who followed the rutgers trial closely or read of the two roommates in the new yorker is likely to conclude that ravi is arrogant , mouthy and insensitive , but not a malicious homophobe clementi was an openly gay , socially awkward , complicated 18yearold , who killed himself for reasons we do n't know my reading of the case is that the jury seized on those handy bias statutes in a clumsy attempt to punish somebody for a death that remains unexplained it s not a great reach to say that ravi faces up to 10 years in prison for being a jerk the shooting of trayvon martin has become a cause before it is even a case it s natural to admire the resolute grace of his grieving parents and to endorse their demand for answers florida authorities have been slow to provide it s commendable to shine the lamp of shame on florida s absurdly permissive gun laws \( this , remember , is the state that tried last year to make it a crime for in the home \) but fashioning a narrative from the hatecrimes textbook bellowing analogies to the racist nightmares of birmingham and selma , as the reliably rabblerousing reverend sharpton has done is just political opportunism this is the kind of demagoguery that could prejudice a prosecution , or mobilize a mob is it not creepy , by the way , that the suspected home address of george zimmerman \? as if to say , go get him ! \( lee sent apologies and a check to the elderly couple who were scared from their home because , oops , the tweet gave the wrong address but apparently it s ok to terrorize zimmerman \) if the trial of dharun ravi illustrates how readily hate crime laws can be abused by juries , the death of trayvon martin shows how easily they become pitchforks for showboating politicians the anguishing cases of tyler and trayvon sent me back to the earlier debates over hate crimes it is an abundant literature packed with historical analogies , philosophical hairsplitting , political posturing and interesting digressions many of the justifications for antihate laws seem to me to fall short bias crimes terrorize more than the immediate victim yes , but so does a mugger who frequents a particular neighborhood we must protect the most vulnerable fine , then why not assign extra penalties for criminals who prey on the poor , children , or as a few prosecutors have done the \? racism and other prejudices are especially offensive motives worse than sadism , or pedophilia \? back in 2001 , heidi m hurd , a professor who comingles law and philosophy , wrote an article entitled why liberals should hate hate crime legislation' the thesis sounded contrarian hate crime laws evolved out of a great liberal cause civil rights and have been propelled by activists and politicians most of us would call liberal hurd , though she is a democrat , was referring not to the contemporary political left but to traditional , johnlockeandjohnstuartmill liberalism , which holds that the state is licensed to temper bad behavior , not to perfect human nature hate crime laws , she wrote , crossed that line the law now regulates not only what we do , but who we are there is nothing novel about the law taking into account a criminal s state of mind one of the prerequisites for a conviction under common law is mens rea a guilty mind , malice aforethought , criminal intent the law also recognizes gradations of guilty purpose a premeditated killing is more punishable than one committed in the heat of the moment , which is worse than a killing that results from negligence new york law compounds the punishment if you kill someone to prevent him from being a witness the distinction hurd makes convincingly , i think is that when you penalize intent you are punishing matters of choice one can choose not to pull the trigger , not to throw the rock , not to steal the purse you ca n't choose not to be prejudiced or biased at least not willynilly , on the spot , she told me , when i called her the other day at the university of illinois we pass moral judgments all the time against bigots and chauvinists and homophobes and so forth but this is a question not of what we should morally blame people for , but of what we should deprive them of liberty for in her criminal law class , hurd teaches the cases of matthew shepard and james byrd , and says that every time she confronts those monstrous crimes a part of her wonders , why do n't we use the power of the state to make people less evil \? but , as she points out , those were both crimes eligible for the death penalty what are you going to do , kill somebody twice \? in most cases , hate crime laws take offenses that would carry more modest sentences assault , vandalism and ratchet up the penalty two or three times because we know , or think we know , what evil disposition lurked in the offender s mind then we pat ourselves on the back as if none of us , pure and righteous citizens , ever entertained a racist thought or laughed at a homophobic slur bias laws are widely accepted they are understandable they are probably here to stay but they seem to me a costly form of sanctimony
at the end of her show at the bowery ballroom on tuesday night , solange was in the crowd , dancing , one reveler of many , set apart only by the fact that she had just been onstage , that it was her song moving the room , that her sister is beyonc but really , by none of that blending into the scenery is harder than you 'd think , especially for a singer like solange she was wearing an earthtone printed suit , and her hair was teased out wide and bounteous she took up a lot of stage and given that many in the crowd have clearly been paying attention to her style check out her video for filmed in south africa , and full of les sapeurs , a crew of african dandies her presence felt huge when it came to the songs , though , solange was content to be smaller , much smaller she just released true \( terrible \) , a slinky ep full of euphoric disco and casual funk with flickers of throbbing , libidinal rock it s produced by devonte hynes , who has taken his penchant for 1980s rock nostalgia that permeates his own songs and channeled them into a more sensual palette as a producer here this is solange s third goround as a teenager she released a poprb album , and then in 2008 , a second album with classic soul bones and a mildly bohemian affect neither hit hard it probably was n't difficult to realize , explicitly or implicitly , that when your big sister already was an rb star or more accurately , rb star becoming one on the same terms was going to be a tough thing to chase wisely , solange receded , then regrouped and then reemerged true was released on a label founded in part by chris taylor , of the digressive indie rock group grizzly bear it s a cool , slightly distant record that channels strains of nostalgia for the 1980s , for classic dance music that are more au courant in rock than in rb at times she recalls the dancepop sugar rush of a stacey q , someone who prizes immediacy looks good with trouble is washed out and drowsy , and do n't let me down has a potent kick to go with its troubled lyric losing you is a highlight , with the astral new wave of , say , alphaville , caressing solange s pliant pleas it s hard not to hear the echo in locked in closets of janet jackson s control , one of her first hits and the song that began to establish her as a solo star outside of her family s shadow solange knows from shadows \( speaking of beyonc was in the balcony during this show , and was n't a distraction \) onstage solange looked to an earlier decade , the 1970s , with overenunciated dance moves on loan from the jackson 5 she was a delicate presence not tentative so much as gentle and while her voice is capable of robustness , she mostly let the music steer sometimes her voice was lower in the mix than her background singers she got looser with the melodramatic disco number tony from her second album , actually , not the new ep pushing her voice in a heavy soul direction that her new music mostly avoids , though clearly not because she ca n't pull it off instead , she s aiming for something amiable and affectionate , letting the mood that she sets speak more loudly than her having the courage to be slight is no small thing
s 573day hiatus from a major league game ended at 1 02 pm sunday , when he pounded his mitt twice , tugged his cap once and galloped out of the home dugout at yankee stadium to start his 17th season of work in the big leagues the crowd cheered , then relaxed the roll call rose from the bleachers in right field , and even included pettitte s name , a recognition the starting pitcher does not usually get by the time they called his name , he was two pitches into the game , too focused perhaps to notice pettitte slipped back so seamlessly into a comfort zone on the mound that , as he would say later , it was as if he had never left his pitching , however , is still rounding into form the 39yearold pettitte , making his first start since game 3 of the american league championship series on oct 18 , 2010 , allowed four runs and seven hits in six and a third innings the lost to the , 62 pettitte , who walked three and struck out two , said he made some mistakes but ultimately felt good i envisioned what i wanted to feel like out there , and i 'll tell you it came back really quick , pettitte said it felt great it felt like i never left despite pettitte s long absence , the crowd seemed overjoyed that he had decided to come out of retirement he was coaching youth baseball and speaking at local church services in texas to rejoin a club that has needed rotation help pettitte s route to the mound had gone through the minor leagues and a federal courtroom in washington , where he testified at roger clemens s trial on perjury charges on may 2 , pettitte acknowledged that there was a chance he could have misunderstood clemens in a discussion about the use of human growth hormone the fans sunday focused instead on the pitcher who won five world series with the yankees , warmly welcoming pettitte and his syrupy windup back into pinstripes the fans are awesome , and i think they know what i think about them , for sure , he said pettitte started off sharply , not allowing a hit through the first three innings and throwing firstpitch strikes to 9 of the first 10 batters he faced but the mariners took a 20 lead in the fourth on a tworun homer by justin smoak then pettitte came a bit undone in the sixth he allowed a hard leadoff single to dustin ackley followed by a tworun homer by casper wells that put the mariners ahead , 41 after the mariners picked up three more hits to load the bases , pettitte managed to escape on a double play turned by first baseman mark teixeira andy s going to get some base runners , but he knows how to get the double play , yankees manager joe girardi said after retiring michael saunders on a groundout in the seventh , pettitte was replaced by cory wade after having thrown 94 pitches pettitte s velocity stayed around the 87 to 89milesperhour range girardi had predicted , and he mixed in all six of his pitches i thought he was sharp he located well , girardi said he had a couple walks , but that s nothing to be too alarmed about he looked like he had n't missed a beat but pettitte s prototypical command was not quite there in addition to his three walks , pettitte threw a wild pitch and said he struggled getting his cutter in against righthanded hitters offensively , the yankees were perplexed by seattle s own veteran starter , the 37yearold kevin millwood , who held them to three hits and a run in seven innings we always like to see andy on the mound because we know what he s capable of doing , derek jeter said but we all have to do our jobs pettitte slides into a rotation that is shorthanded and has had its struggles , particularly by phil hughes and freddy garcia , before garcia was moved to the bullpen but yankees starters had a 131 earned run average with four wins in the previous five games entering sunday , including an uplifting performance by hughes on saturday before sunday s game , girardi seemed to play down the importance of pettitte s return to the rotation it looks like it can stabilize on its own with what we 've got here , girardi said yet pettitte s own eagerness to return was evident he was among the first yankees in the clubhouse sunday , at 9 30 am , organizing items in his locker between c c sabathia and hughes in one corner in it , he had three hats , two gloves , two balls and six pairs of cleats , but none of the little trinkets that personalize other lockers there s not a question about how this is all going to play out for me , and it s not about this one start , pettitte said i 'll measure if this was a successful return or not at the end of october inside pitch robinson cano went 0 for 3 on sunday to snap a 10game hitting streak during which he batted 425 with two homers and nine runs batted in the yankees optioned the righthander cody eppley to class aaa
the saying goes that you should do one thing and do it better than anyone else unfortunately for the tampa bay rays , what the team does best is suffer through perfect games on wednesday , felix hernandez of the seattle mariners retired every rays batter he faced , recording the 21st perfect game of the modern era incredibly , it was the third thrown against the rays in the last four seasons , with the others coming at the hands of mark buehrle in 2009 and dallas braden in 2010  no one would confuse hernandez for buehrle or braden as the latter two are softtossing lefthanders hernandez , a righthander from venezuela , overwhelmed the rays on his way to 12 strikeouts a franchise founded in 1998 , the rays have accounted for 143 percent of the perfect games since 1901 in just 2 , 382 games the only other team to have had three perfect games thrown against it is the los angeles dodgers \( one of the three was in the 1956 world series \) , but that team was founded in 1884 and has played 19 , 752 regularseason games four rays have the distinction of having been on the losing end of history all three times evan longoria , bj upton , carlos pena and ben zobrist longoria , the team s third baseman and its best player , was 0 for 9 with four strikeouts in the three games , as was bj upton , the team s starting center fielder pena left the team as a free agent last season , signing with the chicago cubs , but came back to tampa bay this season in time to repeat the misery his one season away was the only one in the last four in which the team did not have a perfect game thrown against it zobrist , while 0 for 9 with two strikeouts in the three games , at least forced the opposing pitchers to throw 42 pitches , tops among his teammates all four players were also playing on june 25 , 2010 , when edwin jackson nohit the team in a 10 win the quartet can at least claim that they made jackson work hard , drawing six of his eight walks it is almost surprising that none of them were in the lineup when derek lowe nohit the team , called the devil rays then , in 2002  with 905 hits this season , the rays are ranked second to last in the majors , making their futility against hernandez perhaps seem predestined but that was not the case in 2009 , when the rays were the fifth highest scoring team in the american league , or in 2010 , when the team ranked third desperate rays fans can at least point to the comments of john jaso , the mariners catcher , who does not think it is anything in particular about tampa bay that led to its recordtying futility , and was instead just a case of hernandez being at the top of his game you could throw any lineup out there today and it s close to the same result , jaso told reporters after the game for longoria , upton , pena and zobrist , any other lineup would have been a welcome change
london the number of people by jimmy savile , one of britain s most popular television hosts , expanded to 300 from 200 in just the last week , and other people may have acted with him , the scotland yard officer heading the investigation said thursday the officer , cmdr peter spindler , described mr savile , , as undoubtedly one of the most prolific sex offenders in recent british history , during a 50year career as a selfstyled pied piper for the young , the sick and the lonely commander spindler said that in preliminary telephone interviews with 130 of the potential victims , 114 of them had accused mr savile of criminal behavior ranging from inappropriate touching to rape of the 300 complainants , he said , all but 2 have been female commander spindler said the vast majority of the accusations logged by the police were against mr savile alone , with the remainder involving mr savile and others or episodes in which the entertainer was not implicated although the commander specified that investigators had found no evidence of a pedophile ring , as some published accounts in britain have suggested , he said that a number of living people were under investigation later , an article whom it did not further identify , as saying the police were looking at some figures of high standing who might have helped mr savile it is thought investigations are looking at those who may have assisted savile , helped organize abuse , cover it up or taken part in assaults themselves , the bbc story said an article on the guardian s web site , citing no sources , said the newspaper understands that who worked at hospitals linked to mr savile over decades had been passed to police investigators , with claims that they were at the heart of a loose network of child abusers connected with savile the guardian story noted that mr savile kept an office and living quarters at the , a highsecurity psychiatric treatment center in berkshire , and a bedroom in the , in buckinghamshire , which has one of the largest units in the world that specializes in spinal injuries both institutions are close to london the newspaper also said he was given free rein at , in the northern industrial city where he was born and where he found his first job as a boy , working in a mine commander spindler said his investigation , codenamed operation yewtree , had not yet led to any arrests , but he implied that they might not be far off when he said that the police were preparing an arrest strategy in the meantime , he said , police investigators were proceeding cautiously with mr savile s accusers , spending as much as four hours on each initial interview this may be the first time that some people have actually spoken in any detail , and we do n't underestimate how significant an event it is for them to disclose sexual abuse , he said commander spindler , who spoke at a news conference and in interviews with british news organizations , did nothing to allay the shock that the savile scandal has caused across britain the weight of the evidence against mr savile , he said , is overwhelming , not least because of the similarities in what the accusers have told the team of officers raised to 30 in recent days , from an original group of 10 about the abuses we have to believe what they are saying , because they are saying the same thing independently , he said the bbc reported on wednesday that mr savile , a bachelor , was investigated but never prosecuted for sexual abuse at least half a dozen times during a television career in which he presented himself as an irrepressibly jaunty figure with a vocation to spread happiness into some of the most vulnerable corners of society but a cascade of revelations in the past month have suggested that his wildly successful programs , top of the pops and jim 'll fix it , as well as charitable work that raised tens of millions and made him a tireless visitor to hospitals , nursing homes and institutions for the emotionally and psychologically disturbed , were vehicles for another career , as a relentless sexual predator the scandal has thrown his employer , the bbc , into one of the greatest crises in its 90year history as britain s revered public service broadcaster , drawing in several senior figures there , including its current director general , george entwistle , who took over in september from , the incoming president and chief executive of the new york times company mr thompson was director general of the bbc when the editor of a current affairs program canceled an investigation into mr savile late last year , just as other divisions were planning christmastime tributes to him , two months after his death mr thompson has said repeatedly that he knew nothing about the investigation by the current affairs program , newsnight , while it was under way had no role in canceling it and had heard none of the suspicions about mr savile he has agreed to answer questions from parliament and from the independent investigators examining the events at the bbc the police , the national health service and other institutions have been shaken by what the disclosures have shown , and the political shock waves have led the prime minister , david cameron , to demand that the bbc , in particular , account for its failure to protect mr savile s victims , some of whom were said to have been abused in his bbc dressing rooms commander spindler suggested the scandal and the subsequent investigation of the sexual abuse of children would have a cathartic impact on britain he said the events of the past month had been a watershed that would force public institutions to develop new and tougher programs to detect and combat the sexual exploitation of children , push the police to intensify their own procedures and encourage victims to come forward i think what s happened with this inquiry , he said , is that they do have a voice , and that they will be heard
the results of elections in five states will be announced tuesday in uttar pradesh , india s largest state , exit polls released over the weekend indicate that the party of the current chief minister , mayawati , is headed for certain defeat the incumbents in the other four states punjab , uttarakhand , goa and manipur are also expected to suffer defeats or lose seats but can we rely on these exit polls \? in 2007 , ms mayawati , who uses only one name , led the bahujan samaj party to a decisive and historic victory , even though none of the exit polls predicted that she would win the party won 205 seats in the 403member state legislature , the first time any single party had won a clear majority in 18 years ms mayawati , whose core supporters are dalits , the lowercaste hindus once known as untouchables , won even though she and her party were aloof and seemingly uninterested in normal electioneering she did not hold news conferences , issue statements or offer an election manifesto , nor did she do so this year most of the exit polls indicate that her party s representation in the assembly will be reduced by about half predicting elections in uttar pradesh , which has 200 million people , is never easy several parties contest each seat , and the population of each constituency is often divided among several castes , religions and socioeconomic classes moreover , many dalits refuse to speak to pollsters , making it hard to gauge their intentions those problems are compounded by the fact that india uses a firstpastthepost system in which candidates that receive the most votes win even if they do not secure a majority of all votes cast in the race it is a nightmare if there is a multicornered contest as in up , yogendra yadav , a respected indian political analyst and pollster , told me in an email message doing opinion polls in india is difficult because it is hard to do a strictly random selection of respondents and because telephonic surveys do not work mr yadav , who is a senior fellow at center for the study of developing societies in new delhi , said that in 2007 exit polls did a decent job of predicting what percentage of all voters in the state would pick ms mayawati s party but they failed to predict how many seats she would win , a trickier task that requires more detailed , constituencylevel polling data , he said if ms mayawati does indeed lose , it will likely be for a handful of reasons she has , by and large , been inaccessible to members of her party , journalists and government officials , to say nothing of average residents there are widespread allegations about corruption in her government , an impression she tried to dispel before the election by firing ministers who had been accused of taking bribes she has a tendency to transfer government officials frequently from one post or one location to another , making it hard for them to accomplish anything meaningful before they are forced to pack up and move she has also struggled to attract investment to uttar pradesh the state s economy grew at an average of just 66 percent a year in the three fiscal years after ms mayawati took over , far slower than other nearby states like bihar \( 103 percent \) , haryana \( 96 percent \) and uttarakhand \( 12 percent \) most of the exit polls in up indicate that the samajwadi party , which governed the state before ms mayawati came to power in 2007 , is heading for a victory and may win close to half of the seats in the assembly in punjab , the polls have congress slightly ahead of the governing coalition of shiromani akali dal and the bharatiya janata party , india s biggest opposition party at the national level the polls also show a close race between congress and the bjp in uttarakhand , which was once part of uttar pradesh in goa , a state currently ruled by congress , exit polls suggest that no party will win a majority which could open the door for a coalition government and in manipur , the polls suggest the incumbent , congress , will lose some seats but retain enough to return to power
president obama and his advisers are in the middle of a onceinadecade study of the nuclear arsenal and nuclear war plans for strategic and budgetary reasons , they need to further reduce the number of deployed weapons and the number kept in reserve if this country can wean itself from its own dependence , it will be safer and will have more credibility in its efforts to contain the nuclear ambitions of iran , north korea and others twenty years after the end of the cold war , the united states still has about 1 , 790 strategic nuclear weapons deployed and 2 , 800 more as backup \( another 3 , 500 are retired and awaiting dismantlement \) in his 2002 nuclear posture review , president george w bush declared that nuclear weapons had a critical role in defending the united states and its allies against nucleararmed enemies and might be needed to deter and even punish foes wielding chemical , biological or conventional weapons in his 2010 review , president obama downgraded the importance of nuclear weapons , somewhat , to a fundamental role he ruled out the use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear countries , even if they attack the united states with unconventional weapons now mr obama has to make the practical choices to implement his strategy he took a first step in 2010 when he signed the new start treaty with moscow to cut the number of deployed longrange nuclear weapons to 1 , 550 each , from 2 , 200 , by february 2018 but that agreement followed the same pattern as all of the coldwar and postcoldwar arms treaties it said nothing about the estimated 11 , 000 nuclear weapons that the two sides keep as backups the socalled hedge nor did it address america s 500 shortrange nuclear weapons , which are considered to be safely guarded , or russia s 3 , 000 or more , which may be vulnerable to theft mr obama must lead the way to deeper cuts in all three categories for deployed strategic weapons , the pentagon and national security aides have prepared options for the next round of negotiations with the russians a new ceiling of 1 , 000 to 1 , 100 warheads 700 to 800 or 300 to 400 even the lowest number is more than any potential foe , except russia , possesses china , the only major power expanding its arsenal , likely has 240 to 300 nuclear weapons in its arsenal , but experts say no more than 50 are capable of hitting the united states pakistan has perhaps 90 , all aimed at india north korea has fewer than a dozen , none with the ability to hit the united states iran has no weapons , so far just how many does the united states need \? many experts believe the united states can easily go down to 1 , 000 warheads in total deployed and stored without jeopardizing security we agree washington and moscow have committed to undertaking a new round of negotiations , but domestic politics in both capitals are interfering the two sides need to get things moving another treaty will take years to complete , so mr obama should also look seriously at moving more quickly to the new start levels and challenge the russians to do the same both countries need to destroy all of their tactical nuclear weapons no commander would ever use them on a battlefield as quickly as possible the united states and russia also have about 1 , 000 weapons each that are ready to fire at a moment s notice mr obama should take as many as possible off of hair trigger alert and urge the russians to do the same many republicans have reacted hysterically to the idea of further cuts senator james inhofe has accused mr obama of catering to his liberal base , which he says wants to unilaterally disarm that is absurd the stakes are too high for this to be treated as a partisan issue mr inhofe and others ignore the fact that both presidents bush made deep cuts in the arsenal through negotiations with the russians and unilateral reductions in the hedge right now , the united states is on track to spend billions of dollars over the next 20 years to modernize and replace its aging nuclear delivery systems submarines , intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers reducing the arsenal will make it easier to rein in that bloated budget and shift resources to more critical needs president obama helped drive up those costs when he promised to spend 88 billion over 10 years on the nuclear weapons labs to win republican support for the last treaty he began paring back last month when he delayed funding for a new plutonium facility and for a new class of nuclear submarines more and deeper cuts are needed senator tom coburn is one of the few republicans who argue that the country does not need and cannot afford its huge arsenal he has come up with a plan to save 79 billion over the next 10 years , including reducing the number of deployed strategic warheads to 1 , 220 cutting the intercontinental ballistic missile force to 300 from 500 trimming the hedge and eliminating three of 14 ballistic nuclear submarines he also favors delaying the purchase of new bombers until the mid2020s a nuclear implementation review may sound arcane , and arms control talks may sound like a coldwar anachronism they are not this is president obama s opportunity to reshape the postcoldwar world to make it fundamentally safer he needs to seize it
8 22 pm updated hostess brands , known for sweet treats like twinkies and ding dongs , is back in chapter 11 the company went from cream filling to bankruptcy filing on wednesday , just three years after emerging from an earlier restructuring the company has been struggling under the weight of an 860 million debt load and soaring expenses tied to its labor force hostess has up to 100 , 000 creditors , chief among them labor unions and pension funds that represent the company s employees , according to the chapter 11 petition filed in united states bankruptcy court in new york we remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement that will allow us to amend our labor contracts so that we can emerge from chapter 11 as a highly competitive company that provides secure jobs for our employees , the company s president and chief executive , brian j driscoll , said in a statement if the company is unable to reach a new labor deal , hostess said it would ask the bankruptcy court to halt the existing agreement but those with sweettooths across the country need not fret hostess said its return to bankruptcy would not disrupt the company s sale of baked goods and executives are optimistic that , as it did last time around , hostess will climb out of bankruptcy with generations of loyal consumers , numerous iconic products and a talented and experienced work force , hostess brands has tremendous inherent strengths to build upon , mr driscoll said hostess , a privately held company based in irving , tex , has built an expansive list of products over the decades , perhaps none more craved than twinkies in addition , the company makes wonder and nature s pride bread , drake s snack cakes and other wellknown brands twinkies , the creamfilled sponge cakes , have been a guilty pleasure for decades jimmy dewar , the creator of the tasty treat , once remarked twinkies was the best darntootin' idea i ever had but over the last several years , concerns grew that the baked goods might outlive the 82year old company itself in 2004 , confronted with escalating labor costs and fluctuating prices of flour and other ingredients , the company filed for chapter 11 hostess , then known as the interstate bakeries corporation , completed the restructuring process in february 2009 , when ripplewood holdings , a new york private equity firm , seized control the company faces similar troubles today while it recorded net revenue of about 25 billion in the fiscal year ended may 28 , 2011 , it posted a 341 million net loss burdensome debt and labor costs , compounded by the lingering economic downturn , ultimately prompted the bankruptcy , according to court documents about 80 percent of the company s 19 , 000 employees belong to a dozen separate unions , most notably the international brotherhood of teamsters , and the bakery , confectionery , tobacco workers and grain millers international union , mr driscoll explained in an affidavit attached to the bankruptcy filing in particular , hostess said pension and medical benefits , as well as restrictive work rules , were cutting into profit the company paid about 52 million in workers' compensation claims in the fiscal year ended may 28 , 2011 , the affidavit said management sought cuts , but never sealed a deal with the unions competitors , mr driscoll said , have lighter labor restrictions for hostess to achieve longterm viability , he said , it must achieve dramatic change to their labor agreements the unions have moved to blunt some of the contentions , calling on hostess executives to make their own compensation concessions our members have already given at the well , and this time it will take sacrifices among all parties management , lenders , equity holders and employees to restructure hostess into a viable enterprise that is well positioned for future growth , dennis raymond , director of the teamsters bakery and laundry conference , said in the statement hostess acknowledged that its business model was in need of a shakeup mr driscoll outlined plans to overhaul the company , with an eye toward ultimately breaking free of the bankruptcy process the company , he said , aims to reduce its heavy debt load , obtain new capital investments to update its production and withdraw completely from multiemployer pension plans to achieve relief from the crippling costs of these plans with these changes , we can access capital to reinvest in our company again and begin to level the playing field with our competitors , mr driscoll said in the company statement perella weinberg partners is serving as a financial adviser to hostess , while jones day is its law firm , according to the chapter 11 filing in 2010 , the company hired goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase to explore a possible sale to hershey , pepperidge farm and private equity companies , including blackstone but the potential suitors balked for now , hostess has secured bankruptcy financing of up to 75 million from a group of lenders led by silver point finance , according to the filing that will allow the company to continue operating its bakeries and 570 bakery outlet stores extending the already long shelf life of twinkies this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo hostess , the maker of breads and snacks , filed for bankruptcy citing debt of 860 million

if you regularly hang out around schools or colleges , you might have noticed that this is , by presidential proclamation , constitution week , and that monday was constitution day at least you might have noticed something special about monday that s because back in 2004 , senator robert byrd , the late constitutiontoting and quoting democrat from west virginia , got an amendment added to the federal law that designates sept 17 , the day in 1787 when the delegates in philadelphia signed the constitution , as constitution day the byrd amendment requires that each educational institution that receives federal funds for a fiscal year shall hold an educational program on the united states constitution on sept 17 of such year for the students served by the educational institution \( if sept 17 falls on a weekend or , as it did this year , on a religious holiday , the law permits holding the constitution day observance during the preceding or following week \) the department of education s followup regulation warns that the amendment applies to all educational institutions receiving federal funding , not only those receiving federal funding from the department in other words , a grant from the national institutes of health or the national endowment for the humanities also carries the obligation to observe constitution day and all such grants are implicitly at risk of being forfeited by any school , college or university that chooses to spend its sept 17 doing something else so here s my question has the supreme court s recent decision in the affordable care act case made constitution day unconstitutional \? while upholding the health care law s individual mandate , the court invalidated the statute s carrotandstick approach to inducing the states to extend medicaid eligibility to millions of the nearpoor as with constitution day , congress enacted the medicaid portion of the affordable care act under its spending clause authority , the power granted congress by article i to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states federal largesse often comes with strings attached take it or leave it in the affordable care act , the congressional offer to the states was this agree to expand the categories of people whose medical expenses are covered by the federalstate medicaid program , and the federal government will pay almost all the additional cost decline to expand , and risk losing all your existing federal medicaid money \( more than 20 percent of the average state s entire budget \) it is a gun to the head , chief justice john g roberts jr declared in his opinion congress may use its spending power to create incentives for states to act in accordance with federal policies , the chief justice wrote but when pressure turns into compulsion , the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism the vote was 7 to 2 what does this have to do with constitution day \? in contrast to the affordable care act , the threat of forfeited funds is only implicit and the byrd amendment lacks an enforcement mechanism for its implied threat and the potential consequences appear less dire , too after all , would the government really zero out a major university s federally supported research budget for lack of a constitution day program \? probably not but , on the other hand , it s also far from clear that the secretary of health and human services would have actually have tried to recoup the entire federal portion of a recalcitrant state s medicaid budget such a drastic action would have been subject to challenge as arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act , leading to perhaps years of litigation if the penalty provision was a gun to the head , it s not at all certain that anyone would actually have pulled the trigger consequently , the medicaid portion of the health care decision seems at least premature , if not gratuitous it s a mystery why it drew the support of two members of the court s liberal bloc , justices stephen g breyer and elena kagan possibly they were providing cover , or at least moral support , to the chief justice on his unsteady journey in the health care case away from his usual allies and out of his comfort zone possibly justice kagan harbors a dislike of heavyhanded spending clause bargains stemming from her days as dean of harvard law school along with many other law schools , harvard supported a suit against the defense department over the solomon amendment , a law that threatened to withhold federal money from an entire university if any part of the university , such as a law school , failed to provide equal access to military recruiters in 2006 , the supreme court rejected the challenge in an 80 opinion by chief justice roberts quoting the court s language from an earlier spending clause case , the chief justice said , congress is free to attach reasonable and unambiguous conditions to federal financial assistance that educational institutions are not obligated to accept the fact is no one really knows what the impact of the court s new turn on the spending clause will be the affordable care act decision marked the first time the supreme court had ever invalidated any law enacted under the congressional spending power justice ruth bader ginsburg , in dissent , called the decision all the more unsettling because the case for constitutionality appeared , to her and justice sonia sotomayor , so simple what , exactly , was the problem with the bargain congress attempted to strike with the states \? did it simply go too far and threaten too much \? if so , when considering the next case , how far would be too far \? how close a connection must there be between the desired behavior honor the constitution and the threat lose your federal money \? or perhaps the court is telling us that a more fundamental reappraisal is in progress , a turn away from the modern assumption that congress can pretty much attach any string , as long as the condition itself is not unconstitutional \? certainly the current court has placed congressional authority under an unfriendly microscope there were , after all , five votes to strike down the health care law on commerce clause grounds in any event , the court s spending clause jurisprudence , once perfectly clear , is now a muddle before the spending clause issue arose , constitution day came under occasional academic fire for freespeechrelated reasons compelled patriotism in violation of academic freedom , professor kent greenfield of boston college law school argued in an oped essay in the times a year ago but first amendment complaints have never gained traction , because a requirement to observe constitution day is far from a requirement to say anything in particular an internet search shows that schools programming includes everything from a public reading of the constitution to a classroom debate over the constitutionality of the byrd amendment itself some programs seem perfunctory , and others quite creative , like purdue university s inclusion of banned and censored books as part of a display intended to get students thinking about the first amendment there is a wealth of teaching material online that classroom teachers can use to impart some basic civics to their students , not a bad thing now that civics education has withered one day a year of civics is surely better than none \( the icivics web site , founded by the retired justice sandra day o connor as part of her effort to reintroduce civics education into the curriculum , has a particularly robust set of offerings for younger children \) my friend sanford levinson , a law professor at the university of texas , is well known for his lovehate relationship to the constitution , which has led him to write such books as our undemocratic constitution where the constitution goes wrong \( and how we the people can correct it \) i asked sandy for his thoughts about constitution day he said that when he is asked to speak at a sept 17 observance , he starts by raising the question of the byrd amendment s constitutionality he then goes on to say that he would be troubled if schools were required truly to celebrate the constitution but , he tells his audience , my own presence testifies to the possibility that it is enough to discuss it , albeit critically

american electric power , one of the country s largest utilities , gave 1 million last november to the founding fund , a new taxexempt group that intends to raise most of its money from corporations and push for limited government the giant insurer aetna directed more than 3 million last year to the , a republicanleaning nonprofit organization that has spent millions of dollars attacking lawmakers who voted for president obama s health care bill even as aetna s president publicly voiced support for the legislation other corporations , including prudential financial , dow chemical and the drugmaker merck , have poured millions of dollars more into the us chamber of commerce , a taxexempt trade group that has pledged to spend at least 50 million on political advertising this election cycle two years after the supreme court s citizens united decision opened the door for corporate spending on elections , relatively little money has flowed from company treasuries into , which can accept unlimited contributions but must also disclose donors instead , there is growing evidence that large corporations are trying to influence campaigns by donating money to taxexempt organizations that can spend millions of dollars without being subject to the disclosure requirements that apply to candidates , parties and pacs the secrecy shrouding these groups makes a full accounting of corporate influence on the electoral process impossible but glimpses of their donors emerged in a new york times review of corporate governance reports , tax returns of nonprofit organizations and regulatory filings by insurers and labor unions the review found that corporate donations many of them previously unreported went to groups large and small , dedicated to shaping public policy on the state and national levels from a redistricting fight in minnesota to the sprawling battleground of the 2012 presidential and congressional elections , corporations are opening their wallets and altering the political world some of the biggest recipients of corporate money are organized under section 501 \( c \) \( 4 \) of the tax code , the federal designation for social welfare groups dedicated to advancing broad community interests because they are not technically political organizations , they do not have to register with or disclose their donors to the federal election commission , potentially shielding corporate contributors from shareholders or others unhappy with their political positions companies want to be able to quietly push for their political agendas without being held accountable for it by their customers , said melanie sloan , executive director of , which has filed complaints against issue groups i think the 501 \( c \) \( 4 \) s are likely to outweigh super pac spending , because so many donors want to remain anonymous because social welfare groups are prohibited from devoting themselves primarily to political activity , many spend the bulk of their money on issue advertisements that purport to be educational , not political , in nature in may , for example , , a group cofounded by the republican strategist karl rove , began a 25 million advertising campaign , carefully shaped with focus groups of undecided voters , that attacks mr obama for increasing the federal deficit and urges him to cut spending the internal revenue service has no clear test for determining what constitutes excessive political activity by a social welfare group and taxexempt groups are permitted to begin raising and spending money even before the irs formally recognizes them two years after helping republicans win control of the house with millions of dollars in issue advertising , crossroads gps s application for taxexempt status is still pending during the 2010 midterm elections , taxexempt groups outspent super pacs by a 3to2 margin , according to a recent study by the and the , with most of that money devoted to attacking democrats or defending republicans and such groups have accounted for twothirds of the political advertising bought by the biggest outside spenders so far in the 2012 election cycle , according to kantar media s , with close to 100 million in issue ads the growing role of issue groups has prompted a rash of complaints and lawsuits from watchdog organizations accusing groups like the american action network , crossroads and the proobama of operating as sham charities whose primary purpose is not the promotion of social welfare , but winning elections efforts in congress to force more disclosure for politically active nonprofit organizations have been repeatedly stymied by republicans , who have described the push as an assault on free speech these groups are being used as a conduit to hide from voters the identity of people and corporations who are bankrolling these television ads , which are designed to influence the outcome of elections , said representative chris van hollen , democrat of maryland but jonathan collegio , a spokesman for crossroads , said , individuals and organizations have a first amendment right to promote their beliefs through advertising , be that advertising against the iraq war , against or , in the case of crossroads , advocating for free markets and limited government labor unions themselves among the beneficiaries of citizens united have also donated millions of dollars to national super pacs and statelevel nonprofit groups involved in battles over government spending , collective bargaining and health care donations from corporations and unions alike must be disclosed if they go to expressly political groups like super pacs in april , for example , the air traffic controllers' union contributed 1 million to a proobama super pac but other contributions are harder to trace last year , the american federation of state , county and municipal employees gave 100 , 000 to advancing wisconsin , a taxexempt group that supported labor s fight with republicans in that state the donation was reported nowhere in wisconsin , but it emerged in an annual financial report that unions must file with the federal department of labor among the largest beneficiaries of corporate donations in recent years have been trade organizations like the us chamber of commerce , which largely backs republican candidates as a nonprofit business league under the tax code , the chamber does not have to disclose its supporters , who helped finance its 33 million in political ads in the 2010 midterm elections but voluntary disclosures by corporations usually at the prodding of shareholder advocacy groups shed some light on the use of trade groups for lobbying or as passthroughs for political spending a search of voluntary disclosures , some collected by the , which advocates for transparency in corporate political spending , found more than 6 million in chamber donations by 10 companies last year two of the largest came from prudential financial and dow chemical , which each gave 16 million , while chevron , metlife and merck each gave at least 500 , 000 some of the donations were directed to the chamber s institute for legal reform , which lobbies for limits on liability suits some contributions are disclosed by accident aetna s check to the american action network , along with a 45 million contribution last year to the chamber , was mistakenly included in a filing with insurance regulators the disclosure was first reported by snl financial , a trade publication even where companies pledge voluntary disclosure of political contributions , they often make an exception for donations to taxexempt groups in 2007 , aetna signed an agreement with the mercy investment program , a shareholders group , to disclose trade associations to which it made large contributions on regulatory filings , the company initially described its 3 million contribution to the chamber of commerce as a lobbying expense , but the company now says it was intended to finance educational activities an aetna spokesman would not say whether the chamber donation would appear on the company s 2011 voluntary disclosure sister valerie heinonen , the director of shareholder advocacy for mercy investment services , said that a failure to do so would violate the company s pledge beyond the contributions to large , established nonprofits like the chamber and american action network , corporate money is also quietly shaping the political discourse through more obscure groups , none of which are required to disclose their donors in minnesota last year , express scripts , a major drug benefit manager , gave 10 , 000 to a republicanlinked group , minnesotans for a fair redistricting , involved in a partisan fight over redrawing legislative boundaries express scripts made the donation , previously unreported , because the electoral maps in minnesota were in doubt and we supported efforts to bring certainty to minnesota voters , said brian henry , a spokesman for the company , which is based in st louis he added that the firm has a facility in bloomington , minn the reasons behind american electric power s 1 million contribution to the littleknown founding fund are less clear the company characterized it as lobbying in a corporate governance disclosure last year , but the fund says it does no lobbying the fund , whose address is a mail drop in alexandria , va , would not make any of its directors available for an interview the fund s treasurer , frank sadler , is a lobbyist who previously worked for koch industries advising nonprofit groups that support free market causes , although he said the kochs , major republican donors , were not involved in the group in its public filings , the fund said it expected to raise about 10 million this election cycle , primarily from corporations , and use it to promote free markets and the narrowing of the scope and reach of the federal government a spokesman for american electric power , pat d hemlepp , said the company supports organizations with positions on issues that align with aep s positions and strives to be transparent on political giving we also respect the positions of others , including some of the organizations that receive funding from aep , to not publicly disclose funding or activities that s their right under the law
no one ever said running a marathon is easy that s kind of the whole point but not all marathons are created equal either chicago s is famously flat all the way through boston s is largely downhill \( tough on the quads \) except for one spurt that features the notorious heartbreak hill around the 20mile mark san francisco s starts and ends easy but most of the race is as hilly as , well , as the streets of san francisco but new york offers a unique set of challenges \( this year , of course , in the aftermath of the devastation wrought by sandy , the biggest one for many runners will be getting to new york and then to the starting line in staten island \) the chaotic and crowded charge up the incline of the verrazanonarrows bridge is renowned , as is the exhausting push over the 59th street bridge that leaves successful runners feeling groovy only if they make it to the cheering crowds on the flats of first avenue however , while those bridges get the attention , the end of the course trips up marathoners with lesserknown obstacles the willis avenue bridge into the bronx and the 138th street bridge back into manhattan have much smaller inclines but they come at miles 20 and 21 , when many runners hit the proverbial wall additionally , dan schorr , founder of start2finish marketing , said the bridges have awful footing and they are sandwiched by the time in the bronx , which is a dead zone in terms of crowd support much , worse , however , is the much steeper hill awaiting runners at fifth avenue at mile 23 , which is followed by several small downhills and uphills in and around central park that tax the body and the psyche just as the last drops of energy drain away matthew corcoran , an english professor at york college who has run marathons in boston , duluth and pittsburgh , said the hills at the end are a problem only if you set too fast a pace early , but he adds that it used to be worse when runners entered central park off fifth avenue closer to 100th street than 90th and faced an even steeper hill but for firsttimers especially , the hills provide a nasty surprise the week before my first marathon i ran the course s last 10 miles with a group and thought to myself , this isn t so bad , said david schwartzberg , an attorney whose rookie run in new york was in 2010 but of course i didn t appreciate how tired i d be at that point in the marathon , after coming over the 59th street bridge schwartzberg , who has since run the boston marathon as well , says heartbreak hill isn t so bad because runners brace themselves for it and can coast a bit afterward that s what he thought would happen in new york once he reached first avenue when i was on the bridge during the race i said to myself , if i can make it over the bridge those last 10 miles won t be so bad i just didn t realize what i was in for those inclines at the end aren t as big but they felt brutal schorr , who has run chicago s flat , welcoming course , sees this course as a metaphor for new york it s very midwestern while this is typical in that new york just keeps throwing things at you , he says physically , of course , the final miles are draining but schorr says it s just as difficult psychologically those small hills would be one thing at mile 12 but at mile 25 you feel like , here we go again , he said then , he said , when you re in central park you can hear the announcer and the crowd cheering so you think you re almost done but you re not and then you come out onto central park south and see columbus circle but there s still more to come the last twotenths of a mile feels like another mile , schwartzberg said , adding that while the crowd support helps , it s disconcerting because you don t recognize any landmarks with all those people surrounding you still , corcoran said , none of that is as unnerving psychologically as the marathon he once ran in the poconos , where there were constant hills , no spectators and , for much of the race , not even any aid stations , just a state trooper stationed every few miles one state trooper said to me , if you don t think you can finish , well , there s no one who s going to come get you out of here , he recalled the rest of the way i only saw wild animals
on friday , we began to see reasonably clear signs that president obama would receive some kind of bounce in the polls from the democratic convention mr obama had another strong day in the polls on saturday , making further gains in each of four national tracking polls the question now is not whether mr obama will get a bounce in the polls , but how substantial it will be some of the data , in fact , suggests that the conventions may have changed the composition of the race , making mr obama a reasonably clear favorite as we enter the stretch run of the campaign on saturday , mr obama extended his advantage to three points from two points in the gallup national tracking poll , and to four points from two in an online survey conducted by ipsos he pulled ahead of mitt romney by two points in the rasmussen reports tracking poll , reversing a onepoint deficit in the edition of the poll published on friday a fourth tracking poll , conducted online by the rand corporation s american life panel , had mr obama three percentage points ahead of mr romney in the survey it published early saturday morning the candidates had been virtually tied in the poll on friday \( the rand survey has an interesting methodology we ll explore it more in a separate post \) the gains that mr obama has made in these tracking polls over the past 48 hours already appear to match or exceed the ones that mr romney made after his convention the odds , however , are that mr obama has some further room to grow the reason is that the tracking polls are not turned around instantaneously the gallup poll , for instance , now consists of interviews conducted between saturday , sept 1 , and friday , sept 7 that means that many of the interviews in the poll still predate the effective start of the democratic convention on tuesday night that mr obama has made these gains in polls that only partially reflect the democratic convention suggests that his bounce could be more substantial once they fully do so mathematically , mr obama has to have been running well ahead of mr romney in the most recent interviews in these surveys to have made up for middling data earlier in the week in fact , it is possible to reverseengineer an estimate of what mr obama s numbers look like in the postconvention part of the tracking surveys specifically , i will be looking to infer mr obama s numbers from interviews conducted after bill clinton s speech on wednesday night , which in my view was the pivotal moment of the convention let s use the gallup tracking poll as an example mr obama now leads in that survey by four percentage points conversely , he led by one point in the version of the poll published on wednesday afternoon , ahead of mr clinton s speech what must mr obama s numbers have looked like in the interviews since the clinton speech in order for him to make those gains \? this can be determined with a little algebra if we know what percentage of the interviews in the gallup survey reflect postclinton data fortunately , this calculation is fairly straightforward gallup s tracking poll is reported over a sevenday window , and roughly the same number of people are polled each day the interviews gallup conducted on saturday , sept 1 , and then on sunday , monday , and tuesday , predated the clinton speech the interviews it conducted on thursday and friday postdated it the only day about which there is any ambiguity is wednesday itself but , since mr clinton s speech was made late wednesday night , only a small fraction of the respondents in the poll would have had the chance to watch it by the time that gallup called them probably just the last round or so of interviews that gallup conducted on the west coast \( we ll assume that 20 percent of the wednesday interviews did reflect mr clinton s speech , although the fraction was probably a little lower than that in practice \) over all , that means that only about 30 percent of the data from the gallup poll postdated mr clinton s remarks if you do the math , it implies that mr obama must have been leading mr romney by 10 or 11 points in the minority of the poll conducted since mr clinton s speech for him to have gained three points in the survey over all in the table below , i ve run through the same calculation for the other tracking polls the results imply that mr obama has run about nine points ahead of mr romney in the portion of the ipsos poll conducted since mr clinton s speech , about eight points ahead in the rand poll , and about four points ahead in the rasmussen poll on average between the four polls , it appears that mr obama must have held about an eightpoint lead since mr clinton s speech in order to have gained so much ground so quickly this method is not perfect the only way we would know exactly how well mr obama had been doing is if the polling firms published daybyday results , which none of them do but on friday , i wrote that mr obama might eventually hold about a fivepoint lead over mr romney once the tracking polls fully rolled over to postconvention data now it looks like his advantage could potentially be a bit larger than that , depending on how long the bounce holds despite a mediocre jobs report on friday , there were no signs in the polls that mr obama s bounce had immediately receded , as he gained further ground in the surveys that were released on saturday earlier in the week of the convention , before there was any data on the magnitude of mr obama s bounce , i used a series of golf metaphors to serve as a guide to interpreting the postconvention numbers by that nomenclature , it now appears that mr obama is on track for a birdie convention , meaning that he would exit the conventions in a somewhat stronger position than where he entered them the equivalent of a par score remains a possibility if mr obama s numbers cool off a bit , which they very well may , although that would be better than mr romney s bogey  but there is also the possibility of an eagle , with mr obama holding as much as an eight to ninepoint lead over mr romney in the polls once they fully reflect postconvention data his polls seem to have been about that strong since mr clinton s speech , at least again , this is just the upside case for mr obama not the reality yet but the fact that it seems plausible is a bit surprising to me very little has moved the polls much all this year including mr romney s convention and his choice of paul d ryan as his running mate , events that typically produce bounces but mr obama has already made clear gains in the polls in surveys that only partially reflect his convention as surprising as it might be , however , i do not see how you can interpret it as anything other than a good sign for mr obama all elections have turning points perhaps mr obama simply has the more persuasive pitch to voters , and the conventions were the first time when this became readily apparent polls conducted after the incumbent party s convention typically inflate the standing of the incumbent by a couple of points , but not usually by more than that otherwise , they have predicted the eventual election outcome reasonably well since 1968 , the largest postconvention polling deficit that a challenger overcame to win the race was in 2000 , when george w bush trailed al gore by about four points after the democratic convention but won the electoral college although mr bush lost the popular vote and unlike mr bush , who at least led in the polls after his own convention that year , mr romney did not , essentially only bringing the race to a tie in polls conducted early in the week of his convention in fact , mr romney has never held a lead over mr obama by any substantive margin in the polls the real clear politics average of polls put mr romney ahead by a fraction of a percentage point at one point in october 2011 , and he pulled into an exact tie at one point late in the week of his convention , after it was over , but he has never done better than that that makes this an extremely odd election you would figure that at some point over the past year , mr romney would have pulled into the lead in the polls , given how close it has usually been john mccain held occasional leads in 2008 john kerry led for much of the summer in 2004 and michael dukakis had moments where he was well ahead of george hw bush in the spring and summer of 1988 but mr romney , if there have been moments when his polls were eversoslightly stronger or weaker , has never really had his moment in the sun instead , the cases where one candidate led essentially from wire to wire have been associated with landslides bill clinton in 1996 , ronald reagan in 1984 , richard nixon in 1972 and dwight d eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 there is almost no chance that mr obama will win by those sort of margins but this nevertheless seems like an inauspicious sign for mr romney if even at his highwater mark , he can only pull the race into a rough tie , what pitch can he come up with in october or november to suddenly put him over the top \? conservatives sometimes cite ronald reagan s win in 1980 as a favorable precedent for mr romney , because the polls showed him in a tight race with jimmy carter in october and early november , 1980 nevertheless , mr reagan had shown much clearer signs of upside potential earlier in the race most conspicuously , in leading mr carter by nearly 30 points after the republican convention in detroit because of demographic changes , the republican base is probably just a bit too narrow to win the election for mr romney on its own , even with a strong republican turnout certainly , mr romney will win his fair share of independent voters because of the economy and if there are substantive signs of economic decline in october and november , probably enough to win him the election but unless there is some change of course , it looks increasingly as though he lacks the appeal to the voting blocks that might allow him to win 51 percent of the vote rather than 49 percent mr romney s tenure at bain capital and his opposition to the auto bailouts may be a negative with the reagan democrats of the midwest his conservative stances on immigration will likely prevent him from having george w bush s comparative appeal among hispanic voters he is mostly playing defense among the socalled security moms with whom mr bush performed fairly well in 2004 , having largely sidestepped discussions of national security highly educated voters who are moderate on social policy but conservative on fiscal policy might be a natural constituency for mr romney , and they were critical to his election as governor in massachusetts in 2002 but mr romney has rarely broken from the republican orthodoxy on social issues by contrast , it was democrats who were much more forthright about touting their support for abortion rights , gay rights , and less rigid immigration policy at their convention in charlotte , nc i will acknowledge that there is the risk of jumping the gun with this analysis our forecast model began to see mr romney s subpar convention bounce as a bearish indicator for him early during his convention week now that mr obama appears to be making gains when mr romney did not , it has become more entrenched in seeing mr obama as the favorite enough so that it now gives him almost a 4in5 chance of victory taking the temperature of voters around the party conventions is tricky it is a period when a lot of undecided voters start to tune in for the first time , but it is also associated with volatile polling every election is different , and no statistical method to analyze them is beyond reproach but in the immediate term , it seems like the upside case for mr romney is that mr obama s polls cool off quickly and soon revert to where they were before the conventions , with mr obama about two points ahead in the polling average that s certainly a very winnable election for mr romney , but nevertheless one where he is the modest underdog and mr romney s downside case is that mr obama s polling bounce will be a little stickier , and that mr obama will already be fairly close to having achieved 50 percent of the vote with precious few undecided voters left in the race that would make mr romney a clear underdog perhaps even one who needs some foreign policy or economic crisis to intervene to give him much of a chance at winning
brad richards s lastgasp goal in regulation , marc staal s overtime slap shot , henrik lundqvist s thirdperiod save on a breakaway that tipped the crossbar those were the indelible images from one of the most thrilling victories in history , a 32 triumph over the in game 5 on monday night at madison square garden none of them , perhaps , would have mattered if not for anton stralman you always look at one thing that ends up winning the game , but there were a number of things behind it that were important , coach john tortorella said tuesday how does a stralman , 25yearold swedish journeyman defenseman who failed to stick with the lowly toronto maple leafs and columbus blue jackets , who started the season as a tryout in the devils' training camp , who earned tortorella s disdain for not competing hard enough , wind up playing an important role in the stanley cup playoffs \? it s my first playoff , stralman said tuesday before the rangers departed for washington seeking to clinch the series on wednesday night i'm just trying to take it all in and enjoy it as much as i can stralman opened the scoring monday , patiently waiting for a shotblocking washington forward to slide by , then slipping down the boards and firing the puck through a maze of legs and into the net the goal was all the rangers had to show for a 174 firstperiod shooting advantage the goal was lost in all the electrifying moments later , but it was stralman s third of the playoffs \( the other two were also gameopeners , in losses to ottawa \) that gave him the lead among defensemen , even though he averaged only 17 minutes 7 seconds of ice time a game of the 42 defensemen to have scored at least once in these playoffs , only four averaged less ice time than stralman staal , ryan mcdonagh , dan girardi , michael del zotto the top four defensemen have all had their glorious moments staal s came monday , a big drive that nicked off center brooks laich and sailed into the net 1 35 into overtime , sparking pandemonium stralman , though , played a pivotal role in the winning shot stralman called the switch on the draw , staal said , meaning that just before the faceoff , staal , a lefthanded shot , was on the left side of the circle and stralman , a righthander , was on the right stralman told staal to switch places to a more unorthodox setup , and it worked when john mitchell won the draw , staal was in position to fire from a more straightahead angle that provided more of a screen and allowed for a more unpredictable and dangerous deflection not a bad bit of strategy from a player nobody wanted last summer , i was just sitting and waiting for a long , long time , just sitting and waiting , past july 1st , stralman said i told my agent , let s look into europe , ' but then the devils came with a tryout offer stralman spent september in the devils' training camp they wanted to keep him but were hamstrung with salarycap issues and told him to stand by during that time , the rangers came in and showed interest , and we worked out a deal , stralman said i jumped on that train , and i'm very happy i did stralman signed on nov 3 and played 53 games , with 2 goals , 16 assists and a respectable plus9 mark late in the season , he sat out six games because , tortorella said , he needed to compete harder that was the inconsistent part of his game since stralman s return , tortorella said , he s been consistent defensively and offensively and a really good competitor for us stralman said coming in here i knew i had to change my game i was i was all offense and zero defense before but along the way , i kind of lost the offensive part of it i just never had the puck it s been a bit of a struggle and a lot of frustration , trying to find that offensive game but it s coming along , though i got scratched there , talked to john , and i put my mind into it stralman never thought in a million years that he would go from being a devils tryout to a ranger playing deep into the playoffs now he will face the devils again , with a berth in the stanley cup finals at stake asked about that possibility before the devils won , 31 , on tuesday night , stralman said , that would be a little ironic slap shot benny ercolani , the nhl s longtime chief statistician , confirmed tuesday that brad richards s tying goal came with 76 seconds left in the third period , not 66 seconds , as was widely reported the official time of the goal was changed to 19 52 from 19 53
the glove i took to spring training in 1962 , hooked through the handle of my portable manual typewriter , saw service only once , which was enough early one morning in st petersburg , fla , while the scrubs were batting against a hungover bullpen coach , i slipped into right field and settled under what broadcasters call an easy soft fly it exploded in my hand my palm still stings at the memory i hung up my glove that day , having survived the revelation that professional athletes were a different species , even if they were the hasbeens , hardlyables and neverwillbes stocking an empty shelf on its way to becoming one of the worst baseball teams of all time it s a lesson that has lasted 50 years , since the were new and america felt good about itself there was room for a lovable loser in sports in those heady days of jfk s camelot , the peace corps and john glenn orbiting the earth we could take a joke then america was flexing its muscles , shaking off its '50s flab as surely as wintersodden ballplayers were groaning their way into shape for a fresh season among the mets acquired in the expansion draft because they were considered past their prime or otherwise expendable were some star players , including frank thomas , a threetime allstar slugger at pittsburgh gus bell , a fourtime allstar at cincinnati and the onetime phillies whiz kid richie ashburn , a former batting champion with a 308 career average alas , there were more critical numbers the three made up an outfield with 19 children and a combined age of 102 while most of the reporters , including me , saw this as further proof of the mets' inevitable haplessness \( why else would i have taken my glove \? \) , my best friend on the team , jay hook , saw stars he was , like me , a 24yearold college boy , but he was also a real prospect , expected to become one of the club s starting pitchers i was optimistic that spring , i was optimistic for years , he told me recently from his farm in northern michigan the beauty of baseball is that it s a new game every day i never thought we were that bad there were some pretty good guys on the team , especially the old dodgers although they also tended to skew old , veteran valiants like roger craig , clem labine , charlie neal , don zimmer , gil hodges and cookie lavagetto gave the mets a patina of respectability , if not nostalgia , perhaps none more than the former dodgers player and manager casey stengel hiring stengel was a stroke of promotional genius he had won 10 pennants and 7 world series with the yankees he was considered a brilliant tactician , ruthlessly shuffling players he was endlessly quotable he had been fired after the 1960 season for having grown old upon taking the mets job , in a sly nod to his age , 71 , and a civil warera baseball team , he said , it s a great honor to be joining the knickerbockers cranky , smart , mean , compassionate , profane , hilarious , stengel was the show s leading man he was up early , instructing the younger players on life \( get yourself in shape now , you can drink during the season \) and hitting \( he who stands up to bat is all right he who sticks his fanny out is n't worth a road apple \) while bantering with fans and holding a running news conference the nutty language called stengelese \( so this here fella on second base , let me tell you he was not as horseapple as he was in kankakee , which was amazing for a lefthanded dentist , which i did not get to be \) was a construct of bigtime columnists parachuting into camp for 15 minutes with the ol' perfesser heard in their entirety , his hourslong monologues made perfect sense i spent many nights in the hotel bar , at his elbow , absorbing his intricate , though coherent \( if you were there from the beginning , that is \) theories of platooning and pinchhitting and his ribald reminiscences of players he managed , especially joe dimaggio , whom he did not like and referred to by an italian slur even for his time , stengel was not politically correct once , acting on a tip that guests at the colonial inn , where we were all staying , had complained about africanamerican ballplayers in the hotel pool , i asked stengel if that was the reason he barred the mets from swimming thass right , pool s off limits , he growled , pushing his pleated , leathery mug into my face he also said in a salty way that they could not have sex all season he added , now print that a few days later , with a straight face , he introduced his two worst rookies to the press as the future face of the franchise their fame was affirmed in the next day s issues of the seven daily new york city newspapers the youngsters were soon cut and never heard from again it was recognizable stengel cruel to players , contemptuous of the news media he could also be incredibly kind , particularly sensitive to the disabled he would unselfconsciously offer up his seamed face to the questioning fingers of blind fans and trot up the grandstand on his bandy legs to patiently chat with people in wheelchairs once , while i was talking to stengel , a middleaged man approached , dragging a sullen teenager this was clearly a troubled son and dad the man claimed to have played for stengel years ago in the minors stengel took his time , regaled them with tales of the father s prowess and promised the kid a mets contract if he got as good as his old man as they left with arms around each other , stengel rolled his eyes at me and shrugged he had no memory of the man stengel was true to himself in his fashion , never more than when he would say , after another losing mets performance , the attendance and mrs payson got robbed the team s owner , mrs joan whitney payson , one of the country s richest women , had been the beneficiary of a power elite baseball coup then as now , there was a shady side to the mets in the late '50s , branch rickey , who had integrated the game in 1947 with jackie robinson in brooklyn , and william a shea , a politically wired manhattan lawyer , concocted the threat of a rival , the continental league , to squeezeplay baseball into returning the national league to new york since 1957 , when the dodgers and the giants went west , new york had felt baseballdeprived , none more so perhaps than mrs payson , who had owned a piece of the giants and pined for willie mays \( she bought him for the mets embarrassingly late in his career \) the new owner installed her stockbroker , m donald grant , as chairman of the board grant was no bernie madoff , to be sure , but imperial enough he would swagger through the clubhouse lining up ballplayers so mrs payson , regally dotty under a floppy garden club hat , could review them like the queen mum trooping the household cavalry she trilled over them , offering a gloved hand , as grant hovered grant seemed to have attended that first spring training in 1962 primarily to get massages in the trainers' room actually , this fit with the more relaxed mood of that day the news media had almost total access to the clubhouse and to miller huggins field eavesdropping on players took no skill at all i remember how a lighthitting utility infielder named ted lepcio , who had played 10 years for five clubs , liked to rank on richie ashburn he followed him around the field one day , saying , tell them how i was your bat boy in utica , richie at first , ashburn pretended not to hear him , but lepcio would n't let up he raised his voice bunch of cocky rookies in utica in 1945 , and i was the bat boy ashburn , a most amiable man , must have suddenly felt his age because he wheeled on lepcio and snapped , you were a lousy bat boy lepcio was released before the season began ashburn hit 306 for the mets that season , then went on to a brilliant broadcasting career and the hall of fame in the relaxed atmosphere of 1962 , miller huggins field was often swarming with mad men in buttondown shirts , rep ties and harris tweed jackets overseeing the making of commercials we want to have our product associated with symbols of acceptance , said a man from the advertising agency representing viceroy cigarettes he gestured at gil hodges , posing for 750 if hodges smokes viceroy , it might do something for you , too it seems almost churlish now to add that the laconic , stoical hodges died after his second heart attack , at 47 he should be better remembered as the gifted pillar at first base \( so strong , said stengel , he could tear your ear brows off \) who managed the mets to the world series title stengel , naturally , was also the star of the mad men mets he spent an entire day clutching his stomach in thespian agony before snatching a bromo seltzer out of his locker , gulping it down , then brightening at its doubleplay action the scene had to be shot over and over because stengel clutched too hard and brightened too quickly one of the ad men told me that ballplayers were easy to deal with they 're regimented , so they take orders well , he said and they 're vain they like to see their pictures around town stengel later complained about how hard he worked on his alkaseltzer commercial almost as ubiquitous as the ad men were the walkon mets who believed our stories about how bad this team would be my favorite was a skinny , sallow , roundshouldered 21yearold from astoria named john pappas because the younger sportswriters \( yes , guilty \) were eager for a cinderella story , a mets official , john murphy , finally agreed to talk to him when was the last time you threw a ball \? asked murphy , once a yankees relief pitcher last sunday , in new york , said pappas , looking down at his black , pointytoed shoes murphy smiled triumphantly it snowed in new york last sunday pappas nodded yes , sir but not under the triborough bridge pappas got 18 minutes at a nearby high school field with a fourthstring mets catcher he was wild , and not very fast we were disappointed murphy was kindly he told pappas to go back to school maybe if he were 15 , said murphy , he might have a shot , but he had too much to learn on the drive back to the hotel , pappas told me he would be back he also played the outfield the morning that pappas arrived , glenn orbited the earth , making jay hook the goto guy in the clubhouse the lanky pitcher was an engineering student at northwestern and a member of the national rocket society he provided a playbyplay of the historic ride along with sidebars on propulsion and the problems of reentry but he was a baseball player first roger maris s ability to hit 61 home runs in 1961 , he said , was a more impressive individual achievement than glenn s three orbits of the earth hook told me he expected to do well with the mets because he would finally have a chance to play the previous season , his last with cincinnati , he caught the mumps and mononucleosis and sat out the pennant drive and a world series loss to the yankees this time , hook got his playing time he started and lost the mets' first spring training game , at al lang field against the st louis cardinals there were portents a historian from the hall of fame locked himself in the press box bathroom and missed most of the game when he emerged , he said , now i 've seen everything when the game was over , a fan uttered the mantra of the next seven years same old mets hook and i shared a favorite coach , rogers hornsby , the rajah , considered the greatest righthanded hitter of the century by day , hook pestered hornsby for batting instruction , especially bunting he thought if he could learn to sacrifice , he would n't be lifted for a pinchhitter in the late innings by night , when i was n't at stengel s elbow , i 'd be in the hotel lobby with hornsby lobby sitting was his hobby , according to the baseball register sitting tall , his doublebreasted suit open to starched white shirt and tie , his icy little eyes , supposedly the sharpest in the game , missing nothing he 'd see two young women trolling the lobby and mutter to the players around us , try not to go for bad balls he was a font of personal advice couched in ballspeak he was big on getting a good night s sleep if i do n't get the pitch i want between 7 pm and midnight , he would say , forget it i 'll always get another chance to go to bat a heavyset , 66yearold texan , hornsby was a link to an earlier time in baseball and america he had been pushed out of the game 10 years earlier for such meanspirited behavior , while manager and coach , as punching branch rickey for lecturing him on morality and for urinating on his players in the shower room after a loss the stories were easy to believe , sitting with him as he disparaged city phonies and foreigners as well as most current players he denied being a bigot because , our black people are buried on rogers land in a cemetery right next to ours back home on the ranch in hornsby bend he also warned me against writing about him if i do n't like it , i 'll be on your back so fast you wo n't know what happened like hornsby , the early mets fans were throwbacks , from a time when new york had three teams because spectators could sit close enough in spring training to chitchat with the players , there was no escaping the likes of louis kleppel , a stout , disheveled retired furniture mover in his 60s who had cheered for the giants until they betrayed him and moved you want i should go to candlestick park \? he would bellow the mets are my team now i give them my voice i will support them all the way even after he knew my name and called to me , i tried to avoid kleppel and his claque of senior citizens i did n't realize the depth of the mets' fans' passion until after the end of that first miserable , hilarious season when i found him weeping outside the polo grounds a bunch of sandlotters , those mets , he blubbered if the baloneys of baseball want trash , well , they got it and i 've had it but i found him again outside for the home opener in 1963 he had renewed hope , he said and he never lost it , always coming back , through the bedsheet banner years as the mets beat the yankees in the first mayor s trophy game , as marvelous marv throneberry became the quintessential met , as the 17yearold ed kranepool began his 18year career he followed the team to shea stadium in 1964 , and he was there for the seven years in 9th or 10th place until that amazing 1969 season when the miracle mets won the world series i was actually happy to see him at spring training in 1970 this time , i hurried over when he called the mets will repeat , he boomed you heard it here by that time , my friend hook was a rising manager in the chrysler corporation he had pitched three seasons for the mets , failing in his childhood dream of being a 20game winner \( he lost 19 in his first season as the mets lost 120 \) , but he got credit for the team s first victory \( in its 10th game \) hook and his wife , joan , had decided to get out of baseball in 1964 i was 28 , an average player , and our oldest was just starting school , so the family would n't be able to travel with me , he said also , we did n't make the kind of money current players do , so i thought i better start a career in business it was the right decision hook , who had worked on his master s degree in thermodynamics as a met , was remembered for explaining bernoulli s law , which describes how planes stay aloft and baseballs curve when the diagrams he drew appeared in the new york times , stengel said , if hook could only do what he knows i 've dined off that line for years , hook said recently it has great business implications but the biggest thing i learned from casey that spring was to always take care of my customers i watched the way casey kept you sportswriters entertained so you would write about the team for his customers , the fans hook took care of his customers after chrysler , he rose to senior management positions at rockwell international and masco before retiring to become a professor in northwestern s mba program he always played down his baseball career he thought it would distract people from teaching him what they knew it was only recently , after retiring from academia , that he began reaching out to those who remembered him as a met when he asked me six years ago for a copy of his bernoulli s law story , he said that he did n't want his 13 grandchildren to think he was merely a science geek he understood when i told him that my grandchildren did n't grasp my spring training glove story last month , in new york , with the former mets teammates al jackson and frank thomas , hook attended the baseball writers association of america dinner as part of a mets 50th anniversary celebration he got a big laugh recounting stengel s response to bernoulli s law hook also went to several card shows and awards lunches he sounded excited to have met the tigers' ace , justin verlander , and to have talked baseball with joe girardi , don newcombe and tommy davis he felt reconnected to the game , now and 50 years ago , a prospect again on a brandnew team i 'd forgotten what a good time i had , he said casey was so terrific , he used to play with my kids the fans and sportswriters were nice maybe i'm just getting to the age when the past means more , but i remembered what fun it was being there
had you fallen off the globe for a while and returned this morning to check what sports news you missed , you might think you had not left at all because after months and months , sports earth seems to be spinning in a very tiny circle in fact , you could go take another lap or two of mars and it is likely that we will still be talking about the same things when you get back , that being the saints' bounty scandal and college conference realignment specifically , the way the big east is making the biggest hash of it yes , the big east is still making those sputtering noises in the background of the big conferences' power and money grabs the latest noises come via various reports , , in which villanova , georgetown , st john s , marquette , providence , seton hall and depaul are said to be considering a palace coup the seven basketballcentric colleges could be plotting an open revolt against the league expanding beyond all logical parameters in the name of the almighty football rat race it could be seven proud schools growing a spinal column at last , as , or a delayed reaction to pull themselves out of a sinkhole , as they are left with a set of notfabulous options , and lays out the pros and cons of each , or rather the cons and less cons one possibility seems to be the seven schools forcing a dissolution of the league , keeping the name big east for themselves \( despite two of them being in the midwest \) and the rest becoming the big something else we suggest a gps company as a sponsor and somehow they should try to blame nfl commissioner roger goodell for the fiasco because , well , why not \? goodell remains , after months of proclamations and appeals and the descent of paul tagliabue from mount olympus , the great punching bag in the saints' bounty mess in the latest installment of all bounties , all the time , goodell in the wake of tagliabue s waffling , endured a new round of and learned coach sean payton has reportedly of his reinstatement with goodell , making him one of the few people who still has to play nicely with the commissioner the former defensive coordinator gregg williams needs to do that , too , and now has into the lap of the assistant head coach joe vitt and yes , we are pretty much back where we started no wonder representative elijah e cummings of maryland is ripping the league for he expected progress silly him not that other sports are pushing the evolution envelope all that much either an eyeopening story of a transgender athlete playing women s college basketball at age 50 has been greeted with sophomoric response by an espn radio crew , a spoof by the tennis player caroline wozniacki of serena williams has been blown up into a racial incident , and none of this has anything on south american soccer , where the copa sudamericana championship was decided by a team from argentina after saying it was assaulted by the police that s enough to send anyone back into orbit
the indian government was deeply saddened and the united states government expressed its condolences tuesday after american sailors killed an indian fisherman and injured three others in the persian gulf on monday but the incident has so far sparked none of the recriminations and bickering that followed a feb 15 incident when italian marines on board an oil tanker shot and killed two indian fisherman off the southern coast of india on monday , the rappahannock , a united states navy fuel supply ship , had just passed through the strait of hormuz when it opened fire on a 50foot fishing boat moving toward it , killing one indian and wounding three others the naval security team aboard the resupply ship repeatedly tried to warn the fishing vessel from approaching too close , the navy said in a statement the navy has become concerned about the dangers posed by small vessels after suicide bombers linked to al qaeda used a small boat packed with explosives in october 2000 to blow a hole into the side of the uss cole , a guidedmissile destroyer , while it was in the yemeni port of aden the blast killed 17 sailors war games conducted since then have demonstrated that fleets of small , fast ships may be able to cause havoc among the navy s larger vessels , particularly in the relatively small confines of the persian gulf us officials said the incident monday was under investigation the us embassy in new delhi released a statement expressing its condolences to the families of the crew of a small motor vessel after the vessel disregarded nonlethal warnings and rapidly approached the us ship the indian government said it would stay in touch with the authorities in the united states and the united arab emirates to ascertain the full facts and take appropriate further action in the matter
beijing a heavyweight crowd gathered last october for a banquet in beijing s tallest skyscraper the son of mao zedong s immediate successor was there , as was the daughter of the country s no 2 military official for nearly three decades , along with the half sister of s presidentinwaiting , and many more all you had to do , said one attendee , zhang lifan , was look at the number of luxury cars and the low numbers on the plates most surprising , though , was the reason for the meeting a small coterie of children of china s founding elites who favor deeper political and economic change had come to debate the need for a new direction under the next generation of communist party leaders , who are set to take power in a onceadecade changeover set to begin this year many had met the previous august , and would meet again in february the private gatherings are a telling indicator of how even some in the elite are worried about the course the communist party is charting for china s future and to advocates of political change , they offer hope that influential party members support the idea that tomorrow s china should give citizens more power to choose their leaders and seek redress for grievances , two longtime complaints about the current system but the problem is that even as the tiny band of political reformers is attracting more influential adherents , it is splintered into factions that cannot agree on what reform would be , much less how to achieve it the fundamental shifts that are crucial to their demands a legal system beyond communist party control as well as elections with real rules and real choices among candidates are seen even among the most radical as distant dreams , at best part of a second phase of reform in addition , the political winds are not blowing in their favor the , the politburo member who openly espoused a populist philosophy at odds with elite leaders , offered an object lesson in the dangers of challenging the status quo and official silence surrounding his case underscores highlevel fears that any public cracks in the leadership s facade of unity could lead its power to crumble as a result , few people here expect the party to willingly refashion itself anytime soon and even those within the elite prepared to discuss deeper changes , including the secondgeneration , as they are known , have a stake in protecting their own privileges compare now to 1989 in '89 , the reformers had the upper hand , said mr zhang , a historian formerly associated with the government s chinese academy of social sciences , referring to the prodemocracy student protests that enjoyed the support of a number of important party leaders but were crushed in tiananmen square twenty years later , the reformers have grown weaker now there are so many vested interests that they 'll be taken out if they touch anyone else s interests to mr zhang and others , this is the conundrum of china s rise the autocracy that backflipped on marxist ideology to forge the world s secondlargest economy seems incapable of embracing political changes that actually could prolong its own survival much as many americans bemoan a gridlocked government split by a yawning partisan gap , chinese advocates for change lament an allpowerful communist party they say is gridlocked by intersecting selfinterests none of the dominant players a wealthy and commanding elite rich and influential state industries a vast , entrenched bureaucracy stand to gain by ceding power to the broader public many who identify with the reform camp see change as inevitable anyway , but only , they say , because social upheaval will force it in that view , discontent with growing inequality , corruption , pollution and other societal ills will inevitably lead to a more democratic society or a sharp turn toward totalitarianism an overriding worry is that unless change is carefully planned and executed , china risks another cultural revolutionstyle upheaval that could set it back decades the bureaucrats still do n't have this sense of a crisis , one editor at a major communist party newspaper , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said in an interview this year they think that they can continue to muddle through and perhaps they can at least for a while longer most chinese credit the party for lifting hundreds of millions of citizens from poverty and creating a huge urbanized middle class , providing a foundation of support for the status quo but many people are dissatisfied with an elite that retains tight political control , holds immense wealth and operates with largely unchecked authority scholars say the number of mass incidents a vaguely defined official measure of discontent that includes spontaneous citizen protests has doubled since 2005 the government stopped publicly reporting the total in 2006 we recognize the achievements , said yang jisheng , an editor of the liberal journal yanhuang chunqiu but we worry about how to sustain them the cake is extremely big , the secondbiggest cake in the world but it s divided extremely unfairly , mr yang added and it s systemic if the system does n't change , it is always going to be unfair some leaders share those fears the communist party s only vocal advocate of systemic reform , , warned at his annual news conference in march that failing to overhaul the party s leadership risked setting off a second cultural revolution political change is a common topic of debate in the government s many research groups and in the party s school that trains upandcoming leaders neither the rulers nor the ruled are happy with the current situation , said mr zhang , the historian the prevailing belief is that change is coming soon , but the question is how change is either going to come from the top leadership , or from the grassroots level critics complain of stagnation during president s decade in power , and note that mr wen has only halfheartedly pushed for change they say the party has focused less on addressing citizen grievances than on erecting a sophisticated security apparatus to stifle them mr hu s stab at loosening up the communist apparatus has been a call for intraparty democracy , code for giving the party s lower ranks more voice in setting policy and choosing higherups but there is scant evidence that even those minor changes in the power equation have been seriously pressed little is clear about the leanings of a new generation that will supplant mr hu and most other members of the politburo standing committee , the party s top ruling body , in the transition starting this fall the political views of , china s vice president and , are unknown , though he has flashed brief signs in a few speeches and meetings of what sound to analysts like more progressive leanings some others who seem likely to ascend to the leadership have shown glimmers of support for change they include li keqiang , mr wen s expected successor as prime minister vice premier wang qishan li yuanchao , the head of the party s powerful organization department and liu yandong , a contender to become the standing committee s only female member i'm optimistic , zhou zhixing , a media executive and former official at a communist party research organization , said of the next standing committee i think these people have a very good understanding of china s current situation , and they know that people s demands include political reform mr zhou s web site , consensus net , has become an important forum for political debate if peaceful change is to occur , mr zhou and many others say , it must begin inside the communist party the lesson of tiananmen square is that the leadership will not tolerate threats to its control many speak of a transformation along the lines of that in taiwan , where authoritarian rulers peacefully gave way to direct elections in 1996 , and helped spawn today s robust democracy but the proreform contingent agrees on little else on whether china should seek westernstyle democracy , a more open form of the communists' singleparty dictatorship or something altogether different populists want to remake the party to reflect mao s early vision , redistributing billions in government riches to the people a socalled new democracy movement , led by a rural economist and journalist named zhang musheng , is gaining followers with a plan to add checks and balances to oneparty rule and to significantly expand welfare benefits but maostyle populism is disdained by most current leaders , and mr bo , perhaps its leading apostle , was felled by scandal last spring a second communist camp wants to open the party to internal competition , abandoning the leadership s facade of unity and letting rival factions take their ideas to the wider party for approval over the long run , they say , transparency will spawn competing parties under a communist umbrella a sort of oneparty democracy but in a china where stability is the leadership s obsessive concern , the notion of baring divisions at the pinnacle of power seems almost farcical indeed , the reformers cannot even agree on their motivation intellectuals and dissidents see political openingup as an article of faith many in the second red generation , the children of the founding warriors , are driven by anger over what they believe china has become under mr hu they think the youth league has ruined the country that their fathers fought and died for , said mr zhang , the historian , referring to the communist youth league , which is mr hu s base of support the beleaguered idealists cannot afford to be too choosy , though we welcome them , mr zhang said it s better to at least have an interest in reform , no matter why but the sheer scope of the discord leads some who call for change to wonder whether they are less a movement than a debating society intellectuals trading theories over plates

remember when matt kemp was tearing up the league in april , and everyone who didn t have a topthree pick was upset about missing out him \? and then it was josh hamilton , on pace for 100 home runs and 1 , 000 runs batted in through the end of may now it s mike trout who despite wasting three weeks in the minors leads the majors in runs scored with 80 and steals with 36 and unlike kemp , who cost a top3 pick , or hamilton , who most likely went in the second or third round , trout was dirtcheap , and thus the entirety of his production is pure profit trout , though , is not the only one on a vast number of firstplace fantasy teams let s take a look at the top10 profit makers so far this season each player s average draft position is according to mockdraftcentralcom , and all statistics are through sunday 1 mike trout \( average draft position 211 \) 21 hr , 65 rbi , 88 runs , 36 sb , 340 avg in 373 ab 2 edwin encarnacion \( adp 276 \) 30 hr , 76 rbi , 65 runs , 13 sb , 293 avg in 403 ab 3 ra dickey \( adp 219 \) 15 wins , 166 k , 272 era , 100 whip in 162 1 3 ip 4 chris sale \( adp 245 \) 14 wins , 132 k , 260 era , 102 whip in 138 2 3 ip 5 alex rios \( adp 217 \) 18 hr , 67 rbi , 69 runs , 16 sb , 318 avg in 425 ab 6 aroldis chapman \( adp 287 \) 4 wins , 28 saves , 106 k , 126 era , 068 whip in 57 ip 7 carlos beltran \( adp 145 \) 28 hr , 83 rbi , 67 runs , 10 sb , 284 avg in 405 ab 8 mark trumbo \( adp 133 \) 29 hr , 73 rbi , 54 runs , 4 steals , 288 avg in 393 ab 9 aj pierzynski \( adp 282 \) 23 hr , 67 rbi , 50 runs , 299 avg in 334 ab 10 josh willingham \( adp 188 \) 29 hr , 84 rbi , 68 runs , 2 sb , 261 avg in 395 ab if you have two or more of these players , there s a good chance your team is in contention if you have none , it s a major handicap to overcome but on the flip side , while identifying players who vastly outearn their draft slots takes some skill , few owners , if any , could imagine the extent to which these players would overperform in other words , while the mike trout owners certainly deserve credit for taking a gamble on an elite prospect with no visible path to immediate playing time , few had any idea they were getting a player compared to mickey mantle and ricky henderson by contrast , if you re winning while missing out on most of these breakouts , it means you hit on your picks more consistently from top to bottom and managed your team well throughout the season don t get me wrong , however i would much prefer to have as many of these players as possible , and leave it to others to decide how much credit i deserve while counting my winnings at the end of the year christopher liss is the managing editor of rotowirecom rotowire s realtime player notes are available free for 10 days at
i was a guest on up w chris hayes saturday , talking , it seemed , about everything a bit of an ambitious agenda when i go back , the conversation will continue meanwhile , since the initial topic was pink slime , about which i wrote last week , i used my preair time in the studio to outline the issues i thought were worth mentioning we didn t get to a tenth of this , so i thought it worth posting \( i was taught never to apologize for a story submission , but these are close to streamofconsciousness but hey that s why god invented blogging \) perhaps you ll find some things of interest 1 democracy are we entitled to know what goes in our food \? the answer s easy , but big food thinks it s no it s not just ammonia in beef , it s arsenic and antibiotics banned antibiotics at that , and prozac and all kinds of drugs in chicken and pork it s growth hormones in milk , it s genetically engineered ingredients in just about everything and we re told about none of this unless some concerned and often courageous citizen or journalist starts making noise about it that s what s been encouraging about this pink slime business \( and that s what s encouraging about aggag laws \) how hard it s being fought not that we re going to get rid of it , not because it s a major issue in the great scheme of things it matters , of course , but there are many other , greater problems but that public pressure is causing changes , like improved labeling \( almost everyone polled wants to know whether there are genetically engineered products in their foods , and whether ultimately that s important or not doesn t really matter , if it s something everyone wants \) public pressure can also reduce our reliance on factory farms and industrial agriculture in general , public pressure can make our food supply safer and better , and in turn make us a healthier country that s why the pink slime campaign is important it s a victory for public pressure over corporate power and therefore one for democracy note , too , that this happened nationally , which shows once again that noisemaking and protests are good for more than local issues 2 why is this happening in the first place \? pink slime and ecoli salmonella the chicken arsenic and inspection issues about which nick kristof wrote last week , cuts in funding at the usda , fda , epa , and so on what we re seeing are budget cuts as a form of deregulation , and that deregulation is geared toward allowing producers to raise the animals in our food supply any damn way they please , in the most profitable way possible as anyone who s been following these issues knows , cattle are meant to eat grass , not grain yet most cattle are fed grain , almost exclusively , and grain messes with their digestive systems those cows messedup stomachs become breeding grounds for ecoli which can cause kidney failure and death and salmonella , which is rarely deadly but can be extremely unpleasant \( you know how when you have the flu you want to die \? like that \) to combat this , producers must use boatloads of antibiotics 80 percent of all antibiotics used in this country are given to animals , and the vast majority of those are given prophylactically and resort to techniques like treating meat with ammonia or \( perhaps a shade less distastefully \) irradiation you might argue that these are public health measures , and in a perverse way they are they re making an unsafe product less so but why do we need them in the first place \? because our production methods create problems and big food , which finds these methods enormously profitable , wants us to deal with the symptoms of the problems \( wash tainted meat in ammonia \) rather than the problems themselves \( raise healthy cattle \) to defund programs that attempt to bring those production methods the real problem under control , to make them safer , better and healthier , is the equivalent of defunding sewage systems because we re able to wash down our streets with ammonia if you get my drift it ain t pretty 3 the jobs issue i am really annoyed about the this costs jobs nonsense , which is simply a line republicans dredge up when they don t like something they re not complaining about apple doing all its manufacturing in china , and they don t make noise when auto workers are laid off , and they certainly don t care when budget cuts reduce the number of ag inspectors or administrators in the snap program they only kvetch about job losses when it suits them politically we need to push democrats to have more spine to support intelligent measures even if they cost jobs the extreme example is tobacco i m sorry if tobacco farmers can t sell their crop , but their crop breeds death i ll be sorry , too , when americans stop eating so much meat and people in that industry start losing jobs i d be sorry for people on the automatic weapons assembly line if gun control ever develops any teeth \( i ll be sorry for the unemployed grief counselors , too \) but if a product means death for you or your neighbor or the environment , we simply shouldn t be producing it if people lose their jobs as a result , i m sympathetic , but we can t be supporting a process that poisons our citizenry the extreme example would be to complain about health care workers losing their jobs if we were to eat less industrially processed food and get healthier as a result if the only way to keep unemployment down is to employ people creating deadly products or dealing with their consequences , maybe that s worth looking at if you want to create jobs in the food supply , let s have real farmers raise real animals , and let s double the number of inspectors , so we can create jobs that protect people , not jobs that kill them sheesh 4 finally , a word about michael taylor , the socalled food safety czar who is a former monsanto lobbyist at the moment we have little room for hope that the food system will be fundamentally changed , but it s not precisely taylor s fault the changes we need to see are not forthcoming because a \) they re not priorities for the obama administration and b \) even if they were , the administration would be fought to death on them i do want to remind everyone , however , that candidate obama thought gmo labeling was a great idea president obama , evidently , doesn t care so much yet a million people signed a petition asking the fda to mandate labeling of gmo foods and in polls , something like 80 or 90 percent of americans want that to happen the fact that it hasn t happened is not taylor s fault , but because monsanto still has a disproportionate amount of influence , which it would no matter who was in charge of this stuff margaret hamburg , ostensibly taylor s boss , is one of the good guys not that i m in favor of taylor , and not that i think he s going to be helpful in getting gmos labeled but once again , he s a symptom not the disease
moscow more than 170 people have died in flooding in southern russia the news came saturday morning , and the death toll kept climbing throughout the weekend the water apparently came in around 3 am on saturday , flooding first and , in some places , second stories of apartment buildings residents drowned in their sleep several towns and villages were affected , most severely , it appears , krymsk some reports say that the town , population nearly 60 , 000 , has been effectively destroyed later saturday morning the first reports blaming the authorities showed up on blogs i can t believe krymsk no longer exists , wrote a young woman named yulia andropova on her page on vkontakteru , a russian social network apparently writing from krymsk , she described how the town may have been deliberately flooded to spare the bigger city of novorossiysk everyone is keeping quiet about this now , but last night my father was working and he says that they called an emergency meeting in the middle of the night to decide whether to open the floodgates of the neberdzhaevskoye reservoir , andropova wrote i couldn t tell much about her from her vkontakte page except that she was probably in her late teens i could not tell what her father s job was and what do you think \? of course they decided to open the floodgates ! they sacrificed krymsk and still didn t manage to prevent the flooding of novorossiysk good job but at least they should have warned people the water was coming ! why didn t they send the police ahead with warnings \? why didn t they turn on the sirens so people would wake up \? now the stores are closed , we have no electricity or food krymsk is surrounded by troops , though there is no longer a krymsk to speak of just ruins many old people died my friend s parents have disappeared they weren t home when the rescue crews came , but they haven t been found in the morgue either the post was reposted hundreds , possibly thousands of times on different social networks prominent bloggers and journalists quoted it to show the putin regime s utter disregard for human life as if further proof were needed late saturday night , andropova s vkontakte page was deleted so were several tweets about the disaster by another young woman that woman explained that , having received threatening phone calls , she had decided to take down her earlier posts meanwhile , president vladimir putin and alexander tkachev , the governor of the affected region , have denied on state television that the disaster resulted from a decision to open floodgates it was just the rain , they claimed bloggers immediately noted that none of the federal television channels was broadcasting live from the disaster zone or even interrupting regular programming for breaking news from there but late saturday night , two expert bloggers posted detailed analyses of the region s topography , both concluding that krymsk was probably flooded after heavy rain over nearby mountains turned normally tame rivers into monstrous roaring streams one blogger , by the name of eugeny shultz , concluded that the reservoir had probably overflowed on its own no one had opened any floodgates in fact , there are no floodgates at this particular reservoir , he wrote we shouldn t be making up crimes where there were none , shultz added especially since there are plenty of specific and true reasons to be mad at the regime one might think that it would at least be possible to establish for a fact whether floodgates exist or not , but in accordance with old soviet practices this kind of information is considered secret and kept off publicly available maps and other documents some of the same people who reposted andropova s entries also reposted shultz s analysis to a russian , both versions of events are believable except that a story imputing malice to the authorities is probably more plausible than a sudden natural disaster we russians no longer believe anyone who addresses us in the public sphere the president , the television , the newspapers , the police or bloggers we don t know personally thus in addition to the tragedy of the people who died in krymsk , there s the tragedy of having no hope of ever knowing what really happened to them
the philosophy espoused by tony sparano is , in his words , a little different from that of brian schottenheimer , his predecessor as ' offensive coordinator when asked friday to describe that philosophy , sparano used the word physical in seven straight sentences it was as if he were reading from cue cards held up by coach  we 're definitely likeminded people , said ryan , and it was easy to imagine him smiling on the other end of the telephone line sparano s approach emphasizes power running and protecting the quarterback virtues that ryan holds dear , and two of the jets' primary shortcomings during a season that ended in onfield disappointment and offthefield distress you have to form an identity , sparano said in a conference call , and i want to have an identity here offensively the jets' identity crisis dogged them all season , beginning with their misguided attempt to expand their offense and lasting all the way through s 67 dropbacks in a week 16 loss to the giants the jets managed only three plays of at least 40 yards \( none by a wide receiver \) , fewest in the nfl , so it was not surprising that sparano , whose lone season calling plays came in 2006 for dallas , accentuated their need to be explosive his plan to revive the jets' offense could leave an unambiguous imprint on sanchez , who buckled under pressure and a mediocre rushing attack in theory , their running game would improve , making the jets less reliant on sanchez , a strategy that ushered them to two afc championship game appearances on friday , sparano s introduction only temporarily deflected the attention from the entwined issues that the jets still must confront their locker room discord and sanchez s psyche a torrent of criticism has engulfed sanchez since the season ended , much of it coming from unnamed teammates who blasted his work ethic , leadership skills and development sanchez has not publicly addressed his detractors , but ryan and general manager mike tannenbaum defended him on friday , saying they had no reservations about his ability he has all the attributes and traits we want , tannenbaum said sparano s job is to refine those attributes and traits to help sanchez become a more effective quarterback coaching against the jets , sparano said he formed a positive opinion of sanchez , whose arm and athleticism he praised he has yet to review much tape , but sparano intends to apply to sanchez the same approach that he developed while working in dallas with tony romo and in miami with chad henne get them back to square 1 and break them back from a fundamental standpoint , sparano said sparano was talking about more than sanchez s mechanics , which seemed affected by the neck stinger he dealt with over the final six weeks of the season sparano intends to go over with sanchez all 26 of his turnovers as he seeks to improve sanchez s clock management and ball security , sparano wants to understand his thought process during those situations and then set about correcting his mistakes ryan has already begun his own selfevaluation he will continue to encourage his players to express themselves , but not behind the cloak of anonymity that s not being a jet , so that s going to change without question , ryan said he vowed to spend more time in position meetings and in the locker room , trying to regain the feel that he lacked last season for ryan , trying to restore harmony to a locker room loaded with fissures will be the most challenging task of his coaching career dealing with the locker room issues could be easier for sparano , who said he had no preconceived notions of the personalities he would encounter sparano characterized his personality as nononsense , and he is a disciplinarian in the mold of his mentor , bill parcells this is a showme business , a showme game , sparano said once these players get here , it 'll be a blank piece of paper as far as i'm concerned sparano s experience dealing with a mercurial receiver in miami , brandon marshall , should help him with santonio holmes , who was benched after a skirmish in the jets' huddle on jan 1 and whose relationship with schottenheimer was fractured the jets publicly professed that schottenheimer would return unless he was hired as the jaguars' head coach but in multiple conversations after the season ended , schottenheimer expressed a desire for what tannenbaum characterized as a fresh start it was a mutual decision , tannenbaum said as schottenheimer , who interviewed friday at the university of alabama , awaited a resolution from jacksonville \( he did not get the job \) , the jets interviewed two potential replacements the former offensive line coach bill callahan , who left for the cowboys , and sparano when we met with tony , i was like , wow , ' ryan said i was blown away extra points sanjay lal , the raiders' receivers coach , was hired to fill the same position with the jets , replacing henry ellard
when the cedar lake contemporary ballet company was founded in 2003 by the walmart heiress nancy laurie , the news was greeted with a profound shrug by the dance world the troupe s first two years didn t do much to dispel the idea that it was a rich woman s whim there was no headquarters and few performances , and reports arose of an oddly corporate environment with dissatisfied collaborators how times have changed nearly 10 years later , the 16member cedar lake , which opens at the joyce theater on tuesday night for a twoweek run , has become a new york success story , possibly the country s most innovative contemporary ballet troupe with an alist repertoire , and an accent on creation that few companies worldwide can match the change in fortune dates from 2005 , when ms laurie appointed the frenchborn former alvin ailey dancer , benoitswan pouffer as artistic director just as the company moved into a new home with its own theater in chelsea mr pouffer s subsequent decision to focus on acquiring new work from an upandcoming group of mostly european choreographers turns out to have been an inspired one the company now possesses a remarkably distinctive repertory , and has become a showcase for choreographers who are often wellknown elsewhere but little seen in the united states of course , his approach is one that most other troupes can t afford commissioning new work is the most costly and risky part of any company s artistic policy the company is a young one , and i had to start from somewhere , mr pouffer said in a telephone interview because i m european and have a lot of ties there , it felt natural to start with the choreographers that i knew about and respected i didn t think , let me find a niche for the company it was instinct more than anything else he added , what i look for is a quality of movement and an aesthetic i don t already have in my repertoire the company s joyce season includes pieces by angelin preljocaj , hofesh shechter , crystal pite , alexander ekman , regina van berkel and jo stromgren none , except mr preljocaj , likely to be terribly familiar to most new york dancegoers , even though mr shechter and ms pite are regarded in europe as two of the most important new voices to have emerged in the last few years don t be daunted by the onslaught of europeanness to smooth the way to the joyce , here is a user s guide regina van berkel ms van berkel , 43 , a dutchborn choreographer , is probably the least wellknown of the six choreographers represented during the joyce season , although she has worked extensively in germany , where she is based she danced with saburo teshigawara s company in tokyo and william forsythe s frankfurt ballet before beginning a freelance career in 2000 , and the influences of both those choreographers are apparent in the physical and spatial aspects of her work ms van berkel s simply marvel , her first work for cedar lake , is set to the paganini variations , with additional music by theo verbey , and is on point , which mr pouffer said he thought would be a good challenge for the dancers my work varies , ms van berkel said sometimes i do more classical stuff , sometimes a more organic , theatrical piece what i like in choreographic work is that you try to break the boundaries , whether it s theatrical or technical , make a space where things can happen i had paganini in mind because he was such a virtuoso as soon as i saw the dancers , i felt it was the right atmosphere , to go blindly for your abilities but i did want to bring a certain contrast into the piece , so i asked theo to make something very simple musically in relation to the paganini alexander ekman a former member of the royal swedish ballet , mr ekman , 28 , has strayed fairly far from his classical roots , showing a closer affiliation with the more contemporary movement style of mats ek s cullberg ballet , where he subsequently danced his work , often humorous and absurdist , has mostly been seen in northern europe , although he has made several pieces for nederlands dans theater 2 , with which he also performed in 2010 , he created hubbub , his first work for cedar lake his new tuplet , is set to a score that integrates the percussive sounds of the dancers bodies with electronic music by mikael karlsson the new work is all about rhythms and timing , said mr ekman in a telephone interview i thought it suited the dancers because they are so rhythmically gifted and quick to pick things up people say my work is funny , but i never go in thinking of making comedy i think it s more about absurdity but there are big differences in the way audiences react i think often in the us , people expect something more technical or formal , and they aren t sure how to respond to my work crystal pite ms pite , 42 , is canadian but based in frankfurt , where she runs her own company , kidd pivot she danced with ballet british columbia before joining mr forsythe s frankfurt ballet , and is an associate choreographer at nederlands dans theater her style , with its slippery buckling movement and fluid , explosive dynamic is clearly permeated by her time with mr forsythe , but ms pite has a distinctively poetic theatrical imagination , and a startling inventiveness with lighting mr pouffer said that he was captivated from the moment he saw her work , and in 2008 she created the critically lauded ten duets on a theme of rescue for the company  for the new grace engine , set to a score by owen belton , ms pite said in a telephone interview that she has recently been fascinated by epic drama and storylines grace engine was really about trying to create a sense of shared narrative over time , she said there are stories of love and loss and conflict and joy repeating over time , over generations i was interested in capturing big dramatic moments in life , and seeing what kinds of physical images emerge hofesh shechter the israeliborn , londonbased choreographer exploded onto the international dance scene in 2007 with his harddriving in your rooms a hyper physical , superbly theatrical piece for 11 dancers , it demonstrated mr shechter s affiliations with the work of ohad naharin , for whom he had danced before moving to paris to study music mr shechter , 37 , later moved to london and after the success of in your rooms formed his own company his work has been in constant demand ever since he composes all his own music , and his choreography is characterized by a raw energy , tribal unison and a particular gift for evoking an organized chaos his new piece for cedar lake , violet kid , is his second to enter the repertory after the company performed the fools last year for the new piece , mr shechter said in an interview in the canteen of sadler s wells theater in london , i was thinking for some reason about how we want children to be quiet and how this creates a bubbling rage , passionate urges we all want to shout , sing , run out in the rain the tension between good and quiet , and free and noisy that was the physical tension that i explored in violet kid jo stromgren mr stromgren , 42 , is a wellestablished norwegian choreographer who has his own company , but who also frequently works as a theater director his dramatic sensibilities are never far from his dance pieces , which , mr pouffer said , led him to commission sunday , again from mr stromgren in 2010 jo has a very dry humor that sets a very different tone to everything else that we have , he said in mr stromgren s new work for cedar lake , necessity , again , he has juxtaposed charles aznavour songs with a recording of a text by jacques derrida he is perhaps the most incomprehensible of all french philosophers , mr stromgren said of derrida i can t understand a thing ! i wanted a contrast between something extremely dry and intellectual with something very emotional i thought of it as a meeting between two extremes , a contrast that would perhaps enhance and intensify the quality of the dance there is nothing to understand relax , and let your imagination roam
moscow after new year s the biggest traditional family holiday of the year russia descends into an odd , sleepy state for 10 days most businesses go on vacation , moscow s hellish traffic temporarily evaporates , and russians spend their days in that hazy state between hangover and drink , either at their snowedin dachas or on warmer shores a couple of days after orthodox christmas on jan 7 , they will emerge from hibernation and stumble into work , dazed by the prospect of three more months of winter this year , this strange period of enforced idleness has a new dimension will russians , once they are back in town , also stumble back into the streets and into the protest movement s varied work spaces \? why did russians take to the streets in december in the first place \? apparent widespread fraud during the dec 4 parliamentary election served as the trigger and continues to serve as the battle cry for demonstrators but an opinion poll conducted by the wellrespected levada center at the dec 24 protest in moscow with over 100 , 000 participants , the largest the city had seen in over 20 years showed that while about 73 percent of the respondents said they had come out in response to election fraud , about the same percentage also said they had taken to the streets because of accumulated frustration with the state of the country and the policies of the government what is so frustrating about living in russia as to drive people out into the streets weekend after weekend , to brave freezing weather and inept crowd control , to wait in line for an hour to go through metal detectors and be allowed in a rally \? by far the most resonant political issue these days is pervasive corruption , of which election fraud is but one aspect what gets people about corruption and what gets them out into the streets is the humiliation of living with a government that is profoundly corrupt last year , i did three big stories \( in russian \) about three men who had come out as fighters against corruption after having once been very successful entrepreneurs william browder ran the biggest foreigncapital investment fund in the country before he was forced out of russia , the remains of his business were hijacked and used by corrupt government officials in a taxfraud scheme , and an auditor who tried to expose the stunt was jailed and soon died behind bars sergei kolesnikov was a medicalsupplies importer who was drawn into running a fraudulent charity that he claimed was used to build a palace for prime minister vladimir putin on the black sea coast valery morozov owned a construction company that received lucrative kremlin contracts but claimed that he was forced to do an evershoddier job as more and more money was siphoned off by highly placed officials ultimately , all three men decided to go public with what they knew and declare war on the corrupt russian government , which of course denies any wrongdoing in all of these cases none of them was motivated by his political beliefs all of them had done business with the putin government , perhaps holding their noses doing it , perhaps not but each of them had the deeply painful experience of being told that his skills , his intelligence and his experience were of no use to the people who run russia browder was kicked out of the country , kolesnikov was told to cease all activity except for constructing the palace , and morozov was forced to watch the quality of his construction projects deteriorate their experience was much more personal than political disenfranchisement , and this is why they were ultimately willing to risk everything the same thing is driving russian street protesters now they feel like their country has no use for them except to count their names , fraudulently , at the ballot box as the parliamentary election grows more distant , the sting of that insult may fade , but the pain of feeling your country does not need you will not and that , i believe , means that once vacation time is over , the russian protest movement will be back in force
my campaign stops column this week runs through mitt romney s possible vice presidential picks , and concludes that everything we ve seen from the romney campaign suggests they ll make the most cautious , firstdonoharm , don trocktheboat choice possible which probably means picking the competent , experienced , and completely unexciting ohio senator rob portman for further evidence that team romney is happy with the course they re on , here s national review s robert cost a on the plan to reintroduce the republican candidate during the runup to convention week in background conversations , romney aides frame august as an important month the themes of the tampa convention will be outlined in broad strokes , and romney will be more aggressive , one adviser says , when explaining his positions but conservatives should not expect any startling developments as former missouri senator jim talent , a romney adviser , said in mid july , there will be no october surprise , or a summer surprise , on policy romney s positions have already been outlined , he said instead , romney will likely elaborate on previously unveiled economic policies , hoping to give them more prominence top romney sources say political junkies may be familiar with romney s positions , but for many voters , a reintroduction would be helpful he doesn t need a whole lot of new , says former minnesota congressman vin weber , a romney adviser there is no magic bullet what he needs to do is keep emphasizing the key changes in course and get those things right on regulations , spending , and taxes this is the attitude of a campaign that sees the race going their way but is it \? i ve thought for a while that romney is on track for an extremely narrow win , but the latest round of swingstate polls yes , their probablyflawed samples and all suggest that he may well be on pace for a narrow loss instead and in either case , shouldn t romney be aiming for a bigger cushion \? shouldn t he be looking to create a tipping point , la the pivotal moments in bill clinton and ronald reagan s successful antiincumbent campaigns , rather than just waiting for voters to finally stop giving obama the benefit of the doubt \? shouldn t there be a generalelection narrative that s at least somewhat distinct from romney s primary season campaign pitch , and at least somewhat geared toward creating more separation between the current republican nominee and voters nonetoofond memories of the last republican president \? for now , the answer seems to be no here s a for instance the american enterprise institute s jim pethokoukis has been writing a lot lately about banking reform , and the freemarket case for trying to shrink or break up the nation s biggest banks this is an issue area where the obama white house s own policies would seem to be vulnerable to a populist critique , and a place where romney would seem to have a golden opportunity to put some distance between himself and the gordon gekko caricature that his opponent is intent on sketching but the romney campaign s attitude , per pethokoukis , is that taking up the cause of banking reform would be at crosspurposes with its deregulation message which is a reasonable enough point , if there were clear evidence that the deregulation message is a big general election winner but it s just as likely that swing voters especially downscale , disillusioned swing voters are waiting to hear something from romney that suggests that he doesn t just think deregulation and tax cuts are all the postcrash american economy needs and if he just keeps saying exactly what he s saying now , and ends up coasting to 49 percent instead of 51 percent , he won t just have lost the race he ll have squandered it
here s an incentive to hurry up and finish filling out the free application for federal student aid the federal government is now posting completion rates , by high school , online for the first time , the education department is publicizing the number of seniors in each high school who have submitted and completed the fafsa , which determines eligibility for many forms of financial aid students may have submitted their forms , but they may still be missing required information until the missing data is provided , the government cannot determine whether the student qualifies for federal aid the online completion data is based on some automation and may not be exact still , it is intended to help high school counselors , among others , inside higher ed reports  a quick look at high schools in new york reveals that a few stragglers may be keeping their schools from having 100 percent fafsa completion rates none of the students are listed by name , so there s a slim chance that guidance counselors or anyone else , for that matter will be able to tell who the holdouts are to see data from your school , visit the online data center and select your state in the dropdown menu the data , which may be downloaded as a spreadsheet , will be updated every two weeks

as unemployment climbed and tax revenue fell , the city of baltimore laid off employees and cut services in the midst of the financial crisis its leaders now say the city s troubles were aggravated by bankers' manipulation of a key interest rate linked to hundreds of millions of dollars the city had borrowed baltimore has been leading a battle in manhattan federal court against the banks that determine the interest rate , the london interbank offered rate , or libor , which serves as a benchmark for global borrowing and stands at the center of the latest banking scandal now cities , states and municipal agencies nationwide , including massachusetts , nassau county on long island , and california s public pension system , are looking at whether they suffered similar losses and are weighing legal action dozens of lawsuits filed by municipalities , pension funds and hedge funds have been consolidated into a few related cases against more than a dozen banks that are involved in setting libor each day , including bank of america , jpmorgan chase , deutsche bank and barclays last month , barclays admitted to regulators that it tried to manipulate libor before and during the financial crisis in 2008 , and paid 450 million to settle the charges it said other banks were doing the same , but none of them have been accused of wrongdoing libor , a measure of how much banks must pay to borrow money from one another in the short term , is set through a daily poll of the banks the rate influences what consumers , businesses and investors pay on a wide range of financial contracts , as varied as mortgages and interest rate swaps barclays has said it and other banks understated the rate during the financial crisis to make themselves look healthier to the public , rather than to make more money from clients as regulators and lawmakers in washington and europe assess the depth of the libor abuse and the failure to address it , economists and analysts are already predicting it could be one of the most expensive scandals to hit wall street since the financial crisis governments and other investors may face many hurdles in proving damages but darrell duffie , a professor of finance at stanford , said he expected that their lawsuits alone could lead to the banks' paying out tens of billions of dollars , echoing numbers from a recent report by analysts at nomura equity research american municipalities have been among the first to claim losses from the supposed raterigging , because many of them borrow money through investment vehicles that directly derive their value from libor peter shapiro , who advises baltimore and other cities on their use of these investments , said that about 75 percent of major cities have contracts linked to this if the banks submitted artificially low libor rates during the financial crisis in 2008 , as barclays has admitted , it would have led cities and states to receive smaller payments from financial contracts they had entered with their banks , mr shapiro said unambiguously , state and local government agencies lost money because of the manipulation of libor , said mr shapiro , who is managing director of the swap financial group and is not involved in any of the lawsuits the number is likely to be very , very big the banks have declined to comment on the lawsuits , but their lawyers have asked for the cases to be dismissed in court filings , pointing to the many unusual factors that influenced libor during the crisis the efforts to calculate potential losses are complicated by the fact that libor is used to determine the cost of thousands of financial products around the globe each day if libor was artificially pushed down on a particular day , it would help people involved in some types of contracts and hurt people involved in others securities lawyers say the lawsuits will not be easy to win because the investors will first have to prove that the banks successfully pushed down libor for an extended period during the crisis , and then will have to demonstrate that it was down on the day when the bank calculated particular payments in addition , investors may have to prove that the specific bank from which they were receiving their payment was involved in the manipulation before it even reaches the point of proving such subtleties , however , the banks could be compelled to settle the cases one of the major complaints was filed by several traders and hedge funds that entered into futures contracts that are traded through the chicago mercantile exchange and that pay out based on libor these contracts were a popular way to protect against spikes in interest rates , but they would not have paid off as expected if libor had been artificially lowered a 2010 study cited in the suit conducted by professors at the university of california , los angeles and the university of minnesota indicated that libor was significantly lower than it should have been throughout 2008 and was particularly skewed around the bankruptcy of lehman brothers
lamsugod , the philippines the last time visited his father s orphanage here in the remote hills of mindanao island , he stood at the edge of a grassy yard and told the children to make a loop with their arms then , to their amazement , he threw a football right through them he s really good at throwing ! said the rev roberto p gauran , 67 , who runs the orphanage with his wife , raymunda , 65 at 30 meters he could hit dead center , or even farther that was three years ago , before tebow s professional stardom cut down on his time for travel to the philippines but the boys and girls here still toss around a football he left behind for them among the very few youngsters in the country who know how kuya timmy taught us how to throw it , said jessa berbo , 16 , using a local term for big brother the word here at the orphanage is that tebow himself singled her out as the child with the best arm tebow s father , bob , founded the orphanage in 1992 as part of his missionary work in the philippines with the bob tebow evangelistic association , headquartered in jacksonville , fla he visits several times a year , sometimes bringing with him a group of american volunteers to preach in distant towns and villages on a recent visit , bob tebow showed the children a video of his son on the field and the orphans watched with a mixture of excitement and puzzlement , said roberto gauran jr , 28 , the oldest of the pastor s seven children , who also works here the children here know he is famous , but we do n't play football in the philippines and sometimes we do n't know what is going on , he said we watch fox news sometimes , so we know what is happening in the states with tim and we know that people are mocking him for his faith but most filipinos , obsessed with basketball rather than football , have not heard of tim tebow , or of his father s foundation his name rang a bell with one academic here who said , oh , is he the one who puts biblical verses under his eyes \? although the children at the orphanage do know about him , none of them seemed to have heard about tebowing \( in the philippines , the rage is for noynoying , an apparent copycat sendup of president benigno s aquino iii , whose nickname is noynoy , in which people lean their heads on a hand in a gesture of indecisiveness \) the orphanage , called uncle dick s home , now shelters about 40 children who attend nearby rural elementary and high schools , and includes a dormitory for about 10 who have enrolled in a small nearby college , mrs gauran said when we take in the children we intend to raise them until they graduate from college and go out into the world , bob tebow said in a telephone interview from the united states we like to treat them as closely as we can like our own kids our plan is to keep doing the same thing , to get more children and keep raising them up uncle dick s home , named for a close family friend , is clean but spare in this very poor part of the philippines its grounds are lush with foliage and filled with birdsong and the sometimes earsplitting buzz of tropical cicadas school is out now , and on a long quiet afternoon recently some of the children clustered on two hammocks and a broken couch under the trees , swinging and listening to a small transistor radio a water buffalo with long curved horns grazed just beyond the gate not far away , in a reminder of america s dominant historical presence in the philippines , vast dole pineapple plantations stretch across the plains toward the roxas mountains i truly believe that the god who loves me also looks at orphans as extremely special , tim tebow writes in his autobiography , through my eyes , written with nathan whitaker over and over , my parents showed us how talks about taking care of widows and orphans tim tebow was born in the distant capital , manila , in 1987 and lived there until he was 3 years old since the age of 15 he has made a number of visits back and has now established the in addition to its evangelical work in the united states , his foundation has plans to build a 30bed children s hospital in mindanao s largest city , davao his difficult birth has become part of the tebow story , when , according to his family , his mother rejected a doctor s suggestion that she terminate the complicated pregnancy and delivered what she now calls a miracle baby we never thought timmy would go that high in sports , the reverand gauran said god trained him to be a preacher i think he is just setting this foundation for a ministry perhaps that time will come when football will be on the sidelines for him in an interesting twist , the bob tebow foundation is bringing its message , in large part , to christians the foundation s , which provides a link for online donations to support its work , states that its mission is to take the gospel to those who have never heard and plant bible believing churches where previously there were no churches it goes on to say in a country of 92 , 000 , 000 , it is estimated that over 65 , 000 , 000 filipinos have never once heard the gospel of jesus christ but according to the most recent census and other figures , more than 80 percent of filipinos are roman catholic , one of the largest christian populations in asia another 3 percent are evangelical christians and 7 percent belong to other christian sects , with muslims and smaller groups making up the remainder of the population a large portion of the nation s muslim minority lives here in mindanao , but south cotabato province , the center of bob tebow s work , is mainly roman catholic in addition , the foundation says it has deployed some 50 filipino missionaries with the goal of preaching in every village in the country american protestant missionaries have been challenging the roman catholic establishment , fostered by spanish colonialists , since the united states seized the philippines from spain in 1898 the spanishamerican war touched off the missionary great game , if you will , and the prevailing attitudes at the time held that catholicism was n't really christianity , said gregg jones , author of the recently published history honor in the dust theodore roosevelt , war in the philippines , and the rise and fall of america s imperial dream \( new american library , 2012 \) you will probably find that a lot of evangelicals do not believe that catholics in general have heard the good news , in quotes , using their terminology , he said asked in the telephone interview about this largely christian audience for his evangelical work , bob tebow quoted the bible as saying it is the duty of every christian to preach the gospel to everybody he made reference to the book of matthew 28 1920 , which reads , go therefore and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit , teaching them to observe all that i command you in any case , proselytizing like this appears generally to be taken with an easy acceptance in a country that has been familiar with religious missionary work since spanish colonists first brought catholicism in the 16th century the church does n't feel threatened , said randy david , a prominent social commentator who is an emeritus professor of sociology at the university of the philippines and whose brother is a roman catholic bishop it s a very dominant institution you go to any church on sunday and they are packed i 've never seen more people inside the churches he added i think , to my surprise , the philippines has become one of the more welcoming societies with regard to religious pluralism bob tebow s missionary work brought him here in 1985 to mindanao , where he settled with his wife , pam , and four children , two years before tim was born he has continued the mission since the family returned to the united states in 1999 he has set a rigorous standard for his son s evangelical work , ready to go anywhere and meet anyone , in formal or informal settings , in large groups or small , to spread the message , the reverand gauran said even on the bus , the pastor said he 'll just stand up and preach while we are moving and he invites the passengers to accept jesus christ or if he sits in a public place and somebody is beside him , he will ask him , do you know jesus christ \? ' and he will deal with him often he has traveled with the reverand gauran to what the pastor called the remotest places in the country and sometimes very dangerous places to find new audiences for his message on one trip , the pastor said , a boy warned them that a group of men were planning to kidnap them for ransom they chased us maybe five kilometers , he said fortunately bob is a really good driver he can really drive , and we were able to get away in the telephone interview , tebow brushed aside the dangers i was never concerned about my safety , he said i do n't regard it as particularly dangerous to obey jesus christ and do what he wants you to do how are you threatened if you have eternal life \? despite warnings from the military and from local residents , the reverand gauran said , they always pushed ahead he said , if they kill me , that s it , ' the pastor said if they kidnap me , that s my chance to preach to them'
moscow as of last friday , i am an undocumented person in my own country i cannot open or close a bank account , receive medical care at a state clinic , buy a cellphone , return a purchase to a store or enter into a contract , which my job requires me to do several times a day all of these operations and many more require a valid internal passport , a peculiar document that may be the most significant vestige of the ussr in modern russian society back when we lived behind the iron curtain , these passports entitled us to travel only within the confines of the soviet union anyone lucky enough to be allowed to travel abroad was issued a special foreigntravel passport just for the occasion and had to surrender it upon returning home when russians acquired the right to travel freely , they got to keep their foreigntravel passports but the internal passport refused to die so now each adult russian citizen has two passports the documents look alike , except that the one for internal use is printed on lighter paper stock , making it feel less substantial the internal passport may sound like the identity document that citizens of many european countries are required to hold , but none of those are as comprehensive or as intrusive pages 2 and 3 contain issuing information and the bearer s name , date and place of birth this is standard fare pages 4 through 11 are reserved for stamps certifying the bearer s legal right to reside at a particular address in soviet times , this was as close as most citizens got to having property rights the state issued residential quarters and then , with a stamp in the passport , certified the person s right to live there now , the old residencepermit system and the new privateproperty system exist side by side one can purchase an apartment and be denied the legal right to reside in it or one can retain the legal right to live on a property that belongs to someone else pages 12 and 13 are marked military duty all russian males and a fair number of the females \( those who studied foreign languages and could serve as translators \) are subject to mandatory military service a man under 29 whose passport does not reflect that he has either carried out or been released from his military service may be detained by any policeman and delivered to a draft office to be shipped off this happens often enough pages 14 and 15 are reserved for marital status upon marrying or divorcing , one acquires a corresponding stamp pages 16 and 17 are where the names of one s children go as long as they are under 14 , whereupon they have to get their own internal passports the last two pages of the passport contain information on one s foreigntravel passport , as well as , optionally , one s blood type every time i initiate a bank transaction in person , return an item to a store or enter into a contract , i share all of this personal information with perfect strangers or shared last friday i turned 45 , and my internal passport expired one gets one s first internal passport at 14 and turns it in for a new one at 20 and then again , as a government web site puts it , in case one reaches the age of 45 a simple reminder of the fact that a lot of russians don t when i do get my new passport , i am expected to carry it for the rest of my life , probably because the government doesn t expect that to be a very long time
on saturday a batch of letters that louis armstrong wrote to a girlfriend will go on sale at an auction house in los angeles that in itself is not surprising armstrong wrote thousands of letters in his lifetime , and he was known to be a lothario but these letters offer strong evidence of something else armstrong , who most biographers say was childless , believed until his death that he had a child what s more , the woman he regarded as his daughter has surfaced and says armstrong supported her and her mother for more than 15 years , sending them monthly checks from his manager s office , buying a house for them in mount vernon , ny , and even saving 25 , 000 for her college expenses he died thinking in the back of his mind that he had a daughter out there , said ricky riccardi , the archivist at the museum in queens the woman , sharon prestonfolta , 57 , of sarasota , fla , said she decided to break her long silence about what she calls my parents' secret because she was upset that armstrong s estate never recognized her existence his will left her family nothing , and his last wife , the former lucille wilson , signed an affidavit to the court stating that he had no children besides selling the letters , estimated to be worth as much as 80 , 000 , she is releasing a short memoir on kindle , written with denene millner i chose to tell my story now because it s about my legacy , ms prestonfolta said i matter my story is important i have every right to say who i am , to be proud of it ms prestonfolta , a media planner for a departmentstore chain who is married and has a grown son , bears a striking resemblance to armstrong , but has no medical evidence to support her claims just the letters and a sworn affidavit from her mother , who is 91 and declined to be interviewed scholars have known for more than a decade that armstrong had claimed to have fathered a child in the mid1950s with lucille preston \( who was known as sweets \) , a dancer he was seeing romantically shortly after ms prestonfolta s birth in 1955 , armstrong wrote to his manager , joe glaser , directing him to pay her mother s bills and describing , in graphic detail , the moment he believed that cute little baby girl was made that letter was first made public in 1999 in thomas brothers s book louis armstrong , in his own words armstrong s clarinetist barney bigard mentioned the child in his 1983 autobiography , relating an argument he overheard between armstrong and his wife he recalled that armstrong had insisted the girl was his , and his wife retorted that he could not be the father because he was sterile many armstrong biographers thought she might have been right he was married four times and had hundreds of affairs , yet none of those unions produced children and after 1957 mentions of ms preston and her baby seemed to drop out of armstrong s correspondence but ms prestonfolta s memoir and the letters for sale \( there are nine in all \) , along with a telegram , four postcards , a signed photo and an audiotape , offer a fuller picture of armstrong as a man who kept a second family for more than a decade in two letters from november 1954 armstrong professes his love for ms preston and tells her how excited he is that she is pregnant with his child , whom he calls his little satchmo in one he says he is on the verge of divorce and promises to marry ms preston , signing off your future husband ms prestonfolta said armstrong visited her and her mother regularly until 1967 , when they had a bitter falling out after he refused to leave his wife when she was a young girl , ms prestonfolta said , she and her mother joined armstrong as he toured with his all stars every summer it was never a secret to me who my father was , she said a letter from 1959 supports her story armstrong writes of how much he misses ms preston and sends the route for his tour , urging her to join him in 1962 armstrong bought a threebedroom house for them at 413 south columbus street in mount vernon and continued to visit them there several times a year , ms prestonfolta said she has few happy memories of him beyond the concerts she saw him listening to the news on the radio at their house in mount vernon and one fatherly talk he gave to her after a concert at jones beach she said that at 10 she learned armstrong had a wife and a home in queens when she saw him give an interview on johnny carson s show i just felt so betrayed , she said by the mid1960s armstrong was spending less time with her mother in two letters from 1965 he offers apologies for traveling so much give sharon a big kiss , he wrote tell her if she s forgotten ol' satchmo , i do n't blame her i feel she is too young to understand the love affair ended the summer of 1967 , when she and her mother accompanied armstrong to atlantic city , where he was playing at steel pier late one night , in a hotel suite , she woke to hear armstrong and her mother screaming at each other her mother demanded to know when armstrong would marry her hearing him say never ! ' was devastating , she said a letter from aug 31 , 1967 , refers to that fight armstrong begins if you 're ready to bury the hatchet , i am , then tells ms preston to give my little daughter a big kiss from her daddy ms prestonfolta said she only saw armstrong once more , when she and her mother went to a show in 1968 at the latin quarter in manhattan she visited him in the dressing room , and , though he asked about her studies , she and her mother visited with him as part of a more general entourage still , ms prestonfolta said , armstrong continued to send her mother monthly payments until he died in july 1971 after his death his manager sent them a bundle of savings bonds that armstrong had bought for her college fund but he left his entire estate to his wife , lucille , who declared to the probate court that he had no children i had been legally erased , she said the last letter in the lot is dated june 12 , 1968 sharon may not realize now what i mean to her doing for her , he wrote but i am sure as she matures she 'll dig pops as the man who 'll be loving her until he day he dies , or she dies that s sincerity and from the heart stuff terry teachout , the author of satchmo at the waldorf , said , needless to say , we ca n't be certain that sharon is armstrong s natural daughter , only that he thought she was the letters , which are clearly authentic , he added , prove that beyond any possible doubt
foxborough , mass the ' afternoon at gillette stadium began just as their week did , with rex ryan opening his mouth on his way out of the tunnel and onto the field , ryan took a moment to bark at some new england fans he might have been provoked , but leading up to sunday he rarely was ryan is consumed by all things their championships , their coach , their quarterback and he relished reminding them that the jets had beaten them three times in the last three seasons and , even more , that they would do so again i want them to know , ryan had said by nightfall , the patriots did know the patriots knew that the jets the shorthanded jets , the overmatched jets , the underdog jets had restored a reputation sullied by ugly defeats , stifling the nfl s most dangerous offense en route to overcoming a 10point fourthquarter deficit but the patriots also knew they reigned in the afc east , leaning on two stephen gostkowski field goals a 43yarder as time expired in regulation , a 48yarder on their opening possession of overtime to subdue the jets in the latest captivating installment of what could be the nfl s most entertaining rivalry new england secured a 2926 victory when rob ninkovich forced , then recovered a mark sanchez fumble with 7 minutes 28 seconds remaining in the extra period this was a golden opportunity , linebacker calvin pace said a bunch of couldas , shouldas , wouldas those whatifs were spread like sawdust throughout a game that new england led , 2313 , with 5 45 left , but that within minutes the jets felt they would win there was the thirdquarter field goal they settled for after failing on two plays from inside the 5 there was the thirddown drop by stephen hill on their penultimate drive in regulation , forcing them to kick a gametying field goal instead of seeking a goahead touchdown but none engendered more regret than the sequence that followed antonio allen s recovery of devin mccourty s fumbled kickoff return , at the new england 18 , just before the twominute warning the jets lost 7 yards on their next three plays , with sanchez taking a 10yard sack when his intended target , jeremy kerley , slipped on his route nick folk kicked a 43yard field goal , but the patriots , operating their nohuddle offense to perfection against a soft zone defense , marched 54 yards in 1 37 as gostkowski forced overtime i'm thinking we 've got this , but i'm thinking i 've seen this same story before , pace said , referring to tom brady s penchant for lastminute comebacks referring to a touchdown that never happened , he added i just knew in my heart we had seven right there , i really did it just did n't happen for us instead of celebrating an uplifting victory , the jets changed afterward in a locker room so quiet that the sound of athletic tape ripping could be heard in a distant corner moral victories do not exist in the zerosum culture of the nfl , but especially against this opponent , at this stadium , with first place in the division at stake they arrived here seeking credibility they left good , but not good enough we knew it was going to be a dogfight , there s no question about it , ryan said i tell you , it stinks being on this end of it the jets are 34 , with a treacherous schedule ahead games against pesky miami and at seattle bookending a bye week , with a road meeting at the rams after that then new england visits metlife stadium on thanksgiving night , and by then the jets will know more about themselves already they have revealed tremendous resilience since losing darrelle revis and santonio holmes to severe injuries , playing markedly better after being blown out by san francisco on sept 30 what troubled them so on sunday was that they had largely contained brady , who still threw for 259 yards and 2 touchdowns , both to rob gronkowski had largely neutralized wes welker and had limited the patriots to 10 points over the final 43 minutes of regulation and yet they still lost it stings , sanchez said it just stings from a strong week of practice , the jets sensed that their game plan picking on the patriots' maligned secondary , harassing brady , disrupting receivers at the line of scrimmage would be successful , and for much of sunday it was against the league s 28thranked pass defense , against a secondary lacking its starting safeties , sanchez completed 28 of 41 passes for 328 yards , a touchdown and a ghastly interception he was most impressive on a 14play , 92yard drive that drew the jets within 2320 , completing 9 of 10 passes , including a 7yard touchdown to dustin keller as ryan said of the patriots , nobody is going to shut them down , and so the jets knew they needed to minimize mistakes and keep brady off the field a miserable first half ended with the jets trailing , 1610 , despite a 104yard kickoff return by mccourty a muffed handoff to shonn greene that resulted in a safety and a general lack of awareness by sanchez , who realized that hill was more open at the patriots' goal line than a 24hour 7eleven just as alfonzo dennard swooped in for the interception in meetings all week , the jets stressed the importance of scoring touchdowns not field goals against new england a week after succeeding on all five redzone chances against indianapolis , they were 2 for 4 sunday , and a curious playcall on thirdand2 from the new england 4 with the jets trailing by 6 early in the third quarter did not help sanchez threw incomplete on a slant pattern to chaz schilens , who was covered well and cannot separate as well from defenders on such plays as someone like holmes , as tim tebow , who extended the jets' first scoring drive by converting in the same situation , stood on the sideline in truth , the couldhavebeens paled to the reality that slapped them in overtime , when kyle wilson committed a costly thirddown passinterference penalty on aaron hernandez , the flag thrown late knowing that a touchdown would win

the jets can do the same
4 25 pm updated added comments from interview with npd analyst by brian x chen the revamped chrome operating system , announced tuesday by google , plays highdefinition video , has a rebuilt trackpad and is even designed to work on future touchscreen models none of which matters if google cannot get computers that use it out into the world , something that is proving as big a challenge as engineering chrome one thing is certain , however google is not giving up it is heading to retail outlets , showcasing the machines as cheap and easy to manage corporate devices , and rethinking how it sells products for education executives involved with chrome say google does n't care if it takes years for the chrome operating system to catch on \( google also calls its web browser chrome \) what i am sure of is the level of commitment inside the company , said sundar pichai , the head of chrome at google the chrome browser was at a 3 percent share after a year android had little share over a year it takes time the browser has at least a fifth of the market , enough to make it a serious contender against mozilla s firefox and microsoft s internet explorer android is the most widely used smartphone operating system since its first appearance in july 2009 , the linuxbased chrome operating system has been intended for people who live online the name shared with google s web browser underscores both the chrome operating system s requirement of an internet connection to obtain access to most applications , and google s desire to tie together many products , like documents , email and social networking there are a lot more people living online than three years ago , but still few of them using chrome computers chromebook sales are so small that npd group , a research firm that tracks sales numbers for electronics , declined to disclose them stephen baker , an analyst with npd , said retail distribution for these notebooks is poor , and the bigger pc manufacturers like dell and hewlettpackard are not making them he said that google will need to rethink how these computers will be portrayed to everyday shoppers in a store it wo n't be easy for a best buy employee , for example , to sell a computer that appears to just run a web browser it s not an easy message to convey , he said for consumers , it s a niche product it has a very limited customer base through a very small number of outlets laptops using chrome , called chromebooks , are currently made by acer and samsung there are also desktop models , called chromeboxes mr pichai has been showing off new laptops and desktops from samsung , and says acer will also be working with the new version of the chrome os more manufacturers will be selling machines , possibly including touchscreen tablets , by christmas , he said , but he did not identify the manufacturers some best buy outlets will sell the machines , which so far have only been available online that could increase sales , since most people still like to go to physical stores and touch new machines before they buy them the real future for these products , however , may begin in fleettype sales to business and schools the laptops cost 450 , and the desktops 329 , far less than most computers more important , they can be centrally configured and managed , which means they could be attractive for use in call centers , schools or other places that tend to use the same software over large groups google is also looking at new ways to price the machines for schools a year ago , google tried selling them on a low permonth charge that proved hard to work out with the typical annual budgets of most school systems to date , more than 500 schools are using chrome machines that is not many , considering there are over 20 , 000 school systems , school districts , colleges and universities in the united states steve ballmer , the chief executive of google s archrival , microsoft , likes to say , we just keep coming and coming and coming google is almost as rich , and just as tenacious this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print
dublin one of the most deeply divisive issues in irish society was reignited wednesday night when the irish parliament began debate on a bill that would provide for limited access to abortion as in the united states , it was the supreme court here that legalized abortion , although in strictly limited circumstances but in the 20 years since the successive governments have shied away from enacting the legislation needed to carry out the order the proposed measure would provide for termination of pregnancy where a real and substantial risk to the life of the pregnant woman exists the bill s sponsor , an opposition socialist party deputy , clare daly , said it was long overdue we believe that it is only a first step for abortion to be legalized in in all circumstances we have waited long enough , ms daly said over 100 , 000 irish abortions have taken place in britain for many different reasons , none of them easy , all of them valid the hypocrisy , injustice and expense of having to travel to england for terminations , away from family and friends , is a disgrace but in this conservative and catholic nation , sentiment against abortion runs strong , and over the past few months antiabortion groups have been pressuring politicians to oppose the bill , and are confident it will be defeated i do n't believe there is a chance this bill is going to succeed , but i do think it is being used to build up a head of steam towards abortion on demand , said niamh ui bhriain , a veteran campaigner and spokeswoman for the in dublin we will be mounting a very strong campaign in the coming months to make sure this does n't get any traction the x case arose when a 14yearold girl , known as x to protect her identity , told her mother that she was having suicidal thoughts after she was raped by a neighbor and had become pregnant the family planned to travel with her to england for an abortion because of the ban in both the republic of ireland and northern ireland while awaiting departure , the family asked the irish police if dna from the aborted fetus would be admissible as evidence in any future prosecution of the perpetrator \( who was subsequently sentenced to 14 years in prison for rape , a term that was reduced on appeal to four years \) the police then informed the attorney general of the girl s intention to have an abortion , and he refused her the right to travel on the basis that abortion was repugnant to the irish constitution wherever it took place the supreme court ruled against the injunction on the basis of there being a real and substantial risk to her life although it later emerged the young girl had had a miscarriage , the public voted in a referendum arising from the case to pass two of three proposed amendments to ireland s constitution in essence , the revisions allowed citizens to leave ireland to have an abortion and declared it legal to distribute information about abortion services abroad the amendment that was rejected would have disallowed abortion in ireland for women who were suicidal because of pregnancy
our family trip to cleveland for monday night s indians game would ordinarily prompt a historical detour , perhaps to the site of league park , where the era indians played instead , i can stomach only a david berger tour now do you know the name david berger \? i said to my teenage sons no idea , they responded point made berger , 28 , competed as a weight lifter for israel s olympic team in 1972 but returned from munich to his native cleveland in a coffin he was one of 11 members of the israeli team abducted and killed by terrorists who invaded their dormitory the international olympic committee s refusal to memorialize the munich tragedy at the london games demonstrated an inability to see the trees for the forest by visiting berger s grave , his high school and a national park service , i hope to gain greater insight into this lone tree berger earned mba and law degrees at columbia , then moved to israel and competed on the world stage our car trip from baltimore serves to temporarily extract berger from the munich 11 basket and see him and help my sons see him not as a symbol but as one person it s an educational opportunity , fortunately during the london games speaking last week with people who knew berger or were inspired by him gave me some understanding , and they represent the power individuals can exert to perpetuate his legacy growing up in williamsport , pa , zaq harrison watched on television as his boyhood idol , the swimmer mark spitz , won a seventh gold medal , then a record for one olympics the israelis were abducted the next day , propelling harrison on a continuing reassessment of heroism a finance professional from baltimore , he recently began summer camp discussions about the munich olympians and the ethical issues athletes face harrison , 48 , informs children that the israeli wrestling coach moshe weinberg and the weight lifter yosef romano gamely fought the 1972 terrorists he displays single white placards , each bearing a munich name , inviting the teenage campers to recite them he always reserves berger , a worldclass jewish athlete , for last harrison said he admired berger because he figuratively lifted all of us on his shoulders into a german arena a generation after the holocaust i 've gotten 2 , 000 kids to say the names out loud , harrison said it s a different learning experience jed margolis attended berger s rival school , cleveland heights high school david s was a name we all knew and looked up to , said margolis , 61 , the executive director of the united states branch of the international maccabi movement , which promotes jewish pride through sports he was the ultimate studentathlete , someone who developed himself physically and developed his mind the regional jewish community center youth tournament margolis plans to attend next sunday in new york s rockland county will commemorate the munich massacre , as maccabi and jcc tournaments in recent decades have done it s a very dramatic experience because none of these kids was born in 1972 , margolis said don readance , the athletic director at shaker heights high school in suburban cleveland , passes the david berger award affixed to a corridor wall on the way to the school s david berger fitness room readance assesses colleagues' recommendations for the award , given annually to the top studentathlete in the senior class when he is finished , readance said , he feels drained but satisfied that he has selected the most worthy nominee it s an important part of the school and of keeping his legacy going , readance , 49 , said of shaker heights , where berger competed in wrestling and golf , served on the student council and worked on the newspaper it s a way for us to educate kids about the historical significance of the incident camps , sports movements and schools unite diverse young people around commonalities students and athletes might prefer familiarity but can benefit from embracing new people , too my younger son , gil , recently enjoyed a monthlong tour of israel with other teenagers , most of them strangers ten days in , he telephoned a usually happygolucky 15yearold , he had not located a comfort zone a week later , he had found it gil s brother , yossi , nearing 17 , will face similar challenges in college next year tolerance and receptiveness to others open multiple doors throughout life berger knocked on israel s athletic door and entered united by sports , he and his israeli teammates no doubt enriched one another and those they met in munich one of my paramount values is fostering human connectivity in recent days , my syndicated column about people seeking longlost relatives and friends helped to reunite a 1962 with an american boy who attended first grade there , and with an americanborn soldier who had served with their unit until 1972 one person at a time , people embrace but every embrace takes two seven years' experience reporting on the middle east conflict left me with precious little na vet about the region s diplomatic fissures and scant hopes for resolutions sports offer far greater cause for optimism there and worldwide athletes who withdraw from events in which they would compete against israelis as an iranian judoka did at the 2004 athens games and an iranian swimmer did , citing illness , at the 2008 beijing games undermine the olympic ideal more promising were the italian olympians who last sunday held a moment of silence for the munich dead individuals people and gestures do make a difference we were taught that the olympics brought people together of different races and religions , readance said i thought , why would somebody do that \? he added , referring to the munich bloodshed , which he watched unfold on television 40 years ago presenting the david berger award each spring offers readance a meaningful counterweight , he said a teachable moment and an opportunity for us to enlighten young people his words offer me hope
when time magazine announced barack obama as its person of the year , bet you didn t think it would include a dive into his movie tastes but granted an audience with the president , the magazine s managing editor , richard stengel , asked him about watching lincoln noting that daniel daylewis , who plays the 16th president , was sitting behind him at the screening , mr obama said i do think that there are lessons to be drawn part of what lincoln teaches us is that to pursue the highest ideals and a deeply moral cause requires you also engage and get your hands dirty and there are tradeoffs and there are compromises and what made him such a remarkable individual , as well as a remarkable president , was his capacity to balance the idea that there are some eternal truths with the fact that we live in the here and now , and the here and now is messy and difficult and anything we do is going to be somewhat imperfect and so what we try to do is just tack in the right direction so being able to project across a very long timeline while still being focused on the immediate tug and pull of politics i think is a useful lesson , and an accurate portrayal of how i think about my work day to day does a presidential thumbsup count as a best picture plug \? the bagger hears that the film also screened for members of the senate this week , in the presence of its director steven spielberg , its producer kathleen kennedy , its screenwriter tony kushner , mr daylewis and doris kearns goodwin , whose book team of rivals provided some of the source material the filmmakers shouldn t count on getting the beltway vote just yet , though according to none other than time \( and oprah winfrey \) , president obama is also a fan of beasts of the southern wild
the tourist in me is always grateful to the river to river festival simply for presenting dance in some of the most memorable outdoor new york locations south of houston street this year i'm also grateful that it lets me catch up with recent productions i had missed , by several of the most talkedabout downtown dance artists in new york this weekend beth gill reprised her piece \( new a year ago at the chocolate factory \) at pier 15 on the lower east side in battery park city luciana achugar offered \( shown in may at the abrons arts center \) these pieces are as varied as any putative differences between the city s east and west sides ms gill becomes too apollonian for comfort , ms achugar too dionysian but they also have a few ingredients in common ms gill had , by far , the more spectacularly beautiful location audience members at pier 15 , with mainland manhattan behind them , could look left to the brooklyn bridge ahead to the east river , brooklyn heights and its promenade and right to governors island and new york harbor during the performance s 45 minutes , brooklyn heights moved into shadow boats passed tourists waved happily and stared in curiosity in contrast to this location , electric midwife felt as if it had been composed according to regulations laid down by firstgeneration postmodern dance makers here were the flattened dynamics , the resistance to virtuosity and polished technique , the objective temperament and the avoidance of conventional theatricality that go back to yvonne rainer s seminal work , trio a \( 1966 \) the manner was of people coolly at work the material had a scientific method and look the six women , in rehearsal dancewear forming a motley array of soft and bright colors , maintained constant mirror symmetry and precise though changing stage geometries a few movement motifs were steadily recycled , but they also evolved , bringing new motifs into the mix the three women on the right never crossed over to the left , or vice versa gradually the choreography advanced into the foreground of the square stage area at the end the dancers departed , two by two the style was largely pedestrian insteps were only occasionally used when dancers balanced with one leg extended behind in arabesque , at 90 degrees to the floor , the torso went forward to the same angle the line mattered , but without any element of heroic strain involved in keeping the spine erect in such a position other lines made by arms and thighs created straight diagonals and arcs two women reverted to a mudralike motif , holding the splayed fingers of one hand beside an eye the other arm , its fingers splayed likewise , extended low while they stood with legs wide apart , bent and braced in another motif one woman lay between the legs of another who stood , and two women lay a long time with legs apart when i thought about the work s title something i only tend to do after a performance i could recall images that might refer to mother and midwife during childbirth , helpless new children and even stitching but that s a cerebral recycling of images and energies that were unengaging , detached and dispassionate during the performance when feelingpleasuresatisfactioncelebrationholyform was first performed in may the work s four female dancers were naked under hiplength wigs i was looking forward to this on sunday evening and was surprised to find that , as the women entered the performance area , they reminded me of gonks \( gonks are as furry soft toys from the 1960s and '70s they were prevalent in the era when long hair was controversial they were hair s harmless and playfriendly embodiment but the ones i loved best were little dolls hidden under thick manes \) i 'd forgotten my own oncebeloved gonk until these four gonklike women entered my life i'm grateful unlike earlier performances , it soon emerged that these women were clothed in leotards they began by placing bluejeans on their heads , like hats then they inched with crossedover pigeon toes toward one another meeting in the center , they bent and let the jeans drop to the floor so far the piece had a geometrical methodology that matched ms gill s work the women kicked and toed around until , by leg motion alone , they got the jeans all the way up their legs none of them were sylphs the two larger women were best at getting the jeans up over their hips all four then rolled on the ground , like fish in the bottom of a boat , or autumn leaves , to and fro , for a long period \( during this , we saw that their wigs were kept in place by straps under their chins one woman s wig , nonetheless , became detached , and she held onto it with her hand \) one of them twice rolled onto my foot during this horizontal writhing , the jeans of the two slimmer women came off again finally , the dancers made it to two revolving doors behind the performance space the end i may have made this sound more interesting than it was when i consider the title , feelingpleasuresatisfactioncelebrationholyform , i think i can see the idea that these four were working systematically through feelgood patterns of movement and thereby achieving some formal structures , but the movement transmitted little kinesthetic delight these gonkwomen just seemed thoroughly odd , labored and slow , though interestingly driven helpless , possessed when horizontal i had no objection to the choreography nor would i have if they had been naked but , though i was at close quarters , i watched as if from a great distance
cindy sherman was looking for inspiration at the spence chapin thrift shop on the upper east side last month when she eyed a satin wedding dress an elaborate confection , it had handsewn seed pearls forming flowers cascading down the front and dozens of tiny satincovered buttons in the back from which the train gently hung like a victorian bustle it s arnold scaasi , the saleswoman said , as ms sherman made a beeline for the dress unzipping the back the clerk showed off a row of labels , one with the year it was made 1992 and another with the name of the bridetobe it has never been worn , she added as the story goes , when the gown was finished , the bride decided she did n't like it ms sherman appeared skeptical is this really what happened , or is the story just the cover for a jilted bride \? one begged to know more that tantalizing sense of mystery and uneasiness are similar emotions viewers feel when they see one of ms sherman s elliptical photographs over the course of her remarkable 35year career she has transformed herself into hundreds of different personas the movie star , the valley girl , the angry housewife , the frustrated socialite , the renaissance courtesan , the menacing clown , even the roman god bacchus some are closely cropped images in others she is set against a backdrop that , as ms sherman describes it , are clues that tell a story none of the characters are me , she explained , sipping a soda at a cafe near the shop that afternoon they 're everything but me if it seems too close to me , it s rejected on this unseasonably warm afternoon ms sherman , 58 , had bicycled from her apartment in lower manhattan to discuss her landmark which opens feb 26 and includes more than 170 photographs wearing no makeup , with leggings and sneakers and a tweed hat that carefully concealed her crash helmet , she looked totally inconspicuous , hardly the celebrated artist whose fans include lady gaga elton john , who collects her work and madonna , who sponsored a show of ms sherman s untitled film stills , at the museum of modern art in 1997 petite , with strawberryblonde hair that falls to her shoulders , she is nothing like the largerthanlife characters she portrays in her selfportraits softspoken and friendly , she is very much a girl s girl who can as easily giggle about men , movies and makeup as she can discuss literature and art with its array of highend used clothing stores , this neighborhood has proved a rich hunting ground for ms sherman it was here along third avenue that she found the perfect designer clothes for her society portraits , a 2008 series of photographs depicting botoxed , overmadeup , often unhappy women of a certain age even as she prepares for her retrospective her first in the united states in nearly 14 years she is pushing herself to try something new lately she s been thinking about creating a family portrait where she would play every member she s undoubtedly one of the most influential artists of our time , said eva respini , associate curator of photography at moma , who has spent the last two years organizing ms sherman s retrospective she is always addressing issues at the heart of our visual culture in this world of celebrity makeovers , reality tv and youtube , here is an artist whose different modes of representation seem truer now than when they were made philippe s galot , a manhattan dealer who bought his first work by ms sherman for his own collection in the '80s , said i 've always been amazed how she could take what seems like such a simple idea and keep reinventing it cindy is one of the few artists who has been consistently great throughout her entire career raised in the 1950s , among the first artists to come of age in the era of television and mass media , ms sherman is part of the pictures generation , making works that combine pop and conceptualism she was first noticed in the '70s thanks to her untitled film stills , fictional portraits inspired by movies and girlie magazines she and artists like barbara kruger , sherrie levine , louise lawler and laurie simmons were examining female archetypes and gender issues in a way no one had before but it was n't until 1981 , when she made her centerfolds , a series of portraits inspired by photographs in playboy but with the women clothed and conveying a complicated range of emotions that her career really took off that was when museums first began to acquire her work , said janelle reiring , a cofounder of metro pictures , the chelsea gallery it was a big turning point peter schjeldahl , the art critic for the new yorker , who calls ms sherman his favorite american artist of the last 40 years , remembers the day he walked into metro pictures to see the centerfolds he was so bowled over , he ran out to the nearest pay phone i immediately called the two publications i wrote for only to discover that they had already assigned reviews , he recalled i had to write something that day , and it turned out to be a check mr schjeldahl bought a photograph for 900 , paying in monthly 100 installments by 1982 ms sherman was the subject of an exhibition at the stedelijk museum in amsterdam and included in documenta 7 in kassel , germany as well as the venice biennale five years later she had a traveling retrospective that was at the whitney museum of american art and in 1995 she received a macarthur grant her untitled film stills , for which she purposely developed the film in hotterthannormal chemicals to make them look cracked , cheap and grainy , like promotional giveaways , are now considered landmarks of late20thcentury art \( in 1995 moma purchased a set for a reported 1 million , an enormous price at the time \) but scores of other images from her long career have endured too , despite the proliferation of digital photography and photoshop the contradictory and complex readings of her work reinforces its ongoing relevance to multiple audiences , ms respini said more than ever , identity is malleable and fluid , and her photographs confirm this for ms reiring the key to ms sherman s success is that she does n't tell you what to think , she said her work is so rich in meaning that everyone can develop their own ideas everyone sees something different while she generally works in series , she has steadfastly refused to give titles to her photographs because she wants viewers to draw their own conclusions ms reiring said it was either the gallery or critics or the public who have named her series commercially she is often credited with taking photography out of a ghetto and putting it on the same firm fineart footing as painting and sculpture in may 2011 mr s galot , bidding on behalf of a client , bought a 1981 image in which she posed as a teenage girl for six months it was the most expensive photograph sold at auction , bringing 39 million at christie s growing up in huntington beach , on long island , where her father worked as an engineer for grumman aircraft , and her mother taught in public schools , she recalls liking to dress up probably more than other kids there are pictures of me dressed up as an old lady , ms sherman said , sitting in her studio on the edge of soho one afternoon i was more interested in being different from other little girls who would dress up as princesses or fairies or a pretty witch i would be the ugly old witch or the monster she started painting in college at buffalo state i was good at copying things , but i did n't really have ideas of what i wanted to do with painting , she said that was when i thought , why am i wasting my time elaborately copying things when i could use a camera \? ' one of her first assignments in a photography class was to confront something that was hard for her i took a series of myself naked in front of the camera , she said i did a couple of these series , and that was when i started using myself , but at the same time , not as an art practice , just for therapy or something i would transform my face with makeup into various characters just to pass the time she was dating the artist robert longo , and he suggested that she document herself in these costumes and after the two moved to new york in 1977 , ms sherman would often show up places in costume on and off for more than a decade , starting in 1985 , she removed herself from her pictures one series depicts macabre still lifes of vomit , blood and moldy food another captures anatomically correct medical body parts in bizarre poses she has said she created many of these tougher images during difficult periods in her life , like when she was angry about several male artists whose careers seemed to take off more easily than hers , or when she was in the middle of a divorce from the french video artist michel auder , ending their 15year marriage none of these images have been as commercially successful as her untitled film stills , or the history portraits the history series \( 198990 \) were shots of her dressed as characters from old masters like titian , holbein and caravaggio she works alone in her commodious floorthrough studio that houses her costumes , props and equipment women s wigs dot window sills , and there are shelves of wax doll s heads and body parts from medical mannequins it is here that she becomes the subject , the photographer , the director , the makeup artist and the costume stylist whenever i tried to hire people or use friends or family , even if i paid them , i felt like i had to entertain them , she said when i'm working alone , i can push myself and i do n't complain in recent years technology has changed her work before digital cameras i would do the character , set everything up take a roll of film , get out of character , take the makeup off and go to the lab and wait a few hours for the film to be developed , she said then i 'd look at the film and realize something did n't work out and i 'd have to redo everything myself now i can continue working and tweak it as i'm going in the moma show there will be images that are new to american audiences in which she has digitally altered her face i did n't use any makeup , she said it was all slight subtle changes with photoshop to make each character look different in some her eyes are bigger and spread apart in others she has reshaped her chin or plumped her cheeks it s horrifying how easy it to make changes , she said recently she has been thinking big , producing murals printed on a kind of contact paper she got the idea , she said , after seeing how a number of male artists would get invited to do a show somewhere , and they 'd just fill up an entire wall of painting that is just this gigantic thing she added i was thinking how pretentious that is it made me realize not too many women artists think that way as visitors get off the escalator at moma , they will be enveloped in 18foottall images of ms sherman standing amid a bucolic blackandwhite setting that she shot in central park it s like walking into cindyland , ms respini said on a recent afternoon as she was overseeing workers applying the contact paper to the museum s walls there ms sherman emerges in yet another mindboggling array of characters a circus juggler a woman clad in a body suit with pointy bosoms , nipples and pubic hair \( discovered in a tokyo department store \) an aging woman in a long red dress you think you may know them , ms respini said but in fact the more you look at them , the more complex and darker they seem the same could be said of cindy how can such a mildmannered , nice woman have such a wicked imagination that keeps inventing these fantastical characters over and over again \?
the quad asked writers at newspapers at the university of kansas and the university of kentucky for reports on what to expect on monday night new orleans we ve seen something like this before the kentucky wildcats , omnipotent by expectations the kansas jayhawks , underdogs if you ask every nonkansas fan and their cousin but coach bill self isn t buying it i ve never known a game to be played on paper , he said november in new york city was a glitzy nonconference test that kentucky unquestionably passed and won , 7565 but april in the big easy is for a national championship john calipari , the kentucky coach , made a statement the day before monday night s title game against kansas every game we play , he said , it s someone s super bowl kansas assistant coach barry hinson isn t buying that let s get one thing straight , we re kansas , hinson said we know we re underdogs , but hey , we re kansas we re coming to play there are no david and goliath speeches going on right now it s this confidence and pride , which resonates through all the jayhawks , that has meshed with their trust in one another before the hurdles of missouri , baylor , purdue , north carolina and the rest , the jayhawks started in november as five separate yet talented pieces now they re in the title game as a harmonious contingent that optimized its skills and camaraderie by adopting all that self and his staff preached i don t think we got here by wings , junior guard elijah johnson said i don t think we flew here the wildcats have been ranked no 1 for most of the season they boast a slew of freshman superstars most notably forward anthony davis , the player of the year who routinely rejects jump shots and upset bids from opposition there s also forward michael kiddgilchrist , who needs just a few dribbles to weave past a defense and dunk on people , suspecting or not guard doron lamb quietly kills with his smooth shot , especially in transition forward terrence jones , for all his mental errors and inconsistencies , possesses a premier array of ways to score all are advised by senior darius miller , the calm , softspoken guard who has a knack for making teams pay for leaving him open self said that all the praise for the wildcats is just they are rightfully known as college basketball s bully , especially after the way they manhandled the jayhawks back in madison square garden earlier this season but self also said that his team , one that has coalesced before his eyes , has its own reasons to believe in a championship it hasn t always been an easy process the firsthalf tightness , the scoring droughts , the excruciatingly dramatic finishes but self thinks his team belongs in this game this has aged me a lot , he said after saturday s 6462 victory over ohio state but i say this with sincerity i ve never had more fun coaching a group of kids they drive me nuts , but they try so hard they re stubborn and that s one of their greatest strengths after all that these teams have endured this season , there s just one game left the jayhawks don t view it as finding a way to defeat the almighty beast that is kentucky they re not daunted by network projections or highlight reels from november none of that matters any more , senior guard tyshawn taylor said there s 40 minutes left kentucky vs kansas blue bloods in the truest form calipari vs self their first meaningful duel since mario chalmers miracle in 2008 young , skilled acrobats vs tough , developed upperclassmen wholly different routes to reach this stage the two winningest programs in college basketball history and now it s here 40 minutes to crown a champion the appreciation of this moment will come weeks , months and years from now , hinson said these moments , the pictures that they get to see , the newspaper articles , they ll be able to relish this with their grandchildren max rothman , a senior journalism major , is the sports editor and men s basketball reporter for the student newspaper at the university of kansas
one day after being named to coach jurgen klinsmann s 24man roster for two world cup qualifying matches , landon donovan and brek shea were ruled out because of injuries , us soccer said tuesday the squad is in the process of assembling in miami to train for friday s match at antigua and barbuda after that match , the american team will return home and play guatemala in kansas city , kan , on tuesday in the final match of the regional semifinal qualifying round donovan sustained a knee injury in the los angeles galaxy s 21 loss against real salt lake in an mls match last saturday night shea , who plays for dallas , has been sidelined with a abdominal strain since sept 29 it s unfortunate for landon and brek that they won t be able to play , klinsmann said in a statement landon was very optimistic over the weekend when his knee was feeling much better , but now he needs time to recover we knew brek was a question mark coming in , and now we have a clear picture of where he stands we feel confident that the group we have will get the job done during monday s conference call when he announced the roster , klinsmann said of donovan we texted landon over the last two days and he was actually supposed to have an mri this morning but he skipped it because he improved a lot yesterday during the day we spoke last night and he said if things were better this morning , he would skip the mri and come straight to miami as of tuesday evening , there was no indication that klinsmann would add two players to the camp roster the us is tied with guatemala in first place in group a with seven points and matching totals in both goal differential and goals scored jamaica also has seven points but is in third place because of a lower goal differential none of the three teams can clinch a spot in the final concacaf qualifying round until the final day of games do you think the us coach was overly optimistic in naming donovan and shea , despite their injuries \? who would you now like to see called in to camp \? follow on twitter
do american sikhs count \? the horrific shooting at a sikh temple in suburban milwaukee on aug 5 , in which a white supremacist , wade m page , killed six people before fatally shooting himself , elicited an outpouring of sympathy from american leaders and a greater understanding of the role sikhs have played in american life but there are two disturbing aspects of the response to the shooting that deserve wider public attention first is the notion of mistaken identity the assumption that mr page , who had longestablished ties to radical rightwing groups , mistook sikhs for muslims , his presumed target the second is the government s failure to accurately measure the extent of antisikh violence in america a gap that must be remedied whatever the roots of mr page s hatred , it is wrong to assume that every attack against a sikh is really meant for a muslim that assumption overlooks the long history of discrimination and hatred directed at sikhs in america indeed , the first documented race riot targeting american sikhs occurred in 1907 in bellingham , wash their distinct religious identity \( uncut hair , turban , beard \) has historically marked sikhs , particularly men , as targets for discrimination , both in their homeland in south asia and in the various communities of the sikh diaspora and of course , 9 11 brought about a surge in fear and persecution directed at sikhs , muslims and other minorities with ties to the middle east and south asia there is also the question of whether white supremacist groups have specifically targeted american sikhs the authorities in southern california , where mr page was active in the whitepower music scene , are investigating whether he was involved in the killings of two elderly sikh men in elk grove , calif , in march 2011 just after the temple shooting , a sikh man in oak creek , wis , reported that a white man had pulled up next to him in a pickup truck , shaped his hands like a gun , and pretended to shoot him six times before stating , we want to kill all of you and on aug 15 , 10 days after the oak creek shooting , another member of the sikh community there , dalbir singh , 56 , was killed in the armed robbery of a local convenience store \( while the police have not uncovered any evidence to treat the killing as a hate crime , many sikhs have wondered if the violence was more than random \) white supremacist web sites clearly demonstrate intentional , targeted antisikh sentiments for example , the leading neonazi figure alex linder was quoted as saying on a rightwing web site take your dead and go back to india and dump their ashes in the ganges , sikhs you do n't belong here in the country my ancestors fought to found , and deeded to me and mine , their posterity even if you came here legally , and even if you have n't done anything wrong personally go home , sikhs go home to india where you belong this is not your country , it belongs to white men the mistaken identity assumption is directly associated with a second problem a lack of data about the extent of antisikh hatred the currently classifies nearly all hate violence against american sikhs as instances of antiislamic or antimuslim hate crimes as a result , we do not have official statistics on the extent of hate crimes in which sikhs are targeted , despite a long history of such violence why is this so \? the fbi tracks hate crimes on the basis of bias motivation , even if the victim is not part of the group that was targeted the official allows authorities to register a hate crime under one of five categories race , ethnicity \( including hispanic identity \) , religion , sexual orientation or disability within those five categories are 22 subcategories , none of them designated antisikh thus the fbi classifies antisikh crimes as antiislamic \( muslim \) we call on the fbi to begin tracking antisikh violence this does not require legislation or executive order since the original enactment of the hate crime statistics act of 1990 , the fbi has updated its reporting methods for example , the bureau has revised its approach to tracking hate crimes based on sexual orientation , and now includes antilgbt , antiheterosexual and antibisexual along with the antigay and antilesbian subcategories the legacy of antisikh violence and its contemporary prevalence make it painfully obvious that antisikh violence is often purposeful and targeted the government must begin tracking and counting antisikh hate crimes , just as it must continue to vigorously combat bias and discrimination against all americans , including muslims we must do away with a flawed and incomplete assumption of mistaken identity regarding sikhs until we do , we will all be the ones who are mistaken
london american voters have been alerted to be on the lookout for sinister strangers lurking near polling places next tuesday they may be part of a crack team sent from europe to snoop on the election the authorities in texas and iowa have warned that the foreigners could be arrested on sight if they approach a polling place , and a senior georgia official has said that anyone who sees something improper going on should report it immediately the prospect of outsiders from europe of all places attempting to interfere in the democratic process sounds like the stuff of conservative american nightmares it turns out , however , that european observers have been present at us national elections for a decade , since president george w bush first invited them in  this year s visitors are members of an election monitoring team from the organization for security and cooperation in europe , a 56nation grouping of which the united states is a member the international team , led by a dutch diplomat , has been on the ground since early october the organization s office for democratic institutions and human rights , based in warsaw , monitors elections worldwide to ensure they are fair as in previous election years , it has received an official invitation from the united states most us officials have taken a relaxed attitude to the europeans presence a pair of observers looked in on kansas last month but was not expected back i looked at it as some europeans that were curious at how we succeed in doing what we do , by holding free and open elections , bruce newby , the wyandotte county election commissioner , said  some officials have been less understanding greg abbott , the texas attorney general , wrote to daan everts , head of the 57member observer mission , to warn him that the osce s representatives are not authorized by texas law to enter a polling place it may be a criminal offense for osce s representatives to maintain a presence within 100 feet of a polling place s entrance conservatives are concerned that the europeans have been in touch with civil rights groups , which have told the monitors of a coordinated political effort to disenfranchise millions of americans through a campaign of voter suppression in what is expected to be a very close election greta van susteren of the rightleaning fox news complained the election is none of their business we ought to be able to police our own election that may have reflected a natural resistance to seeing the united states being put under the spotlight by an organization that includes the likes of belarus , kazakhstan and russia the controversy over the osce presence might nevertheless have been heightened this year by a tone of europebashing in the campaign of mitt romney , the republican challenger in his latest swipe at the old continent , mr romney was quoted as telling a rally in roanoke , virginia , this week if you re an entrepreneur and you re thinking of starting up a business , you need to ask yourself is america on the same road as greece \? are we on the path to an economic crisis like that we re seeing in europe , in italy and spain \? it cannot have helped the republican mood that opinion polls consistently show europeans would overwhelmingly choose president obama if they had the vote \( my colleague mark mcdonald wrote on rendezvous last week that the feeling is global \) bruce walker , a commentator for the american thinker , gave a conservative view of the continent in a column on friday our next president will have a very important task dealing with the looming disaster which is europe , he wrote portraying a region afflicted by debt , separatism and muslim immigration , he warned the potential disaster of a complete meltdown of europe will affect our nation in ways that ought to alarm all americans
in the most recent on abortion , as many americans described themselves as prolife as called themselves prochoice a combined 58 percent of americans stated that abortion should either be illegal in all circumstances or legal in only a few circumstances these results do not vary appreciably by in the first gallup poll to show a slight prolife majority , conducted in may 2009 , half of american women described themselves as prolife but if you 've followed the media frenzy surrounding the susan g komen for the cure foundation s decision which it backpedaled from , with an apology , after a wave of frankly brutal coverage to discontinue about 700 , 000 in funding for planned parenthood , you would think all these millions of antiabortion americans simply do not exist from the nightly news shows to print and online media , the coverage s tone alternated between wonder and outrage wonder that anyone could possibly find planned parenthood even remotely controversial and outrage that the komen foundation had politicized the cause of women s health that ubiquitous pink ribbon is sporting a black eye today , claire shipman announced on thursday , while diane sawyer nodded along on msnbc , dressed down the komen foundation s founder , nancy brinker i have to tell you , mitchell said , this is shocking to a lot of your longtime supporters how could this have taken place \? in story after story , journalists explicitly passed judgment on komen for creating a controversy where none need ever have existed conservative complaints about media bias are sometimes overdrawn but on the abortion issue , the press s prejudices are often absolute , its biases blatant and its blinders impenetrable in many newsrooms and television studios across the country , planned parenthood is regarded as the equivalent of , well , the komen foundation an apolitical , highminded and humanitarian institution whose work no rational person and certainly no selfrespecting woman could possibly question or oppose but of course millions of americans including , yes , millions of american women do oppose planned parenthood they oppose the 300 , 000plus abortions it performs every year \( making it the largest abortion provider in the country \) , and they oppose its tireless opposition to even modest limits on abortion it s true that abortion is only one of the services planned parenthood provides \( although mammograms , it should be noted , are not necessarily among them the group usually provides referrals , but not the mammogram itself , which is komen s founder had cited for discontinuing the grant \) but abortion is hardly an ittybitty and purely tangential aspect of its mission , as many credulous journalists have implied planned parenthood likes to claim that abortion accounts for just 3 percent of its services , for instance , and this statistic has been endlessly but the who received an abortion is probably closer to 1 in 10 , and planned parenthood s , plausibly , that between 30 and 40 percent of its health center revenue is from abortion by way of comparison , the organization also refers pregnant women for adoption in 2010 , this happened 841 times , against 329 , 445 abortions for the minority of americans who have no moral qualms about using surgery or chemicals to put an end to a growing embryo or fetus , there should be nothing troubling in these numbers and if you think abortion rights are more important to female health and flourishing than the nearly 2 billion the pink ribbon has raised for breast cancer research , komen deserved your scorn and planned parenthood deserves your donations mayor michael bloomberg just pledged to planned parenthood that s obviously his right before komen backtracked , the yale school of public health said its invitation to brinker to speak at commencement was that s certainly any school s prerogative but reporters have different obligations even if some forms of partiality are inevitable , journalists betray their calling when they simply ignore selfevident truths about a story three truths , in particular , should be obvious to everyone reporting on the komenplanned parenthood controversy first , that the fight against breast cancer is unifying and completely uncontroversial , while the provision of abortion may be the most polarizing issue in the united states today second , that it s no more political to disassociate oneself from the nation s largest abortion provider than it is to associate with it in the first place third , that for every american who greeted komen s shift with anger and outrage \( as andrea mitchell put it \) , there was probably an american who was relieved and gratified indeed , that sense of relief was quantifiable the day after the controversy broke , komen reported that its daily dramatically but of course , you would n't know that from most of the media coverage after all , the people making those donations do n't exist
goma , democratic republic of congo the lights are out in most of goma there is little water the prison is an empty , garbagestrewn wasteland with its rusty front gate swinging wide open and a threefoot hole punched through the back wall , letting loose 1 , 200 killers , rapists , rogue soldiers and other criminals now , rebel fighters are going house to house arresting people , many of whom have not been seen again by their families you say the littlest thing and they disappear you , said an unemployed man named luke in the past week , the rebels have been unstoppable , steamrolling through one town after another , seizing this provincial capital , and eviscerating a dysfunctional congolese army whose drunken soldiers stumble around with rocketpropelled grenades and whose chief of staff was suspended for selling crates of ammunition to elephant poachers riots are exploding across the country in bukavu , butembo , bunia , kisangani and kinshasa , the capital , a thousand miles away mobs are pouring into streets , burning down government buildings and demanding the ouster of congo s weak and widely despised president ,  once again , chaos is courting congo and one pressing question is , why after all the billions of dollars spent on , the passed on capitol hill to cut the link between the illicit mineral trade and insurrection , and all the aid money and diplomatic capital is this vast nation in the heart of africa descending to where it was more than 10 years ago when foreign armies and marauding rebels carved it into fiefs \? we have n't really touched the root cause , said aloys tegera , a director for the , a research institute in goma he said congo s chronic instability is rooted in very local tensions over land , power and identity , especially along the rwandan and ugandan borders but no one wants to touch this because it s too complicated , he added the most realistic solution , said another congo analyst , is not a formal peace process driven by diplomats but a peace among all the dons , like don corleone imposed in new york congo s problems have been festering for years , wounds that never quite scabbed over but last week there was new urgency after hundreds of rebel fighters , wearing rubber swamp boots and with beltfed machine guns slung across their backs , marched into goma , the capital of north kivu province and one of the country s most important cities the rebels , called the m23 , are a heavily armed paradox on one hand , they are ruthless human rights groups have documented how they have slaughtered civilians , pulling confused villagers out of their huts in the middle of the night and shooting them in the head on the other hand , the m23 are able administrators seemingly far better than the congolese government , evidenced by a visit in recent days to their stronghold , rutshuru , a small town about 45 miles from goma in rutshuru , there are none of those ubiquitous plastic bags twisted in the trees , like in so many other parts of congo the gravel roads have been swept clean and the government offices are spotless handpainted signs read m23 stop corruption the rebels even have green thumbs , planting thousands of trees in recent months to fight soil erosion we are not a rebellion , said benjamin mbonimpa , an electrical engineer , a bush fighter and now a top rebel administrator we are a revolution their aims , he said , were to overthrow the government and set up a more equitable , decentralized political system this is why the rebels have balked at negotiating with mr kabila , though this weekend several rebels said that the pressure was increasing on them to compromise , especially coming from western countries on sunday , rebel forces and government troops were still squared off , just a few miles apart , down the road from goma the m23 rebels are widely believed to be covertly supported by rwanda , which has a long history of meddling in congo , its neighbor blessed with gold , diamonds and other glittering mineral riches the rwandan government strenuously denies supplying weapons to the m23 or trying to annex eastern congo rwanda has often denied any clandestine involvement in this country , only to have the denials later exposed as lies many people in goma do n't like the fact that the m23 is so closely linked to rwanda , with rwandanspeaking soldiers strutting around this city as if they own it which they do right now but the venom toward mr kabila seems even greater he treats us like street kids , said kalimbiro kambere , a police officer who makes only 50 a month , despite 37 years in service no one wants to fight for him few countries in the world have been as disastrously ruled as congo western interference has not helped from the 1880s when king leopold ii of belgium turned congo into an enormous labor camp to produce as much rubber and ivory as possible , to the violence in the goma area today , which may have been set into motion by a miscalculation on the part of western ambassadors last november , mr kabila ran for reelection he was widely unpopular , suspected of hoarding millions if not billions of dollars from mineral deals and leaving the bridges , roads , hospitals and schools a fiasco during the election , his agents were caught redhanded stuffing ballot boxes , and his soldiers gunned down opposition supporters who protested but western diplomats , though expressing unhappiness , did not press the case several congolese and western rights advocates and analysts said that the diplomatic corps then urged mr kabila to arrest , a rwandanspeaking army general nicknamed the terminator , who had been a commander in several brutal rebel groups and was wanted for years by the international criminal court on war crimes charges kabila miscalculated , mr tegera said and so did the west they pressured him in march , as mr kabila began to move against mr ntaganda and threatened to dislodge the rwandanspeaking rebels who had been incorporated into the national army , they were far more powerful than the government expected , and united nations officials said the rebels quickly drew reinforcements from rwanda they seized town after town , culminating in goma , where power lines were cut in the fighting , casting it into darkness at each battle , the government army unraveled the bodies of government soldiers now litter the roads around goma , someone s father or son rotting in the bush , eye sockets and mouth sizzling with flies villagers trudge past , looking away for them , misery is a familiar face on friday , alfonse kiburura stood in front of his twig and tarp hut in a camp for displaced people the rains are falling hard now , every day his family curls up on a floor of cold , wet mud this was the second time this year that the kibururas have had to pick up everything they own , throw it over their heads and dash down the road away from the combat mr kiburura said that as soon as his 5yearold son , destin , heard gunfire , the boy knew what to do this is n't the first time he s heard gunshots , he said he s heard them many times before
gettysburg , pa it may seem an odd choice , holding a rally here in pennsylvania to celebrate the results of the republican presidential primary in illinois s staff said that he came here tuesday night for a symbolic connection to the land of lincoln , as gettysburg is the very place president lincoln gave his most poignant and passionate defense of freedom and the american spirit but mr santorum also came here to plant the flag the pennsylvania primary is not until april 24 , but it is essential that mr santorum , who represented the state for 16 years in washington , win here if he is to have any hope of moving forward , particularly after his loss tuesday night in the illinois primary despite the loss , mr santorum sounded defiant tuesday night while speaking to supporters in gettysburg , saying he would press on we have five weeks to a big win , he said of the pennsylvania primary , and he returned again to the theme of his parents and grandparents who worked in the mines , men and women who worked and scraped and clawed so their children could have a better quality of life while early polling in pennsylvania shows him leading , newt gingrich and ron paul in the popular vote , he has cause for concern in the more important contest for the state s 72 delegates they can vote for anyone at the party s nominating convention in august in tampa , fla some are in fact uncommitted , but many have connections to the state party and the establishment , which leans toward mr romney by coming here tuesday , mr santorum could focus on trying to trying to persuade some of those uncommitted delegates to commit to his side this will give him a chance to sit down around the table and say , let s go through the list of who we 've got lined up and who we have to go back to and revisit and work on , ' said one person close to the santorum campaign who spoke on the condition that he not be identified there will be assignments from tonight , go back to visit with people , talk to your guys , ' and rick will be reaching out to folks in a conference call with reporters on tuesday , john brabender , mr santorum s top strategist , said the campaign was cautiously optimistic that we will win the primary and we 'll win a majority of delegates but for some in the party , mr santorum may be a tough sell to pennsylvania voters he lost his last senate race here in 2006 by more than 17 percentage points , and that has spooked some into thinking that if he was the presidential nominee , he could drag down other republican candidates in november there s a serious concern if he were at top of ticket he would jeopardize the attorney general , the auditor general and some house seats , said charles gerow , a former santorum ally who now heads mr gingrich s campaign in pennsylvania his loss in 2006 is not that far away in the minds of many pennsylvania republicans the romney team has already been active in the state , with endorsements and other events in a conference call last week , phil english , a former congressman from pennsylvania who has backed mr romney , said that none of the members of the pennsylvania delegation who served with mr santorum when he was in the senate had endorsed him for president that may seem like an anomaly , mr english said but the fact is , it is very significant and a strong indicator of what s going on right now in pennsylvania the situation here perfectly illustrates the importance of organization and longterm planning the april 24 ballot will be divided in two a socalled beauty contest and the race for delegates there is no indication on the ballot which candidate the delegate is supporting mr santorum seems likely to win the beauty contest but lara brown , a political scientist at villanova university , said his lack of money and organization would catch up with him in the delegate contest even though we , as americans , like the idealistic notion that underdogs' can jump in and win , she said , the reality of history and as a result of the complexity of the process is that they do n't frontrunners tend to win nominations , and it often takes several years to become a frontrunner
, the special envoy whose peace plan for ending the increasingly violent conflict in is paralyzed and at risk of complete collapse , asked the united nations security council on wednesday to threaten the syrian government and the rebels with consequences for failure to comply mr annan made his request as new evidence emerged of fracturing in the government of president of syria , which has faced a slow but growing rash of defections and desertions the latest was syria s ambassador to , nawaf fares , who issued a statement reported by al jazeera and reuters that he had resigned and had renounced his membership in mr assad s syrian baath party i urge all honest members of this party to follow my path because the regime has turned it to an instrument to kill people and their aspiration to freedom , mr fares said in the statement from an unidentified location there was no immediate comment from the syrian government on the defection , the first by a syrian ambassador since the uprising broke out in march 2011 the security council has already passed two resolutions that request compliance with mr annan s plan but do not carry coercive pressure you should insist on implementation of your decisions , and send a message to all that there will be consequences for noncompliance , mr annan , who represents the united nations and arab league , told the council mr annan did not specify that the council should threaten measures under chapter 7 of its charter , which authorizes economic sanctions , and if necessary , military action , as was done in the libyan conflict last year but his request quickly laid bare the makings of a potential confrontation among the five permanent members of the council , whose effort to speak in a unified way on the syria conflict has often masked serious divisions representatives of the united states , britain and france said they would address mr annan s request with a resolution that included chapter 7 sanctions but russia and china , which have twice blocked such coercive measures , were expected to resist russia , the syrian government s most important foreign supporter , circulated its own draft resolution that does not include the chapter 7 provision alexander pankin , the ranking russian diplomat at the security council , said that mr annan had asked that the council speak in a united and single voice and there will be consequences but consequences does not mean under a certain chapter or certain article mr annan , who spoke to the council by video link from his geneva office after having visited syria , iran and iraq , also said that mr assad was open to the idea of an interlocutor between him and the political opposition , which presumably would allow a dialogue without the two sides' having to directly talk to each other it was not clear whether syria s array of antiassad groups , who have said they would not negotiate with mr assad , would agree to such an idea mr annan addressed the council less than two weeks before the authorization of the 300member observer mission in syria , assigned to monitor a ceasefire and other provisions of the plan , will expire the observers , who are unarmed and have no enforcement authority , suspended work a month ago because both the syrian government and its armed antagonists were ignoring mr annan s plan , and the rising violence had made the mission s work too dangerous both mr annan and the united nations secretary general , ban kimoon , want the council to renew the mission s mandate mr ban has said a withdrawal of the mission would send the wrong signal and encourage more violence while the council is expected to reauthorize the monitors , the size of their group and duration of deployment remain to be negotiated the defection of syria s ambassador to iraq was the second highranking exit from mr assad s government in less than week , following the departure last thursday of manaf tlass , a general in the elite republican guard who is the son of a former defense minister mr fares , who received the baghdad posting in 2008 , was described at the time of his appointment as a wellconnected statesman whose family was rooted partly in the sunni tribal society of iraq s anbar province , which extends to syria s eastern desert news of his defection was slow to emerge al jazeera first reported it in an unattributed dispatch ayad allawi , a prominent sunni politician in iraq and a former interim prime minister , reported later in a reliable sources have informed me of the defection of nawaf fares , the syrian ambassador to iraq burhan ghalioun , a member of executive bureau and former leader of the syrian national council , the main antiassad opposition group , said he had also been made aware of the defection , while visiting moscow with a delegation of opposition figures we welcome the defection of the syrian ambassador to iraq , mr ghalioun said we have called upon highranking officials whether in the military or in the diplomatic service to defect from this regime and join the revolution of dignity both general tlass and ambassador fares were members of a privileged sunni elite in a syrian government dominated by mr assad s minority alawite sect a growing number of other highranking sunnis , mostly from the military , have been leaving syria in recent weeks , reflecting what syrian political analysts have called the increasingly sectarian nature of the conflict while opposition groups are mostly sunni and have called the defections the beginning of the end for mr assad , outside political analysts are more cautious alawites , who represent only about 12 percent of the population , remain intensely loyal to mr assad , and none of his close alawite confidants have abandoned him there are indications to me that the sunni insulation is cracking , said , a syria expert who is a senior fellow at the washington institute for near east policy but these people are not from the core it s an important distinction
mark emmert , the president of the ncaa , answered questions from pete thamel of the times on monday college sports are still heading in a distinct direction financially is this a culture changer today \? well , i certainly hope it is a cautionary tale to all of us that we need to keep our eye on our values we all have to remember that we can t let our love of the games get ahead of the core values , and we know that happens often this is a painful , painful reminder that awful things can happen when that occurs is it almost unfair to use penn state as a normal reflection of college athletics \? certainly some of the mentalities like the iconic coach or an enabling administration carry over but is it almost hard to incorporate lessons from penn state to other places considering how anomalous the actions of sandusky were \? in many ways we have to be very careful about seeing this as a reflection as the state of college athletics the fact is that this case is so shocking because it s also so rare that s a good thing , thank god right \? this case is anomalous in many regards , and we want it to remain so is this decision an outgrowth of the meeting you had here last year with presidents and chancellors where you began to attempt to reform college sports \? the membership , especially the presidential leadership , has done an extraordinary job in the last 11 months of addressing some of the core problems that we have they re just beginning to come to fruition in the coming months as we put them in place , those actions will speak for themselves we first wanted to tackle the notion that studentathletes have to be students , and we stiffened the academic requirements for participation and continuing to play we did that in a speedy action and in a thoughtful way in the august meeting we re going to have the first vote on a completely new enforcement penalty structure and adjudication model that hopefully will be up for final action in october that will have a profound impact on the way we handle our enforcement cases going forward that everyone is very enthusiastic about we are in the midst of a rewrite of our absurdly complex rules that is taking longer , as we knew it would our goal is still by the end of this calendar year to have in front of the membership a very different looking division i rule book if we can accomplish those things and simultaneously act on our values , which is a bit of what this case is about in ways that everyone supports , then i think we ve made some pretty dramatic progress do you think for you , personally , that this is an important day for your presidency \? i don t know it s important that the association get this right to the extent that i m the leader of the association , it s important to me personally but this isn t about who is the president or the chair of the executive committee it s about the group of leaders , and i m not trying to be selfeffacing , this really is a voluntary association i really don t have authority except as provided by those leaders and presidents they are supportive of the directions that we re taking i find that gratifying personally again for you , what s it been like to watch realignment and the playoff unfold and not have a direct impact on them \? i want those things to happen in a way that furthers college sports what s happened so far with the new fbs football playoff model , whatever they re calling it now , i think it s a step in the right direction it was in fact a presidentially led initiative , and i think it will probably be very good for football it ll generate more resources , and then the question is what do you do with those resources if those dollars are used for good purposes and you know my position on full cost of attendance if it s used for that and other things to support students , then i think it s great if it fuels more of the king football culture that can lead to the kinds of problems we re dealing with today , then it s a challenge that s true with basketball , and it s true with everything this is such a difficult topic how did you deal with the visceral emotions when weighing the decision \? no one i ve met or would care to meet could look at this case and be dispassionate completely about it it s just too visceral i m a dad and a granddad , and i react like anyone , what if this happened to one of my children \? but at the same time , the presidents and i who evoked these sanctions today have to do that to the best of our ability i understand how disgusting this is , but let s examine the culture and circumstances that created this let s find the component of it that has to do with intercollegiate athletics and determine what s our role , if any , in that component we don t deal with criminal matters we have 430 , 000 studentathletes and 50 , 000 employees across the country at any given point in time , if anyone is committing a crime , that s none of our business that s the criminal justice system there are people getting punished on campuses all the time that s their business our business is to focus on whether or not the behavior of a program is supporting the integrity and the ethics and values of intercollegiate athletics , and is the institution in control of that program and is it doing the right things \? that s what we re trying to do here , was set aside the crimes and focus on what part of this had anything to do with athletics and that was challenging can you walk me through the machinations of the decisionmaking process \? was it you or the executive committee \? it was clearly a group decisionmaking process i don t want to minimize my role in this because i put a variety of options in front of the executive committee and the board , and we had , as ed ray executive committee chairman said , extensive debate and discussion about every one of those sanctions some were easy to reach resolution on , and some were more challenging everyone immediately liked the notion of the athletic integrity agreement , something that we ve never done before but a model i know from the corporate integrity world and also the enforcement working group had already discussed as a potential tool to be used going forward i hope that s something we can do going forward that one is easy , as we talked about in the press conferences whether or not to levy the suspension was a very active debate can you give me a little bit of a basic timeline after the friday in november you sent this letter out \? first of all obviously , you and i talked about it in alabama seems like six years ago , doesn t it \? it does we re going to watch what everyone was calling the game of the century , and it wound up being not a great game and it gets overshadowed by this , the grand jury indictment after that came out , we here in the building looked at it , talked about it and considered whether or not there s a role for us in it i spent a good deal of time talking to the leadership of the division and the executive committee and we concluded that the appropriate step was to issue the letter that i sent not a formal investigation , through our normal process , but to ask the questions i asked then we mostly sat back penn state was remarkable we asked penn state to keep us informed and whether we could receive information from the freeh group , which they did they were excellent at it so you were getting information as this went along \? they were briefing us but only briefing us we had nothing whatsoever to do with the investigation they were very independent and quite intentionally so , and that was a good thing we were receiving information as it went along , and i and the leadership were keeping track of that and then when the final report came forward then we sat down and said , alright , where do we go from here , and i began conversations with the executive committee so with the freeh report coming out about 10 days ago , did you already have options on the table or did all this happen in a 10day crunch \? it all happened in a 10day time period that s certainly antithetical to the reputation of the ncaa s typical pace , no \? laughs yes i think that s fair
who is happier about life liberals or conservatives \? the answer might seem straightforward after all , there is an entire academic literature in the social sciences dedicated to showing conservatives as naturally authoritarian , dogmatic , intolerant of ambiguity , fearful of threat and loss , low in selfesteem and uncomfortable with complex modes of thinking and it was the candidate barack obama in 2008 who infamously labeled bluecollar voters bitter , as they cling to guns or religion obviously , liberals must be happier , right \? wrong scholars on both the left and right have studied this question extensively , and have reached a consensus that it is conservatives who possess the happiness edge many data sets show this for example , the pew research center in 2006 that conservative republicans were 68 percent more likely than liberal democrats to say they were very happy about their lives this pattern has persisted for decades the question is n't whether this is true , but why many conservatives favor an explanation focusing on lifestyle differences , such as marriage and faith they note that most conservatives are married most liberals are not \( the percentages are 53 percent to 33 percent , according to my calculations using data from the 2004 general social survey , and almost none of the gap is due to the fact that liberals tend to be younger than conservatives \) marriage and happiness go together if two people are demographically the same but one is married and the other is not , the married person will be 18 percentage points more likely to say he or she is very happy than the unmarried person the story on religion is much the same according to the social capital community benchmark survey , conservatives who practice a faith outnumber religious liberals in america nearly four to one and the link to happiness \? you guessed it religious participants are nearly twice as likely to say they are very happy about their lives as are secularists \( 43 percent to 23 percent \) the differences do n't depend on education , race , sex or age the happiness difference exists even when you account for income whether religion and marriage should make people happy is a question you have to answer for yourself but consider this fiftytwo percent of married , religious , politically conservative people \( with kids \) are very happy versus only 14 percent of single , secular , liberal people without kids an explanation for the happiness gap more congenial to liberals is that conservatives are simply inattentive to the misery of others if they recognized the injustice in the world , they would n't be so cheerful in the words of jaime napier and john jost , new york university psychologists , , liberals may be less happy than conservatives because they are less ideologically prepared to rationalize \( or explain away \) the degree of inequality in society the academic parlance for this is system justification the data show that conservatives do indeed see the free enterprise system in a sunnier light than liberals do , believing in each american s ability to get ahead on the basis of achievement liberals are more likely to see people as victims of circumstance and oppression , and doubt whether individuals can climb without governmental help my own analysis using 2005 survey data from syracuse university shows that about 90 percent of conservatives agree that while people may begin with different opportunities , hard work and perseverance can usually overcome those disadvantages liberals even upperincome liberals are a third less likely to say this so conservatives are ignorant , and ignorance is bliss , right \? not so fast , according to from the university of florida psychologists barry schlenker and john chambers and the university of toronto psychologist bonnie le in the journal of research in personality these scholars note that liberals define fairness and an improved society in terms of greater economic equality liberals then condemn the happiness of conservatives , because conservatives are relatively untroubled by a problem that , it turns out , their political counterparts defined imagine the opposite say liberals were the happy ones conservatives might charge that it is only because liberals are unperturbed by the social welfare state s monstrous threat to economic liberty liberals would justifiably dismiss this argument as solipsistic and silly there is one other noteworthy political happiness gap that has gotten less scholarly attention than conservatives versus liberals moderates versus extremists political moderates must be happier than extremists , it always seemed to me after all , extremists actually advertise their misery with strident bumper stickers that say things like , if you 're not outraged , you 're not paying attention ! but it turns out that s wrong people at the extremes are happier than political moderates correcting for income , education , age , race , family situation and religion , the happiest americans are those who say they are either extremely conservative \( 48 percent very happy \) or extremely liberal \( 35 percent \) everyone else is less happy , with the nadir at deadcenter moderate \( 26 percent \) what explains this odd pattern \? one possibility is that extremists have the whole world figured out , and sorted into good guys and bad guys they have the security of knowing what s wrong , and whom to fight they are the happy warriors whatever the explanation , the implications are striking the occupy wall street protesters may have looked like a miserable mess in truth , they were probably happier than the moderates making fun of them from the offices above and none , it seems , are happier than the tea partiers , many of whom cling to guns and faith with great tenacity which some moderately liberal readers of this newspaper might find quite depressing
at 7 am on nov 1 , as the sun was just beginning to rise over a halfblackedout manhattan and just an hour after \( partial \) subway service had returned to the city for the first time in three days , tiki gelana , the women s olympic marathon champion , set out for an eightmile run along the west side highway normally , elite athletes entered in the new york city marathon train in central park , but the park remained closed due to the damage caused by hurricane sandy two days earlier the storm had devastated the new york metropolitan area , but at that time , and to great controversy , the city was still planning to go ahead with the marathon as scheduled the evening before , gelana , 25 , had arrived in town , after a 19hour , 3leg journey an eighthour flight from her home in addis ababa , ethiopia to amsterdam , an eighthour flight from amsterdam to new york , and a threehour car ride from jfk airport to midtown manhattan it would take another day and a half before the city canceled the marathon gelana , who would have gone into this year s race as one of the favorites , is no stranger to nature s devastating power last year i was in nagoya to compete in the nagoya marathon , she wrote by email thursday one day before the race there was the tsunami also at that time of course the marathon was cancelled it wasn t about the race , she wrote of this year s cancellation it was about people suffering from the storm to get help we learn again that we can t control nature \( in place of new york , gelana will race this sunday in the seven hills 15kilometer road race in nijmegen , netherlands she will take on tirunesh dibaba , her countrywoman who won the olympic 10 , 000 meters this year for the second straight time it will be a battle between two of the best women s longdistance runners racing today , though the distance is closer to dibaba s turf than gelana s three years ago , dibaba set the 15 kilometer world record on that same course \) along the west side highway on that early thursday morning after the hurricane , gelana wore a black knit cap , black gloves , a hooded sweatsuit , and pinksoled running shoes , and she received attention from nearly every runner who passed in the opposite direction only so much of her face showed beneath the cap , but she maintained the same smooth gait that the millions who watched her victory in london this summer had seen a high arm carriage that crisscrossed in front of her chest , a perfectly still head , and shoulders so straight you could use them to hang a picture one passing bicyclist might have recognized that gait good luck on sunday ! he shouted to her as he rode by gelana and her coach , getaneh tessema , had set out for a very easy run , just slow enough that an outofshape reporter who used to run marathons could keep up with them , barely one year ago in amsterdam , gelana improved her marathon time , incredibly , by nearly eight minutes , when she won uncontested in 2 22 08 this spring , in rotterdam , she knocked another three minutes off her personal best , set an ethiopian national record , and became the fourth \( now fifth \) fastest woman in history , when she finished in 2 18 58 in august , she won the 2012 olympic marathon , beating the only two women who had run faster than she had in the last two years if she wins in new york , new york road runners chief executive mary wittenberg had said a week before the hurricane , she can lay claim to the world s best woman marathoner today gelana , tessema , and i were joined on our run by gelana s dutch physiotherapist as the four of us made our way south , i pointed across the river to jersey city , where a curfew had been put in place the night before because of the city s overwhelming lack of power , and to hoboken , a flooded city where thousands remained stranded in their homes from our distance , it looked no different than it did on any other day the four of us continued on in silence i was reminded of gelana s olympic victory though our run was nothing but a light one , and none of us was trying to beat the other , there were four of us , and the last five miles of the olympic marathon had come down to a race among four runners gelana and two kenyans , mary keitany and priscah jeptoo , who had led the whole way , and the russian tatyana arkhipova , who was also scheduled to run in new york this year the kenyans were clearly working together even though they were talking in their language , i felt like i understood what they were saying , gelana said in amharic through a translator after our run they wanted to push the pace faster and faster one of gelana s greatest strengths as a marathoner is her finishing speed at rotterdam , she actually ran her final two kilometers one second faster than the men when i saw that there were four of them left , tessema said , i knew that she would win the race after nearly four miles of our run , the dutch physiotherapist was the first one to drop off the pace he d been suffering from a bad knee and had warned us before that he wouldn t be able to go the full distance a halfmile later we reached our turnaround point , deep in the heart of lower manhattan as with jersey city and hoboken across the hudson , you couldn t tell that the area had no electricity , that in the dark of night it looked like a scene out of a zombie apocalypse film instead of one of the world s most vibrant cities i was running alternately alongside and behind gelana , and for a moment i thought that i got the slightest sense of what gelana s opponents might have experienced in london our pace had started out around an eightminute mile but it had gradually picked up and at that point we might have cracked sevenminute miles i was struggling to keep up , but gelana , who at the peak of her training reaches 170 miles per week , strode with the same easy nonchalance she displayed this summer the only difference between what i was going through and what gelana s competitors had was that we had run only four miles at a pace that was pedestrian by every elite standard at the olympics , they d gone more than 20 miles and were running each one around 5 20 at the 25mile mark in london , keitany dropped back , and with about threequarters of a mile left , gelana broke away from her two remaining competitors actually , it wasn t my plan to go at that moment , she said i was thinking , let me see what happens if i press a little bit when i did , they didn t go with me , and i said , why don t i go and i went just before gelana crossed the finish line in london , she raised her hand and blew a kiss to the crowd then she dropped to her knees and rested her head against the pavement at that moment , i was a little bit stunned , she said , laughing and flashing the same warm smile she did throughout our conversation i crossed the line and i had finished first , and i was confused when i bent down , i didn t know what i was doing i still don t know when she returned to ethiopia , she found the entire country in wait for her when you win the olympics , you don t really feel anything , she said but when you go back home , you know you have achieved something because all you see are all the people , this incredible reception it was fantastic close to a hundred thousand people came out to welcome her and her teammates home they met our team at the airport and a car took us to the national stadium , gelana said and the stadium was completely full the ride from the airport there is about five kilometers , and the whole way people were running alongside us yet it might have been asking too much of gelana to win this year s marathon new york would have been her third race at the distance this year , when most everyone agrees that elite marathoners should run no more than two , and it would have come only three months after the olympics i think it will be impossible for tiki to roll off the rotterdam pr and the olympic gold medal performance and run really well in nyc , wittenberg had said gelana thought differently the olympics was not such heavy competition , she said either way , it doesn t stop everyone from wondering what gelana is capable of in the future of course you think about the world record , gelana said of paula radcliffe s mark of 2 15 25 , but you never know what will happen it doesn t matter if it is one hour and thirty minutes , you think about it and then she flashed another sly smile because thinking is allowed , isn t it \? sure , she said and started laughing new yorkers will get another chance to see gelana run in person i don t know yet about my plans for next year , but what i do know for sure is that i will return to new york , she wrote in her email of course for now i have difficult memories about new york , so my journey towards something good there isn t finished yet
the band may be called one direction , but it turns out there are two claimants to that name as a result , the british boy band whose debut cd , up all night , immediately went to the top of the billboard pop chart when it was released last month is being sued by a poprock quartet from california that says it has been in business under that name since 2009 in a suit filed monday in federal court in los angeles , the californiabased one direction requested both 1 million in damages and an injunction to prevent the british band , which came to prominence on simon cowell s television talent show the x factor in 2010 , from continuing to use the name the complaint says that the management of the british quintet knew that the california group had registered the name in the united states but chose to ignore its rights when it decided to enter the american market both mr cowell s company , syco entertainment , and sony records , which released up all night , have declined comment on the suit but there is already some evidence that consumers and the news media are confused by and unable to distinguish the two bands on nbc s today show a recent segment on the british band was introduced with part of 2012 , a song written and recorded by the california group disputes over ownership of band names that are identical or even similar are not uncommon in pop music examples include mountain and mountain bus , dinosaur and dinosaur jr as well as the chemical brothers and the warlocks , which was the original name of the band that became famous as the grateful dead the same goes for pink floyd , which at one point was called the tea set , a name it abandoned when it discovered that another mid'60s band was already performing on the british club circuit under that name when an american and a british band are competing for the same name , disputes have sometimes been resolved by the british band agreeing to add uk to its name or otherwise indicating its nonamerican identity that was the case for the charlatans uk , wham uk and the english beat , which all went on to have some success in the united states under their new names but none of them had a debut record that topped the billboard chart in its first week this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo \( photograph by chris pizzello associated press \)
caucusgoers all over iowa are gathering in their communities tuesday night to pick a republican nominee for president the times s political unit is on the ground in the hawkeye state with the candidates and at the caucus sites to provide live updates and analysis of the 2012 nominating contests follow along on the live dashboard and on twitter \( thecaucus \) , get realtime results and dig deeper into the numbers with fivethirtyeight at just before 3 am eastern time on wednesday , the chairman of the iowa republican party went on television to announce the official result mitt romney had beaten rick santorum by eight votes out of 60 , 022 cast for the two men  the new york times johnston , iowa rick santorum often speaks in biblical terms , weaving references to god and christian faith into his speeches on the campaign trail and before a national audience on tuesday night , he offered a glimpse of how large a theme religion will be in his quest for the republican nomination in a few short minutes , mr santorum quoted cs lewis , the author and christian theologian a friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and can sing it back to you when you ve forgotten the words he made a case for the role faith plays in building strong communities when the family breaks down , the economy struggles and he credited god with his strong showing in the caucuses here for giving me his grace every day , for loving me , warts and all , i offer a public thanks to god mr santorum used his speech on tuesday night , a modified version of the one he has been giving to voters in all 99 counties across iowa over the last several months , to cast the race as a struggle to allow good to prevail and he portrayed president obama as on the opposite side of that fight his supporters , he said , are the same people who president obama talked about clinging to their guns and their bibles thank god they do they share our values about faith and family they understand that when the family breaks down , the economy struggles they understand that when families aren t there to instill values into their children and to their neighbors as little league coaches , as good neighbors , as fathers and mothers being part of the community , that the neighborhood is not safe and they are not free with their votes , you have taken the first step of taking back this country , he said mr santorum , a roman catholic , said he sees that vision carrying him beyond states like new hampshire and south carolina , which will hold their primaries later this month the message i shared with you tonight is not an iowa message or an iowa and south carolina message it is a message that will resonate across this land  jeremy w peters des moines rick perry said tuesday night that he will return to texas to assess whether there is a path for him to continue in the presidential campaign mr perry , the governor of texas , came in fifth in the iowa caucuses , a disappointing finish after quickly but briefly jumping into first place in the race this summer in less than five months , his candidacy went from first to almost last , brought down by several bad debate performances that robbed his campaign of muchneeded momentum mr perry had said he would take the campaign directly to south carolina , skipping new hampshire to fight on in the conservative southern state but mr perry said on tuesday night that he had changed his mind he did not officially drop out of the race , but said he would return to his home in texas to decide what to do this has to be the greatest honor of my life , mr perry said our country was in trouble , and it was my duty to serve my country one more time this campaign has never been about me  michael d shear  the caucus des moines michele bachmann declined to drop out of the republican presidential contest despite having come in last in the iowa caucus , receiving only about five percent of the vote speaking to her supporters , mrs bachmann said that the people of iowa have spoken but she declined to indicate whether she would drop out of the race in the near future , saying that there are many more chapters to be written on our path to the nomination mrs bachmann railed against president obama in her remarks , saying that the country would undo what she called barack obama s socialized medicine she added we have strayed from the vision of our founders view of government  michael d shear des moines nothing quiets the mitt romney crowd like newt gingrich when mr gingrich appeared on the oversize projection screen in the romney caucus night headquarters , the hundreds gathered in the ballroom of the hotel fort des moines grew silent to watch mr gingrich give his caucus night speech they cheered when mr gingrich said that the most important thing in november was beating president obama , but then the catcalls set in when mr gingrich took a moment to congratulate rick santorum , who was still going neck and neck with mr romney for first place , the crowd let out some boos and when mr gingrich said that mr santorum had run a clean campaign unlike some of the candidates a veiled allusion to mr romney , whose super pacs have gone up on the air with negative advertisements an oh no he didn t hiss rippled through the room later , when mr gingrich touted his own campaign for its positive message , saying he d never run negative ads , a man in the crowd quipped , because you don t have the budget the boos subsided to make way for a disappointed hush , when fox news showed that mr santorum had pulled back ahead of mr romney but the sight of the fox news anchors pulling out a calculator and struggling to figure out how many votes mr santorum was ahead by that d be 28 , 201 minus 28 , 056 for you middle school math students cheered up the room , sending a ripple of laughter throughout  ashley parker des moines newt gingrich promised that a great debate in the republican party will begin wednesday in new hampshire as he lashed out at mitt romney as a massachusetts moderate who would not fundamentally fix the country s problems conceding that he had not placed in the top three in iowa , mr gingrich nevertheless vowed to continue and blasted the process of negative campaigning that he said held his campaign down there will be a great debate in the republican party before we are prepared to have a great debate with barack obama , mr gingrich said to an enthusiastic crowd at his election night party mr gingrich vowed to be the one to wage that debate with mr romney , whom he described as too much a part of the washington establishment to change the way the city works he said mr romney would be pretty good at managing the decay but said he would not be able to change the basic structure of the way politics works having said repeatedly over the past several weeks that he will only run a positive campaign , mr gingrich said he will not suddenly turn around and launch gotcha ads but i do reserve the right to tell the truth , he said , and if that seems negative , it is more of a commentary on mr romney s record , he said this is a debate that begins tomorrow , in new hampshire , and will go on for months , he said mr gingrich also promised a showdown with mr paul at the next debates this weekend over the texas congressman s handsoff policy toward iran his views on foreign policy i think are stunningly dangerous for the survival of the united states , mr gingrich said johnston , iowa i m lovin it ! shouted lynn rodgers as she stood in front of a television tuned to fox news a graphic on screen had just shown a tie between mr romney and mr santorum ms rodgers , 47 , from boone , was one of a few hundred supporters who packed into a hotel ballroom here in this des moines suburb waiting for mr santorum to emerge he was at the bottom of my list , she said , echoing the sentiment from many iowans who have switched their votes to mr santorum and when he came to des moines , i said to my husband , well , i guess i ve got to go see him she said she was glad she did he may be a politician , but he s genuine he s honest the energy around her was palpable is the room officially stoked that even this gets a reaction \? said a supporter who merely tapped the microphone and drew cheers from the crowd we pick rick ! they chanted  jeremy w peters des moines ron paul claimed one of the three tickets out of iowa after results showed him trailing the two leaders in the race , mitt romney and rick santorum but even though he didn t take first or second place , he said his was only one of two that can actually raise a national campaign and can raise the money mr paul spoke to his supporters around 10 pm central time and said there was nothing to be ashamed of in placing third in the iowa contest this movement will continue , he pledged mr paul said that his campaign would go on to new hampshire and the other states that follow we will go on , we will raise the money , he said i have no doubt about the volunteers they are going to be there many of his supporters were disappointed that he was on track a thirdplace finish but they did not show any of that , and they hollered for mr paul as he began to speak we love you ron ! one woman shouted preach it ! a man yelled mr paul said the campaign had succeeded in reintroducing some ideas that republicans have needed for a long time this is the conviction that freedom is popular , he said to cheers this movement is going to continue and we are going to keep scoring we will go on , we will raise the money , and i have no doubt about the volunteers he added that he was ready and raring to move on to the next stop , which is new hampshire the crowd remained enthusiastic all night but as the evening wore on , and the results began to show mr santorum and mr romney opening up a small lead on mr paul , some supporters grew worried it s a little disappointing to be in third , said eric thompson , a precinct coordinator for mr paul hopefully we can get back on top by the end of the night , so we can have some momentum in the end , it didn t happen , and now mr paul will focus on new hampshire , where he has a strong organization , but mitt romney has a commanding lead in the polls  michael d shear and richard a oppel jr des moines wait ! stop the presses ! cnn has just projected everything except the top two spots in what may be a first of its kind , the network announced that it was able to project who would come in third through seventh \( in order , according to cnn paul , gingrich , perry , bachmann , huntsman \) but alas with just a fraction of votes separating mitt romney and rick santorum the network \( and everyone else , frankly \) was unable to project the winner that s not cnn s fault the numbers are just that close but it made for a funny tv moment  michael d shear des moines mr romney s ballroom was crowded but largely free of glamour as a group of supporters and grassroots volunteers piled in to wait for the countybycounty returns representative jason chaffetz of utah sat off to the side , gamely giving interviews , and the boston globe s matt viser a dead ringer for mr romney s youngest son , craig wandered around the hotel , looking a lot like , well , craig romney i m wishing for a huckabee chuck norris moment , said a wistful television producer , referring to the caucuses four years ago , when , in a bizarre twist , mike huckabee went onstage more than once to introduce mr norris as the main attraction asked about the evening s star power , an aide staffing the ballroom entrance joked brad pitt is going to be coming through that door in 20 minutes \( we waited , but mr pitt was not forthcoming , though tagg romney turned a few heads as he walked through the hotel corridor \) perhaps the most glamorous attendees of the night were mr romney s team of advance staff members they d traded their usual road warrior clothes for sharp dark suits , and were dashing around whispering into their wristpieces like the men of ocean s eleven  ashley parker ankeny , iowa the crowd here cheered and hollered when the camera showed them on television but as the evening wore on , and the results began to show mr santorum and mr romney opening up a small lead on mr paul , some supporters grew worried it s a little disappointing to be in third , said eric thompson , a precinct coordinator for mr paul hopefully we can get back on top by the end of the night , so we can have some momentum  richard a oppel jr des moines in the hot and overstuffed ballroom of the hotel fort , the crowd was happy and upbeat , an energetic buzz humming through the room as cnn announced that mr romney was leading with 25 percent of the vote and 79 percent of the precincts reporting , a cheer went up mitt ! mitt ! mitt ! they cheered minutes later , when wolf blitzer came on to announce that mr santorum had pulled ahead with a slight lead , a new cheer rippled through the ballroom switch to fox , switch to fox , came the plea fox ! fox ! fox !  ashley parker des moines it s not over yet , and this could yet change but for now , here s your handy travel guide to where the candidates are heading next romney he heads to new hampshire on a charter flight that leaves wednesday morning , but he s not there long after a quick stop , he heads to south carolina for a couple of days before returning to new hampshire for the debates next weekend bachmann , perry both are heading straight to south carolina , where they hope the political reception they get will be warmer than the one they received here paul mr paul has talked about campaigning everywhere , but his next stop is new hampshire , where he thinks his brand of libertarian conservatism will mesh with the live free or die sentiment santorum he s headed to new hampshire , too mr santorum has said he plans to travel straight to the granite state , where he hopes to build on the momentum he received in iowa to challenge mr romney s expected hold on the state gingrich hammered by ads from a groups supporting mr romney , mr gingrich also plans to head straight to new hampshire and when he gets there \? he says he will hit hard on mr romney s record , drawing attention to what he says is mr romney s liberal record  michael d shear des moines as mr santorum s numbers continued to rise throughout the night , a ballroom at the stoney creek inn where his campaign had staged its caucus night party filled with more and more supporters as of about 9 30 pm local time , with only half the precincts across iowa reporting , mr santorum remained huddled in a secondfloor room with his family and his advisers watching the encouraging results stream in on their laptop computers just downstairs , the crowd was breaking into cheers as they watched totals update on cable news many , like linda kilgore of nearby altoona , had decided to support his underdog candidacy just in the last several days everything i believe in , he believes in , said ms kilgore , 58 rick santorum is working for every penny he s got and people like to see that and look , even if it took them until yesterday to realize that , they still came out tonight until just a week ago , few republicans had contemplated the idea of mr santorum as a formidable competitor in the earlyvoting states beyond iowa and probably just as few had predicted that he would be able to pull off a finish near the top here his campaign has insisted that he will be competitive in new hampshire , where he has not been polling well but has plans to travel to on wednesday he has scheduled one of his faith , family and freedom town hall meetings , the same kind he held nearly 400 of in iowa this year , for wednesday night in brentwood , nh his campaign also just announced plans to begin advertising in the state this week , the first time it has been able to do so his advisers have been counting on a strong finish in iowa to help boost fundraising enough to counter what is sure to be a tough fight on the airways in south carolina and florida  jeremy w peters des moines newt gingrich may not be having such a good night , but his wife remains feisty riding in the elevator at the des moines marriott tonight with the new york times columnist maureen dowd , callista gingrich said she s going to new hampshire and then south carolina with her husband bring on the debate , said mrs gingrich , who was wearing a red jacket and carrying her bags  michael d shear clive , iowa precinct 4 in clive remained true to its reputation as a romney stronghold mitt romney got 238 votes , the most by far in second place is rick santorum , with 67 votes ron paul got 53 votes and newt gingrich got the support of 46 voters rick perry and michele bachmann pulled up the rear , earning seven and five votes , respectively jon m huntsman jr got one vote  susan saulny des moines one of the notable features of the republican race throughout the year was how fickle the electorate seemed the polls seem to suggest that many of those voters waited until the last minute to make up their minds entrance polls indicate that nearly half of the caucusgoers decided whom to support within the last few days mr santorum was the candidate who benefited the most from these late deciders a third of them backed him about half of evangelical christians said they made up their minds within the last few days , while a majority of voters who do not describe themselves that way decided on their vote earlier and about half of caucusgoers who strongly support the tea party movement said they decided late , while most voters who are neutral toward the tea party made up their minds earlier  michael d shear des moines it s a waiting game now there s only so much that the entrance polls can tell us when the votes appear to be bunched up so closely together at the top so the candidates and the political reporters and you are all just waiting as the votes trickle in to the iowa republican party from all over the state what to do in the meantime \? head over to the new york times s interactive map and follow along as the number of precincts reporting in each county rise , ever so slowly here are some to watch pottawattamie county that s where council bluffs is located , and only about 30 percent of the precincts are in if rick santorum ultimately does well there , it could raise his numbers polk county home to des moines , the biggest city in the state it s being led by mr paul now , but with only 40 percent of the precincts reporting if mr romney wins here , that s helpful to him linn county mitt romney is leading here with 91 percent of the precincts reporting that s where cedar rapids is another big city look at the western edge of the state sioux city and the rest of the places in the northwest part of the state so far , none of the precincts are in yet that could be helpful to mr santorum if those areas go for him  michael d shear  josh haner here s an update on the voting in black hawk county , one of the largest caucus sites in the state , where all precincts gathered in the 16 , 000seat sports dome at the university of northern iowa and heard directly from newt gingrich and michele bachmann with 62 percent of votes recorded , the results are ron paul \( 474 votes \) , rick santorum \( 366 \) , mitt romney \( 347 \) , mr gingrich \( 266 \)  trip gabriel des moines a year ago , the tea party asserted itself with force , shaping the outcome of the 2010 midterm elections and sweeping in likeminded members of congress now , with the first voting of the 2012 presidential election in motion , a new test of the tea party s continuing influence in the republican party is under way it appears to remain an important part of the electorate , at least in iowa but its influence may have been minimized by the field of candidates , who each gathered support from those who identify with the movement the tea party had strong support among iowa s caucusgoers on tuesday , with over 6 in 10 saying they support or strongly support the movement however , tea party supporters were somewhat divided over candidates and other issues while rick santorum led among tea party supporters , with nearly 3 in 10 backing him , ron paul and mitt romney got the votes of about 2 in 10 tea party supporters nearly 4 in 10 tea party supporters said the economy was the issue that mattered the most in deciding whom to support , while about the same number said the federal budget deficit mattered the most and about 3 in 10 tea party supporters said that a candidate who could defeat barack obama mattered most , while about the same number said a candidate who was a true conservative was most important and over half of tea party supporters said that working in business better prepared a candidate for to serve effectively as president , while just over a third said working in government was the better preparation despite this , rick santorum and ron paul , who are mostly known for their work in government , drew some of their support  michael d shear alton , iowa tom kiernan , the president and chief executive of a local bank , who ran the caucus meeting in this small town in northwest iowa a corner of the state that strongly backed mike huckabee four years ago said he was surprised that the argument made by mitt romney supporters didn t win out i thought the comment about electability would have more influence than it did , he said but we ve proven again that our ultraconservative christian values have spoken to what we want our candidate to be and what values we want our candidate to have  ag sulzberger a look at how different groups voted , broken down by gender , age , income , political philosophy and more  the new york times washington president obama , back in the capital after his holiday break , was making his own speech to iowa voters on tuesday night , telling caucusing democrats that he has kept the promises he made to them four years ago when his win in the democratic caucus there electrified the country and galvanized his run for the white house speaking via a video conference at the capital hilton , mr obama touted the end of the war in iraq , the passage of the national health care law and his efforts to make college more affordable as some of his achievements a woman piped in from cedar rapids how do you respond to people who say you haven t done enough \? that s why we need four more years , mr obama said in all , mr obama took only two questions , and then returned to the white house meanwhile , the democratic national committee took out an advertisement in the des moines register calling the policies presented by the republican candidates for president terrible  helene cooper des moines a quick note of thanks here the quick polling notes are courtesy of the hardworking folks at our polling unit dalia sussman , allison kopicki and david jones the numbers are still coming in , and we ll post more as the night wears on  michael d shear ames , iowa aaron hintz , 32 , stood up and raised his fist in the air in triumph , as he heard the announcement that ron paul won the precinct here , beating mitt romney eventually other people will come around to ron paul , he said , smiling as people got up to leave he s not someone you can learn about in five minutes just minutes before , six men crowded around a table in the lobby of the auditorium , counting the ballots , a process that took longer than the entire speech process the final tally paul 35 votes romney 30 votes gingrich 26 votes perry 9 votes santorum 21 votes huntsman 5 votes bachmann 2 votes mack c shelley , the director of graduate studies in the political science department at iowa state university , said he was a little surprised by the turnout , because the majority of university dorms have not reopened after the holiday he thought the low turnout from young voters might hurt mr paul s chances here he must have a much stronger base of support here , he said  steven yaccino mr romney is getting the most support among iowa caucusgoers who say that defeating mr obama is the most important quality in a candidate nearly half of voters who said defeating the president was the most important factor in choosing a candidate said they were casting their support for mr romney mr romney s business experience seems to have helped him attract voters concerned about the economy among voters who said the economy was the issue that mattered most in deciding whom to support , a plurality , about 3 in 10 said they would support mr romney he also garnered over a third of caucusgoers , a plurality , who said that working in business better prepares a candidate to serve effectively as president he is also seeing support from older caucusgoers in iowa among those 65 and older , he has a plurality , with 3 in 10 voters over 65 , and about a quarter of voters between 45 and 64 years old and mr romney gets a plurality among highincome caucusgoers , with over a third of those making 100 , 000 or more saying they support him about 3 in 10 voters who said they liked their candidate but with reservations said they supported mr romney tonight , and about 2 in 10 voters who said they strongly favored their candidate were supporting him  allison kopicki des moines ron paul is drawing huge support among young people , according to early entrance poll reports just over half of caucusgoers under age 30 support him , a huge number in such a crowded field mr paul s support diminishes with age , dropping to just over 1 in 10 among voters age 65 and older , a group that favors mr romney nearly 4 in 10 caucusgoers say they have never attended a caucus before again , this is a big group for mr paul firsttime caucusgoers back him by more than two to one over any other candidate mr paul has long appealed to collegeage students with his libertarian message and a techiefriendly approach that has rewarded him with a commanding presence online and with contributions his web presence and search engines have helped his campaign , which taps into the younger more techsavvy community that tends to be comfortable online other groups helping to boost mr paul include independents , lowerincome voters , voters who say the budget deficit was the most important issue to their vote , voters looking for a true conservative and voters who made up their minds early des moines an energetic rick perry sought to whip up his supporters at a caucus location in clive , urging them to work together to get our country back i ll promise you this , mr perry said , reprising a line he has used repeatedly as he campaigned in this state you have my back in this caucus and for the next four years , i ll have your back in washington dc  michael d shear des moines voting at the caucuses across the state doesn t start until after every candidate s representatives have a chance to speak their mind and they are speaking and speaking some more reporters at several locations report that the speeches are taking longer than expected in some cases , there were so many people that it took time to file into the auditoriums in other cases , the speeches were just longwinded we are running pretty late here , reports the times s michael barbaro , who is in pella speeches for each candidate just halfway in as a result , it s now nearly an hour into the caucuses , and in some locations , the voting hasn t even begun yet once it does begin , the voting will go quickly but then the counting begins and that could take awhile  michael d shear  josh haner des moines it looks like a similar proportion of evangelical voters is turning out for the caucuses this year , as compared to the four years ago according to preliminary entrance poll results , nearly 6 in 10 voters consider themselves evangelical or bornagain christians that could be good news for the candidates who had considered those voters to be their strongest supporters , like mr santorum , mrs bachmann and mr perry about half of the caucusgoers have a college degree or postgraduate education , while about 2 in 10 said they had a high school education or less just less than twothirds of voters have incomes over 50 , 000 , and just over a third said their family income is under 50 , 000 nearly twothirds of caucusgoers said that campaign advertising was a factor in deciding whom to support and nearly 3 in 10 said it was an important factor that would help quantify the impact of the negative ads that were run against mr gingrich , who was at the top of the polls a month ago but fell after being hammered on television  michael d shear cedar falls , iowa mr gingrich and mrs bachmann concluded their brief speeches to perhaps 1 , 000 early arrivals at the black hawk county caucus site before the voting began at 7 pm mr gingrich s delivery was slower , more measured than the punchedup stump speeches he has been giving for days , perhaps a concession to the setting , a large basketball arena reminiscent of a convention hall he touched on the familiar themes of recent days , speaking of his role working with ronald reagan to turn around the economy and , in a new twist tonight , defeat the soviet empire he asked voters to imagine who they would most like to debate president obama and refute his policies , his values and his ideas without naming names , he asked voters to reject rival republican candidates who had run negative campaigns , and thereby send a signal to americans before he spoke , mrs bachmann gave an impassioned speech that seemed to lift her a foot out of her heels standing with her mother beside her , she appealed to iowans as a native of the state she was born here in black hawk county and described america as historically a christian country , for whom generations had sacrificed , lately under siege from president obama s socialism i believe in jesus christ , she said i believe in standing up to protect human life from conception until natural death i believe in the traditional definition of marriage as one man , one woman stand up , america , stand up , she said , rising to a rousing finish reclaim our country there were a few minutes for both candidates to shake hands with knots of admirers , and then , before the first votes were cast , mr gingrich was back on a bus for the twohour drive to des moines , where he was scheduled to speak at a party for his workers and supporters before an 11 pm flight to manchester , nh  trip gabriel clive , iowa jackie gingrich cushman broke into tears while speaking on her father s behalf he loves his country so much , and he knows we re in trouble , she said , sobbing , her voice cracking she had been telling a story about how mr gingrich braved icy water to save his drowning dogs she pulled herself together and ended on a high note she denounced the very deceptive ads against her father , but compared him to the energizer bunny , he just keeps going and going  susan saulny des moines senator john thune of south dakota is at the same elementary school in ankeny where ron paul spoke just a few minutes ago mr thune , a top supporter of mr romney , did not criticize his rivals they are good , quality people they would all be an improvement over what we have in the white house today , mr thune said but , he asked , who is the one best position , best prepared , best qualified to defeat barack obama \? i believe that person is governor romney  michael d shear clive , iowa robert paul , grandson of ron paul , is yet another surprise guest the young mr paul can hardly reach the microphone he did not give his age , but he appears to be about 9 years old all we need is your vote , he said and thank you for all your help and support kelly paul , wife of senator rand paul of kentucky , is speaking now she is talking about her fatherinlaw s early support of ronald reagan ron is the only candidate in this race to predict the economic collapse years before it happened , she said we re standing at a crossroads of our nation s history ron paul is the only candidate you can trust to put an end to the uncontrollable spending  susan saulny des moines here are some early numbers from the entrance polls , crunched by the crack new york times polling unit according to preliminary entrance poll results , male and older voters made up a majority of caucusgoers tonight about 6 in 10 caucus goers were over 50 just over 1 in 10 were younger than 30 nearly twothirds of caucusgoers support the tea party movement , with more than a third saying they strongly support the tea party movement just about 1 in 10 oppose the tea party movement , and a quarter are neutral more than 7 in 10 caucus attendees are republicans , and almost 3 in 10 said they were independents or something else nearly half of iowan caucusgoers said they consider themselves very conservative , a third consider themselves somewhat conservative and just about 2 in 10 said they are moderate  michael d shear des moines ron paul showed up at crocker elementary school in ankeny just now his message small , limited government conservative to me means small government , mr paul told a gymnasium full of caucusgoers we ve gotten into our problems because we ve had too many people not obeying the constitution mr paul urged them to support him as he waged the final minutes of his iowa campaign we have to retrench and get our economic system in order , he said  michael d shear ames , iowa speeches have ended mitt romney and ron paul received the loudest applause the members of the crowd are filling out their ballots  steven yaccino clive , iowa the romney campaign considered clive a stronghold , so it is interesting that mr santorum chose this location for his first pitch of the night ralph reed , leader of the faith and freedom coalition , just showed up , too i really just wanted to come by and say thank you on behalf of activists all over america  susan saulny alton , iowa not one person rose here to speak on behalf of mrs bachmann , who briefly led in the polls , backed by her strong evangelical support the silence following the mention of herman cain and jon huntsman was broken only by a barely suppressed chuckle afterward , people began speaking on behalf of the other candidates , mentioning the debating prowess of mr gingrich and mr paul s antiabortion record  ag sulzberger clive , iowa as mr santorum was speaking , someone accidentally turned the lights off there were gasps and sighs i ll take that as a sign ! he joked the lights went back on after a few seconds being here in iowa has made me a better candidate , he went on don t sell america short don t put someone out there from iowa who isn t capable of doing what america needs done mr santorum spoke about his socially conservative credentials , saying that america s culture , economy and national security are built on strong families you can t have limited government if you don t have free people who have strong values and strong families , he said , calling himself a leader on moral and economic issues i hope you will paint tonight in bold colors i hope that you give us an opportunity to do that  susan saulny ames , iowa after some initial mic problems , the caucus begins we re going to try to find a way to get a new president , said roman lynch , 62 , a volunteer , after explaining how the caucus is going to work no one in the crowd raised a hand to give a speech supporting michele bachmann no volunteers for jon m huntsman jr either so we moved on to newt gingrich the crowd heckled a gingrich supporter for listing problems with other candidates instead of the pros of a gingrich presidency  steven yaccino clive , iowa rick santorum has made a surprise appearance , speaking for himself now it is great to be here , he said , accompanied by two of his sons , john and daniel he mentioned that he had completed 381 town hall meetings it was iowa nice every day  susan saulny alton , iowa as voters strolled into the firehouse , they were greeted by volunteers for mr santorum and mr perry , who handed out glossy literature and politely asked for their support a young married couple with local roots , jenn and mike vermeer , said they had decided to support mr santorum only recently after hearing his unequivocally antiabortion message at an event the volunteer for mr perry , wally kinney , had traveled here from austin to support his governor we re here for the undecided people , said ms vermeer , 24 , an event planner and there s a lot of them , added mr kinney , 59 , a retired consultant inside , a volunteer for mr paul sat on a chair making changes to a speech drafted by the campaign to make it appeal more to the local voters i m trying to appeal more to the prolife and christian conservatives because there s a lot of that here , said the volunteer , matt laverman , 24 , who was recently elected to the city council the other candidates showed no sign of having any representatives with all the candidates going up and down it s been a roller coaster , said cindy klein , 57 , a nurse so i ve decided i m going with the safe candidate i am going with romney we have to beat obama that s the key  ag sulzberger clive , iowa there s no more room hundreds of voters are packed shoulder to shoulder here in clive the caucus has officially begun , but people are still in line outside waiting to get in problem is , there s nowhere for them to go the scene here would make a fire marshal nervous , that s for sure  susan saulny ames , iowa the lobby of the city auditorium here is getting crowded , as volunteers try to shoo caucusgoers into the 800person auditorium at least five people are waiting to register for the first time despite the crowd , enthusiasm seems low the twominute warning was just announced many people , though friendly , look around before admitting who they re voting for i felt if i did not become a ron paul supporter , i would be voting for national suicide , said dino curcio , 53 , boldly before leaning in closer to whisper his name the age range is mixed , from 20somethings to the elderly mr paul , who is known for his devoted following among young people , has a number of fans here already he s the only man who fights for our freedoms and our liberties , said russell harder , 23 , who just arrived with another paul supporter  steven yaccino des moines the polls are now open the doors to the caucus locations across the state opened at 7 pm central time stay tuned to this live blog for more dispatches from inside the caucuses , and for analysis of the results as we get them  michael d shear clive , iowa in the battle for hearts and minds at the caucuses , it s literally neighbor against neighbor in a \( friendly , for now \) fight to the finish louann and kent sandburg came to the caucus in clive with their nextdoor neighbors dee and jerry warren and although the four sat together chatting and laughing and have a very nice relationship across their fence , they had not discussed politics until a nosy reporter came butting into their lives there s a reason why it s a secret ballot , mr sandburg said with a sly grin he would not discuss his candidate , but the warrens said they were voting for newt gingrich speaking of mr gingrich , his daughter jackie gingrich cushman is here she is going to speak on her father s behalf and try to sway the crowd , which has grown almost to the room s capacity of 300 she said her father was in high spirits tonight don lutz is another voter who arrived early he calls himself a newt guy but said he would not be casting a vote that way he plans to vote for mitt romney i don t want to have a vote for nothing , said mr lutz , who works in real estate i just don t think that newt is going to be there in the end when i look at the business side of things , mitt is probably the most qualified  susan saulny des moines newt gingrich just spoke to caucusgoers at the university of northern iowa in cedar falls , saying he was the only one who could stand up to president obama s billiondollar campaign he also urged voters to reward what he called his relentlessly positive campaign and to punish anyone mitt romney might have been who he had in mind who has run what he called a viciously negative campaign you have a chance , tonight , to send a signal to america that the constantdriven , viciously negative campaigns are totally wrong , mr gingrich said mr gingrich said the conservative movement has an opportunity to take advantage of all of president obama s weaknesses , and urged caucusgoers to vote for him  michael d shear pella , iowa an informal , unscientific but perhaps telling data point of five couples interviewed here in pella , four of them said they would vote for rick santorum tonight , citing his strong conservative track record on social issues like gay marriage and abortion  michael barbaro alton , iowa at the double d bar in alton , politics was the topic of the day , and if there was one thing everyone agreed on , it was that the current field of candidates was underwhelming a bastion of evangelical conservatism in sioux county , in the northwest part of the state , alton strongly supported mike huckabee four years ago , awarding him 53 percent of the vote and though president obama won the state in the general election , he received less than a quarter of the vote here at one table , six residents enjoying beers after work said they wanted a new president , but none planned to attend the caucus at the firehouse a block away santorum is the closest thing we have to huckabee , said richard vander wel , 47 , an insurance and investment broker but there s not as much excitement  ag sulzberger ames , iowa just down the street from iowa state university , caucusgoers started trickling into the city auditorium in downtown ames the campus was dark , a ghost town with many student still on holiday break for another week some here are nervous that not many young voters will turn out tonight the auditorium is an old school from the 1970s that this midsized college town now uses for the central iowa symphony and other community events volunteers here expect around 300 caucusgoers  steven yaccino pella , iowa at pella christian high school , an hour drive east of des moines , hundreds of voters walking through the front doors were met by volunteers for ron paul and rick santorum have you decided \? asked one of the ron paul supporters handing out leaflets yes , thank you , answered trudy van wyck , 60 , who waved off the papers i ve gotten 2 , 000 calls already in an interview , it became clear why she had politely brushed off advocates for mr paul like a number of people interviewed in this heavily conservative , evangelical town , ms van wyck said she intended to vote for mr santorum  michael barbaro cedar falls , iowa the campaign buses of representative michele bachmann and newt gingrich arrived together outside the arena of university of northern iowa here , which is the site of one of the largest caucuses in the state as many as 7 , 000 people are expected from black hawk county the floor of the basketball palace is partioned by ward and precinct , with other precincts sitting together in the bowl of spectator sections the candidates drew straws for speaking order mrs bachmann will address the crowd at 6 20 pm central time she has only five minutes , and then it will be mr gingrich s turn at 6 25 surrogates for the other candidates have already begun to speak , including the evangelical leader bob vander plaats on behalf of rick santorum a very random sample of voters taking their seats showed a crosssection of the latest polling results , with the perhaps unsurprising twist that all the couples agreed with one another scott breakenridge , the owner of a cemetery memorial business , said he was voting for mr romney he s honest , trustworthy , a businessman , he said i feel the same , said his wife , judy carroll kienol , who is semiretired , said he was leaning toward rick perry but could be convinced to change his mind i teetered a little bit , but the only reason was because he hasn t been to washington before , mr kienol said of mr perry but i realized we had another governor from texas without washington experience his wife , who declined to give her name , said she would vote for mr perry because he s very conservative , i like his faith sue and david bloemsma , owners of a child care center , had narrowed it down to a choice between mr gingrich and mr romney mr bloemsma said i m really leaning to romney i just don t know if newt can get over all the hurdles if mitt had newt s brain , i d think we d be in  trip gabriel clive , iowa this welltodo suburban town of 15 , 000 on the western edge of metropolitan des moines straddles two counties dallas and polk what might make tonight interesting is that dallas county went for mitt romney in 2008 , but mike huckabee carried polk about 5 30 pm , people began trickling into the basement conference room of a financial management company where the caucus will be held rosalea and richard grassman were the eager couple who were first to arrive , seated and settled with more than an hour to go before the festivities begin this precinct is expecting 800 people in a room with a capacity for only 300 , so it was smart for them to get here early four years ago , people were sitting on the floor , people were against the walls and we couldn t see anything , said mrs grassman , 84 , whose first caucus was for jog your memories , folks , she admits that it was a long time ago dwight eisenhower we re actually hoping for a big turnout and for people to be able to speak their minds without any problems , said mrs grassman , a retired secretary we hope our man wins , of course who s their man \? ron paul we would also be happy if he makes it to second , mrs grassman said  susan saulny des moines there have been many questions today about how the caucuses actually work \( see my facebook chat this afternoon for some of the questions \) so here s a condensed version of a column i wrote earlier this week getting voters there the caucuses require voters to travel to schools , churches , homes and community centers the challenge for the candidates \? identifying their supporters and convincing them that getting to a caucus is time well spent the arrival because the state allows democrats and independents to reregister when they arrive at a caucus , they are effectively open to everyone some caucus locations will have just a few people gathered in a living room others will be larger , more formal affairs , held in a gymnasium or a ballroom the campaigning once voters show up , representatives of each campaign are given the opportunity to make remarks in an attempt to sway people at the last minute the secret ballot when everyone has had his say , the voting begins for republicans , those choices are kept secret that is different from democratic caucuses , where voters gather in likeminded clusters in various parts of the room to indicate their support for a candidate the count in 2008 , about 120 , 000 republicans cast ballots in their party s caucuses some political observers expect a higher republican turnout this year the delegates the overall results of the caucuses will drive news coverage as the candidates leave iowa for new hampshire , which holds the next primary contest , on jan 10 but those results actually do not determine the number of iowa delegates the winners will receive  michael d shear within an hour or so , we ll be getting results about the preferences of iowa voters from interviews known as entrance polls similar to exit polls conducted for primaries in other states edison research of somerville , nj , stations interviewers in a number of randomly selected sites those interviewers then ask voters before they head inside to fill out questionnaires about their choices for a presidential candidate , and their positions on other issues the first wave of any exit poll , or in the case of iowa caucuses , entrance polls , is a very early bead of information about the views of voters , and it is quite incomplete in the case of the iowa caucuses , the times does not release the initial findings from these polls for several reasons for one , candidates campaigns are extremely organized in getting their supporters to the caucus sites before they open at 7 pm that can translate into the likelihood that the first wave includes a larger proportion of those who had already made up their minds for an individual candidate , and could skew any totals from the initial count joe lenski , the executive vice president of edison research , which conducts the polls for the primaries and the general elections , noted that candidates like representative michele bachmann , for example , are advising caucusgoers to get to the sites at 6 30 pm whoever arrives first is going to be interviewed first , mr lenski said on tuesday and the earliest tallies are not really a broad enough sample , he cautioned , to read much into them they can be easy to misinterpret or overinterpret mr lenski said , releasing a telephone survey after one night is not normally done it s not the complete sample it s just the interviews done to that point everyone remembers that hillary rodham clinton s campaign provided sandwiches and other food near the caucus sites in 2008 , a possible enticement for caucusgoers \( whether the food was appealing enough to change anyone s vote remains debatable , since she lost iowa to barack obama \) in this cycle , we know that about 4 in 10 in the most recent survey said they could still change their minds , and it is possible anyone in that group would not be interviewed in the initial wave because they might arrive later , unattached to a campaign tuesday night , with the focus on the republican party s caucuses , the second and third waves tallying the entrance polls will provide a much firmer picture of the composition of the caucusgoers and their preferences in previous years , we ve learned from the entrance polls what segments of iowans voted for which candidates in mitt romney s column in the 2008 caucuses , 51 percent of those interviewed believed he had the best chance to win the general election \( iowa went for mike huckabee , even though just 8 percent said he had the best shot at winning that november more important in that cycle was that the candidate shared the voters values , highlighted by the 44 percent who said mr huckabee shared theirs , as opposed to 26 percent who believed mr romney shared their values \) those are the types of views we ll be able to post , once we get the broader figures after about 8 30 pm here s a brief explanation of how the entrance polls

of campaigning as candidates made a final pitch to iowa voters on tuesday urbandale , iowa the students at des moines christian assembly found out tuesday morning that class was being dismissed early so they could get a special civics lesson from a visiting former united states senator , rick santorum but what they actually ended up getting was a harsh critique of liberals and president obama mr santorum , who , like most of the republican candidates , usually criticizes the president on the campaign trail , was unusually disparaging of mr obama and what he described as the president s misguided values the obama administration has a set of values , he told a gathering of hundreds of students in the gymnasium of the school , which is just outside des moines our values are based on religion , based on the bible their values are based on the religion of self he added , his voice rising in anger in their world , if it s religiously based or biblically based , it s out if it s anything else , bring it on in you know what s at stake in this election \? that value structure even as mr santorum promised not to say anything but positive things about mr obama if he is elected president , he likened the current administration to a student who had failed to turn in his homework that s the routine of this administration handing in an assignment incomplete and blaming someone else for the problem , he said if you want to be president , man up and be president the negative tone of mr santorum s remarks struck at least a few students as inappropriate , especially for a christian school i don t really think you should talk about other people like that , said tierra fletcher , a senior i mean , people make mistakes but you shouldn t put them down like that her friend devan brown , a junior , agreed and said that were she old enough to vote in november , she doubt it would be for mr santorum i wouldn t necessarily want to from what he said neither girl knew much about mr santorum before tuesday what s his position on abortion \? ms brown wanted to know when told that mr santorum was solidly antiabortion , she was glad to hear it i don t feel right about abortion at all , she said a child is a gift from god then the girls wanted to know what he thought about gay people when told that mr santorum had once likened being gay to bestiality , ms brown shook her head i have lots of friends who are gay i don t judge , she said i know it says in the bible it s wrong but i don t judge ms brown rendered one more judgment on mr santorum after seeing him walk into the gymnasium with his entourage , she observed , he s not even wearing a suit of course , mr santorum was wearing one of his signature sweater vests   jeremy w peters des moines rick perry won t pack his bags and go home , no matter what happens that s the message from the texas governor to cnn s john king this evening , as iowa voters decide his fate in the hawkeye state i mean the idea that one or two states is going to decide who the next nominee for the republican party is , is just , you know , that that s not reality , mr perry said he added that he will head to south carolina tomorrow regardless of the outcome in iowa and will make the argument there that mitt romney is not an authentic conservative who an solve the nation s problems those folks in south carolina , i can promise you , they re not going to buy a pig in a poke , so to speak , he said  michael d shear washington might intrade know the winner of iowa tonight before many other sources do \? on the night of the iowa caucuses in 2008 , before news organizations declared barack obama and mike huckabee the winners , the odds on the intrade markets began to suggest that both would win between 8 30 pm and 9 pm eastern , the odds began rising for both mr obama , then a democratic senator from illinois , and mr huckabee , a republican and former arkansas governor by 9 pm , intrade an online market where traders can bet on realworld events gave mr obama and mr huckabee each more than an 80 percent chance of winning , according to eric zitzewitz , a dartmouth economist who has studied prediction markets that pattern suggests that information from the caucuses was filtering out to people buying contracts on intrade and affecting the prices but intrade has hardly had a perfect record on nights like tonight , mr zitzewitz notes on the day of the democratic primary in new hampshire in 2008 , mr obama s odds of victory rose to about 99 percent before eventually falling to zero mr zitzewitz wrote , via email i m not aware of anyone having studied systematically whether the withinelectionday market movements have predictive power in the absence of exit poll leaks we probably do not have a large enough sample size to say much in contrast , it s fairly clear that the market movements in the days leading up to elections have plenty of information content in the days leading up to the iowa caucus , rick santorum s odds of victory were rising and continued to rise through parts of tuesday but mitt romney was still given the highest chance of winning \( roughly 44 percent \) at 6 30 pm mr santorum s odds were about 30 percent , and ron paul s were about 25 percent in a 2008 column , i looked at the benefits and drawbacks of intrade odds in more detail  david leonhardt washington the republican caucus is clearly the big story tuesday night , but that hasn t stopped president obama from trying to grab some of the spotlight in iowa the president is hosting a live video conference for democrats attending precinct caucuses across iowa , where he will try to get himself in shape to repeat his 2008 win in the state , while at the same time landing a punch or two against the republicans hoping to strike an emotional chord in the state that galvanized his bid for the presidency , mr obama s reelection campaign emailed supporters a video of mr obama s iowa victory speech in january 2008 mr obama s backers said that four years later , mr obama has kept the promises he made that night , which included vows to make health care more affordable , to cut taxes for the middle class and to end the war in iraq most of us will watch what happens on tv but as you do , remember that the end of this story is up to you and what you decide to do in the days and weeks ahead , mitch stewart , an obama campaign aide , said in another email to supporters mr obama is expected to strike similar themes when he speaks at the video conference tuesday night he is also expected to take questions from caucus voters , and his video conference will be largely limited to those who participate in the caucuses the white house press secretary , jay carney , said mr obama would probably follow the republican caucus results by reading about them in the newspaper or online it was unclear whether mr obama would watch the returns on television white house officials said mr obama wasn t ready to engage aggressively in the election campaign but mr obama s campaign has been up and running in iowa since april , and he had many surrogates in the state on tuesday night on wednesday , mr obama will travel to cleveland for an economyrelated event at a local school  helene cooper des moines so who shows up at the iowa caucuses \? here are some basic statistics from the republican caucuses in 2008 , according to the edison mitofsky entrance poll conducted in 2008 a lot could change these numbers this time around , but it s at least a basic guide to the kind of people who might come out gender 56 percent were male , 44 percent were female age 46 percent were 45 and older , 18 percent were 25 to 44 , and only 9 percent were 17 to 24 race 99 percent were white less than onehalf were black , and about 1 percent were listed as other wealth about 33 percent said their total family income was more than 75 , 000 a year , while 16 percent made less than 30 , 000 a year religion 60 percent said they were evangelical christians  michael d shear des moines here s a minigeography lesson as you watch the iowa caucuses \( these are generalizations , so don t be too picky \) east and south more liberal these are areas that democrats tend to win in north and west more conservative and evangelical mike huckabee did well in this part of the state in 2008 the cities these tend to be more liberal , and so more moderate candidates like mitt romney could do better here colleges ron paul might expect to do well here , since college students tend to favor him there s iowa state in ames , the university of iowa in iowa city , and a raft of others  michael d shear it s starting to feel a bit like caucus time candidates and reporters have gotten used to trudging through snow and enduring frigid temperatures as they cover the iowa caucuses but until a couple of days ago , it was positively balmy today , just in time , that all changed we woke up to a 12degree morning and as night falls , it s just above freezing in des moines  michael d shear des moines sometime after 7 pm , all over iowa , more than 100 , 000 hardy souls will gather in their communities to pick a republican nominee for president for the next several hours , the rest of the country will be waiting for those iowans to pull the trigger on the starting pistol for the 2012 campaign in some years , the iowa dynamic is clear a yesorno , thisoneorthatone proposition that is easily answered by the result at the end of the night this won t be one of those years here are five things to watch for in iowa tuesday night   michael d shear
larry dixon was looking for someone to hug he had just scored the first touchdown of his collegiate career , a 2yard burst straight up the guts of the tulane defense to tie the game he crashed into offensive tackle mike mcdermott s chest and then banged helmets with guard matt villanti he threw his arm around raymond maples and accepted a handshake from trent steelman larry was beaming he had put the black knights on the scoreboard for the first time on this afternoon in 2011 he would go on to average 5 yards a carry , pick up a big third down in one scoring drive , and catch a 25yard pass to set up another touchdown larry was one of the stars in army s 456 victory over the green wave he finally felt that he had contributed to his team and that he belonged on the field against division i opponents in the previous three weeks , larry had felt the game moving way faster than he was holes opened in an instant and then closed before he got there every time he got hit , it seemed harder than the hit he took the previous time larry had expected that there would be a learning curve , but he had not figured that it was going to be as steep as it proved against northern illinois , san diego state and northwestern he felt as if were a boy playing against men still , being a division i fullback was a picnic compared with being a plebe college football is plagued with stories of players violating rules , receiving cash gifts , not doing their own schoolwork , even committing crimes they are catered to and coddled at every turn , and often allowed to violate the guidelines the average student is expected to follow but the football team at the united states military academy is not like other college football teams at west point , football players carry the same course loads as their fellow cadets , shouldering an ivy leaguecaliber education and yearround military training after graduation , they are destined not for the nfl but to danger zones halfway around the world these men are not just football players , they are soldiers first in the locker room , larry would listen to his older teammates as they talked of using weekend passes to take excursions to montreal and aspen , colo , paris and london he smiled and laughed but did n't contribute to the conversation he followed the chain of command around the football team as well , partly because he felt that he had no standing as a plebe and a backup , and partly because it was just easier the football team was a brotherhood within a brotherhood , and democracy reigned in the football center far more than it did anywhere else on campus still , larry figured if he did n't say much , then he would n't say the wrong thing , and if he watched and listened he would get a little better each day for larry , practice was an escape , a perfect one from the total immersion that west point demanded for a couple of hours at least , the noise in his brain got quiet , and his anxiety about rules and regulations evaporated he hid behind his helmet , bit into his mouth guard and gave his head over to his gut he was naturally on high alert on the football field , his instinct launching him into action , leading him into holes , pulling his shoulder low into a tackler larry did n't have to puzzle and think on the field as he did the rest of the day and against tulane , everything snapped into place like the legos he had played with as a child larry had demonstrated the power and explosiveness that coach rich ellerson had touted the previous spring when larry was still in prep school larry was a handful on the field , pure and simple , and was among the reasons army put in a wishbone formation last season to complement its triple option ellerson finally had a stable of big , punishing backs jared hassin , raymond maples , terry baggett and hayden tippett , in addition to larry who had the vision to see holes open and the bodies to hurt the defenders who tried to plug them the triple option relied on the backs cutting through and running away from the defense the wishbone was about giving the backs a 5yard head start and then blasting into the defense like a missile there was more potential for violence , which kept defenses on their heels against tulane , the wishbone had helped 11 army running backs roll to 353 yards rushing and 6 touchdowns it had pulled the black knights' record to a respectable 23 and had raised their hopes for another bowl game even better , it had made for a more festive postgame tailgate it eliminated the questions about what went wrong and the armchair analysis that accompanied the hot dogs and brats and potato salad after losses the postgame tailgate was as good as it got in terms of a social outing for cadets , especially the plebes like larry they rarely got to leave the post , so wandering around the plateaus of parking lots and the grass oasis near the lusk reservoir was something all cadets enjoyed the parents of various teammates were anchored in a lot , right above michie stadium , and for hours after the game groups of players shuttled among the various buffets larry smiled as he accepted congratulations and piled his plate higher with food the black knights were in high spirits after the victory over tulane they had played well , washing the doubt that had lingered after being destroyed by ball state larry knew he had been a major part of that victory the black knights needed four more wins to be eligible for a bowl game , and the vibe in the locker room was that it was an attainable goal they could move closer to it on saturday , oct 8 , against miami in oxford , ohio larry was confident he could help his team in that game as well all larry wanted to do in the meantime was lose himself in practice and count the days to thanksgiving when he could go home and see his mother and his older sisters , karisha and shakira they had come to west point a month earlier for the san diego state game , and it had been one of the proudest moments in both larry s life and his mother s discipline and determination had helped laura ashley to the secondhighest level of chief petty officer in the navy , and she had imparted those virtues to her children shakira had graduated from the art institute of seattle and , with her husband , matt jarin , was raising an 8monthold son , liam karisha was married to staff sgt james stanley and they , too , were living in the seattle area with their children , kiyanna , 12 , and marcus , 6 stanley was in a recruiting office after serving his third combat tour , his second in afghanistan larry s mother had demanded accountability from all of her children she knew exactly where he was , who he was with and when he was going to be home there was no roaming the streets or hanging out she knew larry s friends and their parents she did not allow idle time in her home larry s outlet was sports for his sisters , it was parttime jobs and art classes larry was in junior high school when his parents divorced he blamed his mother and rebelled against her authority he took out his anger with hostile exchanges , flagrant disobedience and a lot of weekends that i spent at home in my room as punishment , he recalled but none of that had mattered when his mother came to west point she and larry walked the campus , breathed in its history , and , when larry took the field against san diego state , shared a warm heart and a few tears it was really emotional , larry said she got to see how all my dreams had come true and she gave me those dreams and believed in me and gave me what i needed to climb that mountain now , a month later , larry was homesick and wanted to hug his mom he needed some relief from the grind he may have been one of the stars of the tulane game , but among his fellow cadets in d company he was just another lowly plebe learning how to be a follower he stayed close to the walls of the building as he walked with his hands cupped at his side and greeted everyone who crossed his path by name those were the rules , and only in the classrooms during the school day did they not apply go , ducks , he called out as three thirdyear cadets , known as cows , from his company passed it was the day s mandatory greeting for all members of d company larry had been up since 6 am it was the wednesday morning after the tulane game , and a halfhour later he had his back pressed against the secondfloor wall of grant barracks the plebes were there to call out minutes in intervals until the 6 50 am breakfast formation ten minutes until formation , he called at 6 40 am , standing at full attention his voice ricocheted along the tiles and granite in the darkness then , larry and his classmates returned to paraderest position for another five minutes on wednesdays , a hair inspection was part of the regular formation and often added another 10 minutes to the process it was merely cool this morning , but larry was bracing for the dark winter days he had heard about , when the snow and the rain and the wind whipping through the valley could turn watery rivulets on your hat into icicles larry kept his hair as short as a putting green his shoes and belt were shined to a gloss high enough to twinkle in the right light there were other cadets , however , who tried to push the hair standards to the limits three inches on top and one inch on the side , no strands touching your ears , and tapered on the neck it was hard to pull off , though , and often resulted in demerits for the vain plebes , which then were rolled into hours that could mean that your weekend could be chewed up with marching or sergeant s hours , extra duties like cleaning the bathrooms and common areas the inspection was concluded and the march to washington hall was on the assault of more than 4 , 000 cadets on the cadet mess is in itself a demonstration of poise , precision and poetry they marched in , in waves , and waited behind the chairs at tables for 10 until the daily announcements from the poop deck above were completed and they were told to be seated the mess hall s baroque stained glass illuminated battle scenes from throughout the country s history and bathed the cavernous room in timeless sepia the mural in the southwest wing takes up 2 , 450 square feet and depicts the various weapons of warfare used in the 20 most decisive battles in history but none of the cadets noticed they had 25 minutes to make the food on the table disappear and get to their first class of the day at 7 30 sharp larry was the day s cold beverage corporal sir , the beverage for this meal is orange juice , he said to his tablemates , members of the football team and mostly upperclassmen would anyone care for a glass of ice , sir \? once the drinks were prepared and the coffee , fruit and yogurt fetched , larry addressed the table commandant once more sir , the new cadets at this table have performed their duties and are now prepared to eat , he said then the knowledge questions came fast and furious at the new cadets who were seated at tables throughout the mess hall how many gallons in lusk reservoir \? seventyeight million gallons when the water is flowing over the spillway , sir what is the significance of foundation eagle and where is it located \? it is the eagle in front of washington hall tradition states that if one looks at it during the academic year he or she will not be found deficient in academics the purpose of the incessant trivia , the cupped hands and the rote greetings and formalities was to break plebes down before larry or any of his classmates could lead , they first must learn to follow this seemingly useless information may , indeed , be the minutiae of leadership , but by accumulating it and flawlessly reciting it , larry and his classmates were taking the first steps on the road to a daily selfassessment am i doing enough to prepare myself \? by the time cadets left west point as second lieutenants , the hope and design was that they would become so obsessed with that question that he or she had the will and the tools to succeed in any lifeordeath situation maj chad bagley was as good as anyone when it came to reading a cadet s personality and understanding where on the journey from new cadet to second lieutenant he or she might be he had taken the same path himself and then guided thousands of others as a tac officer here for the past six years in football operations , major bags , as he was known , had had a frontrow seat to cadet development , which is even more complicated for the young men who had signed on to play football at west point he had watched the lights go on ever so dimly for some as late as december of their senior , or firstie , year , when they learned on branch night whether they were headed to a military career in the infantry or aviation or armor in larry , however , he saw that rare cadet who knew where he was , what he was doing here , and why even in the tough , early days known as beast barracks some young men and women are just meant to be here , bagley said i'm not talking about the overachieving cadets , either i'm talking about the ones that get here and everything is just right they may not have known it before they got here , but something goes off , and they know this is the place for them larry was one of them he took to the rules and idiosyncrasies of the military as if he had been a soldier in a past life he absorbed everything from plebe knowledge to grenade manuals he walked and spoke with gravity he pulled for his fellow plebes to succeed and was generous with his time , whether it was helping them study or getting down and doing situps and pushups with those struggling to pass the physical test larry truly believed that stacking w s mattered on the football field , on the battlefield and in life he was a natural perhaps because he grew up as the son of a chief petty officer who taught him to find the joy in being accountable larry did not exactly relish the saturday morning inspections , or samis , that were conducted twice a semester but he appreciated the preparation they required the 10 hours of cleaning and the focus needed to master the tiniest detail west point left no room for interpretation on what barracks rooms ought to look like or what was expected from the cadets the sami guidelines ran 17 pages with photos and were exacting in their expectations larry s bookshelf almost always matched the photos perfectly his books were displayed vertically , pushed to the rear of the bookshelf , arranged by height , in descending order from left to right , just as required there was precision in his wardrobe , too his white hat , gray hat and parade hat were lined up from left to right as mandated his six uniforms hung on wood hangers and were evenly spaced and canted to the right larry was competitive , of course , but he was as fired up for his roommate , casey childress , who had recently been named soldier of the quarter for the whole brigade he was the no 1 plebe in military standards that s pretty cool , huh \? larry said , his eyes alight in fact , it was hard to reconcile larry s childlike exuberance with the serious adult life he was leading his brotherinlaw matt karin had turned him on to comic books , and together they had built a collection into the thousands , with larry favoring the batman and outsiders series he had quickly figured out the tricks cadets had passed down to one another to make plebe life easier and recounted them with glee his bed was bungeed together to keep its linens and appearance inspection ready , if not truly hospital corners standard it meant that he slept on top of the bed with his green girl , the thermal blanket that was probably the most valued and beloved piece of equipment in all of west point the goal is to have to make your bed like 12 times , in your whole career , he said , delighted that he might be getting one over on military life larry was an eager participant in his duties , cleaning up the bathroom and picking up trash in the hallways he had not received a single demerit or earned any hours or time marching for bad behavior or failure to perform duties he was a rock star at the knowledge parties that broke out as well , usually as he delivered the laundry to members of his company as part of his plebe duties all in all , it was pretty tame stuff that passed for hazing these days at the united states military academy over the years , there had been all kinds of acts of cruelty and physical punishment done to plebes in the name of building character and toughness the issue was first addressed by west point s administration in the years after the civil war , but despite the attention of one superintendent after another , the incidents of physical intimidation and humiliation continued gen douglas macarthur not only testified before congress , he later wrote in his memoirs that hazing was a staple of west point culture and practiced with methods that were violent and uncontrolled until 1998 , the notion remained that plebes were at west point to be tortured and that it was the upperclassmen s duty to see the torture carried out in fact , it was viewed as sport the ultimate score was forcing plebes to quit older cadets were good at it , too the attrition rate for west point plebes approached 40 percent in the 1990s west point in those days was a frightening place where plebes could be tormented with shower detail , when they would wear ponchos while being harassed and made to answer knowledge questions until they dripped sweat and became weak enough to pass out plebes could be dangled by their armpits on the closet doors , otherwise known as hanging out they also lived in fear of being sharked , a practice in which three upperclass cadets surrounded a plebe , one in front and one on either side , then screamed insults and demanding knowledge answers at a rapid clip the only safe place onpost for a new plebe was in his own room it was brig gen john abizaid who finally began enforcing the nohazing policy when he became commandant of cadets in 1997 the next year , he eliminated the yelling and physical punishments and threatened to separate cadets who were caught violating the prohibition on hazing in the years since , the attrition rate for plebes has been reduced to 20 percent do not tell larry dixon , however , that this is a kinder , gentler era one evening , like most , he left the kimsey athletic center at 6 30 for his barracks , where he barely had time to pick up his backpack then it was off to the library for three hours , until 9 45 , when he had to return for trash duty he would be up until 1 am studying for math and chemistry tests and then back on the wall for minutes by 6 30 am the worst thing about being a plebe is not having your voice heard , he said nobody wants to hear you they only want to see you when they want to see you you are on other people s schedules the hardest thing about it is being told what to do , how to do it and when to do it every single day
gary heyward stood on 125th street in harlem , not far from the apollo theater , wearing a jumpsuit that was half blue and half orange mr heyward , 44 , had this oddlooking uniform specially made part prison guard , part inmate to illustrate that at rikers island , where he worked as a corrections officer from 1997 to 2006 , he went from cop to criminal one day you 're taking the count and the next day you 're in the count , he said , referring to the jails' regular head counts of inmates this abrupt transition is precisely the angle of his new book , a selfpublished paperback called corruption officer perpetrator with a badge it is a raunchy tellall and a critical portrayal of rikers island , where mr heyward starts out as a rookie guard almost too jittery to even walk through a cellblock he becomes a reckless veteran running smuggled cigarettes and drugs to inmates , activities that lead to his arrest and journey to the other side of the prison bars on the street on a recent saturday , the books were selling briskly at 10 apiece several passersby stopped and shared a word with mr heyward about their own brushes with the jail system he stood behind a card table bearing stacks of his books from each of his wrists hung a handcuff with a chain dangling , as if he had just broken them apart alberta hale , 58 , of harlem , bought a book and told mr heyward , i hope it s a good book because i do n't read nothing but the bible she said that she had two sons in prison and that both had had runins with correction officers tracey jones of the bronx , whose husband is serving a long sentence for robbery in a prison upstate , asked , you were at rikers \? yes , mr heyward said you were corrupt \? mr heyward shrugged and said , need turned to greed mr heyward , who is divorced with two grown children and now works as a maintenance worker for the new york city housing authority , said he hoped that young people would read the book so they can see that going to jail is not a rite of passage or a badge of honor the book is filled with ribald and disturbing accounts of inmates and guards it is written in street slang , typical of street lit , a genre in which the books are often about gritty topics , geared toward urban readers and sold at sidewalk stands mr heyward said he wrote the book on legal pads while in state prison i'm no english scholar , but an editor helped me put my thoughts in order , said mr heyward , who grew up in the polo grounds towers in harlem mr heyward s initial nervousness at rikers , where he started at a base salary of 28 , 000 , soon gave way to swagger at 6 feet 3 inches tall and well over 250 pounds , he became an enforcer on his cellblock , he said the guard to call when a scuffle broke out or a prisoner needed to be restrained facing steep bills and child support payments , he said , he resorted to making extra money by selling contraband cigarettes and drugs to inmates he was arrested in 2006 and pleaded guilty to taking a bribe and trying to sell cocaine to an inmate he accepted a plea agreement calling for two years in state prison and one year of postrelease supervision sharman stein , a spokeswoman for the city s department of correction , said the claims in mr heyward s book of widespread misbehavior and illicit activity by guards unfairly tarnished the overall reputation of the city s staff of officers the charges he faced including drug selling , bribe taking , smuggling and other misconduct charges violate the correction officer s oath of office and cause a serious threat to the safety of his fellow officers and to inmates , she said the city s correction officers , ms stein added , oversee the custody of this city s jail system with hard work and honor it is their actions that deserve recognition , she said , not the selfserving enterprise of a disgraced former employee who seeks to make a profit off his illegal past michael t skelly , a spokesman for the correction officers benevolent association , also lashed out at mr heyward s book the reputation and dedication of our correction officers is second to none , mr skelly said they do not deserve to be maligned by anyone , especially by an individual whose credibility is highly questionable , as someone who was arrested and fired for breaking the same oath of duty taken by thousands of other correction officers who put their lives on the line every day but some fellow corrections officers have been supportive of mr heyward as he was peddling his book , two former correction officers , kaia sweeting and melissa hall , came up and hugged mr heyward and offered him their congratulations on the book you did it , ms hall told him she bought three books , one for herself and one each for her two adolescent daughters asked about working on rikers island , she said , it s the same as being an inmate , except we get to go home this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo gary heyward , a former rikers island guard who went to prison , selling his memoir in harlem \( photograph by todd heisler the new york times \)
for over a hundred years now the music of igor stravinsky has been central to ballet in 1909 , while still a virtual unknown , he orchestrated a chopin number for the ballet les sylphides as part of the opening season of diaghilev s ballets russes the next year diaghilev presented the premiere of the firebird with stravinsky s new score the 20th century certainly spawned modernist composers , but none of them matched his profound instinct for dance rhythm and none kept on so restlessly unlocking aspects of the new from then on stravinsky went on working with choreographers and ballet companies for more than 50 years like an explorer he investigated different regions of art primitivism , neoclassicism , serialism and others and he often did so in successive scores for ballet petrushka \( 1911 \) , the rite of spring \( 1913 \) , pulcinella \( 1920 \) , les noces \( 1923 \) , apollo \( 1928 \) , orpheus \( 1948 \) , agon \( 1957 \) all works with scores by him were rites of passage through which ballet kept becoming modern this week new york city ballet opens its fall season with two weeks of ballets choreographed to stravinsky music , between 1928 and 1972 , by the company s founderchoreographer , george balanchine balanchine came of age as an artist in 1928 when he choreographed the european premiere of stravinsky s apollo when he moved to new york , stravinsky s music stayed central to his endeavor for balanchine there were only three composers who knew the secret of dance music or , as he put it , musique dansante delibes \( copp lia , la source \) , tchaikovsky \( swan lake , the sleeping beauty , the nutcracker \) and stravinsky that secret involved aspects of rhythm that connected to the point work and brio of ballet , a feeling for the malefemale chivalry that lies at the heart of ballet s romance , and a sense of the suspense that turns ballet into drama when the stravinskybalanchine orpheus had its premiere in 1948 , its aura of genius was so potent that it proved a central reason for the founding of new york city ballet later that year agon was at once recognized as a beacon of radical modernity it opened as part of a triple bill of greek ballets , with apollo and orpheus city ballet s season starts with that historic program on tuesday but composing dance scores was only half the stravinskyballet adventure one of the breakthroughs of 20thcentury choreography was its revelatory discovery of concert music , so that ballets to concertos , symphonies and other works never intended for dance were expanded onstage in dance terms between 1941 , when balanchine first choreographed stravinsky s violin concerto as balustrade , and 1982 , when \( the year before his death \) he staged his third , and city ballet s second , stravinsky festival , he married stravinsky s concert scores to his own new choreography for many people this was where ballet truly entered the abstract but balanchine , like other choreographers , refused to accept that there can be abstraction when there are humans onstage what stravinsky s music helped him to discover was uncharted regions of drama when stravinsky saw the new puredance work that balanchine set to his movements for piano and orchestra in 1963 , he said that the ballet had helped him understand his own music better he had designed the floor plan but balanchine had built the building movements makes drama out of man versus woman , malefemale couple against allfemale group , symmetry versus asymmetry the orthodoxy of ballet language is interspersed with forms and figures so novel that they seem anticlassical you follow it on many levels at once rhythm , spatial architecture , gender , body language and , like stravinsky himself , hear the music better in consequence stravinsky gave ballet rhythms to match the complexity of the 20th century ballet dancers had been used to dancing to meters of threes and fours now they were alternating between fives and sevens , and coping with irregular rhythmic structures but around the dynamo of rhythm everything else changed too there were new harmonies and orchestrations to dance to , new visions of marriage , society and art , new endings and beginnings it s often wrongly assumed that in terms of choreographic perception balanchine had the exclusive on stravinsky the royal ballet in london still dances strong allstravinsky but balanchinefree programs its staging of michel fokine s original version of the firebird still a masterpiece of storytelling , with the best kiss ever choreographed includes what in 1910 must have been the most intricate ensemble ever planned , with six groups dancing different material simultaneously the humans of bronislava nijinska s noces are cogs in society s great machine , with pounding engine meters and an overwhelming pathos there was no ballet that royal ballet s founderchoreographer , frederick ashton , was prouder of having created than his densely classical stravinsky sc nes de ballet \( 1948 \) on one occasion , when a friend told him that it should be seen twice in quick succession , once for its structure and once for its dance material , he irrepressibly replied and the , and the sometimes there are as many as four or five going on at the same time i do n't know how i did it nonetheless it was balanchine , in new york , who staged stravinsky s most extreme ideas he created a profusion of new masterpieces even after stravinsky s death in 1971 , using the concert music of stravinsky violin concerto , duo concertant and symphony in three movements in 1972 for staggering works of poetic dance drama the highconcentrate stravinsky revivals of the coming season will be an important test of today s city ballet most of these ballets are now danced by other companies too the suzanne farrell ballet in washington revealed much more electricity in the meters and shapes of several stravinskybalanchine works it will be instructive in november to watch this company dance the balanchinestravinsky danses concertantes , just a few weeks after city ballet revives the same work the danger at city ballet can be that the stravinsky ballets have become received knowledge rather than uncharted terrain a heritage site rather than an expedition into outer space yet even if these stravinsky revivals prove to be just a visit to a dancehistory theme park , the ballets remain so extraordinary in conception and shape that they compel attention and there s reason for fresh hope some of city ballet s recent balanchines have been its freshest and boldest in years the intense , imaginative janie taylor is billed to make her debut as eurydice in orpheus will she prove the interpreter the role has been waiting for \? the decades pass , and these ballets remain unfathomable they often look so definitive that we assume the dance is the music s physical equivalent not so stravinsky violin concerto begins , as so many balanchine ballets do , with a tableau , while the music is already chugging away what cue did balanchine hear in the music to prompt the moment when suddenly five dancers spring into vividly threedimensional life \? just follow symphony in three movements to me the most irresistible of them all , and among the most baffling in terms of rhythm balanchine at times works often as much against stravinsky as with him the music \( 1945 \) was inspired by the end of the war in the pacific , but the ways in which balanchine , amid a kaleidoscope , gives us imagery of airplanes , the lindy , balinese gesture , vast oceanic horizons , sight and sightlessness , and social units versus impersonal blocs , is always cause for wonder how did even he hear all that \?
east rutherford , nj at some point in the coming days , tom coughlin plans to find a quiet moment and gather some of his veteran players together to ask them the singular question that will linger for him all winter , spring and summer i really do want to discuss it , coughlin said late sunday afternoon , before spelling out exactly what he wants to find out what in the world was the last two weeks all about \? no one knows there are theories , of course some have wondered whether the giants' collapse from first place in their division to elimination from playoff contention was rooted in overconfidence others have speculated that offthefield distractions , including the damage from and the tragic shooting at an elementary school in newtown , conn , hit the players especially hard there are also the more mundane possibilities , like injuries or just bad luck in many ways , it does not matter the playoffs will begin next weekend without the giants , who continued their remarkable nineyear streak under coughlin of winning postseason games only in the years they win a championship yet as much as those in professional sports are trained to look forward , coughlin cannot help glancing back and wondering why his team the defending winners , who were once 62 and a force in the nfc spiraled to the point that sunday s 427 victory over philadelphia was quickly rendered meaningless i do n't have any answers for you on that one , coughlin said quite frankly , i'm anxious to find out if anybody has an opinion or an answer he has plenty of time to inquire if three other results had also gone their way , the giants \( 97 \) would have slipped into the playoffs at the last breath , but that longest of long shots was extinguished early on just moments after the giants returned to their locker room as guard chris snee ripped off his athletic tape and linebacker mathias kiwanuka headed for the showers word came that the chicago bears had beaten the detroit lions , ensuring for the giants that their season will be remembered for two atrocious performances in december instead of another surge in january there s always tomorrow , safety antrel rolle said it just wo n't be this year the mood in the giants' locker room was not especially dreary , and there were no hushed tones or players blinking back tears the library atmosphere one often finds after teams are eliminated was replaced by a typical postgame buzz some players even joked and bantered with one another if anything , the overriding sentiment seemed to be one of acceptance the giants knew their disappointing plight was selfinflicted they were blasted in week 15 by atlanta and again in week 16 by baltimore , two disastrous losses in which their efforts bordered on incomprehensible the formula for their demise was particularly jarring the bigplay offense produced no big plays the vaunted defense accelerated its onceslow slide to mediocrity and the coach , who is known for his ability to motivate , helplessly pushed whatever buttons he could find because the familiar ones seemed only to be making things worse all of it left the giants in the uncomfortable position of relying on little more than hope in the days leading to sunday s game , some players , including justin tuck , took to posting twitter messages that quoted from scripture about overcoming adversity and having faith coughlin lectured the team on restoring its good name and during the game sunday , much of the team and plenty of fans could be seen with necks craned and eyes planted squarely on the video boards that showed the outoftown scores early on , there was optimism , too , as the giants jumped all over the eagles \( 412 \) and the lions stayed close to the bears eli manning threw three of his careerhigh five touchdown passes in the first quarter , and the eagles , who spent most of the game looking as bad their record might indicate , never had a chance rueben randle caught two of manning s scoring passes , and david wilson , ahmad bradshaw and victor cruz also scored even fullback henry hynoski added the first touchdown of his career in the end , though , there was only this none of it mattered we got outplayed in atlanta and in baltimore and did n't give ourselves a chance to win either game , manning said it hurts snee said it s frustrating , and it will be for quite some time i believe that we 're a better team than 97 , but there is no ground to stand on that s our record , and the way we played the last two weeks , we do n't deserve to be in the playoffs the players know there will be changes there always are in the nfl , kiwanuka said , and in a year like this , you expect more than usual a significant overhaul to the coaching staff is not expected , though the defense , which entered the final week ranked 31st in the league , will surely be scrutinized general manager jerry reese is expected to address reporters monday , and his offseason path is clear some players with expensive contracts , like tuck , may be asked to take pay cuts to free up salarycap money for reinforcements others will be released veteran players like bradshaw and corey webster might not return , and defensive end osi umenyiora has already said he does not expect to be back he reiterated that sunday , saying i'm happy to have been part of it all if it s the end , it s the end a few moments after he finished speaking with reporters , umenyiora slipped on his coat and headed for the door all around him , his teammates at least for now did the same they had wanted to play well one final time together , had wanted to show once more that they were not as bad as they looked two weeks earlier we wanted to show we still had our pride , kiwanuka said , and they did that it just was not nearly enough
rudy gay crouched 16 feet from the rim , holding the ball by his knees in attack position as kevin durant held out his long arm to obscure his vision , gay s eyes sought out any thunder defenders who might doubleteam him satisfied that none were arriving , gay glanced at durant , took a long dribble toward the baseline and , with durant still in good defensive position , rose gracefully and dropped in a 12foot baseline jumper getting a shot over durant , who is 611 and has impossibly long arms , is no small feat for gay , getting his third of four straight secondhalf buckets was an almost casual act when the dust settled following memphis rugged 10797 win over oklahoma city , gay had poured in 28 points and added six rebounds and five assists when he entered the league , gay had the physical frame and varied skills of a potential mega star and seemed destined to fill up the stat sheet on a nightly basis now 26 and in his seventh season , gay has arrived at a sinewy 69 , he belongs in the same class of hyperversatile freak athletes as lebron james and durant yet watching him , even on such a torrid shooting night , always leaves a lukewarm feeling sometimes gay makes it look easy to the point it appears he s not trying gay is the grizzlies highestpaid player and he usually takes the most shots for his team , but he rarely grabs the game by the scruff of its neck as durant did wednesday night when , as desperation set in for the thunder during the second half , durant started ripping down defensive rebounds and attempting to go coasttocoast that perception of gay is partly a reflection of his style unlike most star wings , he rarely holds onto the ball for long , and hardly ever scores with more than a few dribbles in a pickandroll league , gay is an oldschool scorer who prefers to work from the wing and posts his specialty is taking two hard dribbles toward the middle of the court , bumping his defender back with shoulder then jumping straight up and using his phenomenal reach to gain ample room for a simple 12foot jump shot but it isn t just that gay is a silent killer , it s that his team is not , as they say , his team the grizzlies do not take after gay he does not set the tone offensively or defensively that s up to mike conley and marc gasol the offense does not flow through him so much as it is run for him in fact , memphis has two different offenses one in which low block bruisers marc gasol and zach randolph work in twoman games with conley , and one in which gay curls off of screens or plays oneonone from the wing or post though gay is difficult to defend , when either conley or gasol controls the ball , the offense is more versatile and dynamic because gay is only an average passer he does not create for others the way , lebron james does and he s not as deadly a shooter or scorer as kevin durant he s somewhere in between the two , which makes him very good , but also oddly ancillary to the play of his own team on the other side of the ball , gay has the rare ability to guard quick wings and 7footers alike lamarcus aldridge is one of the best scoring big men in the nba , but even he found himself flummoxed by gay s rangy limbs and quick feet so in this area too , gay is sort of lebronlite but unlike the heat s defense , which is designed around james s versatility and uncanny anticipatory skills , the grizzlies defense is not defined by gay s ability to cover wide swaths of the court in quick bounds or his willingness to switch onto the other team s best offensive player no , the grizzlies defense takes after its feisty ballhawking guards , conley and tony allen , and the mercilessly physical inside play of 7footer marc gasol , who has been compared to a dancing bear for his light feet , massive frame and surly disposition the grizzlies have the snarling personality of a wild pack they stomp around the court , mean and loud gay , even when he s playing well , often seems more aloof , coasting as his teammates frantically race about there may not be a more talented player in the league who seems so unessential to the personality of his team gay does many things well , but the thing he does best relative to the rest of his teammates is score oneonone , especially from the post that s a useful talent , one that the grizzlies will call on in desperate , important moments but it s also one that s duplicated somewhat by randolph and gasol and while both gasol and randolph do a great job of finding gay on backcuts to the rim , that s pretty much the extent of their compatibility because gay is a poor outside shooter gay shot just 31 percent from beyond the arc last season and continues to shoot poorly this year his inaccuracy can be traced to his technique unlike , say , paul pierce , gay rarely looks ready to receive and shoot the ball quickly when he s open on the perimeter his feet are too close together and his footwork as the ball comes to him changes from shot to shot that same languid casualness that makes his pullup jumpers look so smooth also makes his longrange shot the accuracy of which is dependent on gay shooting the same way every time look shabby and unrefined the awkward way that gay fits with the rest of the memphis roster , one that appears capable of deep run in the playoffs , has led to speculation that he might be traded for a player who better complements the talents of gasol and conley after this season , gay will be on the books for 37 million over two years , or about the same amount as the heat will pay james for a smallmarket franchise , that may be too high a bill for gay s services gay does not necessarily make his teammates better , which is the true mark of a superstar yet gay remains one of only a few players who can give as good as he gets against the likes of james and durant though gay may not always fit perfectly with his team , he also can do things no one else on the team can duplicate things like torching the best player in the western conference for eight straight points to close a crucial stretch in the second half of a tight game the grizzlies may not always take after gay , but that doesn t mean he can t still lead them where they want to go

beijing announced the promotions of five generals this week , shaping the top leadership of the rapidly modernizing military as it becomes a more dominant player in asia and challenges american dominance in the region and on friday , china s state news agency , xinhua , announced that parliament had expelled the disgraced former politician bo xilai the expulsion of mr bo , who has been accused by the government of corruption and failure to disclose the murder by his wife of a british business executive , removes his immunity from prosecution china s military is likely to remain well financed , even as the chinese economy slows , analysts say the new leaders are expected to push ahead with developing naval and air power that can rival the united states and with capabilities , which the chinese see as a new and effective way to project power the new appointees will almost certainly become members of the central military commission , a 12member body that oversees the chinese military and that is undergoing major changes as members reach mandatory retirement age the jockeying for vacant positions has by all accounts been fierce , with much of it riding on personal allegiances to president or vice president mr xi is expected to succeed mr hu as communist party leader at the 18th party congress , scheduled to open on nov 8 , and as president next year the full slate of commission members will be unveiled at the party congress mr hu is chairman of the commission , and one of the big questions hovering over the party congress is whether he will yield this post to mr xi , or hold onto it for two more years based on family connections and his own professional experience , mr xi has stronger ties to the military than mr hu , and analysts say that in many respects the military considers him one of their own whether that means mr xi will rein in the military or give it greater scope as china asserts what it calls its territorial rights in the south china sea and east china sea over the next decade will be one of the most important strategic questions facing the country as it enters its new leadership phase , they say among those promoted was gen ma xiaotian , a former fighter pilot who will become head of the air force , a service that is now coming to the fore after long being relegated to a back seat general ma is unusually outspoken , said chas w freeman jr , former assistant secretary of defense , who has met with chinese military figures he does not yield easily to those with whom he disagrees , though he is willing to do so if an argument of sufficient logical force is presented he is selfconfident enough to really enjoy the roughandtumble of policy argument in may , general ma told a tv station based in hong kong that the south china sea , where china is making increasing territorial claims , was none of the united states' business the chinese air force is now seeking to create the kind of air power that can rival the us , and to create similar stealth , precision strike and longrange strike capabilities , said anthony h cordesman , the senior military analyst at the center for strategic and international studies in washington it is developing similar enablers in terms of refueling , electronic warfare systems , airborne command and control , and satellites earlier this year , general ma accompanied china s defense minister , liang guanglie , on a visit to washington gen zhang youxia , who has publicly criticized the military for its lack of combat experience , was promoted to be director of the general armament department , which oversees procurement and research general zhang , one of the few senior commanders who does have battlefield experience , is said by chinese military scholars to have been wounded during china s 1979 conflict with vietnam in 2009 , he was quoted in people s daily , the communist party mouthpiece , as saying the fires of war are burning throughout the world in this area , the gap between the chinese military and foreign militaries is growing by the day this is a real problem before his promotion , he was commander of the shenyang military region the commander of the beijing military region , gen fang fenghui , was promoted on thursday to chief of the general staff , the defense ministry said the former political commissar of the guangzhou military region , zhang yang , was named director of the political department , and the former commander of the nanjing military region , gen zhao keshi , was promoted to lead the logistics department the new commission will almost certainly be overseeing china s development of cyberwarfare , an area that china views as particularly advantageous , and relatively inexpensive , said kevin pollpeter , china project manager for defense group inc , a firm based in washington that specializes in china s national security issues cyber allows china projection ability it ca n't get with other weapons , mr pollpeter said at a recent conference in washington on china s military so far , the defense ministry has not announced who will command the allimportant second artillery corps , home to the landbased ballistic and cruise missile units opposite taiwan also yet to be announced is the new commander of the navy , another rapidly expanding branch of the military the commanders of the second artillery corps and the navy sit on the central military commission two other posts the commission s vice chairmen also remain to be announced these positions are filled by senior generals who run the daytoday operations of the military under the civilian party leadership

for confederates , the quickest connection across the appalachian mountains , which roughly split the eastern and western theaters of the war , was a railroad line from richmond , va , to chattanooga , tenn from chattanooga other lines fanned west and south toward the mississippi and the gulf of mexico consequently , the mountain city s strategic significance was far greater than its population of just 2 , 500 people might lead one to believe union forces would not gain undisputed control of the town until november 1863 but one general authorized a daring plan that could have led to federal occupation more than a year and a half earlier a scheme that , today , is popularly remembered as the great locomotive chase after ulysses s grant s capture of fort donelson , tenn , in february 1862 and samuel curtis s victory at pea ridge , ark in early march , their theater commander in st louis , henry halleck , was awarded overall authority in the west he promptly urged a previously uncooperative , and now subordinate , don carlos buell in nashville , tenn , to join most of his army with grant s in western tennessee once combined , the two armies could better meet the challenge of a confederate force concentrating at corinth , miss , under gen albert sidney johnston and gen pgt beauregard the result would become the civil war s first epic battle , at shiloh , on april 6 and 7 but buell could not responsibly ignore the rest of tennessee he left 18 , 000 soldiers around nashville , and sent a division eastward to the cumberland gap , another point of passage through the appalachians at the same time , he authorized gen ormsby mitchel to take 8 , 000 troops southward into northern alabama as shiloh combatants were bedding down after the first day s fighting , 200 miles to the east , in shelbyville , tenn , general mitchel was meeting with a spy named james andrews who had a plan to capture chattanooga owing to the riskeverything confederate concentration at corinth , chattanooga was lightly defended if a union force were to attack suddenly , the town would be nearly helpless unless reinforcements could quickly come by rail from either corinth or atlanta if mitchel blocked the chattanoogatocorinth railroad , he would thwart confederate aid from the west to prevent confederate reinforcements from the south , andrews proposed to covertly capture a train just north of atlanta , ride it to chattanooga , and destroy rail facilities along the way once at the mountain city , he would switch to the line connecting with mitchel , leaving an open door to chattanooga behind with luck , mitchel might occupy chattanooga and even strengthen his grip with reinforcements via rail from the troops buell left in nashville to surprise the enemy , mitchel and andrews agreed to synchronize their actions for april 11 andrews selected about 20 volunteers traveling in small groups , they were to reassemble at marietta , ga , on april 10 and hijack a train for chattanooga the following morning that same morning mitchel was to advance eastward along the corinthtochattanooga line and meet the raiders later in the day but april 7 was the first in a string of 10 rainy days , setting andrews a full day behind schedule the raiders finally boarded a train on april 12 , about 6 am eight miles into the trip , at the big shanty breakfast stop , they took control of the train , which was pulled by a locomotive named the general continuing northward , the raiders repeatedly cut telegraph line and twice removed rails behind them , although the latter task was more timeconsuming than expected meanwhile , general mitchel had blocked the chattanoogatocorinth railroad by quickly seizing huntsville , ala on april 11 the next morning he led a column toward chattanooga after capturing a key bridge , mitchel halted 28 miles from the town to meet andrews if he was still coming andrews was running behind from big shanty the raiders were still 110 miles south of chattanooga however , if they could destroy the important oostanaula river bridge 60 miles up the line , it would be unlikely that anyone could follow them the same day thereby enabling them to leisurely wreck multiple smaller bridges further ahead the confederates weren t slow in pursuit led by a young conductor named william fuller , several railroad employees set out after the general they started on foot , but the men soon commandeered a push car , then a switching engine and finally another locomotive , the smith , less powerful than the general it was a tough chase they were thrown off the push car where the raiders had removed a rail and had to abandon the smith where andrews derailed track a second time two of them continued on foot to the next station , where they took over yet another locomotive , the texas , this time a match in speed and strength to the general lacking a turntable in the rail yard , the texas sidetracked its cars , shifted into reverse , and chased after the general , whistling frequently to warn southbound trains of its unscheduled run andrews , meanwhile , had been delayed because mitchel s forces now threatened chattanooga , confederates in the city had sent rolling stock southward to safety , and straight into the general s path andrews tried to bluff , claiming that the general was actually a priority munitions train destined for general beauregard , but his plea didn t get him very far in the rush from the union forces two miles short of the oostanaula bridge , andrews stopped to wreck track a third time , but by this time the texas was coming into view the raiders hurried off , dropping railroad ties out the back and decoupling boxcars in an attempt to block the texas eventually they had to refuel at a woodandwater station , but didn t have enough time to complete the job meanwhile , the texas picked up a telegraph clerk and later dropped him at a station where the raiders had been too hurried to cut the line the clerk sent word to the confederate garrison in chattanooga , which promptly dispatched a company to capture the raiders eventually the general ran out of steam the raiders scattered on foot , but none escaped being dressed as civilians , andrews and seven others were tried and executed as unlawful combatants under military conventions applicable to both north and south the confederate bureaucracy was undecided about the fate of the remaining men they were imprisoned in atlanta , but broke out in october 1862 ten escaped prison grounds and only two were recaptured traveling in four separate pairs , the other eight eventually reached safety among various union commands \( their exploits would later form the basis for two movies , buster keaton s the general and the great locomotive chase , starring fess parker \) perhaps most remarkable were the two who paddled 400 miles down the chattahoochee river , away from atlanta and toward the florida coast , for three weeks their clothes became shredded mosquitoes drove them to cover their bodies with moss when they finally reached open waters , they paddled out to a blockading federal warship , where their strange appearance dismayed the crew the remaining six were locked up until march 1863 , when they were traded as part of a prisoner exchange they were taken to washington , where they met secretary of war edwin stanton and president abraham lincoln stanton gave them a military decoration recently created by congress \( one that would be given to the eight atlanta escapees later \) the

as those who will not see eddie lazear has an oped in the wsj on the fiscal cliff that , among other things , poohpoohs any concerns that sudden cuts in spending might hurt the economy he weasels a bit , but basically conveys the impression that there s no evidence for keynesian effects what this signifies to me is the politicization and corruption overtaking the economics profession i ll give eddie the benefit of the doubt he is probably just going by what his friends say but it s truly awesome in the midst of a crisis that has both provided overwhelming evidence for keynesian views of fiscal policy and inspired a great deal of empirical work that also confirms the case for a keynesian view , the right wing of the profession is just covering its ears and yelling la , la , la , i can t hear you just as a reminder
international relief agencies reported an alarming increase in syrian refugees on friday , shattering calculations made by the and spreading fears that the violence in is creating a broader humanitarian crisis that could further destabilize the middle east , combined with accounts by officials and workers in refugee camps , provided new evidence that the emergency relief efforts undertaken so far are inadequate and have underestimated the needs of the refugee population the swelling numbers of syrians have caused many new stresses in syria s neighbors turkey is struggling to accommodate overcrowded camps and said it has nearly reached its limit the lebanese and jordanian armies are increasingly confining refugees to inhospitable border areas with barebones accommodations schools near the syrian border in iraq , a country still recovering from war , are overflowing with refugees even as local children are preparing to return to class many refugees are younger than 18 , including unaccompanied children saba mobaslat , director of save the children s jordan office , described a windswept , nearly barren area of desert near the syrian border as a children s camp each night this week , the number of people fleeing into jordan almost quadrupled , compared with last week , she said as of friday , the united nations refugee agency said , 202 , 512 refugees had been registered in iraq , lebanon , jordan and turkey , with more than 30 , 000 new arrivals tallied in the past seven days alone the agency had anticipated a total of 185 , 000 registered refugees by the end of this year israel , which is in a technical state of war with syria , has not taken any refugees we 're already past where we were in terms of planning , said adrian edwards , a spokesman for the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees , the agency s formal name we 're going to have to revise upward the planning figures , and the corresponding amount of money needed to help them the agency had budgeted 193 million for the emergency and has so far received adequate funding , mr edwards said in a telephone interview from his geneva headquarters but the unanticipated increase in the refugee population means we still need more money with the number of refugee arrivals growing faster than expected , preparation has become more important , experts said can these countries and the humanitarian aid community ramp up their efforts quickly enough to deal with those numbers \? asked nadim houry , deputy director of the middle east and north africa division of human rights watch it s not just a challenge of a dollar amount it s a question of absorption turkey , lebanon and jordan are all worried about this these are countries that all absorbed and before that , so there is a weariness that s already there the refugee problem has particularly unsettled turkey , which has received at least 78 , 000 registered syrians , the most of any country , and has imposed a limit of 100 , 000 despite turkey s disciplined approach , it has run out of space at its nine camps and is building seven more , but it is unclear what will happen after the limit is reached some families have been forced to wait on the syrian side of the border in lebanon , where a weak central government has been more haphazard in its relief effort than turkey , the crisis has been aggravated by sectarian fighting that is spilling over from syria that has complicated registration efforts by the united nations refugee agency , which closed its office in tripoli , in northern lebanon , on friday amid days of gunfire the plight of the refugees will only grow worse in the coming months , without a significant improvement in accommodations , as the torrid summer gives way to the bonechilling winter winds that can whip through the unheated tent encampments and yet , mr edwards said a more immediate problem loomed many refugees are housed temporarily in schools , which must be vacated for the fall academic year we are struggling over what to do with people living collectively in lebanon , in iraq groups of refugees who have moved into schools , which have to open up in a matter of weeks , he said the accelerated exodus at least partly reflects increased fighting in damascus and aleppo , syria s two largest cities , as well as an intense campaign by the government of president bashar alassad to crush insurgents close to the jordanian border around the southern city of dara'a , where the uprising began nearly 18 months ago ms mobaslat and other officials in jordan said syrians fleeing across the border , many of them from dara'a , had been shot and traveled at night to avoid syrian government forces but those forces also have dropped leaflets encouraging people to flee , especially from aleppo , suggesting that mr assad may be trying to use refugees to punish syria s neighbors , especially turkey , a former assad ally that turned on him as the repression in syria worsened it is a way for assad to put pressure on turkey , said ayman , a syrian activist working with refugees at the turkish border , who used only one name for security reasons he is seeking to destabilize turkey most of the 51 , 000 registered syrian refugees in lebanon have congregated near two crossings the bekaa region east of beirut , and wadi khaled , in the north while none are starving , aid workers said , the lebanese government s efforts to assist them have been uncoordinated and uneven nabil alhalabi , head of life for human rights , a lebanese group assisting refugees near the bekaa crossing , said that without organized camps , many refugee families will not receive the help they need the number of refugees is growing every day , and the local government cannot deal with this daily flow alone , he said jordan and lebanon have responded recently by doing more to limit refugee movement in what appears to be an effort to discourage refugees from settling driving up rents and competing for jobs fences surround some makeshift camps just across the border in lebanon i'm afraid they will arrest us all and send us back , said ferhan alkurdi , 40 , a refugee in rama , lebanon we do n't feel protected andrew harper , the local jordan representative for the united nations refugee agency , said that 62 , 000 refugees had either registered in jordan or were preparing to do so the jordanian government says there are about 150 , 000 syrian refugees in the country , including people who did not register or those who crossed the border and never returned ms mobaslat of save the children , who has been working in jordan s new za'atri camp , built on a barren desert plain about six miles from the syrian border , said that the pace of arrivals this past week went from 600 a night to more than 2 , 200 and that most were from dara'a , including many children unaccompanied by parents the guarded compound , she said , offered little protection from the wind , and the arrivals had no choice but to remain people are running from a horrible situation to a terrible one , she said

8 55 pm updated the global bank hsbc has been used by mexican drug cartels looking to get cash back into the united states , by saudi arabian banks that needed access to dollars despite their terrorist ties and by iranians who wanted to circumvent united states sanctions , a senate report says the 335page report released monday also says that executives at hsbc and regulators at the office of the comptroller of the currency ignored warning signs and failed to stop the illegal behavior at many points between 2001 and 2010 in one case , an hsbc executive successfully argued that the bank should resume business with a saudi arabian bank , al rajhi bank , despite the fact that al rajhi s founder had been an early benefactor of al qaeda hsbc s american branch ended up supplying a billion dollars to the bank the report is the product of a yearlong investigation by a senate subcommittee , the permanent subcommittee on investigations it points to the problems at hsbc , europe s largest financial institution , as indicators of a broader problem of illegal money flowing through international financial institutions into the united states banks that ignore money laundering rules are a big problem for our country , said senator carl levin , a michigan democrat who leads the subcommittee also troubling is a bank regulator that does not adequately do its job he called hsbc s compliance culture pervasively polluted for a long time hsbc executives are expected to apologize for shortcomings in the bank s internal controls in a hearing of the subcommittee on tuesday the company said in a statement on monday that we will apologize , acknowledge these mistakes , answer for our actions and give our absolute commitment to fixing what went wrong mr levin , however , said on monday that hsbc had promised to fix similar problems in years past and failed while the bank is saying all the right things , and that is fine , it has said all the right things before , he said the hearing is unlikely to be the end of hsbc s problems the bank has disclosed in regulatory filings that the issues with money laundering are also being investigated by the department of justice and could lead to criminal charges and significant fines , which analysts have said could reach 1 billion the report on hsbc is the latest of several scandals that have recently rocked global banks and highlighted the inability of regulators to catch what is claimed to be widespread wrongdoing in the financial industry the british bank barclays recently admitted that its traders tried to manipulate a crucial global interest rate , and multiple major banks are under investigation jpmorgan chase disclosed last week that its employees may have tried to hide trades that are likely to cost the bank billions of dollars mr levin said that wrongdoing in the financial world has been exacerbated by the relatively light touch of government regulators as long as a bank just sees that it is going to be dealt with kid gloves , i think we are going to continue to see these shortfalls that have been so endemic , mr levin said the office of the comptroller of the currency has come under particularly harsh criticism for showing too much deference to the banks it regulates the new leader of the agency , thomas j curry , has promised a stricter approach since he took over in april mr curry said in a statement on monday that members of his staff fully embrace the subcommittee s report , and he is expected to testify tuesday that the agency is already carrying out many of the report s recommendations regulators have been paying close attention to the willingness of global banks to facilitate illegal flows of money from outside the united states the treasury department announced last month that ing bank had agreed to pay 619 million to settle charges that it moved money into the united states from cuba and iran , despite sanctions against those countries , for nearly two decades since 2009 , there have been five similar settlements between american regulators and other banks , including barclays and credit suisse , over illicit transactions in the senate report , hsbc is facing accusations that it helped its clients circumvent rules intended to stop transactions from countries facing international sanctions , and in some cases flouted laws in pursuit of profits while hsbc is accused of moving money into the united states from north korea and cuba , the most extensive problems involved accounts in iran an independent audit , paid for by hsbc , found that the bank facilitated 25 , 000 questionable payments involving iran between 2001 and 2007 in some cases , hsbc executives counseled iranian financial institutions on how to evade the filters of american regulators , the report says when the bank developed a way to process transactions for iran s largest retail bank , an hsbc executive wrote an email to his colleagues that said , i wish to be on the record as not comfortable with this piece of business none of his colleagues responded and the deal went ahead , according to the report the subcommittee also found evidence of widespread wrongdoing in hsbc s failure to stop money laundering through accounts tied to drug trafficking in mexico the bank is accused of shipping 7 billion in cash from mexico to the united states in 2007 and 2008 despite several warnings that the money was coming from cartels that needed a way to return their profits to the united states in many of the cases detailed in the report , the office of the comptroller of the currency is said to have spotted the problematic behavior but in nearly every case , the subcommittee found that the agency gave hsbc only a warning or mild punishment and did not push the bank to make largescale changes the agency ultimately issued a ceaseanddesist order against hsbc in 2010 after other law enforcement agencies began looking into the problems mr levin , though , said that his subcommittee found that some of the problems had not been fixed by the time the subcommittee began looking into them over the last year a new chief executive took over at hsbc early last year and he has committed to making sweeping changes at the company in its statement , the bank laid out several steps it had recently taken to increase oversight of international flows of money this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print photo senator carl levin criticized hsbc for laundering money and the office of the comptroller of the currency for not stopping it \( photograph by andrew harrer bloomberg news \) \( b6 \)
