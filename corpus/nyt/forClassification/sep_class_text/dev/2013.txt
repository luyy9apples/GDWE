lothar schmid , a german chess grandmaster who was the referee for three of the most contentious world chess championship matches ever played , including the volatile 1972 contest between and boris spassky , which he may have saved died on saturday in bamberg , germany he was 85 his death was confirmed on monday by his longtime friend helmut pfleger , a fellow grandmaster mr schmid was one of the first grandmasters to earn the title from the , the game s governing body , doing so in 1959 he represented germany in 11 chess olympiads between 1950 and 1974 , winning two individual silver medals he was better known as the chief arbiter , or referee , of the championship matches , between and in 1978 and between mr karpov and in 1986 the fischerspassky showdown is often called the match of the century mr fischer , an american , faced mr spassky , who was from the soviet union , against the backdrop of the cold war , and from the beginning the match was difficult to mediate it was held in reykjavik , iceland , and started a week late after mr fischer refused to show up unless the prize money was increased a private sponsor doubled the fund to 250 , 000 , and the match began on july 11 , before television cameras and an audience in a large auditorium in the first game mr fischer blundered and lost he insisted that the cameras be removed before he would continue the match when they were not , he forfeited game 2 , and the match seemed to be in jeopardy before the third game , mr fischer insisted that the game be moved to a small back room , with only a closedcircuit television feed to the audience and no camera operator in the room mr spassky agreed but when mr fischer arrived , he began to shout and make other demands , according to the 2011 book endgame by frank brady mr spassky , incensed , announced he was leaving for a second , i did n't know what to do , mr schmid told mr brady then i stopped spassky s clock , breaking the rules but somehow i had to get that incredible situation under control mr schmid reasoned with both players to mr spassky , he said boris , you promised me you would play this game here are you breaking that promise \? to mr fischer bobby , please be kind it worked mr spassky sat down mr fischer apologized and went on to win the game , and eventually the match , becoming world champion \( twenty years later , after mr fischer had retired , he staged a brief comeback by playing a match against mr spassky in yugoslavia mr schmid was again the arbiter \) the 1978 karpovkorchnoi match was in many ways even more difficult than the one in 1972 mr karpov , a soviet player , had become world champion after mr fischer refused to defend the title in 1975 mr korchnoi had long been one of the top soviet players , but he had defected to the netherlands two years earlier and was considered a traitor by the soviet authorities mr korchnoi s wife and son had been prevented from leaving the soviet union , and his son was arrested and imprisoned after he refused to be conscripted into the soviet army to complicate matters , the players simply did not like each other the match became a farce of recriminations and bad behavior mr korchnoi accused one member of mr karpov s entourage of being a parapsychologist who was trying to hypnotize him mr korchnoi even threatened to punch him before game 17 unless he was moved farther back in the audience to placate mr korchnoi , mr schmid was given the authority to ban spectators if they became disruptive there was such acrimony that the players stopped speaking to each other even draw offers had to go through mr schmid or one of his deputies the 1986 match was also tense it was the third time in three years that mr kasparov and mr karpov had played for the title the first match , which began in september 1984 , lasted five months and involved 48 games before being suspended mr kasparov won the second match in 1985 to become champion but according to the rules of that contest , mr karpov was entitled to a rematch so they met again in 1986 , and by that time the two had developed a healthy dislike for each other the match , however , featured none of the theatrics of the 1972 or 1978 contest lothar maximilian lorenz schmid was born on may 10 , 1928 , in dresden , germany his father , euchar albrecht schmid , was a publisher mr schmid studied to be a lawyer but became involved in the family business when his father died in 1951 he eventually took it over and ran it for decades although publishing took him away from playing chess , it gave him the financial means to build a chess library , by many accounts the largest private collection in the world , with an estimated 50 , 000 items mr schmid , who lived in bamberg , is survived by his wife of 55 years , ingrid two sons , wolfgang and bernhard a daughter , alexandra and five grandchildren
indianapolis the ' paul george got to shake s hand again sunday night , but this time he was not basking in a show of respect from james , the nba s most valuable player this time , it was more of a nice try , kid the s 11496 victory in game 3 of the eastern conference finals was full of statements like the one made by heat forward udonis haslem \( 17 points \) , who showed that it does not take a single 3point shot for someone other than james , dwyane wade or chris bosh to play a decisive role in the team s offense he was hitting a lot of shots he was n't normally hitting , pacers center roy hibbert said and he was letting me hear it or the one made collectively by the pacers , who responded to coach frank vogel s pregame call for the different sort of poise and composure required at home by declaring with a giant defensive whiff that they are not yet mentally tough enough to kick miami while it s down the heat made clear they can win anywhere , moving to 50 on the road in the postseason , with 10 straight road wins over all , while handing indiana its first loss of the playoffs at bankers life fieldhouse the biggest message , though , was sent by james \( 22 points \) , whose oneonone matchup with george \( 13 points , 3for10 shooting \) showed that george , a thirdyear pacers forward , has some work to do to reach the top tier of his sport at the very least , james put a whole lot of distance between himself and george miami put the game away with a 103 run , capped by a ray allen 3pointer , to make the score 9978 with 9 minutes 35 seconds left but james put away george throughout the first half , especially during the final 5 09 , after george reentered the game and resumed defending james the next four heat possessions went like this james dribbled left , bumped george out of the way and hit a leaning jumper james drove past george , drew a double team and found a cutting haslem for a 3point play james caught the ball deep on george and scored james drew a foul on george and hit two free throws by the end of that brief stretch , which could not have felt brief at all to george , he was exhausted and james had all but given the heat a 21 lead in the series the heat opened a 7056 halftime lead when james drilled a 14foot runner we wanted to be a little more aggressive , a little more committed to getting into the paint and seeing what would happen , heat coach erik spoelstra said and lebron was very committed and focused not to settle that aggressiveness set the tone james started slowly , probably by design more than halfway through the first quarter , miami led by 2019 with james not having attempted a shot over the final 17 39 of the half , though , he scored 18 points and was 7for 11 from the field i saw i had a oneonone matchup , so i just tried to take advantage of it , james said my teammates gave me space he added , i tried to anchor myself down on the block and go to work george , who opened the scoring on a driving layup 23 seconds into the game , attempted only two shots the rest of the half none in the second quarter , even though he played nearly nine minutes haslem , who scored only 3 points combined in games 1 and 2 in miami , was brilliant he was 4 for 4 from the field in the game s first eight minutes , with three jumpers from his familiar spot on the left baseline and one impressive drive into and over hibbert , the pacers' 7foot2 center hibbert , the socalled rim protector , protected nothing sunday , nor did his teammates the pacers , the nba s secondbest defensive team during the regular season extremely effective against james and co down the stretch of a game 2 victory tried to run and gun with the heat needless to say , it did not work hibbert \( 20 points , 17 rebounds \) and david west \( 21 points , 10 rebounds \) kept the pacers within range for much of the game , but only in theory game 3 began with a motivated bankers life fieldhouse crowd booing wade lustily for his elbow to the head of lance stephenson in game 2 miami s chris andersen soon drew his share of invective , too well before the heat had called it a night , though , the arena was more than half empty , and familiar questions were confronting the pacers can they really challenge the heat , let alone beat them in a sevengame series \? are they really such a daunting matchup for the defending champions \? and is george truly an elitelevel player yet \? when james offered him a handshake after the two had traded dazzling plays to end the third quarter of game 2 , it seemed something like a coronation a game later , james was the undisputed king once again , and the heat looked every bit like the team that has not lost consecutive games since january look , game 2 , i'm sure there s so many story lines out there , but the fact is they beat us , spoelstra said the heat found added motivation in that loss , according to forward shane battier it s just maturity , battier said we 've got a lot of old guys in this locker room when we lose a game , we usually understand why
congress made a sensible decision a decade ago when it required the states to administer yearly tests to public school students in exchange for federal education aid the theory behind the no child left behind act was that holding schools accountable for test scores would force them to improve instruction for groups of children whom they had historically shortchanged testing did spur some progress in student performance but it has become clear to us over time that testing was being overemphasized and misused in schools that were substituting test preparation for instruction even though testdriven reforms were helpful in the beginning , it is now clear that they will never bring this country s schools up to par with those of the highperforming nations that have left us far behind in math , science and even literacy instruction congress required the states to give annual math and reading tests in grades three through eight \( and once in high school \) as a way of ensuring that students were making progress and that minority children were being fairly educated schools that did not meet performance targets for two years were labeled as needing improvement and subjected to sanctions fearing that they would be labeled poor performers , schools and districts especially in lowincome areas rolled out a relentless series of diagnostic tests that were actually practice rounds for the highstakes exams to come that the real tests were weak , and did not gauge the skills students needed to succeed , made matters worse unfortunately , most states did not invest in rigorous , highquality exams with openended essay questions that test reasoning skill rather , they opted for cheap , multiplechoice tests of marginal value while practically making exams the center of the educational mission , the country underinvested in curriculum development and teacher training , overlooking the approaches that other nations use to help teachers get constantly better the government went further in the testing direction through its competitive grant program , known as race to the top , and a waiver program related to no child left behind , both of which pushed the states to create teacher evaluation systems that take student test data into account test scores should figure in evaluations , but the measures have to be fair , properly calibrated and statistically valid all of which means that these evaluation systems cannot be rushed into service before they are ready foreign nations with the highestperforming school systems did not build them this way in fact , none of the topperforming nations have opted for a regime of gradebygrade standardized tests instead , they typically have gateway exams that determine , for example , if high school students have met their standards these countries typically have strong , national curriculums perhaps most important , they set a high bar for entry into the teaching profession and make sure that the institutions that train teachers do it exceedingly well in finland , for example , teacher preparation programs are highly competitive and extremely challenging \( the programs are free to students and come with a living stipend \) close attention is devoted not just to scholarly and research matters but to pedagogical skills this country , by contrast , has an abysmal system of teacher preparation that point was underscored recently in a harrowing report on teacher education programs from the national council on teacher quality , a research and advocacy group the report found that very few programs meet even basic quality standards new students are often poorly prepared , and what the schools teach them often has little relevance to what they need to succeed in the classroom some problems could be partly solved by the common core learning standards , an ambitious set of goals for what students should learn the common core , adopted by all but a handful of states , could move the nation away from rote memorization and those cheap , colorinthebubble tests and toward a writingintensive system that gives students the reasoning skills they need in the new economy but the concept has become the subject of a backlash from testweary parents who have little confidence in a whole new round of exams that the system will require beyond that , teachers are understandably worried that they will be evaluated and pushed out of jobs based on how their students perform on tests related to the old curriculum while they are being asked to teach the new one if school officials fail to resolve these issues in a fair manner , the national effort to install the new standards could collapse congress could ease some of the test mania by rethinking the way schools are evaluated under no child left behind test scores are important to that process , but modest weight should be given to a few other indicators , like advanced courses , promotion rates , collegegoing rates and so on similarly , the states that have allowed the districts to choke schools with the diagnostic tests and data collection could reverse that trend so that schools have perhaps one or two higherquality tests per year in other words , the country needs to reconsider its obsession with testing , which can make education worse , not better
one of the truly refreshing changes in baseball is how open it has been lately to commonsense improvements not long ago , the owners and the players union bickered constantly over money , artificial surfaces chewed up knees , and nobody tested for steroids there was no interleague play , no wild cards , no video review for disputed home runs there was no world baseball classic , no sevenday disabled list for concussions , no control over draft bonuses baseball was baffling in its stubborn refusal to make logical changes the next thing that must change is the voting process for the hall of fame there are too many unqualified voters too many voters , period and too many segments of the baseball world with no say in the process there has to be a better way to decide the ultimate honor to get a ballot for the hall of fame , you must be a member of the baseball writers' association of america for 10 consecutive years most of our membership does an extraordinary job of bringing the game to the fans , just as we did when we started voting for the hall of fame in 1936 most writers care deeply about the responsibility but we are an imperfect voting bloc , and to suggest otherwise is na ve in theory , everybody who covers baseball for 10 years has a depth of knowledge and perspective that should last a lifetime but it does not always work that way plenty of the association s active members do not cover the sport regularly there are editors , general assignment writers and so on they hold the card mainly for the convenience of access but if they hold it long enough , they can keep voting no matter what they cover \( the new york times does not permit its reporters to vote for awards \) some writers who have spent decades with no involvement in baseball can vote for the hall of fame yet so many others smart , insightful people with a deep and continuing appreciation for the game have no say in the process broadcasters , for example , are not involved yes , many are employed by or approved by the team they follow but some voters now work for what s the difference \? why should people like vin scully , joe buck and jon miller have no chance to vote for the hall of fame \? the number of voters should be drastically reduced , while the types of voters should be expanded in 1998 , 473 ballots were cast last year there were 573 an increase of more than 21 percent are there really 100 more qualified voters now than there were 15 years ago \? with so many voters , it has become harder for candidates to reach the 75 percent threshold for induction that might not be a bad thing , depending on your perspective some voters have extremely high standards , which is their prerogative historically , though , the expansion era is vastly underrepresented it is possible , and maybe even likely , that nobody will be elected when the writers' ballot is announced on wednesday the steroids issue begs for clarity , but there really is none some of the best players of the recent past took performanceenhancing drugs yet there was no testing yet voters are told to consider sportsmanship yet plenty of rogues are already in the hall the contradictions go on and on but this is not about the makeup of the hall of fame it is about the makeup of the electorate , and who should really be judging immortality there have always been inexplicable votes nobody in the history of the game has been a unanimous inductee but it should not have to be that way the modern iteration of the veterans committee which last year included four hall of famers , four current executives and eight historians or members of the news media offers a guide to a more sensible election process here is a proposal that preserves the tradition of bbwaa involvement while more accurately reflecting the game as a whole a panel of 36 people would participate , with 27 votes \( still 75 percent \) needed for election onethird of the panel would be active 10year members of the baseball writers association onethird would be hall of famers onethird would include representatives of many other areas executives , scouts , broadcasters , statistical analysts , historians and so on no candidate could be elected without at least some support from each group votes would not be made public the hall of famers should have the privacy to vote without regard to the feelings of former teammates or opponents voters could select as many candidates as they wished , without being bound by the current , rather arbitrary limit of 10 per ballot an overview committee the hall s board of directors , perhaps could select a new batch of voters every year this would make it a privilege , not a right , to get a ballot , and ensure fresh viewpoints annually from a diverse group with strong credentials the push for a change in the voting process could come from the hall of fame board , but it really should come from the writers ourselves part of our job description is offering perspective and context to our readers part of the writing process is editing our articles , making them tighter and better it is time to apply all of that to this task we must acknowledge that we are no longer if we ever really were the only people whose opinions should count it is time to improve our process
detroit it was an act of faith , notable in a season of wavering trust , that giants quarterback eli manning lobbied coach tom coughlin to go for a first down during overtime sunday the detroit lions and giants were tied at 2020 , and manning , despite his team s offense being stuck in neutral , wanted to gamble manning , never leaving the field , wanted coughlin s blessing on a fourthand7 situation at the lions 42yard line coughlin was already on manning s wavelength , and quickly agreed manning found receiver jerrel jernigan for a 15yard gain that set up a 45yard field goal by josh brown that allowed the giants to escape ford field with a 2320 win i did n't want to punt it there , i wanted to win this thing , go for it , and win it there , said manning , who was 23for42 passing , for 256 yards , one touchdown and one interception the win ended a twogame losing streak for the giants \( 69 \) they close out the season next sunday , at home , against the washington redskins we 've taken a lot shots this year , quite frankly have earned the criticism i do n't think where is any doubt about that , coughlin said but we have been able to stay focused , and been able to touch on some real deep values that get overlooked when people tell you you 've got nothing to play for we have everything in the world to play for , he added , saying sunday was a good demonstration of that the lions had something more tangible to play for a slender , fraying thread of playoff hope to salvage a tailspin the lions \( 78 \) needed to beat the giants , along with having the green bay packers and the chicago bears lose , to remain in playoff contention the lions failed to complete their part of the equation and instead suffered their fifth defeat in six games the giants revealed some offensive tweaks , rolling out more throwback screens and quickhitting plays to change the pace the lions secondary was ripe to exploit , as injuries forced them to start reserves jonte green and bill bentley at corner jernigan proved to be a key factor , with 80 yards receiving on six catches and the giants lone offensive touchdown with victor cruz lost for the season with a knee injury , the giants needed another reliable receiver it meant a lot , jernigan said , about having a role in the win i was at practice every day , watching victor , and taking tips from him and learning from him that s the best thing you can do it did not need to be this challenging for the giants to win , as they built a 133 by halftime but the offense went silent for the rest of the game , with only the defense clicking with the giants down 2013 with less than five minutes left in regulation , safety will hill intercepted a tipped pass from matthew stafford hill ran 38 yards for a touchdown , pushing the game into overtime tied at 2020 hill , who was arrested friday for a warrant related to unpaid child support , would not talk about his offfield problems he said he was glad to play sunday , and to help the giants earn a win i just saw the ball tip up in the air , and took advantage of the situation , hill said , adding of the defense it was a cover4 , and i was overseeing three people once the ball tipped from his hand , all i saw was daylight both teams struggled with wasted opportunities , turnovers , poor passing and offensive inconsistencies the lions were intercepted twice and lost a fumble , while the giants also lost a fumble and threw one interception the lions defense became more effective as the game wore on , poking more and more holes in the giants offensive line nick fairley singlehandedly revived the lions in the third quarter the giants were pinned deep in their zone on their final drive of the quarter , and manning went into the shotgun formation on a thirdand13 at the 9 elevated pressure forced manning to the goal line as he tried to buy time to spot an open receiver none appeared , and fairley bolted through the line to sack manning in the end zone for a safety the lions slashed the giants lead to 1312 the giants had built their halftime edge by forcing turnovers linebacker mathias kiwanuka triggered the lions 32nd turnover of the season in the second quarter , stripping running back reggie bush safety antrel rolle scooped up the ball , officially marking bush s fourth fumble of the season the giants turned the takeaway into a touchdown , when manning connected with a wideopen jernigan for his first career touchdown catch the giants forced another turnover near the end of the quarter , when defensive end justin tuck intercepted stafford at close range brown kicked his second field goal of the half to put the giants up by 10 the lions went to the ground , since receiver calvin johnson was limited by a knee injury and stafford s timing was still off running back joique bell scored the lions first touchdown of the game with 9 minutes 10 seconds left in the third , cutting the giants lead to 1310 back theo riddick gave the lions their first lead of the game , at 11 50 in the fourth , with a 2yard charge into the end zone the lions gambled , making a 2point conversion to go up 2013 it was a strategic move meant to extend their playoff hopes but it was the giants , already out of the playoff mix , who had the gamble that ultimately paid off , at least for a game
los angeles with the mayor s office up for grabs for the first time in nearly a decade , voters here will go to the polls tuesday in the first step to choose a successor to antonio r villaraigosa but the mayoral primary is drawing far less enthusiasm than the election eight years ago , when mr villaraigosa rode a wave of enthusiasm and became the city s first latino mayor in more than a century none of the eight candidates is expected to win a majority of votes , making a runoff at the end of may all but certain turnout is expected to be very low among the city s 18 million voters the two leading candidates , , the city controller , and , a councilman who represents hollywood , are in a statistical dead heat , each drawing about 25 percent of likely voters , by the los angeles times and the university of southern california released over the weekend they are trailed by , a councilwoman who represents downtown and south los angeles , and , a republican and former radio talk show host , a former mayoral aide , is also a candidate , as well as yehuda draiman , norton sandler and addie m miller over months of campaigning , none of the candidates produced a large core of supporters this is a very capable group of candidates , but they are n't nearly as well known and none of them have the type of outsize personality that we 've seen in past campaigns , said dan schnur , the director of the jesse m unruh institute of politics at the university of southern california , who oversaw the poll the campaign has focused more on biography and experience , but without a largerthanlife figure in the race , that s left voters without a great level of enthusiasm ms greuel or ms perry would be the first woman elected to the city s top post , something both have emphasized in their appeals to voters mr garcetti , whose grandfather came from mexico , has emphasized his latino roots and fluency in spanish his father , gil garcetti , is a former city district attorney ms perry , who is black , asked churchgoers on sunday to turn out like you turned out for obama in this overwhelmingly democratic city , mr james has played up his biography as a gay , socially liberal republican the lackluster interest has not stopped and perhaps has spurred increasingly negative attacks in recent days , particularly among the three leading democratic candidates , who say they agree on a broad range of issues ms greuel has said that ms perry s personal bankruptcy filing in the 1990s calls into question her ability to manage the city s 7 billion budget ms perry and her supporters called the attack morally reprehensible ms greuel has also gone after mr garcetti for his stake in a beverly hills property that has a potential for oil and gas drilling rights mr garcetti and ms perry have returned the attacks by accusing ms greuel of being too beholden to the city s public workers' unions to bring down spending for labor and pensions one independent committee backed by the union that represents workers at the city s department of water and power has spent roughly 2 million supporting ms greuel
school officials in woodbridge , conn , faced complaints on monday evening concerning amity regional high school s spring musical , the stephen sondheimhugh wheeler show sweeney todd , which some local residents are denouncing as too dark and violent for teenagers in the drama program the critics also invoked the december shootings at sandy hook elementary in nearby newtown as a reason to oppose sweeney todd , a tony awardwinning musical about a london barber driven to murderous rage and a shopkeeper who turns the corpses into pies amity high school students are assigned and taught to perform the horrific acts of gruesome murder , cannibalism , rape , suicide , etc , wrote one of the protesters , laura carroll , on a community blog on friday our children and communities are still going through the effects of the sandy hook massacre what is amity s message to these children \? amity high school is supporting violence in our community the tone was less harsh , however , by the time the critics showed up to speak at monday s regularly scheduled meeting of the district school board during the public comment portion of the meeting , a handful of people expressed concerns about the decision to produce sweeney todd and asked about the manner in which shows are chosen , according to howard sherman , a theater consultant and former executive director of the nonprofit american theater wing , who attended the meeting mr sherman said he and a couple of other people spoke in favor of the show none of the critics asked for the outright cancellation of the production , which is scheduled to begin on april 5 after hearing out both sides , the board moved on to other business no votes or other discussion of the musical took place , mr sherman said the local schools superintendent , john brady , said in a telephone interview on monday that he and the high school principal were standing behind the sweeney todd production , which is scheduled to begin performances on april 5 as far as i know this protest is about three or four individuals , who made their feelings known on the blog monday morning , and unfortunately made the decision to link our production to newtown , mr brady said we are doing the high school edition of sweeney todd , which is one of the most produced shows at high schools in the country , and which has some of the lyrics and scenes toned down from the broadway version this is a suitable show for amity high school ms carroll did not return phone messages seeking comment on monday or tuesday efforts to reach her through the blog administrator were also unsuccessful mr sherman , who is also an alumnus of amity regional high school , said he decided to rent a car and drive up to connecticut once he heard about the planned protest , to support the drama program , sweeney todd and the value of allowing students to tackle challenging work this is an issue i see happening more and more , these cases where teachers and schools come under harsh pressure from a few people in the community who do not like the choice of a play or a musical for reasons that don t have to do with education or the arts , mr sherman said by telephone as he drove to connecticut mr sondheim did not immediately reply on monday to a phone message seeking comment
the fight to restore familyplanning financing that was cut from the texas budget in the last legislative session has taken a turn toward primary care republican state senators have proposed adding 100 million to a staterun primary care program specifically for women s health services , an effort that could help avoid a political fight over subsidizing specialty familyplanning clinics it s a much better way to treat the women because they do n't just have familyplanning issues , said senator robert deuell , republican of greenville , a family physician who has advocated an increase in primarycare services for women using taxpayer dollars to finance familyplanning services has become politically thorny in texas , largely because of republican lawmakers' assertions that the women s health clinics providing that care are affiliated with providers in the fiscal crunch of 2011 , the legislature cut the state s familyplanning budget by twothirds , with some lawmakers claiming that they were defunding the abortion industry researchers at the university of texas at austin , found that more than 50 familyplanning clinics had closed statewide as a result now , amid estimates that the cuts could lead to 24 , 000 additional 201415 births at a cost to taxpayers of 273 million , lawmakers are seeking a way to restore financing without ruffling feathers several state senators have suggested earmarking 100 million in general revenue to the community primary care services program , to be used for women s health services the program contracts community health clinics and nonprofit organizations to provide a range of services for poor texans who do not qualify for other state health programs the additional money could increase the number of patients served annually in the program to 234 , 000 from 64 , 000 and nearly double the number of participating health care organizations , to 100 from 57 , according to the department of state health services health care advocates say the proposal to add state money to a primarycare program could broaden the scope of services and the range of women eligible for assistance this new way , hopefully , will invest money in infrastructure to rebuild what the unintended consequences the impact of the cuts have been , said jos camacho , executive director of the texas association of community health centers \( the association is a corporate sponsor of the texas tribune \) but some women s health advocates are concerned that without modifications to the primarycare program , the strategy would divert money for services like to health services for older women there s an advantage to guiding that money to the family planning , that preventive care piece , because that s where the cost savings occur , said janet realini , leader of the texas women s healthcare coalition but , she added , her group was happy to have the funding however it gets there health care advocates say there are reasons to restore federal familyplanning financing , rather than putting state dollars into primary care but that money , which texas relied on in previous budgets , is no longer a sure thing two other organizations , including planned parenthood , that have submitted bids to receive and distribute the federal familyplanning dollars the goal has always been to keep the funds out of the abortion industry , said elizabeth graham , director of texas right to life she hopes the expanded primarycare program will serve a broader population but said texas right to life was still investigating the participating providers to ensure none are affiliated with abortion providers
in america today , we are sometimes made to feel that it is na ve to be preoccupied with trust our songs advise against it , our tv shows tell stories showing its futility , and incessant reports of financial scandal remind us we d be fools to give it to our bankers that last point may be true , but that doesn t mean we should stop striving for a bit more trust in our society and our economy trust is what makes contracts , plans and everyday transactions possible it facilitates the democratic process , from voting to law creation , and is necessary for social stability it is essential for our lives it is trust , more than money , that makes the world go round we do not measure trust in our national income accounts , but investments in trust are no less important than those in human capital or machines unfortunately , however , trust is becoming yet another casualty of our country s staggering inequality as the gap between americans widens , the bonds that hold society together weaken so , too , as more and more people lose faith in a system that seems inexorably stacked against them , and the 1 percent ascend to ever more distant heights , this vital element of our institutions and our way of life is eroding the undervaluing of trust has its roots in our most popular economic traditions adam smith argued forcefully that we would do better to trust in the pursuit of selfinterest than in the good intentions of those who pursue the general interest if everyone looked out for just himself , we would reach an equilibrium that was not just comfortable but also productive , in which the economy was fully efficient to the morally uninspired , it s an appealing idea selfishness as the ultimate form of selflessness \( elsewhere , in particular in his theory of moral sentiments , smith took a much more balanced view , though most of his latterday adherents have not followed suit \) but events and economic research over the past 30 years have shown not only that we cannot rely on selfinterest , but also that no economy , not even a modern , marketbased economy like america s , can function well without a modicum of trust and that unmitigated selfishness inevitably diminishes trust take banking , the industry that spawned the crisis that has cost us dearly that industry in particular had long been based on trust you put your money into the bank , trusting that when you wanted to take it out in the future , it would be there this is not to say that bankers never tried to deceive one another or their clients but a vast majority of their business was conducted on the basis of assumed mutual accountability , sufficient levels of transparency , and a sense of responsibility at their best , banks were stalwart community institutions that made judicious loans to promising small businesses and prospective homeowners in the years leading up to the crisis , though , our traditional bankers changed drastically , aggressively branching out into other activities , including those historically associated with investment banking trust went out the window commercial lenders hardsold mortgages to families who couldn t afford them , using false assurances they could comfort themselves with the idea that no matter how much they exploited their customers and how much risk they had undertaken , new insurance products derivatives and other chicanery insulated their banks from the consequences if any of them thought about the social implications of their activities , whether it was predatory lending , abusive credit card practices , or market manipulation , they might have taken comfort that , in accordance with adam smith s dictum , their swelling bank accounts implied that they must be boosting social welfare of course , we now know this was all a mirage things didn t turn out well for our economy or our society as millions lost their homes during and after the crisis , median wealth declined nearly 40 percent in three years banks would have done badly , too , were it not for the bushobama megabailouts this cascade of trust destruction was unrelenting one of the reasons that the bubble s bursting in 2007 led to such an enormous crisis was that no bank could trust another each bank knew the shenanigans it had been engaged in the movement of liabilities off its balance sheets , the predatory and reckless lending and so knew that it could not trust any other bank interbank lending froze , and the financial system came to the verge of collapse , saved only by the resolute action of the public , whose trust had been the most abused of all there had been earlier episodes when the financial sector showed how fragile trust was most notable was the crash of 1929 , which prompted new laws to stop the worst abuses , from fraud to market manipulation we trusted regulators to enforce the law , and we trusted the banks to obey the law the government couldn t be everywhere , but banks would at least be kept in line by fearing the consequences of bad behavior decades later , however , bankers used their political influence to eviscerate regulations and install regulators who didn t believe in them officials and academics assured lawmakers and the public that banks could selfregulate but it all turned out to be a scam we had created a system of rewards that encouraged shortsighted behavior and excessive risktaking in fact , we had entered an era in which moral values were given short shrift and trust itself was discounted the banking industry is only one example of what amounts to a broad agenda , promoted by some politicians and theoreticians on the right , to undermine the role of trust in our economy this movement promotes policies based on the view that trust should never be relied on as motivation , for any kind of behavior , in any context incentives , in this scheme , are all that matter so ceo s must be given stock options to induce them to work hard i find this puzzling if a firm pays someone 10 million to run a company , he should give his all to ensure its success he shouldn t do so only if he is promised a big chunk of any increase in the company s stock market value , even if the increase is only a result of a bubble created by the fed s low interest rates similarly , teachers must be given incentive pay to induce them to exert themselves but teachers already work hard for low wages because they are dedicated to improving the lives of their students do we really believe that giving them 50 more , or even 500 more , as incentive pay will induce them to work harder \? what we should do is increase teacher salaries generally because we recognize the value of their contributions and trust in their professionalism according to the advocates of an incentivebased culture , though , this would be akin to giving something for nothing in practice , the right s narrow focus on incentives has proved inimical to longterm thinking and so rife with opportunities for greed that it was bound to promote distrust , both in society and within companies bank managers and corporate executives search out creative accounting devices to make their enterprises look good in the short run , even if their longrun prospects are compromised of course , incentives are an important component of human behavior but the incentive movement has made them into a sort of religion , blind to all the other factors social ties , moral impulses , compassion that influence our conduct this is not just a coldhearted vision of human nature it is also implausible it is simply impossible to pay for trust every time it is required without trust , life would be absurdly expensive good information would be nearly unobtainable fraud would be even more rampant than it is and transaction and litigation costs would soar our society would be as frozen as the banks were when their years of dishonesty came to a head and the crisis broke in 2007 america faces another formidable hurdle if it wants to restore a climate of trust our outofcontrol inequality not only did the actions of the bankers and government policies influenced by the right directly undermine trust , both contributed greatly to this inequality when 1 percent of the population takes home more than 22 percent of the country s income and 95 percent of the increase in income in the postcrisis recovery some pretty basic things are at stake reasonable people , even those ignorant of the maze of unfair policies that created this reality , can look at this absurd distribution and be pretty certain that the game is rigged but for our economy and society to function , participants must trust that the system is reasonably fair trust between individuals is usually reciprocal but if i think that you are cheating me , it is more likely that i will retaliate , and try to cheat you \( these notions have been well developed in a branch of economics called the theory of repeated games \) when americans see a tax system that taxes the wealthiest at a fraction of what they pay , they feel that they are fools to play along all the more so when the wealthiest are able to move profits off shore the fact that this can be done without breaking the law simply shows americans that the financial and legal systems are designed by and for the rich as the trust deficit persists , a deeper rot takes hold attitudes and norms begin to change when no one is trustworthy , it will be only fools who trust the concept of fairness itself is eroded a study published last year by the national academy of sciences suggests that the upper classes are more likely to engage in what has traditionally been considered unethical behavior perhaps this is the only way for some to reconcile their worldview with their outlandish financial success , often achieved through actions that reveal a kind of moral deprivation it s hard to know just how far we ve gone down the path toward complete trust disintegration , but the evidence is not encouraging economic inequality , political inequality , and an inequalitypromoting legal system all mutually reinforce one another we get a legal system that provides privileges to the rich and powerful occasionally , individual egregious behavior is punished \( bernard l madoff comes to mind \) but none of those who headed our mighty banks are held accountable as always , it is the poor and the unconnected who suffer most from this , and who are the most repeatedly deceived nowhere was this more evident than in the foreclosure crisis the subprime mortgage hawkers , putting themselves forward as experts in finance , assured unqualified borrowers that repayment would be no problem later millions would lose their homes the banks figured out how to get court affidavits signed by the thousands \( in what came to be called robosigning \) , certifying that they had examined their records and that these particular individuals owed money and so should be booted out of their homes the banks were lying on a grand scale , but they knew that if they didn t get caught , they would walk off with huge profits , their officials pockets stuffed with bonuses and if they did get caught , their shareholders would be left paying the tab the ordinary homeowner simply didn t have the resources to fight them it was just one example among many in the wake of the crisis where banks were seemingly immune to the rule of law i ve written about many dimensions of inequality in our society inequality of wealth , of income , of access to education and health , of opportunity but perhaps even more than opportunity , americans cherish equality before the law here , inequality has infected the heart of our ideals i suspect there is only one way to really get trust back we need to pass strong regulations , embodying norms of good behavior , and appoint bold regulators to enforce them we did just that after the roaring 20s crashed our efforts since 2007 have been sputtering and incomplete firms also need to do better than skirt the edges of regulations we need higher norms for what constitutes acceptable behavior , like those embodied in the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights but we also need regulations to enforce these norms a new version of trust but verify no rules will be strong enough to prevent every abuse , yet good , strong regulations can stop the worst of it strong values enable us to live in harmony with one another without trust , there can be no harmony , nor can there be a strong economy inequality in america is degrading our trust for our own sake , and for the sake of future generations , it s time to start rebuilding it that this even requires pointing out shows how far we have to go
the and on wednesday bring us to a compelling intersection of coaching norms and excessive behavior they also remind us that the good old days were n't all that good pardee was an extraordinary football player and a good coach he played three seasons for bear bryant at texas am , where he survived bryant s notorious 1954 boot camp , a part of the coach s brutal strategy to reenergize a once proud program that experience , in junction , tex , was chronicled by jim dent in the 1999 book dent described the ordeal am players endured under bryant , who tried to toughen what he considered a soft football team by putting it through grueling workouts in unbearable heat with no water breaks pardee was one of 35 players the junction boys who survived the grueling 10 days we would like to think , in our enlightened era , that bryant would be fired if he were to try those tactics today but then we see a video in 2013 of rice hurling basketballs at his rutgers players , screaming homophobic slurs at them and aggressively putting his hands on them how far have we really come \? more to the point how far have we as fans sunk \? have we become numb to the byanymeansnecessary approach by bryant and now by rice \? the rutgers episode raises troubling questions about whether variations of the junction boys imperative live on in the contemporary college sports arena , where young players still see the coach as the ultimate authority figure in in texas , pardee explained his view of what bryant was attempting to accomplish coach bryant wanted to find out who wanted to pay the price to not only play football , but to win , pardee said how effective were bryant s tactics \? in 1954 , the boot camp season , am finished 19 the next year it improved to 721 pardee was a captain on the 1956 team , which was 901 the ncaa declared bryant s 1956 team ineligible for a bowl game because of recruiting violations committed in 1955 he was 83 in 1957 before moving to alabama rice s tactics yielded consistently dismal results his rutgers teams were 4451 over all , including 1516 this season he was 1638 in big east play , including 513 this season what was striking about the rutgers video were the reactions of the players there appeared to be no resistance , no angry scowls none of them had to be held back they seemed resigned , anesthetized , to the tirades by the time most players are 17 years old , screaming and yelling are as much a part of the game as wearing sneakers for many players , a college scholarship is the one great opportunity for a shot at a better life , an education they otherwise might not be able to afford or reach in that case , what s a little screaming or in pardee s case , sprints in the heat when opportunity hangs in the balance \? in the interview with the mineral wells newspaper , pardee said that he never considered giving up at bryant s brutal camp i never thought about quitting , he said if i did , where would i go , christoval \? hey , i worked hard to get out of there , he added , referring to the tiny texas community from which he had come there is a razorthin line between motivation and abuse , between tough tactics and bullying some episodes illustrating that line occur in highprofile arenas , but many take place out of view across the country in 1997 bob knight , then the basketball coach at indiana , grabbed one of his players , neil reed , by the neck and pushed him backward in practice when reed made it in 2000 , but  six months later there are plenty of longforgotten , borderline cases of abuses of power in 1990 duke was defeated badly by virginia in charlottesville , va mike krzyzewski , apparently angered by his team s performance , during this extra session , grant hill , the blue devils' starting forward , broke his nose shortly afterward , delegates to the ncaa convention passed a regulation that prohibited practices on the day of a game the rule was not aimed at duke or at krzyzewski but at curbing the unchecked power and influence wielded by college coaches contemporary viewers can look at bryant s treatment of his players in 1954 through the prism of disbelief , wonderment or admiration we can say bryant s actions were relics of a bygone era rice s outrageous behavior suggests that , from junction , tex , to piscataway , nj , that era may still be upon us
the oklahoma city thunder announced friday that point guard russell westbrook would have his third operation in a year on his right knee and would be out of the lineup until midfebruary in the interim , the thunder will need kevin durant , the nba s leading scorer , to be even more aggressive on offense every point will count as they try to keep pace atop the brutally competitive western conference westbrook s injury will test the team s developing young players , who will be elevated to bigger roles but westbrook s injury will probably have less of an effect on oklahoma city s starters than on its productive bench it is always bad news to lose a player of westbrook s ability , but the thunder are blessed that westbrook s backup , reggie jackson , is raring to take over jackson , out of boston college , started eight playoff games when westbrook hurt his knee in the first round last season and has spent this season staking a claim as the thunder s thirdbest player a 6foot3 point guard with long arms and strides , jackson mimics westbrook s appetite for attacking the basket he does not draw fouls as well as westbrook but is a better shooter and a capable finisher at the rim as espn s tom haberstroh noted , on a per48minute basis , only lebron james , dwyane wade and manu ginobili offer jackson s combination of points \( 239 \) , rebounds \( 73 \) and assists \( 65 \) , along with a 452 shooting percentage that is outstanding production for a thirdyear player making 12 million almost exactly what the knicks are paying for the services of beno udrih the thunder , who have the nba s best record at 255 , were the only team with a topfive offense and a topfive defense in terms of points per possession but it is n't the starting five that is responsible for that statistic the thunder s starters have been outscored as a unit this season , despite the efforts of westbrook and kevin durant jackson and durant s second unit , on the other hand , has been magnificent the thunder do a smart job of pairing durant with four bench players to make sure there is plenty of scoring punch on the floor , but it is the defense , starting with jackson , that often swings games in oklahoma city s favor virtually every regularly used lineup with durant , jackson and three other bench players is outscoring opponents by 20 points per 48 minutes against the knicks on christmas , jackson s crew blew out the host team in the second quarter , holding the knicks to just 17 points on 27 percent fieldgoal shooting amar'e stoudemire learned about jackson s explosiveness firsthand when jackson drove the left baseline and hammered home a righthanded dunk this is not the first time the thunder have enjoyed the services of a super substitute before jackson became the driving force of their bench , that role belonged to james harden , who became a thirdteam allnba player last season after oklahoma city traded him to houston back when harden was sixth man of the year , many insisted that when he took on a bigger role , he would not be able to sustain his perminute production but it has actually improved the thunder hope for a similar leap from jackson , who will probably play at least 10 more minutes a game with westbrook out the worry in oklahoma city will be what happens when jackson has to take a rest the thunder s only other point guard is 39yearold derek fisher , a wily veteran who can draw a cheap foul but whose slow feet make him a poor substitute for a shotcreating talent like jackson for the last two seasons , the thunder have kept fisher on the books as a sort of luxury although he has played in six nba finals , he has become a burden to carry in the second unit westbrook s injury also puts more of an onus on the thunder s starters to build leads rather than tread water until the second unit arrives that will not be easy with the likes of kendrick perkins , who , with his leaden hands , hangs like a 7foot albatross around the production of the starting five , despite his championship pedigree \( boston , 2008 \) and his leadership but while many teams have a player like fisher or perkins , almost none can claim a find like jackson , not to mention jeremy lamb and steven adams , who both play huge roles off the bench a smallmarket team , oklahoma city relies on cheap talent it drafts and develops if westbrook returns again and is ready to inflict his frenzied brand of ball on anyone in his path , his team will charge into the playoffs even better prepared for a title run oklahoma city may lose a step or two in the race for the west s top seed , but if jackson s brilliant first few months of the season are any indication of his play as a starter , the thunder will keep rolling
my children have no wish to live in sparta , and i have no desire to change that there are four of them , and they all , to varying degrees , like some sports , some of the time none of them has expressed more than a passing wish to dedicate his or her life to any particular athletic pastime , and to my mind , that s as it should be they enjoy the sports they play hockey , primarily , with dabbling in soccer or tennis they enjoy doing other things , too our hope is to help them participate in their team sport of choice with suitable teamsupporting rigor , while giving them plenty of time and space to explore other things but as i read lisa catherine harper s essay the crazy , intense schedule of competitive youth soccer \? bring it on , i was struck by how much my children s lives , in which we actively try to balance sports and other activities , avoiding supercompetitive leagues and elite teams , still manage to resemble the spartan training her children choose in their passion for their game the line between what she calls highly competitive team sports and regular , ordinary team sports is thin , and it seems to be getting thinner all the time the funny thing is , even youth sports associations , like usa hockey , say that the intensity with which many of today s children play their sport isn t the way they want it to be or even the way to create the best players , let alone instill a lifelong love of the game because hockey is our family sport , i am most familiar with its attempts to lessen the intensity that has led to young players at all levels playing five days a week , yearround in some places usa hockey s american development model has children under 12 playing fewer games and spending more time on their home rink in practice sessions designed to build skills , not competitive fire , and it actively encourages young players to play other sports at the youngest ages , we shouldn t try to develop hockey players , bob mancini , a regional manager for usa hockey and a former collegiate hockey coach , told espn magazine we should develop athletes who love hockey the espn magazine writer tom farrey notes that both usa tennis and usa swimming support children s playing other sports which suggests that their practice schedules should be structured to give those children the time to do so but movements to lessen the intensity of sports , whether at the highly competitive or theoretically recreational levels , face a mighty obstacle parents parents who , when they see their children playing fewer games than sally across the street , or practicing less often than bobby who is in connor s class , worry that their children won t be able to catch up , won t make the high school team or won t have fun , because they will lose all their games to the kids who spend more time on the ice or on the field those fears lead to a vicious circle , with every league trying to keep up with the league next door as highly competitive or elite teams in various sports add more practices , games and tournaments , even their supposedly more relaxed brethren feel the pressure , and what it means to play a sport as a child changes those of us who aren t raising what lisa catherine harper calls a sharp , pointed dagger of a child , but were aiming instead for a more wellrounded approach , need to speak up before our children s teams ramp up we need to actively tell coaches and associations that we are happy with two practices a week , with one game per weekend , with one tournament per season or none we need to seek out teams where players are not punished for missing a few practices or a game for a piano recital , and hold on to a world in which you can love a game without dedicating yourself \( and your parent \) to it full time team sports should not be the province only of those willing to sacrifice much on a spartan altar while some children and families choose the work and commitment involved in highly competitive elite teams , let s make sure there is still something left for those who consider it play lisa catherine harper and kj dell antonia are taking different approaches to children s sports read lisa catherine harper s essay the crazy , intense schedule of competitive youth soccer \? bring it on
new orleans at bottom , football is math a brutal , ruthless form of it , but math the offense schemes to gain an advantage more blockers than defenders while the defense plots to foil those plans which is why sometime during the super bowl on sunday , san francisco quarterback colin kaepernick will line up four yards behind center , a running back directly behind him , and receive the snap he will shove the ball into the running back s stomach and , from there , do one of three things hand the ball off , fake and run outside , or prime for a playaction pass all of these options are appealing to the 49ers none of them , in sum , are appealing to their opponents it is a hellacious challenge , defending this pistol formation , operated by this san francisco team , with its speedy quarterback and its readoption tendencies and its general proficiency at scoring a lot of points and gaining a lot of yards you name it , we got it , the offensive coordinator greg roman said we 're like the diner in the last two playoff rounds , green bay and atlanta pored over the 49ers' menu but could not eat the choices overwhelmed them the , next up , found a corner booth and have yet to leave after flummoxing peyton manning and tom brady , the ravens have spent the last two weeks practicing and preparing , honing instincts and concocting strategy , steadfast in their belief that for all of and despite the nearmythical status it has attained recently it is hardly unstoppable like every offense , it has its strengths and its weaknesses , said the former nevada coach chris ault , who conceived the pistol in 2005 one of its prevailing strengths is that the placement of the running back in a neutral position , not beside the quarterback prevents defenses from gleaning presnap clues when defending the readoption , teams generally seek to thwart the dive \( the handoff up the middle \) first , then the quarterback , then the potential pitchman dean pees , the ravens' defensive coordinator , has preached the importance of discipline to his players , who , he said , will have specific instructions and assignments someone focuses on kaepernick , someone else keys on the inside run by its nature , pees said , the pistol will put the most stress on baltimore s outside defenders , intentionally left unblocked at the line of scrimmage the defenders likely the linebackers terrell suggs and courtney upshaw will determine how kaepernick proceeds by their immediate reaction at the snap if the linebacker stays put , kaepernick hands the ball off or runs playaction if he funnels inside , kaepernick sprints around the end if you watch the film , you can tell that a lot of people who played against the readoption just played as individuals , ravens linebacker ray lewis said it s really hard to play that type of package as individuals you have to play it as a group the ravens gathered such intelligence on , who also use the pistol griffin s speed surprised the ravens it took them the first quarter to get acclimated , said pees , who called their performance on washington s first two drives about as bad as it possibly could have been lewis , along with the other starting inside linebacker , dannell ellerbe , missed that game because of injury , but he will be critical on sunday in limiting running back frank gore s effectiveness warren sapp , the former defensive tackle , said that stopping gore is more important than stopping kaepernick , a sentiment echoed by his colleague at nfl network , the former cornerback eric davis explaining his reasoning , davis noted that the 49ers , after falling behind by 17 points in the nfc championship game against atlanta , never abandoned their running game you take frank gore away , you take away the running aspect of the pistol , davis said he added that he expected to see the ravens call an aggressive series of slants , stunts and blitzes on sunday of kaepernick , davis said , you make him throw the ball that was a popular approach during kaepernick s early years under ault at nevada in october 2007 , he was an unknown commodity unknown , at least , to boise state , which had prepared for a different quarterback heading into its game against nevada the , despite a brilliant game by kaepernick , who rushed for 187 yards , averaging 6 yards per carry , and accounted for 430 yards of offense we tried to play traditional defense , said justin wilcox , boise state s defensive coordinator at the time , and he absolutely ripped us with more than a year to adjust , wilcox devised a plan a plan that other teams would soon adapt and adopt in boise state s next game against nevada , wilcox involved a safety in run support and put his cornerbacks almost exclusively in oneonone coverage the linebackers , in passing situations , dropped back into a zone sometimes , wilcox aimed to bait kaepernick with defensive fronts that would dictate whether he would run with the ball because he was so fast , we tried to make him run laterally or hand it off the coverage was aimed to entice kaepernick , not yet a polished passer , into throwing , this time limiting kaepernick to 38 percent passing \( 19 of 50 \) and 70 yards rushing , on 44 yards a carry how do you make the offense play lefthanded \? how do you make them do something that they do n't want to do \? said wilcox , now the defensive coordinator at washington that s always the goal but it s never easy teams adjust and nevada did several teams attempted to counteract the pistol by isolating receivers in mantoman coverage , sending one safety deep and another into the slot to assist in run defense or defend passing routes underneath but when defenses sought to negate kaepernick , nevada gave the ball to its backs we always taught kap that the running back is paid to run the football , he s the guy we want to give it to , ault said the good teams we played against , instead of trying to defend the whole world , they would force kap to hand the ball off inside to their linebackers and big defensive tackles and see if they could hold up from there but you keep feeding that back , eventually there s going to be a mistake , and that s when he goes those mistakes did come in san francisco s victory against green bay , when the packers overpursued on the fake inside , and kaepernick shredded them for 181 yards the falcons , after watching that performance , were intent on neutralizing him , so they deployed a strategy that ultimately backfired by sending the edge defender at kaepernick , atlanta did deter him from running he had two carries for only 21 yards but kaepernick , ever patient , reacted by handing off to gore and lamichael james , who feasted on the interior space by combining for 124 yards and 3 touchdowns such is the beauty of the pistol and the problem for the ravens when one option vanishes , another appears just because you have a schematic that works on a grease board does n't mean you 're going to stop the guy , wilcox said you have to have the guy there to tackle him , and kaepernick s the fastest guy on the field even when you 're right , you might be wrong , you know \?
during the 1960s , i attended a christian brothers of ireland outpost near detroit called brother rice high school it was named after edmund ignatius rice , the wealthy roman catholic merchant who founded an order of brothers to educate destitute boys in waterford , ireland , in 1802 the boys at brother rice were not destitute we were sons of the middle class during the glory days of detroit s auto industry , and most of us were destined for college year after year , a chunk of the graduating class went on to notre dame , a university that , in my eyes , had three fatal qualities first , the campus in south bend , ind , is barely 200 miles from detroit , not nearly far enough away from home for my tastes \( this was in a day when most young people did not live in perpetuity under their parents' roof \) second , after my time with the christian brothers , the last thing i wanted to do was be locked in a roomful of catholic boys for four more years third , and by far most important , notre dame was a football powerhouse coach ara parseghian had made the cover of time magazine in 1964 in october 1966 , while i was a freshman at brother rice , the notre dame passing duo of terry hanratty and jim seymour followed suit notre dame won 1 of its 11 national championships in 1966 , a total surpassed only by alabama none of this was lost on the christian brothers sports were oxygen to them , the ultimate test of discipline , competitive fire and general excellence while i was decent at basketball , baseball and hockey , i was n't good enough to make any of the varsity teams and so was lumped with the secondclass citizens , the brains my sins were legion i loved literature and history , was the top french student in my class , worked on the yearbook such interests were not badges of honor at brother rice quite the opposite when it came time to apply to college , i settled on a university in a rotting new england port city it was no harvard or yale , but it had a solid english department , it was coed and there was n't a catholic priest or brother in sight then came the clincher in its annual college football preview , sports illustrated needed just five words to sum up my chosen university s team , the perennial ivy league doormat and brown is in providence my kind of place where football did n't even merit footnote status i left for college elated that my sportscrazed catholic boyhood was over bill roney was two years ahead of me at brother rice when he expressed a lack of enthusiasm for attending an allmale college where football was king , his father , a notre dame alumnus , told him , you can go to school anywhere you want , but i'm sending the checks to notre dame roney packed for south bend for the next four years , he roomed with pat duerr , a classmate from brother rice and still a close friend on their first weekend on campus , a freshman mixer was held , with women from neighboring st mary s college invited that was one of the defining moments of our social world , roney said recently the malefemale ratio of the two schools was about 5 to 1 so pat and i walk in , there s a band playing , and around every couple that s dancing there are about six to eight guys waiting for the music to stop socially , it was backwards football filled the vacuum the campus came alive on football weekends as alumni , family and girlfriends poured into town those alumni and the upperclassmen still had fresh memories of the 1966 championship , and the frenzy was contagious we lived and died with what was going on , roney said as it turned out , the roommates from detroit were experiencing the twilight of a dying tradition the year after they graduated , notre dame admitted women for the first time in its 170year history it was the last bastion of white male , middleclass catholicism , roney said it was a great experience , and i made some great friends , but it was not the real world notre dame is a polarizing place people either love it or they hate it there are not a lot of lukewarm people i think that s because of the historical success of the football team and the fact that some people view it as elitist gary gutting joined the notre dame faculty as a philosophy professor in 1969 , when roney and duerr were sophomores still on the faculty , gutting has become an outspoken critic of bigtime college football and basketball , which he believes are guilty of propagating the bankrupt myth of the studentathlete in his fourplus decades at notre dame , gutting has witnessed three national championships , as well as some excellent football seasons , some mediocre ones and a few outright stinkers things are terrifically different now than they were when i arrived , gutting said recently success used to be defined by winning the national championship things have changed because of the years when they did n't win it has been salutary for the school it undermined the mystique of notre dame exceptionalism which brings us to howard cosell the 1973 sugar bowl , like this year s bowl championship series title game , featured notre dame playing alabama for the national championship late in the game , cosell uttered some of the truest words ever to travel through a press box microphone at notre dame , football is a religion at alabama , it is a way of life that s so true , gutting said when reminded of the quotation sometimes , it got downright religious here but i do n't think you can top the southeastern conference my son used to teach at the university of mississippi , and even though they lose a lot , the fans down there are completely nuts if you doubt this , tune your siriusxm radio to paul finebaum s callin show emanating from birmingham , ala , it is a cageboutinacathedral for worshipers of sec football when alabama suffered a rare loss to texas am this season , a finebaum listener suggested a reason god is judging us for the election of barack obama to the myth of the studentathlete , gutting would add the myth that all bigtime college sports programs are cash cows true , notre dame and alabama will get handsome checks for this year s title game but of the 338 division i universities , according to the ncaa , only 23 all of them in the football bowl subdivision made money on athletics in 2012 as many universities trim academic budgets , the average division i football coach is paid 147 million a year but as i learned at brother rice , the problem with this skewed emphasis on school sports is that the purpose of education the stimulation of the mind is sent to the back of the team bus when colleges commit so much to a nonintellectual , even an antiintellectual endeavor , gutting said , they join hands with the forces that want to marginalize intellectual endeavors amen i wish he 'd been around to tell that to the christian brothers back in the 1960s  i probably had no choice about becoming a notre dame fan it was hereditary , a term my mother used to explain many things , including her varicose veins i'm irishcatholic and bronxbred my father was a fan my older brother was a fan i fell in line at 8 , on a saturday in 1964 when the irish were playing purdue john huarte jack snow and in his first season , ara parseghian i had no idea who any of them were i only knew i 'd just gotten a beatles record from alexander s , the department store , and very much looked forward to lording it over my brother but when i burst into the apartment , waving it like a trophy , i got no reaction whatsoever he was too busy watching something on television , leaning forward , completely engrossed hmmm i have been watching nd ever since , usually with family , typically at home , where i can focus on each play , keep the sound on and yell at the tv \( my daughter called , upset , a few years back when she first moved to manhattan and found that bars , and the rest of the world , had no interest in hearing the playbyplay for a notre dame team struggling to crest 500 the nerve \) though he was the biggest fan in the family , my father never shared our interest in the tip and turn of every play he found the potential for failure too overwhelming so he watched every game from an adjoining bedroom door closed no tv he would come out every 15 minutes or so when he heard cheering or to investigate extended silences he would stay just long enough to get the score , or maybe bellow jesus if the irish had fumbled , before retreating again if notre dame lost , my mother would note my father s darkening mood now he 'll say the roast beef is tough , she would lament if the irish won , my father would watch the broadcast replay that night , a truncated version with gaps bridged by the announcer lindsey nelson and his advisory following an exchange of punts , we move to action later in the third quarter on sundays after a win , my father would sit at the dining room table with a beer , a bolognaandliverwurst sandwich and a yellow legal pad a bookkeeper by trade , he would design charts to show that , no matter how many games they had lost , the irish were , by strength of schedule or some other stretch , deserving of the top spot in the polls the polls were a source of endless frustration to my dad but i 've never been too angstridden a fan the only real problem for me has been the weddings take oct 21 , 1989 , when the irish were no 1 and two dear friends decided to marry during the southern california game the wedding was at baltusrol golf club in new jersey nice club nice people but the members were completely unreasonable about letting me join them in the grill room for the big game after they tossed me , i watched from the doorway until another member who seemed to like trouble asked what i was doing in the hall , then invited me in as his guest the groom said i was missing for hours maybe i was gone for a half tops if it s any consolation , i saw much less of my friend billy s wedding it too was an elegant affair , at the water club in manhattan , and at sunset , some fireboats sailed up the east river shooting celebratory sprays , and some emerald society pipers came by to play tunes in their kilts , and everywhere you looked , it was raining shellfish and canap s but it was also opening night of the 1988 national championship season , and we were playing michigan so , long before kickoff , i had abandoned the festivities for a stool at the club s bar , only to be met by a darkened tv seems the bartender thought football watching was too down market for this fine establishment i tried to recruit allies among the other patrons , who were n't much help but luckily , my wife walked in seven months pregnant , looking lovely but carrying big , as in let s not get the pregnant lady too upset big , and when she asked , suddenly the tv was on it was quite a while before i made it back to the ballroom where , i'm told , a woman had fumed at my bad manners and , lucky for me , chastised my wife for putting up with them a few minutes later , a waitress walked into the bar with a plate of filet mignon are you kevin flynn \? your wife sent this in from the wedding a great moment in wifedom , though nd barely squeezed by , 1917 this fall , the michigan game was again interrupted by affairs of the heart the daughter of close friends married at a lovely club outside philadelphia where the grill room was once again off limits to the wedding guests so late into the night , well past the dessert and the macarena , and long after kickoff , i mentioned to my friend , the father of the bride , that i might head back to my hotel you 're going to leave my daughter s wedding , ' he asked , to go watch some game \? naaah is that what you thought \? friendship cost me the third quarter i know that reading of how easily i was turned back , many nd fans might view me as an impostor , and they would be right on the ladder of notre dame fandom , i occupy a low rung oh , i know who larry conjar is and i'm still pained by the penalty that killed the rocket s runback in the 1991 orange bowl but i own no nd underwear and have been to south bend , ind , only twice , and a guy down the block who does not even like notre dame is better at recalling things like the year vagas ferguson was voted allamerican actually , i do n't even root for notre dame in other sports in hockey , for example , i cheer for boston college , which my son attends he has had a complicated relationship with notre dame , which is to boston college what sin is to god once enough of an nd fan that we painted his bedroom ceiling yellow to mimic the golden dome , he now views the team as an amusement from childhood and his shift in allegiances has been sharp enough to make me analyze my own why do i root for notre dame football \? after all , no one from my family has ever gone there and i know the university , like all universities , has had its problems on the other hand , i do like that victory march , and i enjoy all that rockne , leahy , lujack lore , and i especially appreciate that so many irish players graduate but let s face it , for me and lots of other folks they like to call the subway alumni , it s really not about the university or about football it s about identity it s about our past and our traditions and about all the times our uncle jimmy or our uncle mike watched alongside us on the couch that s why we wear the hats , and scour the coverage and frighten small children by screaming horrible curse words at the tv even when they stink but this year , as you may have noticed , they do n't go irish
most opera fans are intensely involved with the characters of great operas we are protective of them , even the evil ones there is a lively realm of fan fiction focused on movie and television characters , in which viewers share ideas on how some breakup or betrayal might turn out opera fans , by contrast , are fixated on characters who have been around for generations , even centuries the plots of favorite operas have long been cemented in our minds yet we , too , like to speculate on what happens after the final curtain falls several recent books grapple with puccini s madama butterfly , imagining what happens to the 3yearold boy , nicknamed trouble , born to the caddish lieutenant pinkerton and ciocio san , the geisha who commits suicide online , opera lovers are pretty playful about their fantasies of what might happen in favorite works , especially wagner s epic ring one wag envisions a fifth installment to the cycle in which the rhinemaidens , fed up after years of devotion and celibacy , open a classy brothel where clients must pay for services in gold so , like many opera fans , i have long had strong feelings about what happens to certain characters when the curtain goes down take rigoletto , which on monday returns to the met in michael mayer s production , introduced last season the staging zaps the story from 16thcentury mantua to the las vegas strip during the early 60s the tenor matthew polenzani , a house favorite , will sing his first duke at the met in the last moments of the opera as traditionally staged , rigoletto , a hunchbacked jester , hears the lecherous duke of mantua singing in the distance rigoletto realizes that the body in the sack he is dragging to the river cannot be the duke , whose assassination he ordered to avenge his daughter s honor to his horror , it is his daughter , gilda , who , in the throes of passion and shame , has sacrificed herself for the duke but what happens after the opera ends \? will rigoletto try again to have the duke killed \? or kill himself \? will the duke continue his life of entitlement and debauchery , seducing any woman who intrigues him \? the duke is a letch without honor and integrity , mr polenzani said in an interview , when asked to imagine what comes next for his character he lives solely to satisfy whatever desire he has when gilda dies at the end , is he sad \? no 1 , i m not even certain he would know she is dead it was a conquest if he got with her again , he said , it would be just because he was feeling randy and she was there now , that is one tough assessment mr polenzani , of course , can claim insights into the duke that trump mine still , i disagree maybe i m a softy , but i think the duke will find out what gilda did and be shaken by it he will probably go on womanizing but future conquests will feel increasingly empty gilda will weigh on him i take my clues from verdi s music to me , it seems impossible that the man who , pretending to be a student , romances gilda in such tender phrases is faking it just to have sex another opera i ve been pondering since it returned to the met this fall is mozart s cos fan tutte , the third and last opera he wrote with the librettist lorenzo da ponte the ending of cos is intentionally ambiguous to recap the story a cynical old bachelor , don alfonso , tired of hearing his young officer friends ferrando and guglielmo boasting about the faithfulness of their fianc es , challenges them to a wager the young men will tell their girlfriends that they have been ordered to war and then reappear in exotic disguises to try to seduce each other s beloveds alas , they succeed alfonso is proved right the men are indignant the women guiltridden but alfonso urges the two couples to accept human nature and get married anyway the libretto , however , leaves the pairing of partners uncertain do the original couples reunite \? or will the women now stay with the men who won them so easily \? these questions were raised with the cast members who recently finished four performances of cos in the met s revival of lesley koenig s production , conducted triumphantly by james levine in his return to the pit after more than two years away because of health problems this cast reassembles in april , again with mr levine , for more performances in this production , mr polenzani sings ferrando and the baritone rodion pogossov is his friend guglielmo the soprano susanna phillips is fiordiligi , who , when the opera begins , is engaged to guglielmo the mezzosoprano isabel leonard sings dorabella , fiordiligi s sister , who has promised herself to ferrando
daniel paille may play fourthline minutes , but he is not your average checkingline forward , and the chicago blackhawks are finding that out in the stanley cup finals in a series that has been nearly even , paille has served as the difference maker he has scored gamewinning goals in consecutive games , lifting the boston bruins to a 21 series lead after monday night s 20 win at td garden i think i m just happy that we got the win , paille said fortunately , it was the gamewinner and i ll be excited about it more excited that we won if you don t watch closely , you might hear paille s name but miss his contributions he entered the finals with just two postseason goals and none in six games he has not played more than 15 minutes in any of the bruins nonovertime games for three series , paille was the leftwinger on boston s fourth line known as the merlot line for the color of its practice sweaters yet , when gregory campbell sustained a broken leg against pittsburgh , there were fears that the play of paille and shawn thornton would decline without their center instead , boston coach claude julien split the pair , moving paille to the bruins third line with tyler seguin and chris kelly , and paille s play has suited them nicely they have scored three of boston s seven goals they play all three zones , kelly said , adding that it makes his job in the center that much easier when you have two responsible wingers seguin also set up paille s overtime gamewinner in game 2 seguin , who did not record a point in boston s eastern conference finals sweep over pittsburgh , now has assists in all three finals games i think we are just moving well and , for the most part , we are holding onto the puck , paille said of their line , and specifically seguin i think puck possession has been key for us especially you really see him moving his legs that helps a lot paille has also played a big role on boston s stingy penalty killing , playing nearly six minutes of shorthanded time through three games , helping boston kill all 11 chicago power plays the penalty killing , i think we just went back to our game , and they have a lot of talent up there forwards , paille said we know that , and i think that s why we want to try harder i think we ve been able to frustrate them right now paille even offers his teammates some comic relief in the most intense of series kelly said he is always twitching , always fixing something on the bench it puts a smile on my face it doesn t matter if there s a minute left in the game after being cast off by buffalo he was traded to boston in 2009 for two low draft picks paille has made a home for himself in julien s system especially over the last year , he s been putting a lot of confidence in myself and a couple other guys , paille said of julien with the coach that has the confidence in you , you feel like you want to do something for it you want to deserve it we know we ve been able to do that these last couple of games , and we need to continue that
martina hingis smashed nearly a dozen backhand volleys for winners , traded deft short shots and jumped high to crush overheads in her return to the on friday but none of that mattered in a loss with her doubles partner , daniela hantuchova of slovakia , against the open s topseeded doubles team , sara errani and roberta vinci of italy nearly 3 , 000 fans packed court 17 to watch the match , many clapping and cheering after hingis s shots but in a crucial moment , serving to pull her doubles partner into a crucial third set , hingis doublefaulted twice to lose the two final points of the match , resulting in a 63 , 75 loss my calf was killing me , hingis said of her double faults i could n't get up on my serve anymore but there was another reason nerves not playing at a grand slam for six years does n't really , you know , help either , she said for most of the match , hingis delivered a strong performance , often hitting the clutch shots that kept her and hantuchova within striking distance at 55 in the second set , hingis hit five consecutive shots at nearpointblank range to force errani into hitting wide a sevenstroke rally between errani and hantuchova drew another wide shot by errani but vinci and errani , who rank no 1 in the world , took the lead at 65 shouts of come on , martina ! filled the small stadium , and clapping began as hingis stepped to the service line on the first point , she charged the net and feathered a superb drop volley crosscourt to take a 150 lead then she hit a forehand into the net to make it 1515 doublefaulted to trail by 1530 and , moments later , doublefaulted twice to lose the match i thought they did well , said tony duncan of brattleboro , vt , who said hantuchova and hingis were his two favorite players i just wished they played not the very best doubles team first in a night mixeddoubles match that drew about 1 , 400 spectators , hingis and mahesh bhupathi of india lost , 76 \( 5 \) , 76 \( 5 \) , to yungjan chan of taiwan and robert lindstedt of sweden she s a genius on court , lindstedt said of hingis i 've never had a girl who can control pace on the serve like she does hingis responded i like the compliment i still did n't like his kick serve up there felt like i need a ladder to get up there hingis , 32 , who plans to play in tournaments in tokyo and beijing in the coming months , said , it would help to win some matches for confidence , i guess , especially those big points she added some of the shots i feel like , you know , i have n't been away , but there s some things really , the game has improved not patterns , but it s faster hingis has won five grand slam singles titles along with nine major doubles titles in 1998 , she won all four doubles titles in the calendar year hingis first retired in 2003 because of foot and ankle injuries she returned to competition sporadically in later years but retired again in 2007 after losing in the third round of the united states open hingis s afternoon match friday drew long lines of spectators as the sun was setting she was fun to watch when she played , shauna eiffef of chicago said before the match i expect her to win errani and vinci are no 1 , but it s kind of fun to see the underdog joseph o'connor of providence , ri , added , she s coming back in a serious way that s why we 're all waiting here to get a seat
it s costly and difficult to keep a highlevel jazz band working and touring so sometimes outside interests record companies , promoters , festivals , educational entities get involved , creating bands that express the essence of their projects , pasting their brand on them , recording them , sometimes designing limited tours for them jazz at lincoln center and sf jazz do it the blue note and concord labels have done it in recent years the concert impresario george wein has run the newport jazz festival allstars on and off for decades metronome , esquire and playboy magazines created some pretty good oneoff concerts and recording sessions of the 1940s and '50s nothing new but the monterey jazz festival , which has run continuously since 1958 , has really bought into the idea this year it has created a highlevel group with the singer dee dee bridgewater , the saxophonist chris potter , the trumpeter ambrose akinmusire , the pianist benny green , the bassist christian mcbride and the drummer lewis nash it reflects more or less where straightahead jazz is at , without much controversy it wo n't send audiences away confused or unhappy the group is called , unstylishly , , and boy is it on tour 13 gigs in january , and 13 more since then , most of them in theaters and symphony halls this week the sextet plays the blue note through sunday , and then has 14 more dates through april , from florida to alaska it s a commitment on the second set of the group s first night at the blue note , on tuesday , it was straining against that commitment the set had some baseline musical excellence , sometimes startling , which gradually became buried under one long laugh that got progressively wilder this is not a highconcept gig the routine seems to be that ms bridgewater , the frontwoman , and mr mcbride , the musical director , need to reference the festival in various ways , which means playing several songs associated with performers associated with its history \( this could be about 75 percent of the common jazz repertory \) the band , of course , is a construct imposed from without , and almost definitely none of these performers will be remembered for it in the future because it has limited value in and of itself , the sextet had to work , in musical ways and otherwise , to create some ms bridgewater is complicated thorough , learned , curious , daring , impulsive , flamboyant and hyperdramatic she will follow any gesture , joke or innuendo , musical or otherwise , until she has captured and trussed it and brought it home for dinner so she referenced billie holiday , who played the first monterey festival , and then started as an rb slowjam , eventually becoming a gospel detonation she ended up handing the microphone to a woman in the audience , who took it out with hollers ms bridgewater , in a fringed leather suit , seemed relaxed but also kind of worked up it had been a long day , she said her grandson had caught his leg in a bicycle wheel , and her dog had a bladder infection could she have been thriving on the stress \? it s possible she sang a version of the standard i'm beginning to see the light , in a voiceandbass duet with mr mcbride , with a lot of scatting , bass slides and slaps , that became all about something else and ended with mr mcbride encircling her and breathing into her ear , while she improvised a rhymed , flirting protest she sang a bit of james brown s please , please , please and the band members caught up with her , all of them starting to crack up she sipped from mr mcbride s drink , wanted her own , and started singing tequila , by the champs , and let out a torrent of fake spanish it was getting silly , bordering on weird , and also intensely advanced in its comfort and its play otherwise a version of horace silver s filthy mcnasty , with lyrics a version of the louis jordan blues let the good times roll a fast piece by mr green called and mr potter s ballad fear of flying the band was accurate and articulate and loose and serious in several pairs of sequential solos mr potter created rapid , articulate pitchaccurate phrasing , and mr akinmusire played his foil , using short , gapped , spare phrasing and a soft tone it could be a good band , in fact
the primetime emmy awards , which bestowed its first honors on blackandwhite game shows and anthologies 65 years ago , suddenly seems downright futuristic on thursday , the online streaming network netflix , best known until recently for rerunning other companies old shows and films , officially joined its cable and broadcast counterparts in the race for television s most prestigious prizes , picking up more than a dozen nominations , including a best drama nod for its political thriller house of cards kevin spacey and robin wright , who portray the scheming husband and wife at the center of house of cards , were also nominated as lead actor and actress the announcements represented the first time that series distributed via the internet , not television , were nominated in top emmy categories in a way , it solidifies that television is television , no matter what pipe brings it to the screen , he said in a telephone interview mordecai wiczyk , a cofounder of media rights capital , the studio that produced the series , said , for us , what it shows is that if you support great artists and they do great work , they get recognized the means of delivery and distribution are secondary to whether the work is great , he added netflix had campaigned for nominations for both house of cards and arrested development , the canceled fox sitcom that it revived to much fanfare this year mr sarandos acknowledged some disappointment that arrested was not among the six shows nominated for outstanding comedy in a consolation of sorts , one of the show s stars , jason bateman , was included in the lead actor in a comedy category , one of the three nominations arrested earned over all , netflix picked up 14 emmy nominations 9 for house of cards , including 1 for david fincher , who directed the first episode 3 for arrested development and 2 for hemlock grove , a horror series that had its debut in the spring its rival hbo , which has been making critically acclaimed shows for decades , had 108 nominations , its highest total in nearly a decade last year it earned 81 nominees in major categories are listed below the full list is available at emmyscom  the race that is traditionally the most closely watched in the tv industry is outstanding drama in that category , house of cards will challenge one hbo series , game of thrones , as well as last year s winner , homeland , from showtime , and the fourtime winner mad men on amc pbs s downton abbey and amc s breaking bad were also nominated in part because of netflix , competition in the major acting categories was stiffer than ever , as evidenced by the absence of the actress julianna margulies , who had been nominated for the good wife for the past three years and had won in 2011 the new fx drama the americans was also shut out from the major categories otherwise the surprises were relatively few and far between in the lead actor in a drama category , damian lewis of homeland was joined by bryan cranston of breaking bad , hugh bonneville of downton abbey , jon hamm of mad men , mr spacey and , in the only major nod to hbo s newsroom , jeff daniels in the lead actress category , last year s winner , claire danes , also of homeland , was joined by vera farmiga of bates motel on ae , michelle dockery of downton abbey , elisabeth moss of mad men , ms wright and two stars of abc dramas , connie britton of nashville and kerry washington of scandal it is always a real surprise and a real thrill , ms britton said of her nomination , which followed several previous nods , for her roles on nbc s friday night lights and fx s american horror story the mostnominated show was american horror story asylum , which was submitted as a miniseries , and which received 17 nominations game of thrones was the mostnominated drama , with 16 nominations , and 30 rock was the mostnominated sitcom , with 13 nbc s saturday night live picked up 15 nominations , a record for that 38yearold show for nbc s 30 rock , which won the best comedy emmy in 2007 , 2008 and 2009 , this year is its last opportunity to take the prize back from abc s modern family , which has taken home the award for the past three years those two shows were nominated , along with hbo s girls and veep , fx s louie and cbs s big bang theory with three shows in contention for the top comedy prize , the broadcast networks fared better in comedies than in dramas , continuing a pattern that is now several years old this year , just as last , none of the commercial networks earned a best drama nomination , though the noncommercial pbs did for downton abbey the nominations were announced by the academy of television arts and sciences , the governing body that has overseen the awards since 1948 the academy s chairman , bruce rosenblum , invoked the evolution that netflix epitomizes in his opening remarks at a predawn news conference in los angeles television is on broadcast , on cable and on demand over the internet , he said this is truly an exciting time for us to be honoring the best of television some people on thursday drew analogies between the rise of hbo a generation ago and the rise of netflix now the results in both cases have included more choices for viewers and more competition for actors , writers and directors it seems likely that the academy will consider opening up the major categories to more nominees in the future for netflix , the nominations were another feather in an already stuffed cap , coming almost six months after the release of house of cards , the first netflix series that was perceived to be as good as anything on hbo , showtime or amc emmy speculation surrounded house of cards from the day all 13 episodes made their debuts at the same time online , in part because the academy s eligibility rules were adjusted in the mid2000s to include internetdistributed shows \( when that happened , netflix s streaming service hadn t even started yet the company was still just shipping dvds by mail \) in recent years , online shows like web therapy and dr horrible s singalong blog have been nominated in shortform categories , but the internet s presence hadn t been felt in major categories like acting and directing a series that netflix imported from scandinavia , lilyhammer , was eligible for awards last year but did not receive any nominations of course , that series did not break through to the wider public in the way that house of cards did netflix lobbied aggressively for emmy nominations for both this year , even putting out electionstyle lawn signs in west hollywood but the effects of emmy nominations or victories will be tough for netflix to measure what the awards provide is a kind of confirmation of the industry s respect and admiration , something that doesn t immediately translate to its bottom line but is appreciated nonetheless mr spacey said in a telephone interview that the method of distribution of house of cards didn t change the creative process , because the camera doesn t know it s a streaming camera , any more than it s a tv camera or a film camera but , he added , it did affect the way we were able to create the series , and that was very exciting he spoke from baltimore , where production of the show s second season is under way referring to the athome viewers ability to binge on episodes , he said , in some ways , netflix and all of us have maybe learned the lesson the music industry didn t learn for the next two months the emmy winners will be announced on cbs on sept 22 debates will ensue about whether house of cards is worthy of the outstanding drama prize breaking bad , after all , has been passed over repeatedly , despite being nominated three times previously hbo s game of thrones has yet to win , too , despite being nominated twice before alex gansa , a creator of homeland , no longer the underdog that it was last year , said it s really nice to get the opportunity to defend our title this year that s really the way i feel about it when you start defending episodes and things , you just can t help but sound like a whiner we let the episodes and the season stand on their own the third season of the series will have its debut on showtime in september , and its success or failure will ultimately matter more than any emmy statue if i m anxious about anything , he said , it s about the third season , not the second season jeremy egner and dave itzkoff contributed reporting outstanding lead actor in a drama series bryan cranston , breaking bad hugh bonneville ,

the gareth bale transfer drama appeared friday to be reaching its merciful , and seemingly inevitable , end tottenham hotspur worked to complete a deal to move bale , its talented welsh wing , to for a price that would almost certainly top the worldrecord fee that madrid paid to acquire cristiano ronaldo in 2009 a signing of bale for , 5 million more than the team paid for ronaldo could signify the fifth time in the last 13 years that madrid has set a transferfee record in adding a star hints that a deal was finally near began emerging late in the week , as tottenham s technical director , franco baldini , traveled to madrid for negotiations real madrid s online store for sale on its web site and at madrid s santiago bernab u stadium the possible move comes near the conclusion of a european summer transfer period in which several top players changed teams but none drew as much attention as bale s slippery status the interminable process stretched over several months , through two managers at madrid and past a number of vows from tottenham executives , including coach andr villasboas , that bale a 24yearold who scored 30 goals for spurs last season and was the player of the year in the premier league would be staying put as is often the case when a european giant like madrid gets involved , however , money ultimately prevails daniel levy , the tottenham chairman , seemed to milk as much value out of bale as he could , and somewhat transparently , spurs appeared to begin spending its infusion of funds before the cash had changed hands tottenham spent more than 90 million this summer on roberto soldado , nacer chadli , etienne capoue and paulinho , among other roster changes , and continues to pursue other signings the additions indicate that levy is focused on elevating the club to a champions league place with or without bale tottenham finished fifth in the premier league last season , missing out on a champions league place on the season s final day real madrid would simply be adding bale to a stable of stars that already includes portugal s ronaldo , france s karim benzema and germany s mesut zil madrid failed to win a title last season , losing in the semifinals of the champions league and finishing 15 points behind barcelona in the spanish standings it parted ways with its coach , jos mourinho of portugal , in may , replacing him with the italian carlo ancelotti ancelotti , picking up from his predecessor , simply continued the pursuit of bale interest from other clubs has followed bale for at least a year , but it was not until july that bale and his representatives reportedly told tottenham officials that bale was interested in leaving for spain ancelotti did not hesitate to comment publicly on that development , telling reporters that the teams were trying to find a solution to the deal and angering villasboas in the process that was just the beginning of a push that lasted more than two months and featured several twists along the way , including bale s recent injuries to a gluteal muscle and a foot ailments that have kept him from playing for tottenham and prompted some questions from skeptical outsiders as to their severity there have also been several bouts of posturing from madrid officials and levy , who indicated that he was more than willing to simply walk away from the talks if his club s price was not met ultimately , negotiations between the sides continued even as the new seasons began in england and spain this month bale missed all but one preseason game and has not played an official game for tottenham since may
salang , afghanistan there is not an ounce of fat on the wiry frame of abdul wahid , and no wonder after he finishes his morning work shift , he walks 10 miles down mountain trails in northern afghanistan to the first road , where he catches a bus for the last couple of miles to the teacher training institute in salang he walks back up the mountain another 10 miles to get home , arriving well after dark , just in time to rest up for his day job in his determination to formally qualify as a teacher , mr wahid , 33 , exemplifies many of the gains for afghan education in recent years it s worth it , because this is my future , he said but he also personifies how far the efforts here have yet to go mr wahid s day job is being the principal of the high school in his village , unamak though he has only a high school diploma , he is the best educated teacher that his 800 students have it is widely accepted that demand among afghans for better schooling and the actual opportunity to attend , particularly for girls is at its highest point in decades for western officials seeking to show a positive legacy from a dozen years of war and heavy investment in afghanistan , improvements in education have provided welcome news but for those who are working to make it happen local afghan officials , aid workers , teachers and students there are concerns that much of the promise of improvement is going unfulfilled , and major problems are going unsolved in interviews , they pointed out an abysmal dropout rate , widespread closings of schools in some areas of conflict and a very low level of education for those who do manage to find a seat in a class overcrowding is so bad that nearly all schools operate on split shifts , so students get a halfday , and many of them are on three shifts a day , meaning that those students get only three hours of instruction daily and many children are not in school unicef estimated in 2012 that one in two schoolage children did not attend at all further , while there has demonstrably been positive and rapid growth in the public school system , there have also been daunting challenges , particularly a lack of capacity to find or train qualified teachers , print enough textbooks or build enough safe schools according to statistics compiled by unicef , only 24 percent of afghanistan s teachers are qualified under afghan law , meaning they completed a twoyear training course after high school in many rural places , there are sometimes teachers with 10thgrade educations teaching 11th and 12th graders fortyfive percent of the country s 13 , 000 schools operate without usable buildings , under tents or canvas leantos , or even just under the branches of a tree in a country of harsh extremes of climate both in winter and in summer , that means many missed school days the afghan public school system has expanded immensely in recent years , buoyed by extensive international aid the united states agency for international development alone has given 934 million to education programs over the past 12 years , according to the government agency the education minister , farouk wardak , insists that 105 million students are enrolled this year , 40 percent of them girls , a huge increase from an estimate of 900 , 000 enrolled students , almost none of them girls , under taliban rule in 2001 those numbers are widely quoted by afghan and western officials as a marker of success , but the claims are seen as unsupportable by many here jennifer rowell of care international , who has been conducting a study of education in afghanistan , cautions that enrollment numbers are not actual attendance numbers and she said that when care tried to contact the headmasters of schools around the country , using contact lists kept by the education ministry , half to threequarters of phone numbers of school masters were missing , or the man we call has not been in the job for years that makes it difficult for the education ministry to do any meaningful monitoring of actual school attendance around the country beyond initial enrollments , attendance tends to drop off quickly , often within just a few weeks only about 10 percent of students make it through to graduation , according to usaid figures those numbers are even lower for girls , most of whom drop out between sixth and ninth grades , after puberty makes them marriageable in many areas female teachers are acutely scarce , and families worry about the safety of sending their daughters to school given continuing threats from the taliban and resistance from some local elders the schools themselves have an incentive to inflate their figures , since their financing , which comes from kabul , is based on enrollment in the eastern province of khost , bordering pakistan , education ministry documents from kabul officially list 252 , 000 students enrolled last year but in khost province s education department , kamar khan kamran , who works as a recruiter of teachers , said those numbers were wildly inflated i think we would hardly be able to enroll 20 , 000 to 25 , 000 students this year in the province , though the demand for education is booming rapidly the shortage of teachers is so acute that in many districts the schools are hiring teachers who graduated only from sixth , seventh or eighth grade , mr kamran said , even though it s not legal for all of that , even those who warn that establishing quality education in the country is a mission far from accomplished will acknowledge that improvement has been marked over the past decade one united nations official , speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to anger afghan officials , noted that while there still was not enough attention paid to the quality of education being provided , enrollment has been tremendous , very encouraging , particularly for girls s ken yamashita , the head of usaid in afghanistan , said that even though reliable statistics are hard to come by in afghanistan , what s absolutely clear is the number of kids in school has gone up , the participation of girls has gone up , and it s such a huge differential he added , education is very much a success in afghanistan a good example of that success is the sardar kabuli high school for girls , in the capital it was built for 27 million from the united states and is still not the most expensive americanfinanced school the ghazi boys high school in kabul cost 57 million last year sardar kabuli high graduated 290 girls , more than a third of the number of this year s firstgrade enrollments , and half of them passed university entrance exams this school is an example to the whole country , said the headmistress , nasrin sultani two years ago , it consisted of 38 tents and students attending in three shifts now its 6 , 600 students , in two shifts , all have their own desks and no more than two students share one textbook in zamina stanikzai s 12thgrade math class , when she asked for a show of hands of girls who want to go to college , all but one of the 40 students' hands shot up the one was a younger girl , waiting for her sister to finish classes to take her home when the girls were asked how many thought their families would allow them to go to college , however , half of the hands went down a girl in the back stood up and asked to speak , which she did in halting but good english many of our families still believe in the old ways , she said mr wardak , the education minister , expressed pride when he talked about what has been accomplished despite the challenges , and particularly in remote areas , like ghor province for the first time in the 5 , 000year history of afghanistan , for instance , ghor has 800 schools , 173 of them high schools , he said in an interview he becomes defensive , however , about the quality issue i have 70 per student per year to spend , he said in the us you spend 20 , 000 , in pakistan 130 you do n't expect to do much for 70 a year outside kabul s public school system , the difference in quality can be drastic at mir ali ahmad girls school in charikor , in parwan province , the girls share their building with boys two shifts for boys , one for girls only the boys have sports fields and playgrounds one set of textbooks is shared by three or four girls two girls share a seat at each desk and even in the capital , most public schools are not the showpiece that sardar kabuli high is at sayid ismail balkh school , 8 , 000 students are enrolled in three shifts , three hours each they have buildings , but one set of them has no roofs or windows it was a world bank project , but the contractor took the money and ran and another set was a japanesefinanced project that also was never finished , so only the first of two stories were built canvas tarps are slung over the walls to provide shelter when it rains , we take the day off , said barat ali sadaqi , the headmaster toilet facilities and running water systems have not been finished , and the odor of sewage permeates the small compound electricity is intermittent , and there are six computers for the whole student body on a given day , only 5 , 400 students attend out of the 8 , 000 enrolled still , they are crammed in three to a desk , 40 to a class , 10 textbooks per class this is development after 10 years in kabul , mr sadaqi said
pamina is in trouble the queen of the night and her three ladies have abducted her in the midst of her greatest trial who will help tamino rescue her so that he can be reunited with her under the benevolent eye of sarastro \? do n't count on papageno he s fallen prey to the bewitching sister of monostatos , that cunning slave with her marriage to papageno in doubt , papagena is jealous and alone perhaps the time is ripe for monostatos to make his move pamina may just have to rescue herself but first more glockenspiel ! it s no accident if the plot to das labyrinth , which will receive its american premiere in a production by on wednesday , sounds familiar first presented in 1798 in vienna s theater auf der wieden to great popular acclaim , this sequel to the magic flute brought together key players from the same winning team minus mozart das labyrinth oder der kampf mit den elementen \( the labyrinth , or the battle with the elements \) was conceived and written by the impresario emanuel schikaneder , who wrote the libretto for flute and was the original papageno mozart died in 1791 , the year flute was first performed , so schikaneder brought in peter von winter \( 17541825 \) , a german composer and violinist although winter was a respected kapellmeister in munich and the author of highly successful operas , his brief in this case was clear to make the work look and sound as much as possible as the original opera by mozart he had kind of a thankless task , said nathan hull , the president of amore opera , who prepared a performance edition by drawing on published sources and manuscripts in european libraries he also directs the production , which is performed mostly in german , is conducted by gregory buchalter and runs concurrently with amore opera s new englishlanguage adaptation of the magic flute not only do the characters continue , but winter references mozart s music , mr hull said there is a huge bow to what the audience expected the magic flute and glockenspiel a fiery coloratura aria for the queen of the night that goes up to a high f papageno has a couple of patter songs you had to live up to expectations but have enough new things to surprise and delight , he said among the delightful details is a flock of birdlings in a scene in which papageno is reunited with his parents and siblings all named papageno and papagena until the papapa stutter grows into a chorus it s not mozart , mr hull said , but then again , donizetti is not mozart , nor rossini there are some great things in here mozart s own view of winter , whom contemporaries described as a na ve giant who was terrified of ghosts and never left the house after dark , was dim a child in his conduct and a beast in his way of life , mozart described him in a letter in 1781 , who has always been my worst enemy but the chief interest of das labyrinth is the light it sheds on the figure of schikaneder \( 17511812 \) and his astute grasp of popular taste the son of domestic servants , he received a good jesuit education on a scholarship and later joined the freemasons as an impresario , he knew how to exploit the intersection of popular entertainment and aesthetic trends the enormous success of the magic flute , which by 1798 had been performed some 200 times , sprang in great part from the way it grafted a traditional mystery play onto an enlightenment canvas here , virtuous behavior is rewarded in this world , not the next one of the earliest attempts to write a sequel to the magic flute was by none other than goethe , beginning in weimar in 1795 together with his future brotherinlaw , the dramatist christian august vulpius , goethe produced more than 80 performances of a greatly edited version of mozart s opera in which some of the enlightenment elements were toned down and the conflict between sarastro and the queen of the night turned into a family squabble but goethe produced only draft fragments of a sequel , not only because he could not find a suitable composer to team up with but also because schikaneder got wind of the weimar plan and preempted it with the proceeds from the magic flute and das labyrinth , schikaneder was able to build his own theater in vienna , the theater an der wien , in 1801 , equipped with the kind of stage machinery that allowed for even more spectacular sets and effects das labyrinth ends with the queen of the night and her allies being thrown into an erupting volcano it was done on a grand , grand scale , mr hull said it was the equivalent of mounting the phantom of the opera' today but schikaneder s new theater also had room for beethoven , whose fidelio had its premiere there a comparison with mozart or beethoven is unkind to any composer but by presenting das labyrinth alongside mozart s magic flute , amore opera allows audiences to make their own judgment on winter s music according to mr hull , there are hints of beethoven in the choruses of das labyrinth some are gorgeous , he said this is where winter thought he could spread his own wings
less than 30 years ago , nearly half of the golf courses in america had nine holes there was no stigma to that number the ninehole golf round was as common as a slice off the first tee as golf boomed late in the 20th century , the vast majority of new courses had 18 holes , and gradually , as everything in golf seemed to grow bigger and longer , the 18hole round was granted an unofficial , but understood , imprimatur as real golf which left a ninehole round as something else none of this was done purposefully yes , tournament golf was most commonly 18 holes the number harks back to st andrews in scotland , even if that number in the mid1700s could just as easily have settled at 14 or 22 whatever the official number , for decades , the ninehole round was nonetheless widely accepted in america , most of the early golf courses were nineholers the first , in 1895 , was played on a ninehole course more 18hole courses were built in the middle part of the last century , but playing only nine holes on those tracts was still commonplace well into the 1980s the 1990s changed everything that was when everything about golf was aggrandized remember when everyone from tiger woods to you and me wore oversized golf shirts with sleeves that hung down to our forearms \? and we took five hours or more to play 18 holes we know what happened to the everballooning game of golf things have been substantially trimmed since then and if the fivehour round has not disappeared , some golfers have , walking away because they do not have time for a round of 18 to the rescue the ninehole round we 've got to get some people thinking again about nine holes that take two hours to play , said ted bishop , the president of the pga of america and the owner of a 45hole public golf facility south of indianapolis it s a good way to target lapsed golfers and new golfers the 18hole round has its place , but let s see how many people we can attract to the game with an offer of a quick nine holes bishop offers a 19 ninehole round seven days a week , with or without a golf cart , after 4 pm it s brought a real spike in the number of rounds played , bishop said and it s been a lot of people i have n't seen before this week , the pga of america has teamed with the united states golf association in an initiative spearheaded by golf digest called time for nine the magazine s june issue , which comes out tuesday , starts a campaign for ninehole play golf digest plans to create a list of ninehole courses that will focus on promoting ninehole rounds for men , women , juniors and families on layouts that make it easy to do so the list will appear at , and golfers are encouraged to submit qualifying courses to , or  we 're not trying to get everyone who plays 18 holes to play nine holes instead , jerry tarde , golf digest s chairman and editor in chief , said we 're after the people who are n't playing because they think golf is a halfday proposition , which it is n't the message is that ninehole golf is legitimate golf it is not half golf or kids' golf although about 80 percent of american golf courses have layouts that bring the ninth hole back to the clubhouse making it easy to charge for and route golfers on ninehole cycles many courses do not offer standalone , ninehole greens fees that is something the initiative hopes to change as an industry , we must work to promote the ninehole round as a complete and enjoyable golf experience , consistent with the traditions of playing the game , glen d nager , the president of the united states golf association , said and for people worried about their handicaps , the usga wants golfers to know that ninehole rounds are fully compatible with its handicap system there is no doubt that the push to promote ninehole rounds reflects a reality that most of us now work longer hours and have more demands on our weekend recreational time as tarde said every other recreation , it seems , takes more or less two hours movies , dinner , cocktail parties , tennis , bowling , going to the gym if golf were invented today , it would be a ninehole game there are other reasons to consider a ninehole round when a full 18 holes may not fit your plans a ninehole round , like many of the more than 4 , 000 oldstyle , ninehole courses still remaining in america , is almost a state of mind it has a separate pace from its fullfledged brethren , which is not to denigrate an 18hole round and the distinctive rewards it yields but a ninehole round seems inherently relaxed , an enterprise that is neither hurried nor filled with expectation it feels more like leisure , which is the goal , is n't it \? often at 5 pm , i 'll go to the range and beat balls for two hours , bishop said last week the other day at 5 , i went and played nine holes with my daughter instead i told my wife later that i was n't as tired , and i might have improved my game more , too a light went on in my head i'm not going to beat so many balls at the range i'm going to go play golf i remember doing something very similar a few years ago , pulling off the highway toward the end of a long day to play nine holes with my 11yearold son at the public rip van winkle country club in the foothills of the catskill mountains in new york the course , known as the rip , was designed in 1919 by donald ross greens fees were about 15 i do n't remember our scores from that evening i do remember a dog lazily chasing a deer across one fairway i recall ducks quacking , a fish jumping in a pond and a stunning view of a mountain ridge about two hours later , we were back in the car refreshed golf is many things to many people , as it should be but we can keep more people in our flock , and attract others to join us , if we endorse the most simple , natural and unpretentious forms of participation inviting people to come out for an easy , quick nine holes is a good way to start
jerusalem eight years ago , writing about the popularity of kadima , the centrist party of thenprime minister ariel sharon , i argued that maybe it was attractive but it has no grassroots activists , no organization , no history and no future the next few years seemed to prove me wrong in 2009 , with tzipi livni at its head , kadima was israel s largest party , with 28 seats out of the 120 in the knesset now , just one day before a general election , it looks like i might have been right after all the latest polls project that the party will win just 2 or 3 seats kadima is nearly finished and with it , the vitality of competitive democracy in israel will be finished , too israelis will go to the polls tuesday knowing that nothing short of a miracle will prevent prime minister benjamin netanyahu from securing his third term in office he is already thinking about a fourth term this situation is a measure of the failure of israeli political parties to offer viable alternatives to netanyahu and his likud party kadima s success was based on sharon s personal qualities as a leader , but as a party it lacked a coherent ideology sharon s successors first ehud olmert and later livni ran on some of his political fuel for a time , but they lack sharon s charisma and at some point the tank came up empty and no other party has managed to position itself any better in this election labor has an agenda , but a leader with no experience actually leading people the centrist yesh atid party also has an inexperienced person as its leader , and its ideology is even murkier than most in this election , the center and the left tried various tricks to gain an edge for instance , by filling their ranks with former journalists and tv celebrities old parties were rebranded and reshuffled but none of that could unsettle king bibi the prime minister is not overly popular , but according to polls he is still deemed much more suitable for the post and more dependable than his competitors he continues to be popular or popular enough because israelis generally see eye to eye with him on important issues for example pdf , some 67 percent of them believe that the peace process with the palestinians will remain at a standstill for reasons not connected to israel and that there is no chance of progress in the foreseeable future these israelis don t care if netanyahu doesn t push for negotiations because they think negotiations are a waste of time so when livni tries to distinguish herself by campaigning on a slogan like netanyahu international boycott livni diplomatic solution , she just looks silly and when olmert , a kadima supporter , disparages netanyahu for picking a fight with president barack obama , voters side with netanyahu they don t much like obama , and many support the israeli government s current policies , even at the cost of a clash with the us administration pdf  the israeli public also agrees with netanyahu s skepticism about finding a negotiated settlement on iran s nuclear ambitions , about the palestinian peace process and about the longterm prospects of the arab spring shelly yacimovich of the labor party paid a price for trying to bypass all this by focusing on social and economic issues her peers and rivals of the centerleft criticized her for abandoning a core issue of the left peace and for many israelis that position made her irrelevant in the race what s the point of having a leader with no clear agenda on the most urgent matters \? and so bibi it shall be again
unlike robert e lee s army of northern virginia , confederate armies west of the appalachians and east of the mississippi river seldom won major battles the biggest success , at chickamauga in late september 1863 , was a pyrrhic victory , costing the rebel army of tennessee more casualties than the defeated federal army of the cumberland kennesaw mountain was a sizable confederate win , but most of the other convincing victories in the region chickasaw bayou , holly springs were strategically small yet there were at least two instances when the army of tennessee should have achieved a significant victory , but failed for mysterious reasons the first was at mclemore s cove on sept 10 and 11 , 1863 , shortly before the nearby battle of chickamauga things had not gone well for the confederates in tennessee that summer the union general william rosecrans had deployed his army of the cumberland with such skill in midjune 1863 that it suffered minimal casualties when maneuvering confederate gen braxton bragg s army of tennessee out of the central part of the state bragg was forced to retreat into fortified chattanooga , which was barely within tennessee state lines then , on aug 21 , rosecrans began a followup campaign to dislodge bragg from chattanooga in order to capture the railroad center without storming its defenses on sept 9 he succeeded , when gen thomas crittenden s corps entered the town without the loss of a single man ominously , however , the union movements left parts of rosecrans s army widely separated and vulnerable to defeat by a larger , massed confederate force rosecrans s army was composed of three corps under generals crittenden , george thomas and alexander mccook on sept 10 , crittenden was in chattanooga , but thomas was 15 miles southwest in the stevens gap area of lookout mountain , while mccook was another 20 miles southwest of thomas at the town of alpine if the confederates launched a concentrated assault on one of them , the others were too distant to provide support , particularly considering the mountainous terrain rosecrans , however , was unconcerned , since he assumed that the rebels were desperately trying to retreat farther toward atlanta it was precisely what bragg wanted him to believe earlier bragg had directed selected rebel soldiers to pretend to desert and propagate phony reports among the federals of despondency within confederate ranks rosecrans took the bait he instructed a skeptical general thomas , whose corps was in the center of the union formation , to quickly push his divisions eastward through stevens gap in lookout mountain and continue through dug gap in pigeon mountain , several miles farther east thomas could then attack the retreating confederates on their flank along the way thomas s troops would enter a geological formation called mclemore s cove , a canyonlike feature with a broad floor plain and a steep dead end created by the conjunction of lookout and pigeon mountains if attacked by superior numbers from the north and east , thomas s troops would have no way to escape general thomas s corps was composed of four divisions although he was opposed to rosecrans s hasty pursuit order , there was no choice but to comply on sept 9 he sent gen james negley s 4 , 600man division into mclemore s cove from the west by evening it was camped just short of dug gap , through which it would march the next day across pigeon mountain , where rosecrans hoped it would find bragg s demoralized army marching southward the union forces were walking right into bragg s trap the confederate commander ordered gen thomas hindman s division to block the northern exit from the cove and attack negley s flank on the morning of sept 10 he also ordered gen d h hill to dispatch patrick cleburne s division the best in his army into dug gap , where it would simultaneously attack negley from the east the destruction of negley s division was as certain as good generalship could make it , wrote the historian steven woodworth bragg s subordinates needed only to carry out his orders and the army of tennessee s first clearcut victory would be a reality it didn t happen hill and hindman responded inscrutably hill said he could not comply because cleburne was ill and dug gap was too encumbered with obstacles in truth , cleburne was perfectly healthy and the dug gap obstacles could have been cleared in an hour hindman got into position ok , but decided not to attack until he heard the guns of hill s assault , which never happened bragg temporarily accepted hill s excuses but almost immediately ordered gen simon bolivar buckner to reinforce hindman with two additional divisions to compensate for hill s refusal to use cleburne hindman and hill were mystifying officers a year earlier , a copy of confidential marching orders for robert e lee s entire army addressed to hill inexplicably fell into union hands the incident may have changed history by triggering a normally tentative union general george b mcclellan into prompt action that stopped lee s first invasion of the north at the battle of antietam similarly , 10 months earlier , in arkansas , hindman brilliantly marched an army into an advantageous position , only to forfeit decisionmaking to subordinates once the fight at prairie grove got under way the consequent uncoordinated rebel attacks resulted in an indecisive battle despite his frustration , bragg appreciated that the morning of sept 11 would give him a second chance , because hill finally agreed to attack from the east and butler s two additional divisions were available to help hindman from the north although by then negley had figured out that the confederates were out there , he did not know how many , and general rosecrans , his superior , still believed the rebels were retreating on the east side of pigeon mountain rosecrans did not want any of thomas s divisions to backtrack although thomas ordered a second division to reinforce negley , the combined 10 , 000 federals still remained decisively outnumbered by 30 , 000 rebels on the morning of the 11th unfortunately , on the evening of sept 10h hindman became apprehensive that he was about to be attacked by unseen federals at his rear he sent a messenger to bragg , then encamped with hill near the next day s anticipated action at dug gap the messenger was a french staff officer named nocquet who could barely speak english and whose loyalty to the confederacy was questionable after listening to nocquet s message , bragg asked an informed cavalry officer if enemy troops were near hindman s rear and was told there were none therefore , bragg instructed nocquet to tell hindman that he was to attack on the morning of sept 11 as ordered , even if he lost his entire command even though nocquet returned by 6 30 am , hindman spent most of the day rearranging troop attack formations and otherwise delaying nonetheless , the harmless rebel activities alerted negley to his endangered position , from which he quietly withdrew hindman did not attack until 4 pm , by which time there were few union soldiers remaining to be trapped bragg was enraged , but hindman later claimed that nocquet told him bragg s orders were discretionary the following month nocquet infiltrated \( returned to \? \) federal lines with 150 , 000 in funds intended for construction projects the confederate failure at mclemore s cove wasn t merely a lost opportunity to destroy 1 or 2 divisions of the 12 comprising the opposing union army even some of the average rebel infantrymen were nearly in tears at the obvious mismanagement of a golden opportunity as the historian glenn tucker explained had thomas s corps , or a sizable portion of it , been captured in mclemore s cove , crittenden s corps isolated fifty miles from mccook could scarcely have escaped , and with crittenden captured or driven beyond the tennessee river , mccook would have been easy prey in short , rosecrans s army would likely have been decimated , and the union push toward atlanta halted as it actually happened , however , the incident at mclemore s cove convinced rosecrans that the confederates were not retreating consequently , and fortuitously , he ordered his own army to concentrate the result was the battle of chickamauga , where the two mighty

almaty , kazakhstan negotiations over s disputed broke off saturday with scant signs of progress , much less an agreement on tighter controls demanded by six world powers in exchange for some easing of sanctions that have a stranglehold on the iranian economy the failure to reach any accord was a stark but not surprising setback in a tortuous , decadelong standoff over iran s nuclear ambitions while the talks have been complicated by the iranian presidential election just 10 weeks away , officials said the sides remained divided by fundamental disagreements , none of which are new , the s foreign policy chief , who led the talks for the six powers , said that after two days of long and intense discussions , the sides remain far apart on the substance no future negotiations were announced , and ms ashton said she would be in touch very soon with the top iranian negotiator , saeed jalili , in order to see how to go forward mr jalili offered a sharply different summary , saying at a briefing that the next move was up to the big powers , and that they needed more time to digest a new proposal from iran he said the proposal was largely based on a plan first put forward in moscow in june and aimed at addressing some of the international community s concerns but he also adopted a strident tone in reiterating iran s view that it has a right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes of course , there is some distance in the position of the two sides , mr jalili said but he said iran s proposals , which required recognizing our right to enrich and ending behaviors which have every indication of enmity toward the iranian people , were designed to help us move toward a constructive road a senior american official called iran s demands unreasonable and disproportionate it is fair to say that iran is prepared to take very minimal steps in regards to its nuclear program , said the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , which has become the state department s standard practice at the talks the official insisted that the obama administration was still committed to achieving a diplomatic solution , but warned of additional sanctions should iran fail to voluntarily curb its nuclear program international pressure continues and will only increase if iran is not responsive , the official said britain also warned of tougher sanctions iran s current position falls far short of what is needed to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough , foreign secretary william hague said in a statement he added , we look to iran to consider carefully whether it wants to continue on its current course , and face increasing pressure and isolation from the international community officials struggled to give a realistic assessment of the talks' failure , while also offering a hint of optimism there may not have been a breakthrough , but there also was not a breakdown , the american official said sergei ryabkov , russia s lead negotiator , said , we 're still on the threshold , according to the interfax news service the futility of the talks was certain to arouse renewed alarm , particularly from israel , which had tempered its repeated threats of a military strike against iranian nuclear sites in deference to the diplomatic efforts this failure was predictable , yuval steinitz , israel s minister of strategic affairs , said in a statement israel has already warned that the iranians are exploiting the talks in order to play for time while making additional progress in enriching uranium for an atomic bomb he added , the time has come for the world to take a more assertive stand and make it unequivocally clear to the iranians that the negotiations games have run their course the conclusion of the talks without agreement on even a modest confidencebuilding measure or the clear prospect of future talks was striking , given that all sides seemed to have incentives to keep the conversation going , and to avoid talk of military intervention the united states has focused increasingly in recent weeks on an intensifying threat from north korea , which , unlike iran , already possesses iran , meanwhile , is preoccupied by an internal power struggle over the presidential election western countries fear that iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons , while iran has insisted that its program is for peaceful purposes , including atomic energy and medical research , to which it claims a right as a signer of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty iran has accused the big powers , particularly the united states , of hypocrisy for maintaining their own nuclear arsenals but at the same time , iran has refused to comply with demands that it suspend its uranium enrichment program , expand access for inspectors and answer questions about its intentions the talks here in kazakhstan were the fifth round over the past year between iran and the socalled p5plus1 the group consists of the five permanent members of the security council britain , china , france , russia and the united states plus germany the negotiations have settled into a familiar routine the big powers demand concrete steps from iran and a firm commitment to comply with united nations and other international mandates , only to be faced with delays or complicated counterproposals , including one on friday that one western diplomat said had left officials puzzled western officials had arrived here with guarded optimism that iran would give a concrete response to a february proposal that would provide a modest easing of sanctions in exchange for restrictions on iran s supply of enriched uranium enriched to high levels , the uranium could be used in nuclear weapons the proposal called for iran to accept broad oversight for all of its nuclear activities by the , but the big powers dropped a demand that iran shut its enrichment plant at fordo , built deep below a mountain instead , iran would only have to suspend enrichment there , and take other steps that would make it difficult to resume quick production of nuclear fuel in another apparent softening , the six powers had said iran could keep a small amount of uranium enriched to 20 percent purity , which can be converted relatively quickly to weapons grade , for use in a reactor to produce medical isotopes after the first morning of discussions on friday , the iranians said they had offered a new comprehensive proposal aimed at building cooperation the statement baffled the six powers , who said they had not heard anything that sounded like a new plan the iranian side later clarified that it had presented a scaled down version of a package first proposed in moscow in june , which was quickly rejected mr jalili said saturday that iran s plan incorporated the proposal put forward in february , and said the next move was up to the six powers good negotiations took place , and in consideration of our new proposals , it is now up to the p5plus1 to demonstrate its willingness and sincerity to take appropriate confidencebuilding steps in the future , he said ms ashton and mr ryabkov agreed that there had been somewhat more productive giveandtake than in previous meetings the iranians' position was quite open and quite constructive , mr ryabkov said still , both diplomats said that ultimately the sides were too far apart on the substantive issues
miami when she was little , elaine taylor remembers rushing home whenever old smokey fired up clouds of ash from the towering trash incinerator would fill the air and settle on the ramshackle houses and the yards of the  her mother , who took in laundry , would be whipping sheets and shirts off the clotheslines often , the soot would force elaine and her mother to wash everything again , by hand old smokey was shut down in 1970 , after 45 years of belching ash , but its legacy might be more ominous than mere memories of soiled laundry residents of the neighborhood , established by bahamian immigrants in the 1880s , have become alarmed by that soil samples there show contamination from carcinogens like arsenic and heavy metals , including lead , cadmium and barium ash from the old incinerator is being blamed , and residents are asking why none of this came to light sooner they did n't want to let it be known , so they kept it hushhush , said delphine sweatman , who has lived in the same house for 40 years and has stopped taking her three grandchildren to local parks i do n't think that s right miami officials discovered contamination two years ago at the site of old smokey , now a training center for firefighters , but they did not alert residents of the area a report on the findings remained under wraps until a city employee revealed its existence this year to a university of miami law professor , anthony v alfieri , who directs the law school s  once the presence of toxins was made public , officials scrambled to commission tests of soil samples in the immediate area they later expanded the investigation to include 7 parks , 17 private properties , 4 churches and 12 green spaces in the west grove and in adjoining coconut grove , as well as in coral gables , a separate municipality at a briefing for residents last week , wilbur mayorga , a miamidade county environmental official , said testing results suggested that the amount of toxins in the west grove sites was unlikely to cause illness , and that arsenic , for instance , can occur naturally in the area s soil and limestone marc sarnoff , a miami commissioner , said the west grove had received a clean bill of health everything is testing to be residential standard , mr sarnoff said , referring to contaminant levels permitted under environmental regulations that may not be the final word a cancer researcher at the university of miami said that she and several colleagues discovered a cluster of pancreatic cancer cases in the west grove several years ago that s the little region that lights up , said the researcher , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the issue although she found the discovery puzzling , she said she did not pursue it because of a lack of funds but when she read a newspaper article this year about old smokey that said its ash had spewed arsenic and heavy metals into the neighborhood , she said everything started making sense the researcher noted that no correlation could be established between the cancer cluster and the old incinerator without more research in any event , some longtime residents now have at least a clue as to what might have made them sick i'm dying of cancer , said vernon clark , 77 , who once ran for a city commission seat my brother has cancer , said mr clark , who walks slowly , using a golf club as a cane my mother died of it residents recall that redhot ash from old smokey , which could pulverize and burn 300 tons of trash a day , sometimes sparked fires on nearby roofs and in trees in the 1950s , according to the miami herald , pilots descending toward miami international airport resorted to instrument landings when the smoke became too dense there were a lot of people living around that thing they were not protected , said marion culmer wright , 86 , who remains in the dusty frame house where her parents married in 1917 she remembers the soot on the eight australian pines her father had planted , one for each of his children , that were later taken down when the city widened the road across the street from old smokey s former site lies esther mae armbrister park and its playground down the block is george washington carver elementary school , a once allblack institution that traces its history to 1899 former students recall ash blowing in through the school s open windows professor alfieri said that the construction of old smokey in the middle of a jim crow community in 1925 exemplified the city s pattern of neglecting the west grove , an area that has never experienced the prosperity so evident in its neighboring communities in a 1950 article in ladies' home journal , marjory stoneman douglas wrote that when the city installed a water and sewage system in coconut grove , its western neighbor was left out of the project , and for years residents continued to use wells and outhouses paradoxically , the worst toxin levels found in the recent testing were not in the west grove but in coconut grove s , the site of a popular playground and a dog park workers removed leadcontaminated soil this month and paved over a parking lot , and officials declared the problem contained my daughter learned to crawl in that sand , said dawn mccarthy , the mother of two girls who frequented blanche park we 're all praying there s nothing wrong , but we 're terrified none of us go to that park anymore
london do you know where your children are \? you could start by combing the national theater s stage adaptation of emil and the detectives , which may just be the most kidsintensive production i have ever seen that s saying a lot in a theater capital that is also showing charlie and the chocolate factory , matilda and billy elliot , three musicals that give pride of place to many a pintsized tyke but none of those three can quite match the sense of recess run rampant that has taken over the national s capacious olivier stage in a show featuring 60 children and then raise that number to 180 given that three rotating casts will be keeping backstage chaperones busy throughout an engagement that finishes on march 18 their energy , as it happens , is the abiding virtue of bijan sheibani s production , an undeniable logistical triumph that nonetheless gives off the air of a project that is possibly more fun to be in than it is to watch based on the german writer erich k stner s timehonored 1929 children s novel , the book , previously adapted for the london stage in 1934 , resurfaces here in a version by carl miller , a onetime theater critic we witness the growing empowerment of the earnest 10yearold , emil \( played on opening night by ethan hammer \) , whose hairdressermother \( naomi frederick \) gives the schoolboy 140 marks to take to his grandmother , by train from the provinces to the big city the cash is stolen en route by a plump baddie , mr snow \( stuart mcquarrie \) , who does n't reckon on the solidarity that lies in wait as the prepubescent populace of weimarera berlin come hurtling to emil s aid these young accomplices have names like tuesday and toots and pony the hat , and they take to the stage with brio and the odd wink to the very playgoers whom they then clamber among in the second act \( this infiltrating of the audience by the cast is becoming an irksome london habit precisely the same occurs in the new english national opera production of the magic flute \) but even as one is wondering whether that s all there is slightness on the page can look amplified on stage the designs lift the evening to a level of visual finesse that is unusual even at this address drawing on the national s apparently limitless resources , including an ace projection team in 59 productions , bunny christie has devised a german expressionist landscape of evershifting and swirling perspectives that bring to life a bustling metropolis reaching down to the sewers i do n't know what tuition is being offered to the children backstage during the run but they have an entire vorticist landscape unfolding breathtakingly around them i hope they 're taking notes keeping with both the teutonic setting and the art historical references , the olivier s neighboring auditorium , the lyttelton , has just opened a rare production of from morning to midnight , a longneglected play \( in english , anyway \) from the german repertory that the children next door would doubtless find pretty heavy going make that quite a few adults , as well the theme of georg kaiser s 1912 parable , seen here in a version from the tonywinning writer dennis kelly \( matilda \) , is the destabilizing and dehumanizing effect of money so it s not a little ironic that melly still s allstopsout production looks as if it must have cost a small fortune soutra gilmour s set keeps transforming itself in front of our eyes , referencing along the way various german painters \( ernst kirchner and otto dix for starters \) andrzej goulding s projections lend a celluloid component to a highly stylized piece of theatrical artifice that charts the financial and moral reckoning of an unnamed bank clerk \( adam godley \) who absconds with 60 , 000 marks across the long day indicated in the title a clock keeps us apprised of time s onward passage until it is obscured from view a hardworking mr godley \( late of london s pillowman and the broadway revival of anything goes \) lends a hangdog demeanor and limber physicality to this everyman figure who exists to be taught a life lesson his conclusion money decreases worth that is the real truth now i 've saved you the price of a ticket the design and one or two performances are more or less the only reasons to catch strangers on a train , a third production to put visuals at the forefront of the evening craig warner s play draws from the 1950 patricia highsmith novel that led to the alfred hitchcock film a year later , whose rabid homoerotic undercurrents can be felt anew this time around so far so tantalizing , you might think , except that robert allan ackerman s production signals from the start that something is not quite right barely have our two antiheroes met aboard a train to plot their mutually convenient scheme of murder before bruno \( jack huston \) twice extols guy \( laurence fox \) for having a spark precisely what a dulled , not always audible mr fox does not possess , to the detriment of the evening as a whole instead , one is left pondering the relationship between bruno and his ravenous mother \( a throaty \) , who seems to have wandered in from a tennessee williams play , and the comparative cool brought to proceedings by christian mckay as the private detective who wises up to events mr mckay is excellent , as is an animated mr huston , the latter betterknown these days from his work on television \( boardwalk empire \) and film \( american hustle \) the rest is theatrical pastiche of varying degrees of skill , but the train should surely get its own curtain call directed by bijan sheibani directed by melly still directed by robert allan ackerman
spend any time around monetary officials and one word you 'll hear a lot is normalization most though not all such officials accept that now is no time to be tightfisted , that for the time being credit must be easy and interest rates low still , the men in dark suits look forward eagerly to the day when they can go back to their usual job , snatching away the punch bowl whenever the party gets going but what if the world we 've been living in for the past five years is the new normal \? what if depressionlike conditions are on track to persist , not for another year or two , but for decades \? you might imagine that speculations along these lines are the province of a radical fringe and they are indeed radical but fringe , not so much a number of economists have been flirting with for a while and now they 've moved into the mainstream in fact , the case for secular stagnation a persistent state in which a depressed economy is the norm , with episodes of full employment few and far between was made forcefully recently at the most ultrarespectable of venues , the imf s big annual research conference and the person making that case was none other than yes , that larry summers and if mr summers is right , everything respectable people have been saying about economic policy is wrong , and will keep being wrong for a long time mr summers began with a point that should be obvious but is often missed the financial crisis that started the great recession is now far behind us indeed , by most measures it ended more than four years ago yet our economy remains depressed he then made a related point before the crisis we had a huge housing and debt bubble yet even with this huge bubble boosting spending , the overall economy was only soso the job market was ok but not great , and the boom was never powerful enough to produce significant inflationary pressure mr summers went on to draw a remarkable moral we have , he suggested , an economy whose normal condition is one of inadequate demand of at least mild depression and which only gets anywhere close to full employment when it is being buoyed by bubbles i 'd weigh in with some further evidence look at relative to income that ratio was roughly stable from 1960 to 1985 , but rose rapidly and inexorably from 1985 to 2007 , when crisis struck yet even with households going ever deeper into debt , the economy s performance over the period as a whole was mediocre at best , and demand showed no sign of running ahead of supply looking forward , we obviously ca n't go back to the days of everrising debt yet that means weaker consumer demand and without that demand , how are we supposed to return to full employment \? again , the evidence suggests that we have become an economy whose normal state is one of mild depression , whose brief episodes of prosperity occur only thanks to bubbles and unsustainable borrowing why might this be happening \? one answer could be slowing population growth a growing population creates a demand for new houses , new office buildings , and so on when growth slows , that demand drops off america s workingage population rose rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s , as baby boomers grew up , and its work force rose even faster , as women moved into the labor market that s now all behind us and you can see the effects even at the height of the housing bubble , we were n't building nearly as many  another important factor may be which emerged in the 1980s and since then have fluctuated but never gone away why does all of this matter \? one answer is that central bankers need to stop talking about exit strategies easy money should , and probably will , be with us for a very long time this , in turn , means we can forget all those scare stories about government debt , which run along the lines of it may not be a problem now , but just wait until interest rates rise more broadly , if our economy has a persistent tendency toward depression , we 're going to be living under the lookingglass rules of depression economics in which virtue is vice and prudence is folly , in which attempts to save more \( including attempts to reduce budget deficits \) make everyone worse off for a long time i know that many people just hate this kind of talk it offends their sense of rightness , indeed their sense of morality economics is supposed to be about making hard choices \( at other people s expense , naturally \) it s not supposed to be about persuading people to spend more but as mr summers said , the crisis is not over until it is over and economic reality is what it is and what that reality appears to be right now is one in which depression rules will apply for a very long time

when jeff alling , a family physician , moved to wise county more than 20 years ago , he was one of only two doctors in the rural north texas community qualified to deliver babies since then , he has delivered more than 2 , 000 i 've got 12 little babies that i delivered their mothers 18 or 20 years ago , so i'm kind of on my second generation , he said but dr alling no longer has a place to deliver babies in the county the community hospital in bridgeport that he helped found in 2008 merged its obstetrics unit with the wise regional health system in decatur in march that hospital , where dr alling delivered babies before he left for bridgeport , instituted a policy in 2009 that allowed physicians to deliver babies only if they had undergone a threeyear residency program specializing in obstetrics and gynecology the purpose of that was looking ahead to the potential in the growth of our market , said steve summers , the chief executive of wise regional for more than a decade , mr summers has worked to shift wise regional toward a specialist model he said it was an effort to meet the qualityofcare standards set by its urban affiliate , the , which operates hospitals nearby that also allow only qualified obstetricians to deliver babies although he acknowledged that family physicians usually receive a rotation of obstetrics training during their residency , mr summers said the hospital board decided not to allow exceptions to its policy as a result , dr alling and three other family physicians were denied obstetrics privileges at wise regional and are in legal mediation with the hospital they estimate that 50 to 100 pregnant patients , the majority of whom live in rural areas and are covered by , have been affected by wise regional s refusal to grant them obstetrics privileges those patients now have three options they could transfer their care to one of three doctors with obstetrics privileges at wise regional continue to see their current doctor and go to the emergency room when they are in labor or travel roughly 30 miles to jacksboro , where a community hospital has granted those family doctors obstetrics privileges the situation in wise county illustrates how many family physicians are caught in a growing divide between rural and urban health care markets with a shortage of medical providers nationwide , one that is particularly acute in remote corners of texas , rural regions continue to rely on family physicians to provide an array of services while some urban hospitals allow qualified family doctors to deliver babies , the practice has become less common , in part because patients with more provider options often choose medical specialists you ca n't chalk it up to any one thing , but the underlying reason it s money , said dr brad faglie , one of the family physicians denied obstetrics privileges at wise regional specialists make more money on these bills moreover , he said , maybe rural life is losing out to urban life a 2012 study by the journal of the american board of family medicine found that the number of family physicians providing maternity care declined to 97 percent in 2010 , from 233 percent in 2000 the study attributed the decline to malpractice costs , lifestyle concerns , lack of institutional and community support of family physicians delivering babies and changes to family medicine residency requirements in a written response to that study , dr howard blanchette , the chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at new york medical college , suggested that there was growing evidence that the adequacy of prenatal care for women in rural and medically underserved areas is deteriorating dr faglie said that nearly 90 percent of his obstetric patients , whom he sees at a rural health clinic in alvord , northwest of decatur , are on medicaid he continues to receive new obstetric patients , he said , many of whom do not want to change doctors before delivery , or who have difficulty transferring to wise regional because those doctors are booked he said the situation had endangered some patients , especially those with highrisk pregnancies , because it had been difficult for him to coordinate patient care with a specialist i have patients that i'm seeing to term , and when they go into labor , they go to the er , dr faglie said that is a poor standard of care mr summers disputed the assertion that the hospital s obstetrics privileges policy was created for financial gain he said he expected that the family physicians would continue caring for patients in the region , and simply transition their obstetrics services to the community hospital in jacksboro we are opting for a higher level of quality over all , he said , and actually turning away from the potential benefit financially by having the increased business come here mr summers chalked up some coordinationofcare challenges to communication he said some of the family physicians' patients who wanted to deliver at wise regional did not transition to admitted physicians far enough in advance wise regional said the assertion that women were delivering in emergency rooms was false the hospital has had 17 pregnant patients transferred from family physicians to obstetricians since march , all but one of whom were receiving medicaid none of the family doctors' patients had to deliver in the emergency room , the hospital said instead , patients were moved to the labor and delivery unit a spokeswoman for baylor health said the system s policies governing hospital privileges were recommended by medical staff based on clinical assessment of the skills and experience necessary to perform the privilege sought she said the obstetrics policy had been in place for many years but dr jeffrey cain , president of the american academy of family physicians , said that while local hospitals may set varying criteria for granting physicians hospital privileges on the basis of training and competence , it was bad for patient care to deny family doctors the ability to practice cooperatively with obstetricians tom banning , the chief executive of the texas academy of family physicians , said that wise regional is the sole hospital in the area and , as a result , has the power to set administrative policies that interfere with patient care it s incumbent upon the family physicians and obgyns to work collaboratively to provide that care , he said , because there s just not enough of them in those communities
this is the second installment of a  on a cold , blustery sunday morning , feb 5 , 1865 five days after the congress passed the 13th amendment prohibiting slavery and over two months before john wilkes booth fired the bullet at ford s theater president lincoln and his young son , tad , walked a mile to the photography studios of alexander gardner , at 511 7th street , washington , dc it was to be a productive morning five sets of images wetplate collodion negatives on glass , then albumen paper prints 1 two imperials , the first and the last , and three sets of four small cartedevisite negatives a total of 14 images 2 all 14 were ordered and given numbers by lloyd ostendorf , the most prominent postwar collector of lincoln photography and the author \( with charles hamilton \) of lincoln in photographs an album of every known pose , first published in 1963 and republished in various editions over the years \( by 1998 , there were 130 ostendorfnumbered photographs in all \) in the preface , ostendorf explained his project each camera exposure every known photograph of lincoln is catalogued and printed in this book only the best examples that have come to light since lincoln s death have been selected and historically researched for this compilation the pioneer works of meserve are now out of date , and other picture biographies are incomplete or go far afield from photography , nor do they include the most recent discoveries this book fulfills the ongoing need for a definitive study and provides the true closeup of lincoln as the camera saw him there exist 130 separate photographs of lincoln , 40 beardless and 90 with beard among that number are 36 stereoscopic or three dimensional views further , 22 photographs of lincoln are published for the first time in book form as part of the ostendorf enumeration since 1963 3 according to ostendorf , gardner used two cameras for the february 5 sitting a regular singlelens instrument and a multiplelens camera which exposed four images simultaneously , two upper and two lower , on a single large glass plate although each pair was stereoscopically related , this was incidental to the photographer , whose purpose was to make duplicates quickly and cheaply only one operation was needed to turn out four cartesdevisite photographs the glass images were usually cut apart no entire fourplate photograph of lincoln is known to exist and were then distributed to branches or assistants to insure maximum production 4 , 5 here are the photographs , in roughly the order in which they were taken 6 these 14 images are well known but arguments about the dating of the photographs persist the entire group o114 through o118 was first dated to april 9 , 1865 , five days before the assassination , by frederick hill meserve later he changed the date to april 10 \( only , it seems , because april 10 was a sunday \) meserve was the godfather of collecting lincoln photography one day he had seen someone sweeping glass negatives into the street , and asked if he could keep them instead he went on to build the greatest collection of these negatives in the world meserve put out a listing of lincoln photographs in 1903 it listed the o118 image as the last photograph ever taken of lincoln alive 7 sometime after gardner s death in 1892 , meserve received a print of o118 from truman h bartlett , a sculptor friend of gardner s and the author of an article called the physiognomy of abraham lincoln the print had a line through it , indicating that the negative was cracked bartlett told meserve a story that he had heard from gardner himself in the developing process , the negative was broken in two , the fracture cutting through the top of lincoln s head by placing two pieces of glass together , gardner successfully managed to make one print , and only one , before destroying the damaged negative 8 gardner had preserved the original , unretouched image , and it found its way to meserve s collection 9 but he also sold prints that had been substantially retouched he sharpened the left ear and removed the crack the story of the crack , along with the original april 9 date , was printed in the new york times on feb 12 , 1922 o118 was captioned the president sat for this photograph just five days before booth shot him the cracked negative caused it to be discarded it has only once before been published , and then in a retouched form the accompanying text by james young read probably no other photograph of lincoln conveys more clearly the abiding sadness of the face the lines of time and care are deeply etched , and he has the look of a man bordering upon old age , though he was only 56 proof that the camera was but a few feet away may be found by scrutiny of this picture the print has been untouched , and this picture is an exact likeness of the president as he looked in the week of his death 10 my fascination with the dating and interpretation of photographs is really a fascination with the pushpull of history facts vs beliefs our desire to know the origins of things vs our desire to rework , to reconfigure the past to suit our own beliefs and predilections perhaps nothing better illustrates this than two radically different predispositions to objects the storyteller vs the collector for the collector the image with the crack is a damaged piece of goods the crack potentially undermining the value of the photograph as an artifact , a link to the past the storyteller doesn t care about the photograph s condition , or its provenance , but about its thematic connections with events to the storyteller , the crack is the beginning of a legend the legend of a death foretold the crack seems to anticipate the bullet fired into the back of lincoln s head at ford s theater on good friday , april 14 , 1865 it should have a name i call it the proleptic crack i talked to harold holzer the storyteller who has written , cowritten , and edited approximately 40 books about lincoln and the civil war 11 and to keya morgan the collector an entrepreneur and expert on lincoln photographs and memorabilia the date , as i mentioned , was disputed if you look at the standard histories of lincoln photography \( meserve , stefan lorant s abraham lincoln a picture story of his life , and the early editions of ostendorf \) , o118 is typically dated to april 10 , 1865 holzer explained harold holzer meserve was the first one to attribute it to april 10 i don t see any other evidence anywhere that there was any rhyme or reason to it it was part of a romanticized story the last negative in the series o118 fractured in the printing process and that famous crackedplate negative was the last photograph of lincoln except for one problem it s not true errol morris it s not true \? harold holzer hitherto known as april 10 , 1865 , but subsequently corrected errol morris the photograph had been misdated \? harold holzer yes i m the guy who corrected it and i never get any credit for it but that s okay errol morris but i would be delighted to give you credit harold holzer no , it s ok it was great how i discovered it people don t realize that many lincoln photographs were taken at the request of painters and sculptors , as crutches for his fidgetiness if that s the word you want to use lincoln often made himself available for lifesittings even while he was busy in the white house so , painters would come , and he kept saying things like , you ve got to paint me on the jump or , you can paint me when i m reading my mail and so the greatest lincoln photographs the famous sitting , for example , that produced the fivedollar bill , the penny profile , and lincoln and tad were taken under the direction of a painter for a painter 12 errol morris and who requested the gardner photographs \? harold holzer his name was matthew wilson i was doing a piece over 30 years ago for antiques magazine wilson was commissioned by gideon welles , lincoln s secretary of the navy , to do a painting of the president and so he got live sittings in the white house same old story lincoln was agreeable but fidgety and moving around so wilson persuaded lincoln to go to gardner s studio and there he sits for a series of photographs in which he looks pretty haggard and thin worn out by the war errol morris so how did you learn that the date was feb 5 \? harold holzer i was looking in wilson s hometown hartford , conn for original material about the sittings that he had with lincoln so many of the artists who painted lincoln wrote recollections after he died because it became profitable to do so this guy didn t but in scrounging around , as i recall , i found that someone had recently published his diary in the bulletin of the connecticut historical society and the diary recorded lincoln s visit to gardner s on feb 5 serendipity the article on the painter matthew wilson includes a portion of wilson s diary from 1865 it is on the strength of the feb 5 entry that holzer came to believe that the photograph had been misdated here are some excerpts from the diary january 23 1865 at 1 15 took cars to washington from philadelphia , cold , wet ride , arriving at eight , drove to 416 st west , between f g streets january 24 from there to mrs welles , found mary morgan and others there , then to navy department found mr welles , mr faxon and edgar welles saw the smithsonian institute in flames everyone feeling it a sad loss the fire was yet another conflagration near the end of the civil war on jan 24 , 1865 , the smithsonian institution caught fire not explicitly because of the war , but because of a mislaid stovepipe alexander gardner photographed it but at that time , it was technologically impossible to capture smoke and flames on a photographic plate cameras could capture the aftermath , but photographic emulsions were not sensitive enough \( nor lenses fast enough \) to quickly capture destruction in medias res often an exposure could last for seconds , even minutes , with wetplate collodion negatives and so gardner was forced to paint smoke and flames onto his image for me , it represents a borderline moment in the history of photography gardner could capture a portrait of lincoln in his studio in less than a minute but for the image of the smithsonian burning , both painting and photography were needed a haunting contemporary account was provided in the diaries of mary anna henry , the oldest daughter of joseph henry , a physicist and the first secretary of the smithsonian the family lived in rooms on the second floor of the east wing of the building 13 1865 jan 25th i record in my journal one of the momentous and saddest events of lives the burning of a large portion of the institution the fire originated in the insertion of a pipe of a stove which had been put up in the picture gallery into an air chamber in the wall instead of a flue the man in charge had been told to be particularly careful and father had inquired of several times if he was sure all was safe the fire must have been smoldering several days but did not break out until yesterday shortly after three o clock we were soon informed that our end of the building was no longer in danger so we stationed ourselves at one of the windows to watch the progress of the destruction truly it was a grand sight as well as a sad one the flames bursting from the windows of the towers rose high above them curling round the ornamental stone work through the archs and trefoils as if in full appreciation of their symatry sic , a beautiful fiend tasting to the utmost pleasure of destruction matthew wilson s diary continues the repeated phrase , painted on mr lincoln , reveals that wilson began working on his painting just after feb 5 , and continued on past the assassination it is evidence of painstaking work done over the course of many months the diary illustrates just how a painting is totally unlike a photograph compared to a painting , a photograph is produced instantaneously january 25 a reception at mrs welles met gen bank , admiral farragut and others , chatted most with gov \( now sen \? \) morgan of new york january 31 went to the house a day not to be forgotten for this day the amendment to the constitution to abolish slavery was passed february 4 at 1 00 o clock went with jeannie and mrs welles who took us to the president and presented us to mrs lincoln we met there gen hancock , mrs seward , mrs genl hunter , admiral and mrs farragut , etc mrs lincoln in purple velvet and white

painted on mr lincoln february 18 went to the white house at 11 o clock saw the president went to mrs lincoln s reception february 20 went early to the white house , painted on mr lincoln to half past 9 april 10 waked by guns before 5 o clock counted over 100 and concluded something had transpired lee had surrendered and this may be a day on which to remember the commencement of peace after 4 years of war went with the stream to the president s house and other places went to ford s in evening laura keene , she stoops to conquer with rufus wright april 14 about half past 10 was awakened by a commotion in the house and found it arose from the fact that the president had just been shot in the theater \( ford s \) dressed and went about seeking news , the whole city in a ferment universal horror grief expressed april 15 went to the kirkwood house saw senator sumner who had just left mr lincoln breathing his last i said to mr sumner , thank god you are spared to us ! his reply was , i may be the next mr knapp sat at 11 but there was such a gloom over all the city , almost every house was draped in black nothing \( else \) was talked of and the day was rainy and dark , altogether it was the saddest imaginable on the day of lincoln s death , mary anna henry had written in her diary we were awakened this morning by an announcement , which almost made our hearts stand still with consternation the president was shot last night in the theater when the morning paper was issued he was still alive although little or no hopes were entertained of his recovery but now the tolling bells tell us he has ceased to breathe he is dead mr de bust has just told hannah he died at half past 7 o clock deeply must the country mourn this death for although uncouth ungainly , he was true hearted , magnanimous and kind and in the present crisis ready to follow the such a course with the defeated belligerent as would win them back to their allegiance to the government and subdue the rebellion in their hearts as well as subjugate their aims the south has lost in him a good judicious friend his successor johnson heartily desires the death of the leaders of the rebellion is in every way ultra in his views back to matthew wilson s diary april 20 began a copy of mr lincoln s portrait for l prang co , print publishers , boston \( 159 washington street \) april 21 painted on mr and

hours the procession , what most interested me was the torn flags people not as enthusiastic as i should have supposed may 25 painted on copy no 3 of lincoln all day may 26 painted all day on copy no 3 of lincoln may 30 painted all day on mr lincoln matthew wilson may have used o118 for his portrait but more likely , the painting was a composite of the photographic images from feb 5 o115 seems to be the predominant image but the painting itself is undistinguished , mediocre who is this lincoln cheeks rouged , face unlined , eyes bland , and with the smile of a simpleton \? walt whitman wrote none of the artists or pictures has caught the deep , though subtle and indirect expression on the man s face there is something else there the current portraits are all failures most of them caricatures 14 could it be that painting could not capture lincoln that lincoln needed photography \? by april 20 , the day of lincoln s funeral , the storefront of philp solomons , gardner s publisher , was advertising the feb 5 photographs as coming from the president s last sitting meanwhile , matthew wilson had been commissioned to duplicate the painting for the lithographic firm of louis prang co matthew wilson s diary allowed the feb 5 photographs to be accurately dated , but wilson and his wife jeannie may also be the source of the error jeannie endorsed a copy of the painting as painted by matthew wilson from life , two weeks before he was shot  holzer explained the significance of the feb 5 date harold holzer so , all of those last photographs , which were supposedly taken so that the nation could see the toll that the war had taken on lincoln , were made for an entirely different purpose they were made for an artist and the photographer who gets the commission issues them publicly and makes money from the deal errol morris are you saying that lincoln wouldn t have agreed to have these photographs taken if not for the portrait that had been commissioned \? harold holzer there were certainly other reasons he opened alexander gardner s gallery in 1863 we presume gardner said , i m opening my own studio i would like you to be the first sitter so he goes to gardner s but it s almost always you get this in the illinois years as well like he s being importuned he s being invited to photo studios but there s this wall of victorian formality and modesty that prevents him from concluding these are doing me a lot of good they re getting my image out there they re letting people see how i m suffering for this cause holzer has toured the country with stage programs titled lincoln seen and heard , the lincoln family album , lincoln in american memory combining pictures and quotations with performances by actors , he has dramatized history harold holzer you try to make the story have a dramatic arc i have been touring with sam waterston i introduce sam waterston reading the gettysburg address and then comment eleven days before , lincoln goes to the photographer s and the people in the audience laugh it s almost as if he s creating an image of himself for the gettysburg address that may have been part of it , but the evidence we have is that a sculptor , sarah fisher ames , was having trouble getting the measurements and the poses she needed , so she took lincoln to gardner s and lincoln s own secretaries say went to gardner s with mrs ames and got some handsome photographs the one of the president and us , meaning the secretaries , is especially good but they were made for the sculptors it just happened to be eleven days before the gettysburg address i can do the story both ways i can tell it both ways and make it sound real holzer s enterprise is to weave a context a story around photographs and significant events in american history if meserve were correct if gardner took his photographs of lincoln on april 10 , if the negative cracked just days before lincoln was shot it would make for a better story but that story , like so many better stories , isn t true errol morris so is there a desire on your part to connect the last gardner portrait with the assassination \? harold holzer yes , but it s not quite so dramatic , because it s feb 5 it probably is the last of that series that day photographers would do a series of pictures and then move in for one closeup the final photograph o118 was clearly the closeup it s bizarrely out of focus for gardner , who is usually i don t know , maybe he broke it because he was angry because it s a bad photo in a way and it doesn t have that pathos that a cracked plate would have three or four days before his murder ah , but for me , o118 is one of the truly sublime photographs far from being out of focus , the eyes , nose and mouth are deadon yes , the sides are falling off the image has a limited depth of field \( as the focus becomes shorter and shorter on any given lens and i assume that the same lens was used for o114 and for o118 the depth of field decreases \) it is an optical artifact that gives this photographic portrait a threedimensional feeling , a feeling of floating in space errol morris so o118 isn t actually the last photograph of lincoln harold holzer no , the last photograph of lincoln was actually taken the day after the inaugural , march 6 , on the porch of the white house and it s the only outdoor closeup we ever had of him and you can see him squinting in the march wind , looking a little irritated he s got practically nothing left but a , like a devilish goatee at that point but apparently , this photographer henry f warren was visiting from massachusetts and saw tad lincoln on the white house grounds riding around on his pony and he asked tad if he wanted to have a photograph of it he set up his tripod , took a picture , and then he said , would you tell your father that i would like to take a picture of him too as long as i m here so they took warren up to the white house balcony and lincoln looked a little irritated that he was being dragged out by his little boy to have a picture taken and you could see it in the expression , i would rather be doing something else errol morris and do we know anything about the circumstances of that feb 5 sitting \? what was lincoln doing in the white house that day \? anything that can provide context \? harold holzer if you go to the lincoln log on the web it s even better now than it was when it was published as a book , lincoln day by day , in 1961 all they have on feb 5 is that he had a 7 pm cabinet meeting where there was a proposal on the table to sort of pay out the disloyal states the value of their slaves if they would lay down their arms at that minute and the cabinet said , don t do it here is the entry from the lincoln log president reads to cabinet meeting at 7 pm proposal for joint resolution of congress whereby payment of 400 million would be distributed among 16 states pro rata on their slave population in return for cessation of all resistance to national authority by april 1 , 1865 cabinet unanimously disapproves 15 and a notation from gideon welles s diary records dated feb 6 there was a cabinetmeeting last evening the president had matured a scheme which he hoped would be successful in promoting peace it was a proposition for paying the expenses of the war for two hundred days , or four hundred millions , to the rebel states , to be for the extinguishment of slavery , or for such purpose as the states were disposed it did not meet with favor , but was dropped the earnest desire of the president to conciliate and effect peace was manifest , but there may be such a thing as so overdoing as to cause a distrust or adverse feeling in the present temper of congress the proposed measure , if a wise one , could not be carried through successfully 16 footnotes 1 a description of the wetplate collodion process is available at the getty museum and the george eastman house website 2 brobdingnagians vs lilliputians the imperial negative measures approximately 17 x 20 the format had been popularized by gardner , who was skilled with large negatives , when he worked as a camera operator at the studio of mathew brady the cartedevisite , or cdv , negatives measure 2 inches by 3 inches the cdv format was developed by andr adolpheeug ne disderi in france in the 1850s disderi had patented a process for producing 10 images on a single glass plate , but fewer multiples became popular 3 lloyd ostendorf , lincoln s photographs a complete album , dayton , ohio rockywood press , 1998 , p ix 4 ostendorf , p 131 in fact , there is evidence that gardner sold stereoscopes and intended for them to be seen in a stereoscopic viewer and there is at least one double negative intact from that sitting the upper half , presumably , of the o116 plate it was sold at cowan s auctions last year for 35 , 250 this is from the catalogue of the auction  this seated portrait of the president was taken february 5 , 1865 , in what is generally acknowledged as the last sitting made in gardner s studio while not an unknown image the great lincoln collector lloyd ostendorf cataloged the sitting as o116 the negative was assumed to have been lost descended directly in the family of photographer moses parker rice , the current negative may signify otherwise it is clearly a true stereoscopic , and not pseudoscopic negative the left and right images are laterally reversed , and must be separated and remounted to produce a stereoscopic photograph this suggests that the negative is probably not a copy little is known of moses p rice and his photographic career in his biography of alexander gardner , katz \( 1991 276277 \) notes that rice apparently arrived in washington , dc in 1861 from nova scotia he is not listed as a photographer until 1865 , when he appears in the city directory for the district of columbia as working in the studio of j orville johnson while it is unclear if rice ever worked for gardner during the war years , there is little doubt that at some point he gained access to his negatives welling \( 1976 xivxv \) reprints a 1953 reminiscence of charles bender , a scrap silver

inexpensive cartedevisite or callingcard photographs when the fall of fort sumter made major robert anderson the popular hero , the demand for card photographs of him was immediate and unprecedented as other military men became popular , the fad of collecting their likenesses brought about a demand for mass production of the cards no photographic gallery of the day was equipped to meet such a demand on mr gardner s advice , mr brady entered into a contract with anthony and company , the largest photographic supply house in the country , whereby anthony and company agreed to make many

is it ethical to draw a line between animals we see as deserving personhood and those we see more as features of a landscape or the source of food on a plate \? is a dolphin more deserving of special consideration for its care than a pig \? i explored this question earlier this year in when is a person not a human \? when it s a dolphin , or chimp , or  this issue is relevant to this blog in that any consideration of sustainable paths for human societies on a crowding planet has to account for how we get our food particularly the meat that , for now at least , remains a centerpiece of diets once people emerge from deep poverty \( in his sunday column , nicholas kristof , an omnivore raised on a farm in oregon , explores society s slow shift toward improving conditions for the animals we rely on \) david n cassuto , a pace university law professor who specializes in environmental and animal law , offered the following your dot post digging in on a central issue underlying the concept of personhood one s rights under the law here s professor cassuto s contribution before we debate whether and which animals should be persons under the law , we should first determine what personhood means and what it does legal personhood has historically proved a moving target the etymology of person traces back to the latin persona , meaning mask , especially the type worn by actors or those playing social roles only later did the concept evolve into the roman idea of a bearer of legal rights it s important , therefore , to understand the nature of a legal right a right is a legally enforceable claim personhood is often viewed as a precursor to rights but the converse is much more true one need not be a person in order to have rights one rather needs rights in order to be a person unfortunately , it is not at all clear which rights elevate one to personhood animals , for example , have many different rights they have the right to be protected from cruelty \( unless they are agricultural animals \) the right to sustenance and shelter \( if they are domestic animals \) , the right to adequate habitat \( if they are endangered \) , and the list goes on nevertheless , though corporations and boats are legal persons , for reasons that defy explanation , animals are not past attempts to differentiate humans from animals and thereby explain their disparate treatment before the law have taken many forms some , like descartes , maintained that the difference lay with the capacity for language others based it on intellectual ability , selfconsciousness or basic biology none of these rationales withstands close analysis nonhuman language capability has been conclusively demonstrated in innumerable cases while differentiating based on intellect founders on the existence of cognitively impaired people whose humanity none would deny basic biology is also a thin reed on which to hang one s humanity and claim to personhood to date , no quintessentially human characteristic has emerged to definitively set humans apart from other animals this should not surprise , given that the human genome differs only minimally from that of a roundworm in light of the foregoing , no one definition of person encompasses the range of legal entities with legitimate claims to its mantle however , simply broadening the ambit of personhood will not solve the problem regardless of how wide its scope , personhood will always define itself through contrast with an excluded other it requires those possessing the requisite characteristics to evaluate whether other beings do as well in this sense , even as a broader conception of personhood validates other beings as worthy of moral considerations , it does so by evaluating whether their essence sufficiently resembles our own consequently , any attempt to frame a set of criteria for personhood begins with an inherently speciesist bias one way to address this problem is by doing away with personhood as a dispositive legal category as an umbrella term encompassing a cluster of traits , personhood obfuscates rather than clarifies the issue of moral and legal responsibility any discussion of rights and membership in the legal community would be better served by focusing on the components of the term rather than the term itself different traits demand different entitlements clustering them all beneath the term personhood invites imprecision by contrast , separating the term into components allows the legal system to treat difference differently while still enabling access to the moral community for example , acknowledging that animals have the right to be free from the grotesque exploitation of the industrial food apparatus does not require that we also grant them the right to vote human rights are just that animal rights should be something altogether different recognizing species differences need not mean asserting superiority but rather acknowledging and respecting otherness thus , replacing personhood with a cluster concept of rights offers a point of embarkation to a more coherent and egalitarian approach to our relationships with the nonhuman world at pace , cassuto recent hosted and introduced a highly relevant lecture by steven m wise , a legal scholar focused on animals and rights , titled nonhuman rights to personhood i hope you ll read it , as well cassuto s recent paper , meat animals , humane standards other legal fictions , is relevant , as well , but available online only by subscription
although you applaud the dancers , it s the dances in the triple bill that american ballet theater on tuesday night that haunt you these three superlative , entirely distinct examples of ballet classicism , made between 1947 and 1988 , do much to demonstrate that ballet choreography reached its most diverse and fascinating peaks in the middle of the 20th century the program deserves more performances than the mere four it is receiving this season its centerpiece , frederick ashton s narrative a month in the country , a mainstay of royal ballet repertory since the dance s creation in 1976 , is receiving its ballet theater premiere its overwhelming original cast was led by lynn seymour and by anthony dowell , who has supervised this production the oldest work on the bill is george balanchine s wellknown symphony in c \( 1947 \) , and the youngest is mark morris s drink to me only with thine eyes \( 1988 \) the only serious fault of month is that its ending sentimentalizes the bittersweet turgenev comedy on which it is based but in the movebymove phraseology of its dances , the subtle complexity of its characterizations and the astonishingly judicious musicality with which it matches its score \( john lanchbery s superb arrangement of three pieces for piano and orchestra by chopin \) , it remains an extraordinary and compelling achievement while many exceptional dances have been set to chopin , none match his music as acutely as this one month is a work that extends your idea of what you thought an art form could convey all three dances gain immensely by being seen together compare ! contrast ! symphony in c has long been one of the epitomes of highorthodox ballet classicism the structure is arranged hierarchically in three tiers principals , demisoloists , corps and in four movements , with an entirely new team of dancers for each of the symphony s four movements the idiom is organized in terms of chivalry around female glory men in black tunics and tights serve principally as cavaliers and as background to women who are resplendent in white tutus each movement is a formal realm with a ballerina as galvanizing monarch the brisk , highly charged pointing of a foot and leg the exultant , bowlike arc of a body stretching as a dancer steps grandly offbalance the rhythmic thrill of academic steps as they pronounce the music s beat these are basic ingredients of a heady mix in month , however , it is male beauty and grace , in the single person of the young tutor beliaev , that rattles a largely female household his presence turns three very different women to thoughts of love amid a story told with plenty of naturalistic acting and scenic realism , the formal classicism and intense musicality of the dances turn the drama into high poetry and then there s drink to me only with thine eyes , a work that shows us wonderfully a postmodern view of ballet s sexism yes , only women dance on point , only men lift but the lifted women look no lighter than they are , while in harmonious heterosexual couplings it is the man rather than the woman who extends a straight leg out into the air drink , while deconstructing ballet , makes sheer dancing larkily irresistible because it is new to ballet theater , month deserves special scrutiny julia trevelyan oman s designs look superb in the metropolitan opera house although the color scheme pale blue , white , cream and gray throughout is too pastelpretty , the innumerable horizontal layers of the household interior and the distant garden at once show us a complex world beliaev s duet with the teenage vera is flirtatious an ardent crush on her part , a charming and courteous responsiveness on his but ashton irradiates both of them with the grace of purest classical form , as when both , side by side after tipping forward , raise their arms into the same halo shape above their heads they arrive there on a crucial musical note , and so a passing moment in their relationship shines forth like sunlight on a blossom when beliaev and the maid katia dance together , they 're all brio though their rhythms and steps are close to folk dance , their lines and patterns transform their exuberance into something heartcatchingly intricate and when he dances with the lady of the household , natalia petrovna , the adult ardor of her emotion beams forth in terms of sheer ballet steps , so that even a low lift , in which her extended feet are turned to catch one piano note after another in the music , becomes breathtaking ballet theater s first cast does well victor barbee is superb as natalia petrovna s nondancing husband , yslaev the charm with which he misunderstands what s going on has marvelous weight daniil simkin as their son , kolia \( a role of youthful dance brilliance \) stella abrera as katia and gemma bond as vera are very fine although , as natalia , julie kent looks gaunt and at a few moments does not present her feet and hands with ashtonian line , she catches most facets of this marvelously complex character a chatelaine who loves neither her husband nor her admirer rakitin who finds herself jealous of vera , her ward and whose fullness of amorous reaction to beliaev seems to arise out of sheer boredom as beliaev , roberto bolle dances admirably , and the skill of his partnering is astounding but he s too assertive and too adult he misses the innocence whereby this tutor is repeatedly taken by surprise by the declarations he receives beside him and ms kent , jared matthews as rakitin seems too young for a role that , with little dancing , requires decisive force under ormsby wilkins s conducting , the orchestra played admirably , with gorgeous solo pianism from emily wong i look forward not only to this season s other cast \( led by hee seo and david hallberg \) but also to further ballet theater performances in later seasons soon , please marcelo gomes and , especially , isabella boylston led the admirable drink cast with terrific freshness barbara bilach s onstage playing of virgil thomson s piano pieces was rhythmically infectious david lamarche s conducting helped symphony in c to shine veronika part , despite her tendencies toward facial overemphasis and following the music in solos rather than embodying it , finds one of her most sumptuous roles in its celebrated second movement cory stearns , her partner there , was outstanding , with a glamour and skill not seen in this role since peter martins performed it 30 years ago in the third movement herman cornejo was a jet , a breeze , an eruption
oakland , calif when i lived in new york during the early 1960s , john f kennedy was a hero among the downtown art crowd not because of any legislative or foreign policy achievement , but because he pardoned the jazz pianist hampton hawes hawes was a bebop pianist with a righthand technique so brilliant that he was admired by none other than art tatum , widely considered the greatest jazz pianist ever hawes had been sentenced to 10 years in a fort worth prison for buying drugs from an undercover agent just after my third christmas i was watching john kennedy accept the presidency on the washington steps , hawes wrote later something about him , the voice , the eyes , the way he stood bright and coatless and proud in that cold air i thought , that s the right cat looks like he got some soul and might listen he applied for a pardon , and received one from the president on aug 16 , 1963 democrats have more of an affinity for jazz than republicans even jimmy carter , not everybody s idea of a hipster , invited dizzy gillespie to the white house but among the democrats , president obama is the one who comes closest to the style of bebop called the cool cool jazz is exemplified by the saxophone of lester young and his prot g stan getz the trumpet of miles davis \( especially on his 1957 album birth of the cool \) the vibraphone of milt jackson and the song stylings of billie holiday , sarah vaughan and june christy like the president , cool musicians carried themselves with a regal bearing some members of the generation before them had to engage in minstrellike antics to make a living cool musicians demanded respect , and when attacked did n't blow up , but , like the president , responded stoically one of his favorite words is persistence , the attitude of his hero , the saxophonist sonny rollins , the greatest surviving bebopper for a while in the mid20th century , the cool was everywhere as youngsters in the '50s , my friends and i talked cool , walked cool and dressed cool for us , if you were n't cool , you were hot , square or corny we thought that louis armstrong was too hot and corny , until we read about his dispute with president dwight d eisenhower over school integration armstrong had guts last month i got to see the president of the cool at the san francisco jazz center , a 64 million building that opened earlier this year i am in my second term as its poet laureate , and one of my poems , when i die i will go to jazz , has been installed on one of the building s walls \( in an alley named after hawes s memoir , raise up off me \) , so i was invited to attend the event the pianist who anchored the evening , herbie hancock , is cool he was accompanied by other cool musicians , like the saxophonist joshua redman and the bassist esperanza spalding , who was so engaged in her instrument that she seemed attached to it an added attraction were the sfjazz high school allstars , a group of white , black and asianamerican students one of the graduates , the young flutist elena pinderhughes , performed with the trio and held her own outside , though , it was hot demonstrators against everything from military drones to energy pipelines greeted the president s entourage when it arrived after being introduced , the president just about bounced onto the stage a few days earlier i had heard a commentator say he seemed in the dumps these days that afternoon he was fresh , unruffled in other words , cool \( maybe it was because our state s healthinsurance exchange , covered california , demonstrates how well the affordable care act works when implemented correctly my youngest daughter got a silver plan that drastically reduces her monthly premiums within an hour of applying \) one hallmark of a cool musician , like ms spalding earlier in the evening , is an intensity and focus that lurks underneath the detached exterior the same with mr obama that night he hit repeatedly on his version of the american dream , that if you work hard you can succeed , no matter who you are his recent speeches have abandoned the tough love rhetoric that targeted blacks exclusively he now includes millions of whites in talking about a tangle of pathologies , something the political scientist andrew hacker first noticed in his 1992 book two nations at one point , a member of the audience began heckling mr obama , demanding that he be more aggressive on progressive legislative issues the president replied , without skipping a beat , a lot of people have been saying this lately on every problem just sign an executive order and we can do everything the constitution tells him to do otherwise then the president of the cool left to make a speech in los angeles in 2010 mr obama awarded the national medal of arts and humanities to mr rollins , the saxophonist oftentimes , there is a gulf between the people receiving this medal and the person conferring it what does a president know about theater , or architecture \? not so that day when awarding mr rollins the medal , the president said that his music had helped inspire me , or get me through a tough day , or take risks that i might not otherwise have taken i can dig it an expression that is now considered corny
while the touted and muchdeserving colt , orb , took home the roses in the 139th kentucky derby , many new yorkers understandably leaned toward verrazano , the colt that won the wood memorial at aqueduct in early april they may be forgiven a somewhat provincial affection for a horse named for the bridge over the narrows linking staten island and brooklyn , but the main span of that landmark structure across the gateway to the hudson river and new york s harbor hadn t been completed in 1963 when another horse one named for a small upstate new york town led the field under the wire in the 89th kentucky derby chateaugay , a chestnut son of swaps , was bred in kentucky by the ohio sportsman and real estate magnate john w galbreath at his darby dan farm in lexington , ky galbreath named the colt for the town and nearby lake chateaugay by the canadian border where , years earlier , he was involved in postworld war ii economic development efforts to help revitalize struggling small communities galbreath s business success provided the resources for him to continue to indulge his lifelong love of horses and a quest that , by 1963 , had become a 30year effort to breed and race the finest thoroughbreds in the land chateaugay was galbreath s first kentucky derby entry and the first darby dan homebred to compete in a triple crown race the colt s dam was banquet bell , a daughter of native dancer s sire polynesian , which made him a full brother to galbreath s champion filly , primonetta while not quite as precocious as his older sister , who was undefeated at 2 , chateaugay had notched two wins in five starts as a juvenile before embarking on the triple crown trail in early 1963 trained by james p conway , who was known as jimmy , chateaugay made his way to louisville , ky , by way of a pair of victories in allowance races in florida and kentucky , respectively , followed by a win in the blue grass stakes at keeneland chateaugay s regular rider was braulio baeza , a solemn and slender , 23yearold panamanian who was instantly recognizable by his unfailingly upright , elegant posture in the saddle described by the renowned sports illustrated turf writer whitney tower as wondrously gifted , baeza was as quiet and serious as he was capable in guiding a racehorse he already had a belmont stakes victory to his credit , riding sherluck to spoil carry back s bid for the triple crown in 1961 i recall vividly that my late mother , who was a savvy observer of racing in new york , was a big fan of baeza s riding i m not sure if she admired him for his success on the track , his striking appearance on a horse , his quiet demeanor or all of those qualities , but she instinctively knew back in 1963 that he was a rider worth watching so watch him we did as he piloted chateaugay against a ninehorse derby field that included two other impressive colts from the east coast the 2yearold champion from cain hoy stable never bend with manuel ycaza riding , who won the flamingo stakes at hialeah , and greentree stable s speedster no robbery who d won the wood memorial with john rotz aboard none of those three horses had been defeated that spring , but lining up in the gate with them at churchill downs was candy spots , a solid california invader ridden by bill shoemaker a flashy chestnut with unusual white markings on his rump and gaskin , candy spots was bred and owned by rex c ellsworth , who also bred , owned and raced swaps , the 1955 kentucky derby winner , before he eventually sold the horse as a stallion for 2 million to john galbreath candy spots , who d won both the santa anita and florida derbies that spring , was the heavy favorite at post time in louisville , with no robbery as the second choice , followed by never bend and patrice jacobs s bonjour , winner of the derby trial despite his victory in the blue grass , chateaugay was sent off as the fifth choice at 91 breaking from the inauspicious no 1 post , baeza took chateaugay back early in an effort to save something for the crucial last quartermile , while never bend quickly sprinted to the front no robbery quickly followed , and just behind that pair was an uncharacteristically unruly candy spots , who nearly ran up on no robbery s heels before shoemaker was able to steady and settle him the order remained unchanged through the backstretch , but the maneuvering soon began as horses entered the far turn the pacesetter never bend still held the lead , but no robbery , who was known for bearing out in earlier races , began to tire , while candy spots remained in third cruising along patiently with chateaugay in sixth place , baeza soon swung the colt to the outside on the turn by the time the field hit the quarter pole , baeza had shifted chateaugay into high gear , deftly moving him between horses at the top of the stretch to take aim at never bend gradually wearing him down , chateaugay drew clear of never bend by a length and a quarter at the finish , with candy spots , who never really fired , in third on my honor , a 30 to 1 long shot who had trailed the field , closed swiftly to nab fourth place from no robbery , who faded to fifth with the victory on chateaugay , baeza became the first foreignborn jockey to win the kentucky derby he guided the chestnut back to the infield winner s circle , where the colt promptly showed his disdain for red roses , leaping and wheeling when attempts were made to place the obligatory blanket of flowers over his withers you never forget that , baeza observed when we spoke about his derbywinning experience by phone recently he jumped around , but i stayed on i wasn t going to come off then ! despite his antics , baeza characterized chateaugay as a kind horse , and the colt soon was shipped to pimlico for the preakness stakes memories of that contest prompted the former jockey s only expression of regret about his 1963 triple crown experience as he recalled the blistering onemile workout chateaugay had clocked just two days before the preakness he got away from the rider , baeza lamented he wanted to run back to the barn or something mr galbreath wanted to know if the horse was hurt he wasn t hurt , but we told mr galbreath he wouldn t win he already ran his race , he recalled baeza added since the horse wasn t injured , mr galbreath said we ll run we ran , and he got tired , but we were second chateaugay finished three and onequarter lengths behind candy spots , but the colt firmly redeemed himself three weeks later in the belmont stakes run at aqueduct while the belmont park grandstand was being reconstructed , chateaugay led candy spots by two and onehalf lengths to claim two of the triple crown s three jewels with two more stakes wins added to his stretch of classic victories , chateaugay was named the year s 3yearold champion chateaugay continued to race at ages 4 and 5 , but he never quite regained his earlier form he was retired to stud at darby dan farm , where he sired four stakes winners in his first crop as a stallion in 1971 , he became the first kentucky derby winner to be sent to japan for stud duty he remained in japan from 1972 to 1985 and sired the 1981 japanese 2yearold champion , hokuto flag , before his death there at age 25 baeza s successful career continued through the 1960 s and early 1970 s as he rode numerous champions to victory , including buckpasser , dr fager , and arts and letters , with whom he won his third belmont stakes in 1969 the nation s leading rider in earnings from 1965 through 1969 , baeza was inducted into the national museum of racing s hall of fame in saratoga springs in 1976 , but retired soon after , having amassed 4 , 013 winners during his 21 years in the saddle in panama and the us now 73 and the only surviving member of chateaugay s kentucky derbywinning team , baeza remains active as a racing official at louisiana downs and hialeah park jimmy conway continued to train for darby dan farm until 1966 , when he resumed operation of a public stable active in racing for 38 years until his death in 1984 from illness at age 73 , conway was posthumously inducted into racing s hall of fame in 1996 john w galbreath died in 1988 in ohio at age 90 , but not before celebrating a second kentucky derby win in 1967 with proud clarion , another darby dan homebred in 1974 , galbreath s little current captured the famed preakness trophy that previously had eluded him darby dan farm remains one of the country s preeminent breeding farms under the leadership of galbreath s grandson , john phillips , who continues to race homebreds with his family members under the phillips racing partnership colors phillips characterized his grandfather s reaction to chateaugay s kentucky derby victory as an amazing and wonderful thrill that he shared with the entire family , when we spoke by phone recently he loved horses , and , while he wouldn t necessarily have put it this way , it really marked his graduation into racing s elite it was a fitting accolade that could accurately be applied to all of those connected with chateaugay s decisive derby victory as for my mother , her enthusiasm for baeza s and chateaugay s success took a more colorful and creative turn later that year , when she fashioned a very special halloween costume for her then 9yearold , buddinghorsewoman daughter with riding breeches and boots , a black velvetcovered hunt cap , a dark brown turtleneck sweater and a pale pink almost fawncolored sleeveless blouse all readily available in my closet , my mother cleverly layered the blouse over the turtleneck on the left front panel of the blouse she applied the distinctive interlocked dd logo of darby dan farm that she d meticulously cut out of a patch of chocolate brown ironon fabric i m sure the significance of my lovingly homemade costume that replicated the racing silks of that year s kentucky derbywinning jockey was totally lost on the neighbors whose doorbells i rang that halloween night in 1963 , but my mother and i both knew it was all about chateaugay the horse named for that small town in northern new york his stylish rider , and their big day in may
in the current issue of billboard , at the end of the cover feature on one direction , there is a cooling mist of reality spritzed by , who else , simon cowell , the tv judgeimpresario who helped frankenstein this group into existence on the 2010 season of the british version of the x factor eventually , they probably will split up and maybe want to have their own careers , he said , a statement that most likely sent shivers down the tiny spines of one direction fans but is , of course , merely stating the obvious mr cowell was referring to a corollary of the immutable law of boy bands the band s fans age , but the band generally does not may break that spell almost from the beginning , its members niall horan , zayn malik , liam payne , harry styles and louis tomlinson have seemed older than the job required , even though they are just 19 to 21 and continuing to call one direction a boy band is simply wrong they play the part almost resentfully , with the mien of people who know better they do n't dance , they 're not particularly enthusiastic , and though their disdain is n't palpable , their selfawareness always is whether this is transparent to the squealers that make up the bulk of their fan base is tough to tell the guys are pretty , and maybe that is enough the credibility of that theory is certainly boosted by the fact that one direction is easily among the least musically adventurous acts on the pop charts , and among the least sonically ambitious boy bands that phrase again in recent memory midnight memories \( syco columbia \) is its third album , and it establishes how little it takes to keep a global pop phenomenon moving in the case of one direction , which became a tumblr phenomenon in the wake of its x factor success , and which has had only a handful of genuine hits , not only does demand outpace supply , it may require almost no supply at all so it s fine , in a way , if midnight memories is uninteresting \( though it s not as blank as the group s last album , take me home \) it need only be amiable and keep the flame lit maybe the blankness is a strategy think of what these songs need to accomplish they need to give each of the five men a showcase \( unlike other boy bands ahem this one does n't have a blatant frontman , though mr styles and mr malik come close \) , and they need to cast a wide enough net to avoid alienating anyone already along for the ride unlike new kids on the block , or 'nsync or take that , one direction makes music that does n't feel of the moment the closest it comes to being on trend is the excellent single story of my life , which is a clear stepchild to mumford sons' powerfolk an odd choice for carpetbagging , though a riskless one , as opposed to opting for a dancemusic or hiphop makeover \( the sound also gets a workout on through the dark \) what story of my life has is scale , and for a group that practically leapfrogged into arenas , scale matters it also matters for a group comprising singers whose voices are various gradations of thin they 're good , and sometimes better than that , but none are robust \( there s a reason none of them made the original x factor cut as solo singers \) this album is produced largely by he produced the better songs on take me home and john ryan , who are deft in the way they create sturdy sketches that do n't ask much of the guys or their lyrics , for that matter with a couple of exceptions , this is a dimly written album there are love songs , natch , and there are a couple of songs about the state of crazy the group lives in do n't forget where you belong and the title track , with the comic lyric people talk ssshhhh but we do n't listen most troubling , in a couple of places the lyrics veer toward the seedy , which is probably far more reflective of the group members' perspective on their fame than anything else on this album i know you want , know you want to take it slow but think about all the places we could go if you give in tonight so go the opening bars of why do n't we go there on happily , the message is darker \( even if the music is n't \) it s 4 am and i know that you 're with him i wonder if he knows that i 've touched your skin \( oddly , the three bonus tracks on the deluxe edition are more affecting than almost everything on the actual album , especially the stark half a heart \) these are the sentiments of five young men yearning to breathe free , and yet , according to billboard , one direction has signed a new contract for an additional three albums it s doubling down on its future as a unit maybe it is betting on a few more years of evergreen demand , or on the power of inertia after all , it has n't taken much to stoke interest thus far , and one direction seems to understand that best song ever is the biggest hit from this album it s an implicit commentary on how each generation looks for its own best song , just as all the generations before it did the slot is always there for the taking it almost does n't matter what fills it the guys seem to be winking in the chorus , where they sing , i think it went oh , oh , oh' i think it went yeah , yeah , yeah' that s all it takes , no \?
the nhl returned over the weekend to soldout arenas and record openingday television audiences it also returned to fighting the first 21 games featured 12 fights , including three that took place within the first two seconds of the opening faceoff on monday afternoon on long island , matt martin of the islanders with b j crombeen of tampa bay , the islanders' joe finley fought pierrecedric labrie both fights took place a second after the opening draw on sunday night at the ' home opener , arron asham fought pittsburgh s tanner glass began they stood toetotoe for nearly a minute , throwing 45 punches and landing 20 , according  none of the three fights were in retaliation for a previous collision or to protect a star player the players involved , all frequent fighters , were inserted into the opening lineup by their coaches once on the ice , they simply asked each other and then dropped their gloves and they were frank about it afterward i asked him when we lined up , he agreed , and away we went , asham said all fights are to try and get your bench going , get the crowd into it martin said pretty much the same thing we saw what their starting lineup was before we went on the ice , and me and fins wanted to get the crowd going early , he said of finley i think we did a good job of that calls to curtail fighting came from many quarters after the may 2011 death of from an overdose of alcohol and painkillers , and after the apparent suicides of two other players who fought frequently subsequent research showed that boogaard , like other deceased nhl players whose brains were studied , that scientists concluded was caused by repeated blows to the head the nhl has said no link between fighting and brain trauma has been proved , and players and league officials both maintain that fighting is an integral part of the game still , in recent seasons the league toughened rules against checks to the head in an effort to reduce concussions , and it brought in a respected former player , brendan shanahan , to administer tighter discipline against players who commit dangerous fouls but the league has long maintained that it penalizes fighting enough with fiveminute majors , game misconducts and supplementary discipline a fight that starts before the opening faceoff or after the end of the game triggers heavy fines against teams and potential suspensions for the coaches and players involved the players have resisted rules that sharply curtail fighting because such measures would cost certain players their jobs , and because they largely contend that fighters police the game and prevent greater mayhem from breaking out in 2009 , nhl general managers made a modest effort to curtail staged fights like the ashamglass bout , recommending an additional 10minute misconduct if a fight took place right after a faceoff but the players' union shot down the measure on monday , the nhl and the players' association declined to respond to questions about whether new measures against staged fights would be considered the collective bargaining agreement reached earlier this month includes a new joint health and safety committee , which will have equal representation from the nhl and the nhlpa and will have an advisory role nothing in the agreement pertains specifically to fighting commissioner gary bettman has pointed out that fighting over all is steadily declining under coach john tortorella , though , the rangers have gained a reputation for their snarl they had 62 fighting majors in 201011 and led the nhl with 65 fighting majors last season nine of those came from fights that took place within the first 10 seconds of the opening faceoff , including a line brawl three seconds into , in which three fights broke out simultaneously this season the rangers have had three fights in two games one included asham , 34 , whom the rangers signed from pittsburgh in the offseason he now has 91 nhl regularseason fights i do n't expect him to be a saint , tortorella said before asham s rangers debut sunday after a , asham was about the only player tortorella praised high marks for ash , he said when a player does something like that , as long as he did that , the other guys need to feed off that and do their thing and that has not happened glass s version of what happened might have been more revealing of prevailing attitudes i just said hi' to him at the faceoff , glass told pittsburgh reporters i squared off against him he said , do you want to do this \? ' i said , sure' he said , good luck , ' glass said i like when a guy does that
khost , afghanistan the poet guided a strip of sheet metal into the ancient steel clippers , cutting shimmering triangles that fell with a dull clang on the shop floor in the background , a workman s chorus filled the yard a handsaw planing a log beam a generator humming and catching the groan of a giant diesel truck idling the harsh music of the workday welled up around matiullah turab , one of afghanistan s most famous pashtun poets , in the garage where he earns a living repairing the colorful pakistani caravan trucks that transport goods around the countryside the cadence of his nights , though , is his own shaping poetry as hard and piercing as the tools he uses by day nature and romance carry no interest for him a poet s job is not to write about love , he growled , his booming voice blending with the ambient noise of the workshop a poet s job is not to write about flowers a poet must write about the plight and pain of the people with his unflinching words , mr turab , 44 , offers a voice for afghans grown cynical about the war and its perpetrators the americans , the taliban , the afghan government , pakistan taped versions of mr turab s poems spread virally , especially among his fellow ethnic pashtuns , whom he unabashedly champions a tribal affinity that alienates some tajik and hazara listeners his close affiliation with hezbiislami part islamist political party , part militant group has put off others but even as his social affiliations are narrow and divisive , his poetry has mass appeal mr turab reserves his charity for ordinary afghans , weighed down by the grinding corruption and disappointment that have come to define the last decade of their lives many see his poems , some of which were translated from pashto for the new york times by mujib mashal , as a counter to the daily spin showered on afghans by the government , diplomats , religious leaders and the media seated on a makeshift bench , his wool pakol hat tilted slightly and his clothing stained with grease , mr turab surveyed the evening beyond his concrete workshop bay , a landscape of rags , wires and waste the squalid heat was broken intermittently by a standing fan connected to a car battery a neighboring vendor hammered a glacier of ice , cleaving chunks to sell to drivers passing by there is no genuine politician in afghanistan , he said , briefly cracking a rare smile as far as i know , politicians need the support of the people , and none of these politicians have that for me , they are like the shareholders of a business they only think of themselves and their profit he continued the taliban are not the solution , either gone are those old days when the taliban way of governing worked he has no patience for preciousness in his own work or in others' , and he is particularly merciless with government officials he ridicules them , saying they should stitch three pockets into their jackets one to collect afghanis , one for dollars and a third for pakistani rupees for all that disdain , however , mr turab has remained popular in influential corners of the government and president hamid karzai recently invited him to the presidential palace in kabul the president liked my poetry and told me i had an excellent voice , but i do n't know why , he said i criticized him in fact , he is quite widely in demand though he prefers to be home in khost , mr turab s travel schedule still far outpaces the average metalsmith s people flock to his rare personal readings , and new poems posted on youtube quickly become among the mostwatched by afghans he is planning a trip to moscow soon to receive an award from members of the afghan diaspora there and he visits the governor of paktia , a friend , to perform on occasion mr turab is the latest in a long roll call of poets cherished in afghanistan , among the most famous of them rumi , the sufi mystic whose works of love and faith remain popular across the world in this country , poetic aphorisms are woven into everyday talk , embraced by afghans from all walks of life in pockets of kabul , it is not uncommon to see men bunched together as they transfer audio files of readings over bluetooth from one cellphone to another though poetry is loved , it seldom pays some writers have taken government jobs , finding the steady paycheck and modest responsibilities conducive to their work mr turab , for his part , has stuck to his dingy garage on the outskirts of khost city this is my life , what you see here banging iron , cutting it short , making it long , he said i still do n't call myself a poet there is something else , which even the plainspoken mr turab seemed reluctant to confess he is nearly illiterate though he can , with difficulty , read printed copy , he can neither write nor read the handwriting of others , he said he constructs his poetry in his head , relying on memory to retain it and others to record it mr turab grew up in a small village of nangarhar province , poor even by afghan standards his father was a farmer , and grew just enough to feed the family though they had little , he fondly remembers his youth particularly the days spent learning from the village poet , a man he grew to love for his sharp words and honesty after the soviet invasion in 1979 , mr turab , a teenager at the time , moved with his family to pakistan he came of age there , returning to afghanistan only two decades later , with a trade , a wife and a modest following as a poet he kept refining his craft after his return , cultivating a broader audience under taliban rule , he dared to publish a book of his work a grave mistake the taliban beat me very badly , he said , shaking his head , then proffering a smile after that , i decided publishing was n't such a good idea though he is an unabashed pashtun loyalist , he has no love for the taliban , who are closely identified with pashtun tribes he says he loathes the terror they cultivate and the way they have destabilized afghanistan and he excoriates them , for being as inept and out of touch as the westernbacked government the dirt road outside his shop runs all the way to pakistan , and its traffic is an economic lifeline vendors line the highway , selling everything from snow to keep the blistering heat at bay to seasonal fruit periodically a convoy of american vehicles passes , breaking the spell of an otherwise afghan scene sometimes i'm amazed that things are n't falling apart , he said , clasping his hands together as he reflected on years of war and foreign presence here but then i realize there is a social law here that holds the country together , even if there is no governmental law though he has been critical of the american occupation , he does note the progress that has come with it roads , electricity and schools it is other parts of the western legacy in afghanistan that he worries about democracy will hurt and eliminate our tribal laws , he said the medicine prescribed by democracy was not suitable for this society s sickness
s o paulo , brazil shaken by the biggest challenge to their authority in years , brazil s leaders made conciliatory gestures on tuesday to try to defuse the protests engulfing the nation s cities but the demonstrators remained defiant , pouring into the streets by the thousands and venting their anger over political corruption , the high cost of living and huge public spending for the world cup and the olympics in a convulsion that has caught many in brazil and beyond by surprise , waves of protesters denounced their leaders for dedicating so many resources to cultivating brazil s global image by building stadiums for international events , when basic services like education and health care remain woefully inadequate i love soccer , but we need schools , said evaldir cardoso , 48 , a fireman at a protest here with his 7monthold son the demonstrations initially began with a fury over a hike in bus fares , but as with many other protest movements in recent years in tunisia , egypt or , most recently , turkey they quickly evolved into a much broader condemnation of the government by the time politicians in several cities backed down on tuesday and announced that they would cut or consider reducing fares , the demonstrations had already morphed into a more sweeping social protest , with marchers waving banners carrying slogans like the people have awakened it all seemed so wonderful in the brazil oasis , and suddenly we are reliving the demonstrations of tahrir square in cairo , so suddenly , without warning , without a crescendo , said eliane cantanh de , a columnist for the newspaper folha de s o paulo we were all caught by surprise from paradise , we have slipped at least into limbo what is happening in brazil \? thousands gathered at s o paulo s main cathedral and made their way to the mayor s office , where a small group smashed windows and tried to break in , forcing guards to withdraw in juazeiro do norte , demonstrators cornered the mayor inside a bank for hours and called for his impeachment , while thousands of others protested teachers' salaries in rio de janeiro , thousands protested in a gritty area far from the city s upscale seaside districts in other cities , demonstrators blocked roads , barged into city council meetings or interrupted sessions of local lawmakers , clapping loudly and sometimes taking over the microphone the protests rank among the largest outpourings of dissent since the nation s military dictatorship ended in 1985 after a harsh police crackdown last week fueled anger and swelled protests , president dilma rousseff , a former guerrilla who was imprisoned under the dictatorship and has now become the target of pointed criticism herself , tried to appease dissenters by embracing their cause on tuesday these voices , which go beyond traditional mechanisms , political parties and the media itself , need to be heard , ms rousseff said the greatness of yesterday s demonstrations were proof of the energy of our democracy her tone stood in sharp contrast to the approach adopted by turkey , where similar demonstrations over what might also have seemed an isolated issue the fate of a city park in istanbul quickly escalated into a broad rejection of the government s legitimacy from a vocal section of the population but while turkey s prime minister has dismissed the protesters as terrorists , vandals and bums , ms rousseff seemed acutely aware of the breadth of frustration in brazil over the gap between the nation s global aspirations and the reality for many millions of its people the protests in brazil are unfolding just as its long and heralded economic boom may be coming to an end the economy has slowed to a pale shadow of its growth in recent years inflation is high , the currency is declining sharply against the dollar but the expectations of brazilians have rarely been higher , feeding broad intolerance with corruption , bad schools and other government failings these protests are in favor of common sense , said roberto da matta , a leading cultural commentator we pay an absurd amount of taxes in brazil , and now more people are questioning what they get in return one of ms rousseff s senior aides said tuesday that tax measures already adopted by the authorities would allow s o paulo to lower bus fares considerably , though it was unclear whether the concession was too late and too limited to derail the protest movement one of the major complaints among demonstrators is government corruption , as evidenced by the trial involving senior figures in the governing workers party in one of brazil s largest political scandals in recent memory none of the officials sentenced in the trials has yet gone to prison , despite the prosecution s contention that they should have begun serving their sentences immediately after the high court announced them in november we 're furious about what our political leaders do , their corruption , said enderson dos santos , 35 , an office worker protesting in s o paulo i'm here to show my children that brazil has woken up some of the stadiums being built for the world cup soccer tournament , scheduled for next year , have also been criticized for delays and cost overruns , and have become subjects of derision as protesters question whether they will become white elephants one in manaus , the largest city in the amazon , will have capacity for 43 , 000 , but it is in a city where average attendance at professional soccer games stands at fewer than 600 fans government institutions seem prepared to continue plowing public funds into the projects a brazilian newspaper reported tuesday that the national development bank had approved a new loan of about 200 million for itaquer o , a new stadium in s o paulo that is expected to host the opening match of the world cup when you see the investments in health and education and then you compare that to the massive investments to carry out the world cup , it is clear that this provokes a certain indignation , said ad o cl vis martins dos santos , a sociologist at catholic university in porto alegre but near avenida paulista , s o paulo s most prominent thoroughfare , the scene was festive some protesters sipped cans of beer marijuana smoke emanated from parts of the crowd many painted stripes on their faces with green and yellow paint , the colors of the brazilian flag people are going hungry and the government builds stadiums , said eleuntina scuilgaro , an 83yearold pensioner at the protests here in s o paulo i'm here for my granddaughters if you 're tired , go home , take a shower and return that s what i'm doing
for many years the basic formula for deciding who would win the most valuable player award came down to the triple crown statistics batting average , home run and runs batted in and the record of the player s team there were occasional exceptions , but if a player had 140 rbi for a firstplace team , he had a good chance of receiving major league baseball s highest singleseason honor last year , mike trout , the los angeles angels' phenom , changed the way people discussed the award he may have fallen short of miguel cabrera in terms of the triple crown statistics , and ultimately short of the award , but his base running and defense were so far superior , the idea that he deserved mvp consideration became commonly accepted in the american league this year a similar situation exists in the national league but with far less fanfare the league has two obvious contenders andrew mccutchen , the veteran leader of the surprising pittsburgh pirates and clayton kershaw , the ace of the los angeles dodgers pitching staff but a third player deserving of consideration is hiding in plain sight carlos gomez , the slickfielding center fielder for the  minnesota twins fans would be forgiven if they dismissed the idea out of hand that gomez , who tantalized and frustrated in his tenure there , could have morphed into one of baseball s elite players but in a weak year for mvp candidates , gomez has a lot going for him \( that kershaw is drawing consideration shows that voters are not in love with anyone because starting pitchers have a rough road to winning the award \) the case for gomez , whose lapses in concentration once tormented his twins manager , ron gardenhire , begins with his defense trout earned raves for his fielding last season , and had 21 defensive runs saved in 139 games , according to in 115 games this season , gomez had 28 defensive runs saved , tops among major league outfielders , piling them on with sensational catches this is nothing new as gomez had accumulated 75 in his 7 seasons , which trails only brett gardner of the yankees in that time the difference for gomez over the last two seasons is that he is no longer just a defensive whiz compare his numbers on offense and defense with mccutchen s and gomez does fairly well mccutchen has a large edge in batting average and onbase percentage through friday , but gomez led in triples \( 9 \) , home runs \( 18 \) , slugging percentage \( 515 \) and stolen bases \( 30 \) and had a huge edge in defensive runs saved \( 28 to 7 \) in all , the numbers produce 65 wins above replacement for gomez and 68 for mccutchen the only position players in the majors who rank higher in war are trout and cabrera the truly remarkable thing is that doug melvin , the brewers' general manager , seemingly saw this coming after gomez hit a careerhigh 19 home runs last season , melvin signed him to a threeyear contract extension for 24 million at the time , the figure seemed high for a player who still had problems getting on base and continually made errors in judgment but as measured by fangraphs' formula for determining a player s worth in dollars , gomez s 2013 season has been worth 288 million and the contract extension does not even begin until 2014 the value the brewers are getting from gomez should be a bit unsettling for mets fans gomez came up through the mets' system but was traded to minnesota for johan santana while gomez has finally blossomed , and is a steal at a salary of 43 million , santana is making 255 million , the secondhighest salary in baseball , despite being shelved for the season with shoulder problems unfortunately for gomez , the brewers are terrible this season , and have become a bit of a circus as their franchise player , ryan braun , was suspended for the remainder of the season as part of mlb s biogenesis investigation as good as gomez has been , and as much as attitudes have changed about the way the game is evaluated , the chances of a player on a team flirting with last place getting an mvp award are slim to none mccutchen helping return the pirates to relevance and kershaw s dominance will be remembered for years they are each deserving of the top spot but when the baseball writers fill out their ballots , gomez deserves consideration
the architect behind the expansion of the kimbell art museum in fort worth is so famous that his name has been affixed to the project like a brand the addition , which will be unveiled on wednesday , is called the renzo piano pavilion over nearly 50 years , mr piano has designed notable buildings like the pompidou center in paris and the modern wing of the art institute of chicago , and his association with texas institutions of fine art dates back more than a quartercentury to his 1987 menil collection in houston eight years later , he designed the cy twombly gallery in the same city and in 2003 his nasher sculpture center opened in dallas \( some 1 , 400 miles away , he designed the headquarters building of the new york times \) but the 135 million piano pavilion is , perhaps , mr piano s most subtly ambitious texas work to date in part because the structure was commissioned to serve one of the most revered museum buildings in the country , designed by the american architect louis i kahn the piano pavilion will be the main location for visiting exhibitions and the museum s asian art collection it also contains a 298seat auditorium mr piano s pavilion design aims to complement kahn s monumental modernist aesthetic , his fondness for concrete and his emphasis on light i understood that we needed to create a dialogue between the two buildings , mr piano wrote in an email what mr piano s pavilion adds to the conversation is a stress on contemporary sustainability practices the kahn building is famous for its natural light , mr piano said but that was a natural lighting system designed in the late 60s and 70s technologies have advanced considerably since then we needed to capitalize on the new technologies and make a design that is more flexible and responsive to the issues of today , like sustainability designing for energy savings is not an add on , mr piano said in an october kimbell art museum publicity release , but , rather , the proper way to build he set threequarters of the 101 , 130squarefoot building below ground though the decision was driven by mr piano s desire not to overpower mr kahn s masterpiece , having a huge amount of the museum program underground increases its energy efficiency as we only send daylight into the areas where the public actually goes , said andy klemmer , president of paratus group , the pavilion s project director the pavilion s roof has fritted glass and fabric scrims , over which lies a network of aluminum mechanical louvers , or slats , that open and close to control and diffuse the amount of light let into the museum the evenly distributed natural light cuts down on how much electricity the kimbell might otherwise use to illuminate the gallery spaces moreover the tops of those aluminum louvers are covered with photovoltaic cells , or solar panels , that harvest sunlight to generate electricity for the museum the solar cells produce the energy to illuminate the building at night , mark carroll , the pavilion s lead architect and partner with the renzo piano building workshop , wrote in an email on the ground , mr piano and his team have installed 36 geothermal wells , each one 460 feet deep , to harness the more stable temperature of the ground water to heat and cool the building the galleries white oak plank floors \( with quarterinch gaps between the floor boards \) are made to be breathable , allowing lowvelocity air to circulate throughout the pavilion the airdisplacement system uses less energy , and air is sent only where there are people finally , there is the 19 , 200squarefoot green sod roof covering the museum s western pavilion it insulates the building from both the sun and the cold and unlike from a traditional roof , you will avoid lots of wasteful rainwater runoff into a nearby gutter , said kathryn holliday , director of the david dillon center for texas architecture at the university of texas at arlington of course the roof also scores aesthetic points the roof is done in such a beautiful , sculptural way , said carlos jim nez , a professor of architecture at rice university it is more like an impeccable green tapestry because of mr piano s many green choices mr klemmer says that the piano pavilion will need only half the energy per square foot required to run the nearby kimbell piano firmly set out the environmental goal of this new building to make it as carbonneutral as possible , and to wring every bit of energy efficiency out of it , while still providing natural light and a great place to view art , mr klemmer said what we ve finally created is the most energyefficient art museum piano has ever designed by a long shot as impressive as that is , the kimbell art museum director , eric m lee , is most proud of the fact that none of mr piano s environmental features intrude on the sheer beauty of his latest texas museum i m thrilled at how renzo built into the kimbell his concern for building green , as , in 2013 , i don t think you can construct a museum without building it green , mr lee said but even better is that none of these green aspects have compromised the new building s stunning visual appeal in fact , so many of our works of art , especially from our african , precolumbian and asian collections , positively sing in the new piano building and mr kahn s original kimbell museum building , just 65 yards to the east , positively sings outside and across from it
munsan , south korea as lee jaeeun retrieved her squirming twins from day care and loaded them into a twoseat stroller , she barely glanced up at the olive green blackhawk helicopter that swept overhead , just above the highrise apartment buildings even in peaceful times , lowflying military aircraft are a common sight in this residential community near the heavily fortified border that separates capitalist south korea from the communist north but these are not placid times , and the roaring helicopters are one more reminder of rising tensions wrought by s recent barrage of war threats still , said ms lee , a 34yearold homemaker , residents have resigned themselves to living with the constant risk , and occasional tantrums , from their bellicose northern neighbor sure , our radar is up to new danger , she said , holding one of her yearold daughters and surrounded by other mothers picking up their children but living here makes you used to it it s not such a big deal in recent weeks , the heavily armed north s cherubfaced young leader , , has threatened south korea and the united states with nuclear attack , declaring that a state of war exists on the korean peninsula refusing to be cowed , south korea s newly elected president , park geunhye , the democratic nation s first female leader , responded by if provoked despite the steady drumbeat of war talk , life seems to go on as usual in most of south korea , the industrial powerhouse that lifted itself from the ashes of the 195053 korean war to become one of asia s economic success stories nowhere is the determination to hold on to the south s hardwon middleclass living standards more apparent than in munsan , a distant suburb of the south korean capital of seoul that sits on the edge of the tense border the demilitarized zone , or dmz , which lies where the fighting stopped 60 years ago once a collection of farming villages known for their local delicacy of tasty eel , munsan was transformed into a boomtown of tall white apartment buildings and neonlighted shops a decade ago during an era of political rapprochement with the north and soaring property prices in the fastgrowing south more recently , development has slowed after the global financial crisis hurt the south s exportdriven economy and new tensions with the north have scared away some prospective buyers some of the 47 , 000 residents who live here now say they have learned to accept the helicopters' nearconstant rattling of their windows , and the columns of tanks that sometimes block roads during training exercises , making their children late for school they say they have also learned how to ignore the rows of concrete bunkers and guard towers along the highway they use every morning to commute to seoul , 35 miles to the south they just tune out the dangers and focus on enjoying their daily lives korea is the most dangerous place in the world , but we are numb to it , said song hyunyoung , an employee in the real estate department of paju city hall , which has jurisdiction over the town of munsan if something happens , we will all die together , so i do n't really think about it when pressed , many residents admit to feeling anxiety about the intensity of the north s most recent threats , and the fact that its nuclear arsenal is controlled by an untested , unpredictable leader some also partly blame their own country for imposing sanctions on the north , a closed and impoverished country to be honest , the talk of nuclear attack is much scarier this time , said ms lee , the mother of the twins i think north korea is cornered , and anyone who is cornered will strike back responding to such concerns , paju city employees held an evacuation drill last week with the police , firefighters and the army in the event of an attack , residents would be led to one of nine underground bomb shelters that the city built after the north s last violent provocation , the artillery bombardment of a south korean island three years ago that killed two civilians the shelters have been freshly stocked with flashlights , medicine , gas masks and firstaid kits , officials said but most residents have not taken similar precautions none of the more than halfdozen residents interviewed said they were stockpiling food or supplies many said they were optimistic that such preparations were unnecessary they were confident , they said , that the bonds of shared ethnicity between the two koreas would prevail over political differences , and prevent the north from following through on its apocalyptic threats the world thinks we are on the brink of war , but we are fine , said gong soonhee , 55 , a real estate agent whose small office was filled with wallsize maps showing a checkerboard of privately owned plots that abruptly end at the edge of the dmz , just a few miles away koreans are good people , kind people , not stupid people who would just start a war suddenly despite the tensions , ms gong said , new homebuyers continue to trickle in , lured by prices that have dropped to less than onetenth of those in central seoul most give no sign of noticing a formation of helicopters flying overhead as they check out apartments , she said i guess we could hide in an underground parking garage if the shells start falling , she said , but we do n't bother with escape plans others said the current standoff cast a spotlight on the fact that in the face of the north s threats , the south was in the weaker position because it had so much more to lose some said south korea s biggest vulnerability was its unwillingness to sacrifice its much higher living standards , a sentiment that would make essentially buying off the north an easier option if this is just going to continue until we give aid , then let s just give them some aid , park soonyi , a 44yearold homemaker , said with a laugh but she was only halfjoking , as she shopped in the upmarket hillstate highrise condominium and retail complex then they 'll be quiet , and leave us in peace
washington the justice department for the first time has notified a criminal defendant that evidence being used against him came from a warrantless wiretap , a move that is expected to set up a supreme court test of whether such eavesdropping is constitutional prosecutors late friday in the case of jamshid muhtorov , who was charged in colorado in january 2012 with providing material support to the islamic jihad union , a designated terrorist organization based in uzbekistan mr muhtorov is accused of planning to travel abroad to join the militants and has pleaded not guilty a showed that much of the government s case was based on intercepted emails and phone calls the government s notice allows mr muhtorov s lawyer to ask a court to suppress the evidence by arguing that it derived from unconstitutional surveillance , setting in motion judicial review of the eavesdropping the new york times that the decision by prosecutors to notify a defendant about the wiretapping followed a legal policy debate inside the justice department the debate began in june when solicitor general donald b verrilli jr discovered that the department s national security division did not notify criminal defendants when eavesdropping without a warrant was an early link in an investigative chain that led to evidence used in court as a result , none of the defendants knew that they had the right to challenge the warrantless wiretapping law the practice contradicted last year in a case challenging the law , the fisa amendments act of 2008 legalizing a form of the bush administration s program of warrantless surveillance , the law authorized the government to wiretap americans' emails and phone calls without an individual court order and on domestic soil so long as the surveillance is targeted at a foreigner abroad a group of plaintiffs led by amnesty international had challenged the law as unconstitutional but mr verrilli last year urged the supreme court to dismiss the case because those plaintiffs could not prove that they had been wiretapped in making that argument , he said a defendant who faced evidence derived from the law would have proper legal standing and would be notified , so dismissing the lawsuit by amnesty international would not close the door to judicial review of the 2008 law the court accepted that logic , voting 5to4 to dismiss the case in a statement , patrick toomey , staff attorney with the american civil liberties union , which had represented amnesty international and the other plaintiffs , hailed the move but criticized the justice department s prior practice we welcome the government s belated recognition that it must give notice to criminal defendants who it has monitored under the most sweeping surveillance law ever passed by congress , mr toomey said by withholding notice , the government has avoided judicial review of its dragnet warrantless wiretapping program for five years the justice department change traces back to june , when the times that prosecutors in fort lauderdale and chicago had told plaintiffs they did not need to say whether evidence in their cases derived from warrantless wiretapping , in conflict with what the justice department had told the supreme court after reading the article , mr verrilli sought an explanation from the national security division , whose lawyers had vetted his briefs and helped him practice for his arguments , according to officials with knowledge of the internal deliberations it was only then that he learned of the division s practice of narrowly interpreting its need to notify defendants of evidence derived from warrantless wiretapping there ensued a wider debate throughout june and july , the officials said national security prosecutors raised operational concerns disclosing more to defendants could tip off a foreign target that his communications were being monitored , so intelligence officials might become reluctant to share crucial information that might create problems in a later trial mr verrilli was said to have argued that there was no legal basis to conceal from defendants that the evidence derived from legally untested surveillance , preventing them from knowing they had an opportunity to challenge it ultimately , his view prevailed and the national security division changed its practice going forward , leading to the new filing on friday in mr muhtorov s case still , it remains unclear how many other cases including closed matters in which convicts are already service prison sentences involved evidence derived from warrantless wiretapping in which the national security division did not provide full notice to defendants , nor whether the department will belatedly notify them such a notice could lead to efforts to reopen those cases
washington if adopts the most farreaching recommendations of the advisory group he set up to rein in the , much would change underneath the giant antennas that sprout over fort meade , md , where america s electronic spies and cyberwarriors have operated with an unprecedented amount of freedom since the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks no longer would a team of two dozen or so agency analysts be able to type into a computer that there was a reasonable , articulable suspicion about the person behind an american telephone number and , in seconds , see every call made to and from that phone followed by the same records for hundreds or thousands of their contacts instead , an individual court order would have to be obtained a far slower process that , just months ago , mr obama s intelligence team insisted would be too cumbersome in halting attacks on the same guarded campus , military and civilian computer hackers working for the united states cyber command would be barred from using one of the most important building blocks of their growing arsenal of sophisticated cyberweapons every day they exploit previously unknown flaws in computer programs , known in the industry as zerodays , to conduct both surveillance and attacks a handful of such flaws named for the fact that they have been known to the world for zero days , and thus cannot be defended against were central to attacking iran s nuclear plant at natanz already , critics of the advisory report have called it a form of unilateral disarmament bad idea , said james lewis , the cyberexpert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington we 'd be the only country in the world to knock ourselves out of the market the chinese , the russians , the iranians , every criminal gang would still be out there developing attacks with these flaws for mr obama who in the past five years has grown dependent on the nsa for countering terrorist threats , and dependent on cyber command for buying time to deal with iran and other longterm adversaries the choices he makes in the next few weeks may well define america s approach to national security long after his term is over but it is a major balancing act between a security system that he has come to depend on and principles of privacy that he has said are dear to him one of the five experts in the advisory group , michael morell , says the task is possible we are not in any way recommending the disarming of the intelligence community , said mr morell , who retired over the summer as deputy director of the cia but that is different from saying the choices are cost free both of these have operational impact there is no question about that , michael hayden , a former director of both the nsa and the cia , said thursday for sure , there are other values than just intelligence collection those may be worth it but there is no doubt that this will make the collection of intelligence slower and more difficult the advisory group is not the only one weighing and shaping mr obama s choices his top counterterrorism aide , lisa monaco , is briefing him regularly about an interagency review that deals with many of the same issues as the outside advisory group not all of their recommendations were things we had focused on , and not everything we are focusing on in our review is necessarily addressed in their report , a senior administration official said thursday the administration expects to accept a good number of the advisory group recommendations , the official said , and will perhaps reject others while few in the white house want to admit as much in public , none of this would have happened without the revelations by edward j snowden , the former nsa contractor now in asylum in russia while mr obama has said he welcomes the debate about the proper limits on the nsa , it is not one he engaged in publicly until the snowden revelations began now the president has little choice this week alone a constellation of forces is pushing for change a federal judge called the bulkcollection program almost orwellian , while some in congress , many of his allies and silicon valley executives demanded change those represent very different pressures mr obama has already said that bulk collection of telephone records should continue the unresolved question is whether he agrees with the advisory committee that the records should remain in private hands either the telecommunications companies or a private consortium and that individual court authorizations should be required for every use of metadata while mr obama can deal with some of those issues by executive order , others would doubtless require congressional action and even his own party is deeply divided about how much leeway the nsa should have mr obama has already acted on another recommendation , albeit quietly the nsa and the director of national intelligence are no longer able to monitor the cellphones and emails of leaders of other nations without white house approval that does not mean no national leaders will be tapped as said thursday on msnbc s morning joe , they are the ones we should be listening to but now that one such operation has blown up in the nsa s hands the monitoring of chancellor angela merkel of germany mr obama has begun to weigh their potential benefits against the huge diplomatic and economic costs if they are exposed the president has made it clear he never wants to be blindsided by one of these again , one of his aides said under the advisory group s proposal he would not be he would have to approve such operations the president is also the one who must approve the use of cyberweapons gen keith alexander , who leads both the nsa and cyber command , said there were only a handful or less such attacks conducted by the united states but designing the stealthiest cyberweapons occupies thousands of specialists and costs billions of dollars the pressure to rein them in is coming from industry , which fears that the nsa s abilities to crack data encryption and bore into foreign computer systems and the cloud will scare away business across europe and asia mr obama must now make a choice to keep building the world s most sophisticated cyberarsenal , or pare back for fear of harming american competitiveness
if texas' lessthantheatrical 83rd legislative session is remembered at all , it will be known for accords , not discord lawmakers put down their partisan swords to expand financing for water infrastructure , women s health , public education and the mentally ill , steering almost entirely clear of bitter ideological battles over enforcement and abortion the state s republican majority pulled its weight in a few major areas passing legislation requiring drug screening for unemployment benefits and blocking measures opening the door for an expansion of , the joint state and federal health care program for children , the disabled and the very poor , under the federal  but republicans themselves warded off some of the session s most anticipated battles , like senator dan patrick s school choice effort to finance scholarships so public school students could attend private schools and house speaker joe straus s reluctance to tackle redistricting though gov rick perry , lt gov david dewhurst and attorney general greg abbott wanted to was an effort to keep democrats in the fold that effort seems unlikely to last if the governor calls legislators into a special session on the issue indeed , many of the lawmakers' hardestfought initiatives this session preventing wrongful convictions and prosecutorial misconduct , overhauling high school diploma requirements and highstakes testing , and curbing the authority of regents of the state s public university systems did not fall along party lines behind the curtain , there were many forces at play a more robust state budget the biggest freshman class in years a republican base just small enough to require allegiances with democrats or the , depending on the issue and the soontoberevealed political aspirations of mr perry , along with the chessboard of elected officials waiting for him to make his move in many ways , the most gripping stories of the 2013 legislative session happened outside the house and senate chambers special sessions are like fight club other than gov rick perry and his trusty dachshund , lucy , nobody knows for sure if and when there will be one , and nobody knows what it will be about but this being a legislature , everyone feels free to speculate lawmakers have talked among themselves about the possibility for weeks mr perry has said he wants lawmakers to address water and transportation issues , cut taxes and write a balanced budget that leaves enough money in the rainy day fund to maintain the state s triplea bond rating if they do not complete his wish list , he could summon them for a special session on one of those topics as this session came to a close , the only open question was whether the tax cuts that were made were big enough to keep the governor happy , but a hitch in any of those issues could force lawmakers into overtime a couple of other issues remain a state district judge found texas' financing plan for public schools unconstitutional lawyers on both sides expect an appeal to the texas supreme court depending on the content and timing of a ruling by the top court , legislators could be forced to return for a special session before their regular session in 2015 to patch the budget then there is redistricting attorney general greg abbott wants lawmakers to ratify courtdrawn maps that were used in 2012 , freeing the state from defending maps drawn by lawmakers in 2011 that are still tangled up in litigation if the governor agrees to go along , that could mean a quick special session perhaps as early as this week and lt gov david dewhurst has a list of special session topics , too antiabortion bills , drug screenings for welfare recipients and allowing the carrying of concealed firearms in university buildings special interest groups on the far right were a noisy bunch this session , but in many ways their bark was worse than their bite when the conservative advocate took aim at an expensive water deal or a transportationfinancing plan that would have raised vehicle registration fees , the tea party set in the house showed strength in numbers still , the influence of groups like mr sullivan s and the was mixed , particularly when compared with their successes in 2011 their efforts to keep the rainy day fund intact have failed the legislative budget deal would ask voters to spend 2 billion of it for water projects any tax relief approved this session will be smaller than they had hoped for while they avoided a medicaid expansion under the federal health overhaul , there has been little movement to formally ask the obama administration for block grants other groups had bigger successes homebuilders , who played a key role in blocking immigration enforcement legislation last session , helped derail a measure to crack down on worker misclassification and payroll fraud in the construction industry in legislation to prevent wrongful convictions , the texas defense bar successfully removed language requiring defense lawyers to open their files to prosecutors the measure only forces prosecutors to turn their records over to the defense but and , two groups that tried to pass school choice legislation , underperformed , despite hefty spending although they got the cap on charter schools raised , they struggle to find support for a number of other measures on their agenda in 2011 , lawmakers struggled with how to address a multibilliondollar revenue shortfall now , the legislature has a much different problem tax collections are surging and state coffers are flush , in large part because of an oil drilling boom before the session began , it was clear that three issues would drive the budget debate restoring the 2011 education cuts , finding money for water infrastructure projects and addressing a financing crisis at the texas department of transportation with a rainy day fund of about 12 billion , some legislators were hopeful that all three could be resolved that became less likely as a debate emerged among republicans is the fund there to address revenue needs during recessions and in the event of natural disasters \? or is it meant to preserve the state s high bond ratings so that lawmakers can continue borrowing money cheaply \? rick perry and a contingent of tea partyfriendly republicans insisted that the latter was crucial , and they pushed for withdrawing as little from the fund as possible others said the state would be just fine with a savings account 6 billion lighter a deal backed by budget leaders last week had legislators spending about 39 billion from the fund as the factions fighting for school and water financing gained traction , those focused on transportation were not as successful transportation department leaders said the agency needed to address congestion , but lawmakers did not get worked up over the issue this session in the final week , democrats resigned themselves to coming up short of their goal to fully restore 54 billion in cuts to education but farright lawmakers and conservative activists also failed in their efforts to maintain all the cuts for those who reach for the popcorn whenever they spot drama unfolding on the house or senate floor , the 2013 session was a bit of a letdown lawmakers largely sidestepped the most contentious issues , at least in public it would have been hard to surpass the riveting theater of 2011 , in which a house member displayed a transvaginal probe as a debate prop , and protesters cried criminal ! and treason ! from the senate gallery over the death of a bill that would have criminalized invasive body searches by transportation security administration employees much of that session s rancor centered on volatile issues related to abortion and illegal immigration that gov rick perry had deemed emergency items he did not designate any emergency items this session even fights over the budget have been more congenial , an unsurprising outcome given that the legislature has had the luxury of debating where to invest rather than where to cut the angriest debates emerged in the fight over a measure to create a state innocence commission during a senate committee hearing , the brother of an exoneree who died while wrongly imprisoned shouted at senator joan huffman , republican of southside place , over her pivotal opposition to the bill days later , the bill s author , representative ruth jones mcclendon , democrat of san antonio , began using a parliamentary procedure to kill several of the senator s bills in retaliation for ms huffman s opposition on tuesday night , democrats used several delay tactics to run out the clock on a bill to create a drugtesting regimen for some welfare beneficiaries but they could not forestall a bill on drug tests for unemployment benefits two years ago , rick perry was at the height of his power , driving the legislature to produce tough new restrictions on abortion , pass new curbs on lawsuits and enact deep budget cuts this session , he fell into a more traditional role nudging a lot and threatening when necessary , but otherwise compromising , even with democrats mr perry played a major role in knocking off a bill that would have used increased fees to pay for expanded transportation financing he also put a lot of political capital behind passage of a 2 billion water infrastructure upgrade and a large business franchise tax cut while he still has veto power , mr perry faces the prospect of making concessions on the details though he insisted on 18 billion in tax cuts , the legislature was , at last check , leaning toward giving him less education financing , at the insistence of democrats , is also set to rise more than mr perry had urged house speaker joe straus and lt gov david dewhurst faced similar pressure to compromise mr straus had initially criticized mr dewhurst s plan to let voters decide whether money should be taken out of the rainy day fund to pay for water , transportation and education programs in the compromise reached by the two chambers , voters will be asked to approve financing for only water projects the legislative process , when it s working normally , forces people to move off their ideal position , said jim henson , a political scientist at the university of texas at austin and a texas tribune pollster it does look like everyone s going to have to give a little something \( utaustin is a corporate sponsor of the texas tribune \) even geniuses have to learn the ropes somewhere in the legislature s huge freshman class , there may be a genius it is too early to know this much is known 41 people in the 150member house were serving in their first legislative session , along with three former representatives who returned after losing their seats in 2010 the 31member senate got six new members this year the big numbers in the house led to some substantial changes for example , a group of conservatives banded together several times during the session to influence debates on the budget , pensions and ethics legislation this freshman class will be more influential when the members learn their way around the capitol the traditional advice for new legislators is blunt sit down and shut up many of them took that seriously some did not and some got schooled for opening their mouths in debate , with senior members ribbing them goodnaturedly as they presented their first bills , and much more roughly when they challenged or amended other bills especially for political reasons the freshman class and the large sophomore cohort together include most state officeholders who might be classified as exponents of the tea party when they are engaged , they can swing issues , like using the state s rainy day fund that is partly because of their numbers and partly because other republicans are wary of crossing tea party voters who have an outsize voice in primary elections that power can only grow when they gain some experience the legislature has all but finished the business of the regular 2013 session , and all eyes will be on rick perry as he weighs major decisions on the policy and political fronts first , he will have to decide whether to sign or veto the state budget , which might not have everything he wanted a tax cut , which probably will not reach the 18 billion he insisted on and scores of other measures from new ethics rules to education reforms hurtling toward his desk he has until june 16 to sign or veto legislation if he does neither , the legislation becomes law even if the mustpass budget legislation survives , there are several avenues toward a special session this summer and beyond attorney general greg abbott wants a session so the legislature can adopt the redistricting maps put into place by the federal courts and if voters do not approve financing for an enormous water infrastructure plan , lawmakers could be back sooner rather than later to find the money later , a fix for the school financing system , already deemed unconstitutional by a state court , might prompt another all the while , mr perry will have to decide whether he is running for reelection , running for president , or both or even none of the above he has said that he will send a signal about his future in june , just months before the filing deadline for the 2014 elections there are numerous signs he will step aside and let mr abbott become the heir apparent but mr perry is keeping the decision under wraps , and anyone who knows him has learned to expect the unexpected
london in an episode of season four of downton abbey , the earl of grantham puts on an evening of entertainment by the opera star dame nellie melba \( played by another operatic dame , kiri te kanawa \) but clearly does n't think too well of singers , even ones with titles there is a debate about whether she should dine with the family or if a mealtray should be sent wherever her uncertain social status merits generally , though , people with grand houses and estates have warmed to the idea of opera on their premises especially now in britain , where it seems that almost every owner of a country pile with a few acres fills them in the summer months with magic flutes and marriages of figaro back in downton days the fourth season is set in the early 1920s attending such performances would have required an invitation now they tend to be commercial ventures anyone who can afford the tickets and a decent meal \( champagne picnics in the interval are an essential part of the experience \) can attend but the ideal is still a sense of being welcomed to a private party on a grand estate , and there is usually a dress code of black tie and evening gowns the socalled f te champ tre aspect does not always draw good press , however such offerings are indulgent and expensive , critics say , with bankers and other stalwarts of the countryopera scene displaying their wealth and adding to the exclusive image of an art form that in other contexts struggles to project open access champions of opera know it can be hard to argue for state financing only to be accused of using taxpayer money to support champagne lifestyles but in fairness to the countryhouse opera establishments in britain , none claim state money for their core summer seasons they rely instead on private donations and receipts from ticket sales , which can cost roughly 60 to 120 pounds , or 100 to 200 , at smaller companies , and 100 to 180 for larger establishments like garsington producing a show at a small venue might cost as little as 18 , 000 , while at garsington it might have a price tag of about 250 , 000 many countryopera venues also now run satellite projects for schools and community groups that reach far beyond the world of the wealthy and although they range from the grandly sophisticated to the haphazardly eccentric , they mostly share a seriousness of purpose and ambition for artistic standards , offering short , intensive seasons in rural areas that are easier to manage than the yeararound slog of fulltime companies that , at least , is how it always was with in east sussex , britain s longestrunning countryhouse opera and the one that used to rank preeminent , though it no longer stands out as it once did founded in 1934 and celebrating its 80th birthday next year , glyndebourne began as a rich man s plaything , when the owner of a large estate on the sussex downs , john christie , married the soprano audrey mildmay mr christie decided , as aristocrats could in the 1930s , to build an opera house for his wife beside the tudorbethan mansion that was their home for years the venue was not much more than a village hall , with just 300 seats but it drew serious talents on the run from europe in world war ii , like the austrian impresario rudolf bing , the german conductor fritz busch and the german director carl ebert legendary names on which glyndebourne s reputation was built with time the village hall grew bigger , and the christie family eventually replaced it in 1994 with a 1 , 200seat auditorium that is probably the most exquisitely appointed theater of its kind in britain the 2014 edition of the glyndebourne festival will take place there from may 17 to aug 24 and includes three new productions strauss s der rosenkavalier , mozart s la finta giardiniera , and verdi s la traviata along with revivals of tchaikovsky s eugene onegin , mozart s don giovanni and handel s rinaldo but in acquiring its enviable facilities , glyndebourne has paradoxically lost something of its former energy and vision some productions , like the britten billy budd that will play in the united states next year , attract acclaim , but many do not the choice of repertoire plays safer than it should and with more seats to sell for what is now more than 120 performances a year if you include its annual tour , which takes reduced versions of the season s shows around britain there is a widespread belief that glyndebourne has lost an element of exclusivity and cachet to garsington and grange park , its closest rivals in the countryopera pecking order also has seen dramatic changes in recent times , but it has managed them more skillfully started in 1989 as a modest venture in the gardens of a jacobean manor house near oxford \( famous for its bloomsbury connection \) , it was the most personal and charming of the country opera venues its owner , leonard ingrams , would meet and greet guests , ring the starting bell and make endearingly eccentric speeches from the stage about improvements to the lavatories but a few years after his death in 2005 , ingrams s widow , who endured the annual invasion of her house by singers , instrumentalists and punters for two decades , wanted out the opera moved to the wormsley estate in buckinghamshire , owned by the getty family , where it occupies an auditorium that wins architectural prizes , though perhaps not for charm but garsington s new building has succeeded in raising its game , which was already high thanks to astutely clever programming it has made a specialty of rare works by familiar names like rossini , richard strauss , haydn , vivaldi , many of them never before staged in britain offenbach is now another focus , with the monty python sounding farce \( about a dead parrot \) scheduled for 2014 and with a new artistic director , the conductor douglas boyd , who also runs an orchestra in switzerland , there are plans for international tours and shared productions all of which will take what once looked like a cozy , local venture \( and the butt of jokes when village neighbors got together and complained about the noise \) to more exalted levels one thing i know i want to do , mr boyd said , is bring to garsington some sense of the style and ethos of the chamber orchestra of europe , which i 've been closely involved with and

onehundredandone summers after the battle of gettysburg , a family of four stopped their nash rambler at the site during a 1 , 000mile drive from the new york world s fair to tallahassee , fla the father was a new jerseyborn former boxer , paratrooper and policeman who became a creative writing instructor at florida state after enrolling to study opera before arriving at the park he had published dozens of sciencefiction short stories , but nothing about history but he had researched several gettysburg participants for the trip , and he fascinated his daughter lila and son jeff with stories of his favorites while the family walked the grounds they ended up staying for several days , because michael shaara was in the early stages of creating his masterpiece novel , the killer angels partly owing to meticulous research , it took shaara \( pronounced sharea \) seven years to finish the manuscript relying chiefly on firstperson accounts like memoirs , diaries and letters , he pioneered a new type of historical novel normally such stories revolve around fictitious characters in real events the protagonist in rifles for watie , the 1957 novel by harold keith , is an imaginary union soldier who fights at wilson s creek and prairie grove in contrast , the killer angels uses a combination of recorded and fictional dialogue , as well as imagined thoughts and incidents , to tell the gettysburg story from the viewpoint of actual participants shaara s extra burden was to portray such speculation in a manner authentic to the characters , which compelled him to research men like robert e lee , james longstreet , joshua lawrence chamberlain , winfield scott hancock and john buford in such depth that he once told an interviewer he was visited by them thus , when the author has the confederate general longstreet advise a pokerplaying neophyte that his odds of drawing an inside straight are none , he foreshadows the general s future anguish when ordered to direct pickett s charge while simultaneously hinting at the temptation the assault presented to lee , desperate for a winning hand when attempted by a less conscientious researcher , shaara s technique brims with danger as a sciencefiction writer he understood oscar wilde s implication , audiences will believe the impossible but never the implausible by definition science fiction is fantasy , but the genre s good examples deliver credible stories , like the computer in 2001 a space odyssey that overrules human decision making thus , both shaara and his readers recognize that lee would have been as unlikely to give poker advice as stuart would have been to ignore a newspaper reporter shaara succeeded so brilliantly that he shifted the accepted historical interpretations and even changed the park s landscape before the publication of the killer angels in 1974 , academics thought that the ailment that waylaid lee during the battle was most likely a virulent form of indigestion they failed to consider incipient heart disease but shaara did having suffered a heart attack of his own while researching lee and writing the book , the fourpackaday author recognized symptoms others overlooked similarly , the novel s implication that the union general buford s delaying action west of gettysburg was intended to preserve defensible ground south of the town for gen george meade s army has become the received wisdom before the novel , park grounds contained no monument to longstreet , while its most popular site today , where chamberlain and the 20th maine regiment fought on little round top , was hard to find shaara resurrected chamberlain as a hero , and he has remained one of the most popular figures associated with the battle ever since despite its ultimate triumph , the novel s history is convoluted when shaara began sending the manuscript to publishers in 1971 , our country was in the late stages of the vietnam war that war s casualty lists , combined with its protracted length and our failure to win it , left much of the public disrespectful of anything military the killer angels was turned down by 15 publishers before it was accepted in 1972 by the david mckay company , which was best known as a publisher of comic books like blondie , dick tracy and popeye mckay was acquired by random house in 1973 and published the book in 1974 the initial production run was only 3 , 500 copies initially the novel sold modestly , but its critical reception was astounding the following year , the killer angels won the pulitzer prize together with other pulitzer winners and dignitaries , shaara and his wife joined gerald ford for a white house dinner the author was seated next to henry kissinger , with whom he had a brief disagreement on a forgotten intellectual matter although he lived for another 14 years , the 1975 pulitzer and white house visit were the author s lifetime high points while on a teaching assignment in italy in 1972 , a motorscooter accident put shaara in a coma for seven weeks he never fully recovered his writing skills were diminished , and he was left with a permanent speech impediment the killer angels was popular among civil war buffs and certain military enclaves like west point where at times it was required reading but otherwise the novel remained obscure further commercial success was also probably handicapped when shaara disregarded advice to consider other civil war projects his daughter , lila , to whom the killer angels is dedicated , believes her father was determined to let his own wideranging interests dictate future subjects two later novels published while shaara was still alive are presently so ignored that neither has a single reader review at amazon only after his death did his son , jeff , manage to secure a publisher for his father s previously snubbed baseball story , the love of the game then came ken burns when pbs unexpectedly captured 40 million viewers in 1990 with his civil war documentary , interest in the war s most famous battle spiked , and new readers began to buy copies of the killer angels among them was ted turner , who was told that the director ron maxwell had a film script based on the novel and was seeking financing mr turner agreed to provide funding , but changed the title to gettysburg when market research demonstrated that uninitiated moviegoers said shaara s title suggested a film about motorcycle gangs through a combination of box office receipts , video tape dvd sales , and online rentals the film became a commercial winner since its premiere in october 1993 , over 33 million people have seen it thanks to the film s success , shaara s novel shot up to the top of the new york times bestseller list , where it remained for four weeks that was almost 20 years after it was published and 5 years after the author s death it has since sold some 315 million copies , about 90 percent of the total copies sold since it first appeared , 40 years ago the commercial success of gettysburg led turner to suggest that the director consider a prequel and sequel maxwell agreed that shaara s son , jeff , should make the first attempt at the screenplay when random house was told of the project , they requested a copy the publisher liked it and gave jeff a contract to turn it into a novel the result was gods and generals , which was his father s original title for the killer angels the book was popular , but the film script was radically altered , resulting in success for the story as a novel , but failure as a film jeff feels his father most likely identified closest to chamberlain , a union colonel whom he portrays as both masculine and intellectual resonant of shaara s hemingwayesque life as a boxersoldierprofessornovelist but while shaara may have identified with chamberlain , his life after the book was more like that of an iconic confederate soldier in the book he quotes lee addressing longstreet to be a good soldier you must love the army but to be a good officer you must be willing to order the death of the thing you love that is the trap you can hold nothing back when you attack you must commit yourself totally likewise , shaara committed himself totally to the killer angels for seven years it marked the high tide of his capabilities but in his achievement , it was also his bid at posterity follow disunion at or join us  sources special thanks to helen , jeff and lila shaara widow , son and daughter for generously sharing reminisces phil leigh is an armchair civil war enthusiast and president of a market research company he is the author of , an illustrated and annotated version of the memoirs of confederate pvt sam watkins
boston like many of the candidates running for mayor here , john barros attended house party after house party over the weekend he found a warm reception from his hosts and the small groups they invited , as he spoke of his plans to improve schools , increase diversity in the police department and create more affordable housing and more mixedincome neighborhoods for the first time in a generation , the race for mayor of boston is wide open with thomas m menino , the city s mayor for the last 20 years , retiring , the race has attracted no fewer than a dozen candidates five of them are black , and one is latino one is a woman the city has never held a mayoral election with such a racially and ethnically mixed roster of candidates nor has its population ever been so diverse it is now a minoritymajority city , with 53 percent of the population identifying as something other than nonhispanic white it s nice to have so many of us running , mr barros said but boston has never elected a nonwhite mayor in fact , of the nation s 25 biggest cities , boston is one of only two in the north \( indianapolis is the other \) that has never elected a mayor of color and mr barros acknowledges that the odds and the demographics are against him and his fellow minority candidates jeffrey berry , a political scientist at tufts university , said his research showed that nationwide , black candidates have a terrible time getting elected from districts where there is n't a very , very large africanamerican population , and in the case of boston , what base they have is splintered despite the hoopla over having so many candidates who are black or latino , some analysts expect the city will fall back to type and send an irishamerican man to city hall , resuming an old habit that mr menino , an italianamerican , only interrupted he was the city s first nonirish mayor elected since 1930 to a lot of people , it seems like groundhog day , the endless cycle repeating itself , said thomas whalen , a political historian at boston university so far , none of the six candidates has broken through the crowded field into the top tier , as measured by polls and fundraising then again , no one at all has emerged as a clear frontrunner those doing best in the polls have only 10 percent or 12 percent of the vote , and as many as 40 percent of voters may be undecided the fluidity of the race and the unpredictable nature of voter turnout there has not been a competitive mayor s race here in three decades has given hope to the minority candidates that with community organizing in the weeks to come , they might succeed the preliminary election is sept 24 the top two vote getters will face off on nov 5 mr barros , for one , said he believed that boston was ready to elect a mayor of color , despite its history of racial strife in the 1970s over courtordered busing to desegregate the schools boston helped propel deval patrick to the governorship and barack obama to the presidency , he said but , he said , the minority candidates have had a harder time raising money and becoming known citywide because they do not have the extensive financial , business and social networks that the white candidates have though this year s varied crop of mayoral candidates reflects how much the city has changed since mr menino was first elected in 1993 , the top tier of candidates underscores just how much has stayed the same the three biggest fundraisers through the end of august were irishamerican men daniel f conley , the suffolk county district attorney john r connolly , a city councilor who has focused on overhauling the public schools and martin j walsh , a state representative who has strong union support closing in on them was michael ross , a city councilor who is jewish he seeks to represent the new boston and wants to work with neighboring cities like cambridge on collective causes among the minority candidates , charlotte golar richie , a former aide to mr menino and former state representative who is africanamerican and the only woman in the race , was the top fundraiser but the chasm between her and the top fundraisers , who had raised more than 1 million each , was wide ms golar richie pulled in just 260 , 000 close behind her was felix g arroyo , another city councilor and the only latino in the race mr barros , a former member of the boston school committee and executive director of a neighborhood initiative focused on affordable housing , was next the other three minority candidates trailed far behind having all the minority candidates bunched at the bottom , at least in fundraising , has been frustrating for them and their supporters and has prompted some soulsearching it has also led to one of the few eruptions of tension in an otherwise remarkably rancorfree campaign several black leaders held a closeddoor meeting with about 80 or 90 minority activists wednesday night and said they wanted the lagging candidates to drop out so voters could coalesce behind one or two others who seemed better positioned the proposal infuriated many in the audience , who saw it as a strongarm tactic to engineer support for ms golar richie we do n't all speak with one voice , and this kind of discussion just did n't feel good , said kim janey , a community leader who supports mr barros maggie brown , a grassroots organizer who also attended , said , we will not be silenced ms brown has stirred controversy of her own by planning a forum for tuesday at which only the six minority candidates have been invited to speak critics have called this shortsighted , saying that whoever is elected will be mayor of the entire city and that all candidates deserved a chance to appeal to all voters the event was to be held at freedom house , a nonprofit group , but katrina shaw , the group s head , said that because the forum did not include all candidates , it was no longer welcome regardless of who wins , she said , we are not the boston where bottles were thrown at me when i was growing up , and we want to be inclusive ms brown , who now plans to hold the forum on a street corner in roxbury , said she did not want to let the white candidates speak because it takes away from the historical moment some analysts said minority communities were experiencing the growing pains of any group with political aspirations out of this election , there will be a whole realignment of city politics , said peter kadzis , the former executive editor of the boston phoenix , who is now a political commentator i think the black community , which is more cohesive than the irishcatholic community these days , will be stronger after the election
madrid bloodstains mixed with graffiti mark the walls of this city s old slaughterhouse and its vast compound of arched neomoorish pavilions they are signs of an eclectic history over the last century , the complex , called matadero madrid , has changed from an abattoir to a homeless squat to an outpost for contemporary art , theater and documentary films now is evolving into a cultural laboratory , where a new arts financing strategy is being tested companies and institutions are providing financial support to supplement dwindling government arts subsidies , but with a twist they do n't just send checks , they move in within the walled 59 , 000squarefoot center , there are public theaters and exhibition spaces that last year drew more than 500 , 000 visitors for music and art events and avantgarde plays but five new residents are private institutions , including a designers' association , a publishing house s foundation and offices of red bull , the austrian energy drink maker they are in the compound rentfree for now , but have invested millions in the remodeling of pavilions there , as well as in programming , from art exhibitions to music festivals these new partnerships are forged , out of necessity , here in spain , where government support for culture has plunged by almost 50 percent over the last four years , a result of a lingering economic crisis that hit late in 2008 in other struggling countries in europe , austerity policies have forced art institutions to curtail programs and court private donors there is , though , some wariness about how far to press this approach increasingly , in some european countries , the emerging down side of corporate patronage is that culture is heavily influenced by those businesses one example is a museum exhibition in paris this year in france , this trend has been mocked as publicity exhibits but there is not the same criticism in spain , where most cultural institutions are struggling to stave off more cuts in their activities within matadero , the corporate neighbors are embraced as full partners who share in the coordination of the compound and discussions about programming , a model that has intrigued arts executives in other countries who have come to madrid to study it casa del lector , a foundation to promote reading created by the founder of the spanish textbook publisher anaya , moved into matadero last fall after financing a 168 million makeover of a pig slaughterhouse within the compound into a hightech lecture and exhibition space the foundation offers lectures , workshops and art exhibitions on themes like bram stoker s dracula and the covers of early spanish romance novels red bull whose name is emblazoned on the front of a former stable moved into matadero in 2011 it spent more than 22 million to create its own musical academy and fashion a garden in the interior of the building , where there are also whimsical sandbag huts built on top of the red earth ordinarily used in bullfighting rings the academy includes a and performing space , part of red bull s international network of music workshops and concerts that it has organized since 1995 in cities from new york to berlin to promote its brand we 're creating a new model of partnership , said victor flores , the cultural director for red bull in spain , who calls it the first time a company has worked so closely with a public cultural institution in spain in spain s cultural landscape , museums have sponsors , but they do n't get involved so deeply in terms of the programs , schedules and how to create and run space red bull is negotiating an extension of its threeyear lease , partly because it was attracted by the demographic of matadero s visitors , many of whom are in their 20s and 30s for us , it was super fresh , cutting edge , innovative in its way with the arts , mr flores said in the meantime , matadero is still looking for more partners to finance a multimillion dollar makeover of two more empty pavilions the existing arrangement has helped matadero thrive , earning a spot on a top 10 list of cultural institutions in spain that have weathered the financial crisis , a roster compiled by the culture observatory , a nonprofit organization in madrid that tracks culture spending and convenes a panel of arts experts to highlight highperforming groups in the future , none of spain s cultural institutions are going to recover the budgets they had , said alberto fesser , director of the observatory the alternative path is this mix of private and public income sponsorships , commercial projects and individual contributions in that regard , matadero is an innovator , he said the art of the deal , according to arts executives , is key to survival it s really different from the old way , said carlota lvarez basso , the programming director for matadero , who was appointed in 2012 and whose aim is to preside over a paradigm shift in fundraising before , i just got the money and i did n't need to knock on the doors of different institutions we were rich in the context of the crisis , we need to find new ways we have to change tactics when matadero opened , in 1911 , it was a pioneer in industrial architecture but by 1996 , it had closed and was abandoned to squatters , whose graffiti has been retained as local color in one of matadero s hip restaurants its reconstruction as a cultural center started in 2007 , before financial markets began panicking about the difficult financial situation in spain and elsewhere matadero s executives are dreaming up other costsaving strategies , from scouting for coproducers in prosperous countries to enlisting unlikely patrons , like a german insurance company with a modern art collection to lend for an exhibition to supplement madrid city hall s 38 million budget for matadero s administration and construction , the center draws revenue from two restaurants in the compound and is opening a bicycle rental business revenue from warehouse rentals and fees grew to roughly 930 , 000 last year ms lvarez has also enlisted foreign embassies to help finance residency exchanges of visiting artists , part of a broader plan to build up matadero s international profile her search for alternatives is a reflection of systemic difficulties for cultural institutions the government imposed a 21 percent sales tax on ticket sales and , despite government pledges and lobbying efforts , companies are not eligible for tax deductions for sponsorship contributions the threat of more government budget cuts has also inspired teatro espa ol which runs an offshoot avantgarde theater in matadero to seek private producers to mount small plays and to form alliances with spanishspeaking institutions outside the country , according to natalio grueso , the director of madrid s programming for theater arts mr grueso noted that the annual budget for teatro espa ol , now 8 million , is half of what it was 10 years ago he added that the cuts are continuing it s important , he said , to look for new alternatives
nairobi , i was in the giant crowd in uhuru park in downtown nairobi in the runup to the 2007 election when the presidential candidate raila odinga told his supporters they were tiny but fiery safari ants , who were going to drive the snake that had invaded the bird s nest out of the tree this analogy comes from african folklore mr odinga suggested that his supporters , by their sheer numbers , were capable of achieving what the other animals of the forest were afraid of doing the reformers who supported his democratic movement , which stood in opposition to the presidency of , embraced the label of safari ants fast forward five years and a bit on the morning of march 9 , i was on waiyaki way , a major nairobi thoroughfare , when i came upon a throng of supporters of uhuru kenyatta , who was declared the winner by the narrowest of margins of the presidential election held five days earlier the demonstrators brought the traffic on that busy highway to a stop at dawn , the same mob had awakened me , as hordes of young people paraded through residential suburbs in an anticipatory celebration for mr kenyatta , a son of kenya s founding president , jomo kenyatta seated in a minibus immobilized by traffic , i got a close look at them these were no urbanites if you have lived in nairobi for as long as i have , you are able to tell country folk who are new to town just by their looks someone had bused them in what shocked me , though , was not that they were snatching cellphones out of open car windows it was the expletives they were shouting through those windows a nation of kikuyu kenya s dominant ethnic group , of which the kenyattas are members had triumphed once again over the luo , the minority to which mr odinga belongs the tribal invective was ugly but the shocking bit was watching kids of around age 6 wallow in the rhetorical filth , egged on by people i assumed to be their parents we were drawing from the basest of our primitive reserves in the name of celebrating a victory that had yet to be confirmed \( mr odinga has refused to concede defeat , and is challenging the results in court \) this depressing scenario does n't bode well for kenyan democracy , a halfcentury after kenya attained independence from britain back in 1963 , the masses were made to believe that if the british colonialists were expelled , the land they had occupied would revert to the people of kenya this never happened instead , the colonial old guard and their kenyan collaborators came together and moved into the colonial farmhouses with their families the mau mau freedom fighters , who had been instrumental in driving out the british , were warned by none other than president kenyatta to end their insurgency there was no land reform , no redistribution of wealth , no rethinking of the terms of colonial society the dispossessed kikuyu were at the core of the land problems that persist to this day land motivated the tribal clashes that sporadically broke out during the presidencies of mr kenyatta s successor , daniel arap moi , who served from 1978 to 2002 , and of the current president , mr kibaki , who has served since 2002 the fawning , shukaclad kenyan of isak dinesen s out of africa has become wise to the world , and weary of its ways she has discarded her wrapping skins and cloaks for tailored suits and attained a university degree that , unfortunately , cannot guarantee her a job she is the emblem of kenyan disillusionment if kenya s forever squabbling political leaders have n't learned anything from the french revolution , or , more recently , the arab spring , then pretty soon she and other angry young women and men will become their nightmare over the years , that malaise has festered into a ripe boil that requires nothing short of surgery we came close to lancing it in 2002 , when we threw out mr moi and cronies from his kalenjin ethnic community , who almost brought the economy to its knees i was in uhuru park when kenyans pelted the unpopular president s motorcade with earthen clods the demand for what kenyans called the second liberation was universal when mr moi was defeated , it was the first time kenyans had voted overwhelmingly against something , and at the time , there was unlimited optimism but mr kibaki s troubled term did not deliver this liberation instead what we witnessed was a sustained attempt by the political elite to slam the lid on the boiling pot of societal unrest the dream soured when he surrounded himself with a kitchen cabinet made up of his kikuyu tribesmen the fatal postelection violence of 20078 was the second chance we had to lance the boil this time , sharpened machetes were unsheathed and terror such as had never been seen before visited the land any kenyan of conscience agreed that the violence served nothing but to destroy this year , for the third time , we had an opportunity to bring about political change in a decent , legally acceptable manner , following the successful promulgation of a new constitution that devolved power from nairobi to local governments but the razorthin election results mean the future is cloudy as we await a supreme court ruling on mr odinga s petition disputing the vote tally , i have heard calls from kenyans mostly kenyatta supporters to accept the results of the election and move on but welcome as peace is , especially for an economy not stable enough to withstand turbulence , i think it is the easy way out we would be sweeping the dirt under the carpet and simply ignoring the problem we must wait to see what the court decides without faith in democratic institutions , the tender boil will only fester and then it will burst
wobbled , but only for a moment he winced , flexed his left knee a few times , reset himself and returned to his unshakable agenda soaring over a league of helpless challengers the image of james s twisted knee sunday afternoon had to send shudders through south beach , and perhaps a perverse hope through madison square garden , but none of it lasted very long the only image anyone will remember is of james flying downcourt , converting another turnover into a spectacular breakaway dunk , a final touch on a 9993 victory with that , the avenged two blowout losses to the knicks and put a little more distance , literally and figuratively , between them the heat \( 4314 \) have a sevenandahalfgame lead over the knicks \( 3521 \) in the eastern conference james provided the clear edge as the heat erased a 16point deficit and dominated the second half , 5434 he had 12 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter , blocked tyson chandler s layup attempt down the stretch , then lunged to steal j r smith s careless pass for the final dunk by that point , james s thirdquarter collision with smith , the one that made james s knee twist unnaturally , had long since been forgotten that man do n't get hurt , , his close friend , said with a wry smile so we was n't buying that he made some plays , made some shots james also finished with 11 rebounds , 7 assists and 3 steals as the heat won their 14th straight game and ended the knicks' threegame winning streak you 're not going to stop him , coach mike woodson said of james he s figured it out the knicks answered with anthony , who had 32 points but went quiet in the second half , going 3 for 11 from the floor as miami focused its defense on him and let the knicks' shooters roam free the result was a barrage of missed 3pointers , most of them by smith , who went 3 for 14 from the arc for the game , drawing woodson s scorn afterward anthony did not take a shot in the final four minutes and said afterward that he had hyperextended his right arm in the first half he played down the injury james , in turn , said his knee was fine i was concerned , but i had a doctor look at it , james said i will be all right it was a heavy reliance on 3point shooting that carried the knicks to two victories over miami last fall , inspiring a belief that the two teams were at last on equal footing that notion seems antiquated now , and anthony avoided any attempt to make the case we do n't compare ourselves to miami , he said miami is miami we 're new york we 'll see them when we see them again even before the loss , woodson proclaimed the heat by far the best team right now in our league afterward , james politely praised the knicks as one of the best teams in our league they will meet for a fourth time on april 2 , in miami and after that , perhaps in the playoffs by then , the knicks can only hope to find a better offensive balance they got doubledigit scoring from smith \( 13 points \) , amar'e stoudemire \( 12 \) , chandler \( 10 \) and a resurgent jason kidd \( 14 \) but the heat s big 3 were simply better , with dwyane wade providing 20 points and 8 assists and chris bosh scoring 16 when you have the big 3 playing the way they 're playing , especially right now , it makes it tough for a lot of people , anthony said these teams had traveled divergent paths since they last met in early december , with the heat dominating the league and the knicks meandering through the schedule so the afternoon provided some encouragement for the knicks , who at least played well enough to have a doubledigit lead against the best team in the league their defense was mostly sound , if ultimately undermined by 17 turnovers , and the fourth quarter was tight until the end after months of virtual dormancy , the knicks of november reemerged for a time they hustled , they attacked the defense and they made a whole lot of 3pointers , building a 14point lead by halftime even kidd , who turns 40 this month , looked as if he had been sent back in time , by months or years he converted four 3pointers in the first half , his most in a game since jan 5 and as many as he had hit in the previous eight games combined the knicks took their final lead , 8785 , on a smith 3pointer miami scored the next 6 points , with one basket each from bosh , wade and james , who completed the run after blocking chandler replays showed james , who blocked the shot with his left hand , had grabbed chandler with his right hand no foul was called he grabbed my shoulder , chandler said and then he blocked the shot the knicks had closed the gap to 2 points when james completed a driving layup over smith it was a 4point game with less than a minute to play when james snatched smith s pass and ran away for the dunk we 're walking away with a win tonight if we just execute some small things defensively , chandler said so as tough as this loss is to take , we can definitely build on it rebounds kenyon martin is expected to get a second 10day contract after his first 10day deal expires monday the knicks are still evaluating martin , who had not played this season before signing with them martin is likely to

storrs , conn paul pasqualoni took over a connecticut football program in 2011 that had risen in less than a decade from division iaa to a berth in the fiesta bowl a former connecticut high school football player , he had cut his coaching teeth in the state before moving on to syracuse , where his teams won 107 games in 14 seasons with pasqualoni and his instate recruiting ties , a relatively new stadium and a stateoftheart practice center , was expected to continue a trajectory toward national prominence , something it seemed to be on before the former coach randy edsall left for maryland i did n't come here not to have success , pasqualoni said last week but he did not pasqualoni was fired , less than three years after taking the job he managed a 1018 record , including an 04 start this season his dismissal came two days after a 4112 loss on sept 28 at buffalo , a team whose only other victory this season came by 3 points over stony brook but there were signs of trouble almost from the beginning shortly after pasqualoni was hired , the program s biggest donor , robert burton , asked for his 7 million back and to have his name removed from the team s football complex burton had wanted another connecticut native , steve addazio , to replace edsall and thought that his opinion was ignored he was eventually talked into keeping his money and his name with the program , but he was never in pasqualoni s corner addazio went to temple and is now at boston college pasqualoni then lost his biggest ally at uconn when the athletic director jeff hathaway , the man who hired him , was sent packing before the start of the 2011 season that move came after the university s new president , susan herbst , undertook a review of hathaway s handling of the athletic department , including the hiring of the football coach she later hired warde manuel , a former michigan football player , away from buffalo to take the job as uconn s new ad the people that are there now are not the people who hired me , more or less , pasqualoni said last week susan was always supportive , but in this business , things change nothing ever stays the same none of that would have mattered had uconn won but it did not the huskies finished pasqualoni s first season with a 57 record , and there were rumblings uconn was seeking a spot in the atlantic coast conference amid the conference realignment shuffle , and that league was looking for a candidate that had a high profile in basketball and football uconn had been considered a frontrunner louisville eventually ended up with the invitation a second 57 season put the coach squarely on the hot seat but manuel said he did not make a move then because he saw progress after wins over pittsburgh and at louisville against the nationally ranked cardinals pasqualoni relieved his longtime friend george deleone of his duties as the offensive coordinator , replacing him with t j weist , who had been an assistant to butch jones at cincinnati but the offense did not improve uconn ranks 119th in the football bowl subdivision in total offense and last in rushing at a little less than 46 yards a game the huskies opened this season with a loss to towson , a football championship subdivision team , and one to maryland and edsall uconn then lost to the two universities with ties to manuel michigan and buffalo manuel said with connecticut heading into the american athletic conference s first season of league play , he decided the time was now to try to salvage the season , and the program s reputation pasqualoni was out , and weist is in for the interim pasqualoni said he felt good with the shape in which he left the huskies , adding that his last two recruiting classes were strong this week , weist changed quarterbacks , inserting the freshman tim boyle into the lineup over the junior chandler whitmer he said there would be increased roles for other freshmen , among other changes practices were a bit different last week , with ac dc blaring during stretches , and players being given more responsibility for motivating their teammates i do n't want to sit here and say we 're going to run double reverses , and blitzes on every snap and we 're going to do this and we 're going to do that , weist said you guys know that hopefully i'm smarter than that but you 'll see some changes manuel said he believed the talent was there to win now he will conduct a national search for a permanent head coach who can do that i think we have great fans , which ultimately want what i want , what t j wants , what this team wants success , he said we have a passionate fan base i love that does it need to be resold \? probably but what sells it is success
beijing as oscar fever grows around the world with the 85th academy awards set to begin in los angeles just hours from now , excitement is building in china , even though it has no films in competition there is also a sense of frustration here about why china s movies aren t nominated for the world s biggest awards \? china sees itself as advancing in many ways , growing richer and more powerful , so its inability to come up with serious oscars contenders rankles the most popular answer to the question , held by ordinary chinese and film experts alike , is too few good films that s the real reason in recent years chinese films have moved further and further away from the oscars dream , wrote the international herald leader newspaper , in a story carried on the country s popular tencent entertainment site an article by the economic daily , carried on people s daily web site , gave another interpretation the oscars have never been a communal forum , the films taken seriously have only the responsibility to portray the north american world view and the lives they re willing to see as i ve explored elsewhere , strict censorship hobbles the chinese film industry directors are increasingly voicing their frustration in public , yet there s little they can do against the directives of the state one result of this hamstringing of talent is it s virtually impossible to make probing films about contemporary society , which has many social tensions the government doesn t want openly explored instead , filmmakers retreat to the safety of historical themes , with tales of warring dynasties commonplace also , strict import rules governing overseas movies mean few may be shown here as a person with the handle layin wrote on sina weibo , the microblog with the exception of ang lee s life of pi , none of the nominated films has screened in china much attention is being focused on a prediction of winners in an annual list drawn up by the actress zhang ziyi ms zhang starred in crouching tiger , hidden dragon , a hit in 2000 by the taiwanese director ang lee she is also the first chinese star from the people s republic of china to be listed on the jury for the oscars , in 2005 , xinhua , the state news agency , reported many netizens are pointing out that ms zhang s list runs at an estimated 90 percent accuracy rate so what s she tapping \? best director \? mr lee and steven spielberg \( lincoln \) are in tight competition , she writes emotionally , i m drawn to ang lee intellectually i m drawn to spielberg these are the two films i ve liked most this year best film \? lincoln whether you like the movie or not , it gives off glamor and radiance i salute spielberg s youthfulness , she wrote china is 16 hours ahead of los angeles , so watching will be tricky for people headed into a normal working day on monday as mostro wrote on a microblog site , it s the oscars today ! ! ! ! ! ! ! but it ll only be on tomorrow , beijing time i can t watch it , followed by four yellow , grimacing emoticons

d j augustin realized how far he and his friend raymond felton had come three years ago , they were teammates on the charlotte bobcats , each having their first taste of the nba playoffs last friday , augustin and the eliminated the atlanta hawks felton and the did the same to the boston celtics , giving the two point guards their first playoff series victories and setting up their meeting sunday in the opening game of their eastern conference semifinal series raymond is a great player , augustin said of felton , who scored 18 points sunday as the knicks lost to the pacers , 10295 at madison square garden he added i'm happy to see the position he s in he s doing a great job with the knicks felton could say the same about augustin , who had the best playoff game of his young career augustin came off the bench to score 16 points in 13 minutes of play he was 5 of 6 from the field , including four 3pointers before sunday , his career best in the playoffs was 11 points , which came in game 5 of the pacers' firstround series with the hawks the knicks spent much of sunday s game focusing on david west , paul george and roy hibbert , a reasonable strategy but that left opportunities for augustin he was left wide open on each of the 3pointers he made on one possession , kenyon martin was more concerned with staying with west than picking up augustin when he had the ball i just wanted to get in the game and play well , augustin said we have guys that draw double teams like dwest , roy and p g they 're very open to passing the ball and finding guys like me when you have guys like that who are always willing to pass , you will always get open shots when the knicks were able to force augustin to dribble late in the third quarter , he drove by felton and jason kidd on the baseline for a layup on the next possession , augustin made his fourth 3pointer to extend the pacers lead to 16 , at 8165 , their largest lead of the game in the first round against the hawks , augustin shot 29 percent from behind the arc , and pacers coach frank vogel who had encouraged augustin this season to become more of a shooter and less of a driving point guard said he was concerned that augustin was forcing too many shots but on sunday , vogel watched augustin find his rhythm that was his best game so far in terms of balance , vogel said the pacers are a team without a superstar although george emerged as an allstar this season , the pacers have emphasized spreading around their offense west , who led the pacers with 20 points sunday , said none of his teammates could afford to pass up open shots augustin has been making sure to take his shots when he has them we 've been yelling at him all year to shoot the ball , west said these last two weeks , he s shot the ball without hesitation we knew he could play a big role for us we know he can play , and he has the talent to make plays off the bounce and at the 3point line the pacers are hopeful augustin can continue his success from the perimeter against the knicks i 've seen him working in the gym after every practice , and he s hitting big shots , lance stephenson said if he hits big shots like that , we 'll be unstoppable rebounds the pacers denied that their physical play in game 1 was meant to cause further damage to carmelo anthony s sore left shoulder after sunday s game , raymond felton said the pacers were focusing on anthony s shoulder our guys do n't even know he s hurt , frank vogel said we 're just playing basketball david west , who guarded anthony throughout the game , said the pacers did not do anything different on defense we take the brunt of the contact on most possessions , west said i thought we were doing a good job of playing our style of defense
inaugural speeches are often criticized as long on rhetoric and short on substance but president obama s second inaugural address on monday was surprisingly specific about his secondterm goals mr obama devoted an entire paragraph to climate change and energy , and later in the speech he pointed to several public policy issues where our journey is not complete , he said polls show that the president has at least a slim majority of americans in his corner on almost all of the issues he highlighted here s a look at the most recent polling on some of the agenda items mr obama laid out climate change we will respond to the threat of climate change , knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science , but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires , and crippling drought , and more powerful storms the pollingreportcom database includes two polls on global warming conducted after the nov 6 presidential election an associated pressgfk poll in the field from nov 29 to dec 3 found that 78 percent of respondents said they believed the planet had warmed over the past 100 years , and 49 percent said they thought global warming would be a very serious problem for the united states if left unaddressed \( 31 percent said they thought it would be somewhat serious \) fiftyseven percent of the 1 , 002 adults surveyed said the united states government should do a great deal or quite a bit on global warming a united technologies national journal congressional connection poll conducted nov 8 to 11 found that 57 percent of adults said they thought global warming was increasing the likelihood of storms like hurricane sandy samesex marriage our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law for if we are truly created equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well on the issue of gay marriage , polls show that mr obama has a slim majority of americans on his side the percentage of adults who favor samesex marriage has been rising steadily for some time five polls on samesex marriage have been conducted since the election and are included in the pollingreportcom database each poll uses slightly different question wording , but an average of 51 percent of respondents favored samesex marriage and 44 percent opposed it voter identification laws our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote there haven t been many polls testing the popularity of long voting lines \( although it is hard to imagine their being popular \) however , the focus on the nation s voting process in 2012 largely centered on states photo identification laws , like the one in pennsylvania that was eventually blocked by a judge on this issue , mr obama does not have the public on his side polls asking about laws requiring voters to show photo identification have found a solid majority favoring such laws a new york times cbs news poll from september and a fox news poll from april both found 7 in 10 respondents supported requiring a photo identification card to vote in a washington post poll from august , 75 percent of respondents favored photo identification laws immigration our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving , hopeful immigrants who still see america as a land of opportunity , until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country there is polling on many aspects of immigration policy but most observers consider the most contentious plank of potential reform to be a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who meet certain requirements \( the obama administration and congressional democrats will reportedly insist on including such a path in any comprehensive reform bill \) in the pollingreportcom database , four surveys have asked about a path to citizenship since the election each poll asked slightly different questions and found a range of answers a fox news poll conducted jan 15 to 17 found that two in three registered voters favored allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the country and eventually qualify for us citizenship , but only if they meet certain requirements like paying back taxes , learning english , and passing a background check seventeen percent of the 1 , 008 voters surveyed supported sending all illegal immigrants back to their native countries a cbs news poll from middecember surveyed 1 , 179 adults nationwide and found that 47 percent favored allowing illegal immigrants who are currently working in the united states to eventually apply for us citizenship , and 27 percent favored requiring illegal immigrants to leave the united states in a united technologies national journal congressional connection poll from just after the election , 43 percent of adults favored allowing only those illegal immigrants who have been here for many years and have broken no other laws to stay here legally another 33 percent supported allowing all illegal immigrants to stay , provided they have broken no other laws and commit to learning english and us history and an abc news washington post poll conducted nov 7 to 11 asked simply , do you support or oppose a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants \? fiftyseven percent of the 1 , 023 adults surveyed answered support and 39 percent answered oppose guns our journey is not complete until all our children , from the streets of detroit to the hills of appalachia to the quiet lanes of newtown , know that they are cared for , and cherished , and always safe from harm the mass shooting in newtown , conn , appears to have galvanized support at least temporarily for gun control , with polls conducted this month consistently showing support for stricter gun laws in the mid 50s for example , a new york times cbs news poll found that 54 percent of respondents favored tighter gun laws , up from 39 percent in a cbs news poll last april a jan 17 gallup poll found 53 percent of adults said they would want their representative to vote for the package of gun law reforms that mr obama proposed fortyone percent said they would want their representative to oppose the laws the evidence isn t uniform , however the most recent fox news poll found that 51 percent of respondents said that protecting the constitutional right of citizens to own guns was more important than protecting citizens from gun violence forty percent of those surveyed said protecting citizens was more important a more granular look at the polling reveals that a number of the proposals put forward by the obama administration have overwhelming support in the same fox news poll , laws requiring criminal background checks and mental health checks on all gun buyers were both favored by more than 80 percent of respondents \( that s in line with virtually every recent poll on guns the times cbs news poll found that 92 percent of respondents favored background checks on all potential gun buyers \) surveys show that bans on certain weapons and ammunition are less popular , but still supported by majorities of adults recent polls have found that support for a ban on assault rifles and semiautomatic weapons as well as a ban on highcapacity magazines usually falls in the low 50s to low 60s
washington when offered a tongueincheek lament last week that he was getting kind of lonely in this big house , he was referring to his two daughters , who he said were less eager to hang out with their dad as they grew older but mr obama might just as well have been talking about the fraternity of middleaged political advisers who have been at his side since before the 2008 campaign and who are finally moving on exhausted and eager for new careers , they nevertheless plan to create an ad hoc support group for the boss they are leaving behind it s something we 've thought about a lot , said , one of mr obama s most trusted political aides , who returned to the obama fold to advise on the reelection campaign and is now off to start an institute for politics at the university of chicago presidents need to have people with longstanding relationships around them , he said , because the instinct most people have with the president is to be deferential to a fault for the first time since mr obama became president , none of his big three political counselors mr axelrod , and will be working in the white house now they are in the top rank of obama alumni , a status that confers benefits of its own mr obama still has trusted aides around him , including valerie jarrett , a family friend from chicago denis r mcdonough , a veteran of 2008 , who is moving up to chief of staff and alyssa mastromonaco and pete rouse , two of his longestserving staff members we 're strategically spaced out , said benjamin j rhodes , who wrote foreignpolicy speeches in 2008 and is a deputy national security adviser but reaching some of his oldest and closest confidants will now require a phone call , rather than simply a knock on their west wing office doors and that is where anita decker breckenridge comes in ms decker breckenridge , 34 , sits a few steps outside the oval office and is a master of the obama rolodex she ran his downstate illinois office when he was in the united states senate her only moment in the limelight came when the white house confirmed that she , like warren buffett s secretary , in 2011 than her boss that year , mr obama asked ms decker breckenridge to be his personal aide , a position that doubles as his gatekeeper she met mr obama nearly a decade ago and knows instinctively whom he does , and does not , want to hear from loyalty and trust mean everything , she said in a weekend interview he is someone who has always valued long and old friendships and she can find any of his old friends on short notice , particularly in the latenight hours when he likes to talk on the phone we know the deal when he needs us and when he asks us to get involved , said mr gibbs , his first white house press secretary and that is , yes , sir' for all the chatter about whether the president socializes enough in washington , friends know that he has always been something of a loner and yet he does not always like to be alone during long rides on , including his solitary flights to and from hawaii over the holidays , he was busy rounding up players for one of his favorite pastimes a game of spades his most frequent partners are marvin nicholson , the trip director pete souza , the chief white house photographer and jay carney , the press secretary all three are remaining in their positions , eliminating the need for mr obama to find new tablemates though much of the president s political inner circle has dispersed , they are bound together by the latest iteration of the obama campaign organization  jim messina , who managed the president s reelection bid , will be the chairman of the group , which includes mr gibbs and mr plouffe , who managed the 2008 campaign not clear yet is whether mr messina will hold weekly dinners at which the alumni can dispense advice to those inside the white house mr axelrod had dinners , featuring pizza and thai food , when he was senior political adviser from 2009 to 2011 mr plouffe , who has been in the white house since 2011 , is leaving this week to return to the private sector , where he has been a consultant and a public speaker even with the bruising battles over fiscal policy , gun control and ahead , he said , he did not entertain the idea of sticking around getting fresh voices is good , mr plouffe said reducing a president s reliance on insiders can have unpredictable consequences for a second term , both good and bad , according to the presidential historian michael beschloss dwight d eisenhower flourished after sherman adams , his overly protective chief of staff , left in 1958 but ronald reagan stumbled after james a baker iii , his trusted chief of staff , was replaced by donald regan , a wall street banker whom he barely knew to the extent that mr obama s advisers worry about such things , their concern is having people who are willing to tell the president when they think he is wrong even those who have known him a long time , his aides acknowledge , sometimes hesitate to do that will it be a great strategic and political loss without axe and plouffe \? i hope not , said dan pfeiffer , the communications director , who is also a veteran of 2008 and plans to stay on but will the nature and character of this place change \? that s probably true
washington president obama , seeking to put the prosperity and promise of the middle class at the heart of his secondterm agenda , called on congress on tuesday night to raise the federal minimum wage to 9 an hour , saying that would lift millions out of poverty and energize the economy in an assertive state of the union address that fleshed out the populist themes of his inauguration speech , mr obama declared it was our generation s task to reignite the true engine of america s economic growth a rising , thriving middle class every day , he said , we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation how do we attract more jobs to our shores \? how do we equip our people with the skills to get those jobs \? and how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living \? the increase in the minimum wage , from 725 an hour now , was the most tangible of a raft of initiatives laid out by the president , from education and energy to public works projects taken together , mr obama said , these investments would accelerate the nation s recovery by helping those in the broad middle class raising the minimum wage holds particular political appeal for younger americans , struggling workers and labor groups , all of which were important to mr obama s reelection his proposal drew one of the loudest ovations of the evening from democrats in the house chamber speaking to a divided congress , with many republicans still smarting from his november victory , mr obama declared , together , we have cleared away the rubble of crisis , and we can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger he urged lawmakers to act on immigration , climate change , budget negotiations , and , above all , on gun violence , delivering an emotional appeal for stricter controls that drew on recent tragedies like the schoolhouse massacre in newtown , conn they deserve a vote , mr obama declared over and over , gesturing to victims of various shootings , who were scattered through the audience mr obama took the podium after a rousing welcome from lawmakers and other dignitaries but millions of tv viewers , not to mention people glancing at their smartphones inside the chamber , were distracted by a manhunt across the country , where the police in california were tracking a suspect in the killing of officers and others news coverage concentrated on the search almost up to the point the president entered the chamber , and immediately after he finished , networks cut away to continue reporting on the events in california republicans quickly rejected mr obama s activist approach , saying it would inevitably translate into higher taxes and an overweening government role , strangling economic growth and deepening the nation s fiscal hole still , in selecting senator marco rubio , a cubanamerican from florida , to deliver their party s official rebuttal , republicans implicitly acknowledged the damage they had suffered at the polls from their hard line stance on immigration mr rubio , one of the party s rising stars , favors overhauling immigration laws on tuesday , he complained that mr obama s solution to virtually every problem we face is for washington to tax more , borrow more , and spend more in a speech dominated by domestic issues , mr obama admonished north korea a day after it tested a nuclear weapon he warned the country s reclusive government that it faced further isolation , swift retaliation and a united states bent on improving its own missile defense systems as new threats erupted , however , old threats were receding , mr obama said he announced , for example , that 34 , 000 troops would return home from afghanistan by this time next year that withdrawal , representing slightly more than half the current american force , underlined his resolve to quickly wind down the second war of his presidency mr obama did not match the lofty tone of his inauguration speech , but the address was clearly intended to be its workmanlike companion in place of his ringing call for a more equitable society was a package of proposals that constitute a blueprint for the remainder of his presidency some would require legislation others merely an executive order
tel aviv from around the mid1980s through the '90s , a generation in the west grew up on parties and raves as a culture , gai behar explained , his shirt unbuttoned to the navel and a collection of chains hanging over his chest from 1999 through the mid2000s , mr behar produced similar underground music events in basements and parking lots in israel sharon eyal , already a celebrated dancer and upandcoming choreographer , was an occasional , if timid , guest i remember i used to come to his parties and run away because it was scary for me , she said , wearing a pink collared blouse studded with small gold spikes for me , nothing is too much , but this moment was too much shy and softspoken , ms eyal is nevertheless connected to mr behar and his world she invited him to a rehearsal in 2005 , and soon they were a pair in life and in art , creating work for some of the top dance troupes here and abroad until last year they did so under the umbrella of the batsheva dance company , israel s premier contemporary dance troupe , where ms eyal , now 41 , was the house choreographer for 11 years and , before that , a star dancer as comfortable and supportive as the arrangement was , it was imperfect when you go to other companies , it s like being a guest , said mr behar , 36 , who has no formal dance training your own troupe , ms eyal interjected , is your home their new home , \( heart in hebrew \) , will make its american debut at the in becket , mass , wednesday through next sunday ms eyal s choreography was shown at jacob s pillow by the norwegian company in 2011 but this is the first time ms eyal and mr behar s work will be seen there with their own dancers and creative team fittingly , they 're presenting a piece called house but far from a cozy haven , this house throbs with a rave s raw , bright energy what s onstage does n't resemble a rave in a literal sense , and the playfully mischievous music by ori lichtik , a member of the lev family , has none of techno s aggressive , metallic repetition but the work does induce a trancelike , hypnotic state , the tripping experience , as mr behar refers to it if the duo s previous pieces , like bill for batsheva or too beaucoup for hubbard street dance chicago , feel epic and universal in their size and scope , then house is an extreme closeup the dancers totaling nine , including ms eyal nicknamed the first of three sections the family , a nod to its intimacy and perhaps also a recognition of what is being built here after ms eyal s departure from the family that raised her batsheva entered a golden age when the choreographer took over in 1990 but to credit him solely with the troupe s thrilling transformation would be to overlook ms eyal s significant contributions as muse , singular interpreter of his work and feral company choreographer in her own right that artistic lineage attracted ella baff , the executive and artistic director of jacob s pillow i'm interested in what happens generationally , she said , explaining that her respect for mr naharin s work and his endorsement of ms eyal put lev on her radar they 've been embraced and nurtured by an organization , but they want to do something different ms eyal said she was grateful for her time with batsheva and described the breakup in romantic terms you separate from your lover , and you start to understand who you are without him you learn so much about yourself the split was amiable it was n't suddenly this exodus , said doug letheren , who left batsheva to join lev it was organic but ms eyal became something of a reluctant pied piper anyway , and mr letheren and others have followed as a dancer , to really build something with someone who you believe in so much , it s kind of the best thing you can do , mr letheren said his sentiment is similar to the way dancers often describe their devotion to mr naharin whether this magnetism is passed from mentor to prot g or is merely the mark of similar souls , ms eyal s dancers speak of her with a sense of reverence bordering on obsession , a feeling she returns still , the moment of separation created a seismic shift almost half of batsheva departed , and the company had to refresh its ranks with dancers from its junior company and a few from abroad mr naharin declined to comment on the transition but maintains that ms eyal has his blessing meanwhile , lev generated ample excitement at a showcase of israeli dance here in december , leading to performance dates around europe in 2014 , as well as its american debut at jacob s pillow it s an impressive beginning , consistent with a company from the startup nation , as israel has been branded , a reference both to its own scrappy origins in 1948 and to the tech boom of the past decade the cultural scene has soaked up a bit of that risk taking nevertheless , ms eyal remains a devotee of gaga , the movement language mr naharin developed , and she uses it as the foundation for lev s training , maintaining an energetic and qualitative link between the two groups much of the actual movement material is generated from watching ms eyal improvise in the studio and distilling her movements to their most elemental parts , mr letheren said it s like watching an open heart and mind undo itself , he said in addition to their choreography s precise movements , ms eyal and mr behar have put an aesthetic stamp on their work their creations for lev , batsheva and other companies all feature a variation of monochromatic white or nudecolored unitards , often paired with whitened hair simultaneously sensual and a bit cold this aesthetic , the creators explain , acts as a blank slate , an erasing mechanism through which the personality of each dancer emerges physical traits disappear , and what s left is just a family of open hearts undoing themselves this is my fetish , ms eyal said i like when people are going extreme
law enforcement officials in oregon say they have disrupted a plot by a student to set off explosives at his high school in what one official described on sunday as a videogame style of killing people reminiscent of the columbine high school massacre the suspect , grant a acord , 17 , was arrested thursday at his home in albany , ore , said john haroldson , the district attorney of benton county mr haroldson said in an interview that the police had confiscated several explosive devices and that mr acord appeared to be trying to get more weapons we intervened on this before he could get all the materials that he wanted , mr haroldson said the fullblown plan would have involved even more bombs it would have involved rifles he said mr acord would be formally charged on tuesday investigators believe that the intended target was west albany high school , where mr acord is a student after the arrest , officers searched the school for explosives but found none the initial security search will be followed up by a more extensive school search , which will include the use of an explosives detection k9 from the oregon state police , to ensure that the campus is safe for students' return to class on tuesday , an albany police department statement said albany , a city of about 50 , 000 people , is 70 miles from portland the police began their investigation after receiving a tip that associated grant acord with manufacturing a destructive device with the intent of detonating it at a school , the statement said as of sunday , any motives were unclear mr acord s family has made no public statements the authorities would not say when the attack was to be carried out , but mr haroldson said the police had recovered a detailed checklist and a timeline he said no single person appeared to be the target mr haroldson also said mr acord had taken a substantial step towards carrying out the crime , but would give no further details
ed zitron may not be the savviest public relations person around when he emailed a new york times business editor , he asked for the strictest anonymity about his complaint that a writer for the you re the boss smallbusiness blog was demanding money as a trade for mentioning his clients but he also sent a copy of that email to the public editor my office s automated email response informs senders that their email may be printed , and says , in essence , please tell us now if you don t want that to happen \( we , of course , comply with those requests \) he never did so while he spoke anonymously to gawker to make his alarming complaint which that web site made much of earlier this week i was able to interview him , on the record , by phone on tuesday i also spoke to the blogger , cliff oxford , and to loren feldman , the editor of the you re the boss blog accusations flew about mr zitron , who says that for about a year he has run a oneman shop public relations agency , claims that mr oxford demanded a quid pro quo \( mr zitron s credibility may not be goldplated for example , his web site says ezpr operates out of new york city , but he told me that he splits his time between suburban new jersey and north carolina which is , quite literally i suppose , out of new york city \) from the word go , i was always talking about coverage , mr zitron said the deal , as he came to understand it , was essentially this mr oxford would write about mr zitron s clients if his expenses , and maybe more , were paid in trade such an arrangement would be in complete opposition to the times s guidelines for ethical journalism at first , he said , things went well i was really happy i thought i was going to get my clients in the new york times but when they couldn t come to terms because mr oxford was demanding more , mr zitron said he felt he needed to go public with what he now saw as an ethical lapse i was getting freaked out by the escalating demands , he told me mr oxford and his editor said that none of that was ever the case , and an email chain backs them up , if imperfectly in his role as a business consultant for the oxford center for entrepreneurs , mr oxford said he considered taking on mr zitron s tech startup clients but ultimately rejected them he is adamant that there was never any discussion of a payoff or trade for writing about the companies in the times blog nor would he ever do such a thing , he said but , to my mind , he wasn t clear enough about that in his correspondence and in his interview with me , some of mr oxford s statements strained the belief that he is a straight shooter for example , he told me with a flat no that he doesn t find his association with the times s small business blog helpful in his consulting business i don t want to mix the two at all , he said however , the home page of his web site prominently features two references to his times writing several of his blog posts are featured there and , separately , viewers see a link to the you re the boss blog as another example of this tendency , mr oxford at first denied that he had threatened this week to sue mr zitron i asked because mr zitron sent me an email from mr oxford that read you are deliberately falsifying information since your companies did not get free ride with oxford center you are running a smear campaign and we will address in a judicial proceeding we are looking right now into appropriate venue it also appears you altered emails please do not erase anything on your hard drive when i pressed mr oxford , he admitted to a little too much passion in his correspondence mr feldman , who came to the times from inc magazine and has run the blog for four years , understands the difficulties of asking business people who are not professional journalists to be his writing staff the challenges are real , they re significant and i lose sleep over them , he told me but he believes that the blog s content offers something to small business owners that they can t get elsewhere the expertise of more experienced small businesspeople , and the willingness to join discussions and share their stories the blog s 232 , 000 twitter followers \( nytsmallbiz \) suggest that many find it valuable mr feldman told me that he makes it clear to his writers that they must avoid conflicts of interest the blog sometimes takes us into gray areas , he said , but this wasn t one of them in the end , i don t believe that mr oxford demanded payment for a writeup in the times blog in fact , there is evidence to the contrary in the very emails quoted in gawker , mr oxford wrote i would like to be very clear that this trip is for my own understanding and i am not representing nyt this time that s clear enough but then , muddying the waters , he added , if i see a worthy story , i will engage in that capacity given mr zitron s behavior and mr oxford s lack of clarity , the situation was troubled from the start let s err on the side of mercy and call it a misunderstanding
those who argue that media representations have no impact on how certain groups of people are perceived might want to cover their ears when taylor coleman speaks ms coleman is one of the three teenagers at the center of the docuseries which has its premiere on lifetime on tuesday , and boy , does she believe what she hears being a preacher s daughter , she reckons , gives her license to misbehave , because after all , that s what preachers' daughters are supposed to do , right \? chafing against authority is virtually her job her ultimate transgressive idea \? talking about being a stripper , or even a porn star , because their lives appear free naturally that sends her father , a pentecostal preacher who describes himself as a warden , into paroxysms of prayer god , please , do n't ever let my daughter become a porn star while he s at it , he should also pray she does n't settle for becoming a cast member on bad girls club either ms coleman is the most aggressive of the three stars of this show , all of whom are radiant in their youth and challenging to their parents kolby koloff is seeking permission from her parents one of whom is the former professional wrestler , now a preacher to date for the first time olivia perry has a baby but is uncertain who the father is , driving her parents to tears as well as prayer these interactions have none of the dark drama found on teen mom or 16 and pregnant at least not yet preachers' daughters hinges on the inescapable premise that the more difficult the stars become say , ms coleman frolicking with a handsy boy while wearing a notquitethere bathing suit , as she does in the premiere the more tantalizing this show will become but the parents have their arsenals too ms coleman s father s draconian rules ms perry s empathetic father s tears and forgiveness and ms koloff s mother s discomfiting frankness about intimacy \( she is also a preacher \) , repeating phrases like finger sex often enough so as to rob them of all erotic power there are many more examples of reality tv s capitalizing on young people willing to show off their indiscretions than of its depicting communities of faith standing strong in the face of moral turpitude that means that participating in this show is a gambit of sorts for the parents here , who are using their children s growing pains as a gateway narrative in hopes of ultimately reaffirming faithbased messages trying to turn reality tv into a values vessel but reality tv has its own designs , and influence the stars only have so long to misbehave before they age out of this show that means that later seasons , if they come , may well be stocked with a new wave of preachers' daughters who are watching at home , taking notes

cairo a year after the ouster of president hosni mubarak , the man responsible for rooting out government corruption , gen mohamed farid eltohamy , faced a very public barrage of allegations that he had deliberately covered up years of cronyism and selfdealing president mohamed morsi promptly fired the general , prosecutors opened an investigation , the news filled the papers and his career appeared to end in disgrace but now the general is back , and more powerful than ever his prot g and friend , gen abdulfattah elsisi , ousted mr morsi about four months ago , and virtually the first move by the new government was to rehabilitate general tohamy and place him in charge of the general intelligence service , one of the most powerful positions in egypt western diplomats and egyptians close to the government say general tohamy has emerged as the leading advocate of the lethal crackdown on mr morsi s islamist supporters in the muslim brotherhood , in a drive to eviscerate the movement any public trace of the corruption charges leveled by one of the general s own investigators has disappeared what happened to the prosecutors' claim of evidence of his corruption and obstruction of justice \? asked hossam bahgat , one of the few egyptian human rights advocates willing to publicly criticize general tohamy why was he ousted in that humiliating fashion \? why was he brought back from retirement the morning after the military takeover \? he continued there is zero public discussion of these very serious questions general tohamy declined to be interviewed for this article and did not answer written questions no court has evaluated the allegations against him his accuser , lt col moatassem fathi , a police officer , has also declined to be interviewed in a television appearance last fall , he acknowledged that at one point he temporarily quit working for general tohamy at the administrative oversight authority , the main anticorruption watchdog he was upset over a job transfer that he deemed punitive , and it could have left him with a grudge but critics of general tohamy say he was the quintessential mubarak man , the handpicked guardian of the system of corruption and impunity that was a central grievance of the revolution of january 2011 and his swift and silent return , the critics say , signals a restoration of the old order after the military takeover yezid sayigh , a researcher at the carnegie middle east center in beirut , lebanon , who has written about the administrative oversight authority , asked of all the qualified people in egypt , why bring in tohamy , who is way past his retirement age and under a cloud already \? why is this so urgent \? western officials who have met with general tohamy and other leaders of the militaryled government say he quickly distinguished himself as the most influential advocate of a crackdown he was the most hardline , the most absolutely unreformed , one western diplomat said , speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings with general tohamy he talked as if the revolution of 2011 had never even happened general sisi and the civilian ministers around him initially pledged to try to include mr morsi s islamist supporters in a new democratic process for more than a month , general sisi appeared to consider the arguments of former vice president mohamed elbaradei and a few others urging restraint in the interest of reconciliation with the islamists , who had camped out by the tens of thousands at sitins protesting the takeover but within days of the takeover , general tohamy was already arguing against any inclusion of the muslim brotherhood , the islamist group that led the voting in elections for parliament and the presidency its members were terrorists whose movement must be excluded and crushed , general tohamy argued , according to the western officials who met with him and with egyptians in the new government by midaugust , general tohamy had prevailed security forces stormed the islamist sitins , killing nearly a thousand demonstrators in the largest mass killings in modern egyptian history \( more than 40 security officers were killed that day in a backlash from the islamists , some armed \) all the state and private television networks adopted the same vocabulary as general tohamy egypt fighting terrorism , ran a banner the networks affixed to their screens , in arabic and in english islamists accused general tohamy of a vendetta against mr morsi revenge is a powerful motivator , said wael haddara , a former morsi adviser now living in canada under mr mubarak , the spy chief , gen omar suleiman , became the president s alter ego and ultimately his vice president but the spy service deeply distrusted mr morsi , egypt s first freely elected president , according to egyptians and westerners who met with senior intelligence officials in june , a top intelligence official publicly urged egyptians to join the demonstrations demanding mr morsi s ouster , and since then credible news reports have said the intelligence services had been spying on mr morsi to that may now be used against him , possibly in a criminal trial in contrast , general sisi , egypt s de facto new leader , had a long relationship with general tohamy they climbed together through the ranks of the egyptian infantry , where general tohamy , 66 , had become a mentor to general sisi , 58 , according to egyptians and western officials who know both officers general tohamy had served as head of military intelligence , and he helped pick general sisi as his successor that was when general tohamy took over the administrative oversight authority , a secretive agency run by the egyptian military it is a singular combination of a domestic spy service and an auditing bureau historians say president gamal abdel nasser created it in the years after he led the 1952 military coup , to keep the army on top of his everexpanding civilian bureaucracy the authority conducts its own electronic surveillance and operates its own jails former detainees , speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals , say both suspects and witnesses under interrogation were sometimes confined there for months without any judicial process , or any assurance of release , and its extrajudicial detentions appear to have continued under mr morsi but the authority reports to the president mubarak , and presidents before him , used it to exercise a form of control that stood above the state , said mr sayigh of the carnegie center it could be used to reward or punish whenever it suited the president as soon as mr mubarak handed power to the generals in 2011 , colonel fathi , the investigator , filed detailed charges with prosecutors accusing general tohamy of colluding in the corruption he was supposed to root out , the colonel later said but the case was quickly transferred to a military court and disappeared , he added when mr morsi was sworn in as president in june 2012 , his power was initially circumscribed by a simultaneous military takeover of all legislative authority when the generals finally yielded power in august , colonel fathi proclaimed that the transfer had dismantled the last shackle on freedom as the revolution had promised he refiled his charges and this time went public , declaring in the interview that general tohamy is one of the reasons for the corruption egypt has suffered for the last 30 years he is protecting the former regime , colonel fathi said in the television interview , colonel fathi said he had earned a master s degree in forensic accounting and worked for 10 years in a secret unit handling delicate cases he accused general tohamy of consistently thwarting the agency s investigators by locking away evidence in a secret safe general tohamy had covered up reports that mr mubarak s sons , gamal and alaa , were given use of a governmentbought private plane , called eagle 2 , and a yacht , colonel fathi said he also said that he had personally written reports on allegations against both mr mubarak and ahmed shafik , the former president s last prime minister and then a presidential candidate , but that general tohamy squashed them you write all the information and you submit them as cases , but they do n't come out , colonel fathi said in the interview he said that he had firsthand knowledge of 14 cases general tohamy blocked to protect senior officials , including a general who was governor of north sinai and another general who was minister of military production in two cases , colonel fathi described charges that prosecutors or judges later rejected , citing a lack of evidence colonel fathi said that he and his colleagues had filed a 40page report detailing charges of bribes and payoffs involving the sale of vast acreage of public land outside cairo under the minister of housing , mohamed ibrahim soliman in one example , he said , the owners of the maxime development company sold mr soliman two luxurious apartments on omar ibn alkhattab street for about 100 , 000 but a sale to a publicly owned bank around the same time put the value of the two units at more than 15 million , mr fathi said and around the same time as the apartments' sale , mr soliman arranged a deal involving 90 acres of public land for the same company , maxime , colonel fathi said in the interview general tohamy censored the report to just a few pages and left out all the evidence mr soliman , who left office in 2005 , said in an interview this week that he was innocent of any crime he said that while mr mubarak was still in power , prosecutors had dropped the charges colonel fathi mentioned after concluding there was insufficient evidence under military rule after mr mubarak s ouster and then under mr morsi , however , mr soliman was arrested on other corruption charges , jailed for two and a half years , and forced to surrender millions of dollars he was released last week , under the new government , and he is awaiting a retrial for one of the charges he said the charges against him were politically motivated colonel fathi also said that general tohamy had covered up documents , wiretaps , surveillance and testimony that showed that farid khamees , chairman of the industrial affairs committee in the upper house of parliament , had paid more than 300 , 000 to bribe two senior judges mr khamees s lawyers later confessed to delivering the bribes on his behalf and the judges who received them quit or were fired , but mr khamees , who also owns the rug giant oriental weavers , was acquitted for lack of evidence of criminal intent , according to news reports farid eldeeb , lawyer for mr khamees and for the mubaraks , declined to comment colonel fathi said general tohamy had protected others in the supreme council of the armed forces who had profited from the smuggling of subsidized fuel , some accumulating fortunes of as much as 7 million there are complete cases of corruption involving officials at the military council known to everybody , including the council members , colonel fathi said in the interview \( he volunteered that general sisi was not involved \) general tohamy himself had received millions of pounds in gifts from state companies , colonel fathi said , and in turn used his agency s budget to buy birthday gifts worth as much as 16 , 000 a year for the former defense minister , field marshal mohamed hussein tantawi , and other presents for mr mubarak s sons m cherif bassiouni , an egyptianamerican legal scholar who has worked with egypt and western governments on efforts to find the stolen assets abroad , said the administrative oversight authority was one of the few institutions that could have helped locate them but it consistently failed to provide the needed financial records , he said the administrative oversight authority has the evidence , but none of that was ever disclosed , mr bassiouni said that is why egypt has never recovered a penny learning of colonel fathi s allegations , two senior morsi advisers , rifaa tahtawy and assad elsheika , called the colonel to the presidential palace , according to other former officials and news reports , and mr morsi soon fired general tohamy \( mr morsi , mr tahtawy and mr sheika are now in detention \) colonel fathi had quit around the start of 2011 after the job transfer , convinced he had been punished for his reports but he later won his old job back now , surprisingly , he is still there at work , although he has been transferred again to a more limited job outside cairo they have got him locked in the basement , mr soliman , the former housing minister accused in colonel fathi s reports , said with satisfaction
washington the senate republican leader , , made clear on sunday that he would oppose any effort by the obama administration to raise more tax revenue and that he remained focused on finding ways to cut spending as the government grapples with its debt the tax issue is finished , mr mcconnell over completed that s behind us mr mcconnell s interviews on three sunday morning programs came just days after he and vice president joseph r biden jr to the latest fiscal crisis and as washington over debt and spending mr mcconnell s stance on taxes countered calls from democrats , and even some house republicans , to revamp the tax code to close some provisions and raise new revenue but mr mcconnell did say he would favor changes if they were revenue neutral , meaning that lower rates would be paid for by limiting deductions and closing loopholes mr mcconnell s focus on the need for spending cuts was relentless in his interviews on abc , nbc and cbs he was equally insistent that president obama must take the lead on fiscal plans his remarks stood in contrast to comments from the senate s no 2 democrat , richard j durbin of illinois , who that there was plenty of room to increase revenue by examining deductions , credits , special treatments under the tax code mr mcconnell s position also , who said in his weekly address that he remained open to both spending cuts and further tax increases the fiscal agreement last week made tax cuts permanent for most households and put off big spending cuts mr obama , who was speaking from hawaii before returning to washington on sunday , emphasized his own line in the sand now that the government has reached its statutory borrowing limit , mr obama said , congress had no choice but to raise it to avoid a damaging default he said the matter was not up for negotiation if congress refuses to give the united states the ability to pay its bills on time , the consequences for the entire global economy could be catastrophic , mr obama said our families and our businesses cannot afford that dangerous game again mr mcconnell repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether he supported republican senators who have suggested that a default and even a brief shutdown of the government might be necessary to secure deep spending cuts my answer is hopefully we do n't need to get to that point , he said on abc the president surely must know we 're spending way too much so why do n't we do something about reducing spending \? mr mcconnell also suggested that other obama administration priorities , including a new push for gun restrictions after the connecticut school shooting , might have to wait mr mcconnell was asked about reports that mr biden , whom mr obama charged with developing proposals to address gun violence , had confidently  mr mcconnell seemed to cast cold water on that notion the biggest problem we have at the moment is spending and debt , he said that s going to dominate the congress between now and the end of march none of these issues , i think , will have the kind of priority that spending and debt will have

greenburgh , ny ryan mcdonagh was in s face all night in the ' seriesleveling 43 victory wednesday at madison square garden but with game 5 at verizon center on friday , the will have the last line change and may have an easier time getting ovechkin free of his blueshirts shadow mcdonagh , however , has not been ovechkin s sole nemesis the last two games , we 've had better structure with our forwards in the neutral zone , mcdonagh said if he gets through there , we 're able to have good gaps because of our structure we talk about having to defend in units of five up the ice in five , and backcheck in five the strategy paid off in the rangers' two victories at the garden ovechkin was limited to two shots on goal in game 3 and only one in game 4 mcdonagh was on the ice 17 minutes 13 seconds of the 23 26 ovechkin played in game 4 on ovechkin s other nine shifts , the rangers never missed a beat with mcdonagh and his defense partner , dan girardi , taking a breather in the capitals' 10 overtime victory in game 2 , mcdonagh was off for 7 of ovechkin s 22 shifts 6 11 of the 23 54 ovechkin played including the game s final shift , in the eighth minute of overtime but with mcdonagh in the penalty box for delaying the game , ovechkin assisted on mike green s gamewinning goal coach john tortorella said thursday that the rangers were not defending against the capitals' top line any differently on the road we 're playing defense the way we always play defense , tortorella said any top line , that s any team s strategy , to try to keep them in their own end zone no one s reinventing the wheel here in this series left wing taylor pyatt knocked ovechkin down once wednesday and blocked one of his shots but he said his line was not assigned to ovechkin it just happened to be on the ice at the time we talked about our structure in the neutral zone , pyatt said a lot of time it s positioning , where our forwards are supposed to be , where the defense is supposed to be it does n't matter which one of our lines is out there at the capitals' practice in arlington , va , on thursday , ovechkin had a different impression of tortorella s strategy of course , they put callahan against our line we 're on to what he s going to do , he told reporters he tries to make it a physical contest girardi and mcdonagh , they just stay back and try to block the shot capitals coach adam oates said it would be difficult to free ovechkin from mcdonagh and girardi in game 5 because they play those two guys so much girardi is averaging 26 32 a game , with mcdonagh at 24 57 , including 31 29 in game 4 in games 1 and 2 in washington , ovechkin had 12 shots and a goal and an assist when ovechkin and his linemates , nicklas backstrom and marcus johansson , see mcdonagh and girardi on the bench in game 5 , they will probably skate against the defense pairing of anton stralman and john moore mac and danny did a phenomenal job here in new york , moore said but with the matchups being the way they are on the road , the onus falls on guys like me and strals and other guys in our lineup so we 'll have to be on our toes according to mcdonagh , it does not matter which line or defense pairing is on the ice matched against ovechkin we 're not focusing so much individually who s out there against their top line as opposed to playing as a fiveman unit , strong in the defensive zone , strong in the neutral zone , and trying to sustain our forecheck , mcdonagh said slap shots defenseman marc staal was not at the rangers' optional practice thursday after unexpectedly sitting out wednesday s game 4 without any explanation from the team but it seems as if staal pulled himself from the lineup out of concern that his damaged eyesight might cost the rangers i think it s an honest and humble decision by him knowing he did n't want to put the team in any jeopardy , defenseman ryan mcdonagh said after the game it takes a lot of guts to do that on thursday , coach john tortorella declined to answer a question about whether staal would return during the series asked about mcdonagh s comments about staal , tortorella said mac should shut up it s none of his business
east rutherford , nj the giants have lost so many starting players during the preseason that after another key contributor went down thursday night , it did not discernibly rattle the mood inside the team s locker room the next day the giants were disheartened by the left leg fracture that running back andre brown sustained in a loss to the new england patriots on thursday but on friday , the focus quickly turned to who could replace him and who among those previously injured might return in time to face the dallas cowboys in the season opener sept 8 yeah , obviously when you lose a running back , a guy who s going to play a decent amount , it s tough , eli manning said but we 've got a couple other backs that have been in the system for a little while still , none of those backs have extensive game experience with the giants , or any other nfl team the question now is whether the giants will take a leap of faith with their untested backs or sign a castoff from another team after mandatory , leaguewide roster cuts friday and saturday then there is the possibility that brown will return in four to six weeks will the giants simply stand pat and wait \? brown has had more tests on his leg , an injury he called a small fracture , and tom coughlin acknowledged that the results of those tests might influence the team s decisions as cuts are made saturday we need some true definition of how long this injury is going to be , and once we understand that , i think there will be some discussions about a lot of different things , coughlin said the secondyear running back david wilson , who was already expected to have a principal role at the position , may now be counted on to do more , a responsibility that wilson accepted whatever they need to me to do , i can do it , wilson said friday if they need me to kick a field goal , i 'll go out there and try the field goal but there is some worry that wilson could be overused , even if he does not have to kick he cannot play every snap at running back you do have to be aware of the number of plays and have that in the back of your mind , coughlin said david is a guy who has outstanding endurance and strength i'm not aware of what the number might be , but i'm sure we 'll work that out for now , the giants are apparently not interested in bringing back running back brandon jacobs , a free agent who last played for them during the 2011 season but much could change after rosters are trimmed this weekend
the global outpouring of respect for nelson mandela suggests that we 're not just saying goodbye to the man at his death but that we 're losing a certain kind of leader , unique on the world stage today , and we are mourning that just as much mandela had an extraordinary amount of moral authority why \? and how did he get it \? much of the answer can be deduced from one scene in one movie about mandela that invictus just to remind , it tells the story of mandela s one and only term as president of south africa , when he enlists the country s famed rugby team , the springboks , on a mission to win the 1995 rugby world cup and , through that , to start the healing of that apartheidtorn land before the games , though , the sports committee in the postapartheid , newly blackled south africa tells mandela that it wants to change the name and colors of the almost allwhite springboks to something more reflective of black african identity but mandela refuses he tells his black sports officials that an essential part of making whites feel at home in a blackled south africa was not uprooting all their cherished symbols that is selfish thinking , mandela , played by morgan freeman , says in the movie it does not serve the nation then speaking of south africa s whites , mandela adds , we have to surprise them with restraint and generosity there are so many big leadership lessons in this short scene the first is that one way leaders generate moral authority is by being willing to challenge their own base at times and not just the other side it is easy to lead by telling your own base what it wants to hear it is easy to lead when you 're giving things away it is easy to lead when things are going well but what s really difficult is getting your society to do something big and hard and together and the only way to do that is by not only asking the other side s base to do something hard in south africa s case , asking whites to cede power to black majority rule but to challenge your own base to do hard things , too in south africa s case , asking blacks to avoid revenge after so many years of brutal , entrenched , white rule dov seidman , whose company , lrn , advises ceo s on governance and who is the author of the book how , argues that another source of mandela s moral authority derived from the fact that he trusted his people with the truth rather than just telling them what they wanted to hear leaders who trust people with the truth , hard truths , are trusted back , said seidman leaders who do n't generate anxiety and uncertainty in their followers , who usually deep down know the truth and are not really relieved , at least for long , by having it ignored or disguised finally , said seidman , mandela did big things by making himself small through his uncommon humility and his willingness to trust his people with the truth , explained seidman , mandela created a hopeful space where enough south africans trusted each other enough so could unite and do the hard work of transition together what is so inspiring about mandela , explained seidman , is that he did not make the moment of south africa s transition about himself it was not about being in jail for 27 years it was not about need for retribution it was about seizing a really big moment to go from racism to pluralism without stopping for revenge mandela did not make himself the hope , added seidman he saw his leadership challenge as inspiring hope in others , so they would do the hard work of reconciliation it was in that sense that he accomplished big things by making himself smaller than the moment to put it another way , mandela , and his partner , south african president fw de klerk , got enough of their people to transcend their past rather than to wallow in it so much of american politics today , noted seidman , is about shifting , not elevating , people so much of american politics today is about how i narrowcast to this polltested demographic in this zip code to get just enough voters to shift to my side to give me 501 percent just enough to win office , but not to govern or do anything big and hard mandela s leadership genius was his ability to enlist a critical mass of south africans to elevate , to go to a new place , not just shift a few votes at the margin it is precisely the absence of such leadership in so many countries today that has motivated millions of superempowered individuals in different countries in the last four years from iran to egypt to tunisia to turkey to ukraine to flock to public squares what is striking , though , is the fact that none of these tahrir square movements have built sustainable democratic alternatives yet that is a big , hard project , and it can only be done together and it turns out that generating that unity of purpose and focus still requires a leader , but the right kind of leader people are rejecting leaders who rule by the formal authority of their position and command by hierarchical power , said seidman , but they are craving genuine leadership leaders who lead by their moral authority to inspire , to elevate others and to enlist us in a shared journey
rawabi , west bank two students came up with rawabi , the arabic word for hills , in a competition to name this new palestinian city , the first to have been planned from the ground up the developers rejected suggestions like arafat city and jihad city that evoked a more chaotic past the new generation is building this city , said bashar masri , 52 , the palestinian businessman who has headed and says he will be moving into a duplex penthouse in the town center once it is completed every palestinian has a duty to participate in nation building , he told reporters on a tour of the site last week halfway between jerusalem and nablus , rawabi is a short commute from ramallah , the palestinian authority s bustling administrative capital in the west bank palestinian flags fluttered from the tractors and cranes , and a huge one flew outside the tasteful sales office , a symbol that was clearly visible from ateret , a jewish settlement of 100 families on a nearby hilltop but like a microcosm of the palestinian state in the making , the building of rawabi is a continual struggle its future growth depends on a precarious political environment and the cooperation of israel because of rawabi s location , mr masri says , he and his colleagues spend about 70 percent of their time on issues like water and obtaining permits promised funds from the palestinian authority never materialized , posing an additional challenge the sales team began marketing apartments here a few months ago , aiming at middle to uppermiddleclass palestinian buyers the developers say the first phase of more than 600 apartments has already sold out and will be ready for occupancy early next year the master plan comprises 6 , 000 apartments and ultimately up to 40 , 000 people the buildings , faced in locally quarried stone with features like archways , are organized along quiet culdesacs in orderly neighborhoods to be linked by green walkways and outer ring roads the slopes offer views of the surrounding countryside in addition to offices , plans for the city center include shopping arcades , cafes , restaurants , movie theaters and a convention center built around a central piazza the political ambiguity of the area has , however , caused endless complications amir dajani , deputy managing director of the bayti real estate investment company , which is building the city , said the company had spent 80 million to 100 million a year in israel on knowhow and materials like cement , which he called a true example of an economy for peace but there is no airport or port in the palestinian authority territories , meaning that all imports have to come by way of israel we still have to deal with the israeli occupation , mr dajani said , referring to the division of the west bank into different areas of authority under the overall rule of the israeli military although the project was announced in 2007 and construction began two years ago , it took until june 2012 to secure a temporary permit from israel , renewable annually , for a narrow , winding access road to the site that is because a milelong segment of the road passes through a part of the west bank that remains under full israeli control there have also been problems with water , which israel provides through the palestinian water authority the developers say that the current water supply is insufficient and that they are working feverishly to ensure adequate water by the time residents move in israeli security officials said that part of the problem was that the developers wanted to transfer water through territory under full israeli control rather than that of the palestinian authority and that discussions were under way to resolve the issue the project has also come under attack from the palestinian boycott , divestment and sanctions national committee , which opposes any normal ties with israel the committee has accused mr masri of promoting his private interests at the expense of palestinian rights and of whitewashing the israeli occupation the developers say they prefer to use palestinian products wherever possible but the whole venture comes with high risk if the environment changes for the better , the developers say , rawabi may serve as a model for future entrepreneurs if not , they may have to downsize the vision was not only to provide affordable housing but also to create thousands of jobs in construction and in the city s business district rawabi is hoping to attract international technology and communications companies to set up outsourcing and researchanddevelopment hubs in the city an additional objective was to create geographic contiguity among the palestinian cities in israelisettler parlance , to establish a fact on the ground but mr masri , the founder , said his idea was conceived as a commercial venture and not an altruistic one bitter at turns , he said that at this point it was not clear when or if the company would break even mr masri , who lived in the united states for 25 years , has learned to adapt to adverse circumstances during the anarchic years of the second intifada , or uprising , his local service companies were failing , so in 2004 he decided to diversify and did well building low and middleincome housing in morocco when he embarked on the rawabi project , he said , he soon found that he was in over his head financially a company owned by the qatari government agreed to put in twothirds of the rawabi budget , now said to be in excess of 1 billion the project has attracted almost no international financing despite the billions of dollars that donor nations have given to the palestinian authority four years ago the palestinian authority agreed to pay for the building of schools , a police station and some other public amenities in rawabi at a cost of 150 million none of that money materialized bayti real estate had to foot those bills as well mr masri said he was disappointed that the authority had not set rawabi as a priority today we have the full support of our government , but now they are broke , he added apartment prices range from about 60 , 000 to 200 , 000 and are said to be 15 percent to 20 percent lower than market prices in ramallah adel and amal kaabi and their four children are moving into a new threebedroom apartment here next year asked why they chose rawabi , mr kaabi , 47 , the manager of a branch of an insurance company in ramallah , said , there will be a system working here , public amenities and no chaos the managers say that the buyers are mostly professionals who are educated and internetsavvy the majority are twoincome families who work in the private sector the average household head is nearly 42 years old of the 7 percent of buyers who are single professionals , most are women eleven percent of the buyers are christians , a higher proportion than in general palestinian society where christians make up 2 percent or less of the population there are plans for a greek orthodox church as well as a domed central mosque in the sales pitch , which includes a 3d movie , the promoters of rawabi present it as offering both a liberal lifestyle and an authentic palestinian environment while promotional videos show men in suits on cellphones and women with flowing hair and figurehugging clothes , they also feature men smoking water pipes , women with islamic head scarves and a troupe performing the , an arab folk dance when he was a child in nablus , mr masri said , displaying a palestinian flag was enough to get someone shot or carted off to an israeli prison now , he said , he has no doubt that the state is coming the question now is , will i see the palestinian state \? he said or my children \?
the artist pilvi takala won this year s emdash award from frieze and the 10 , 000 that comes with it just to give the money away her decision is not an act of charity but a project that she calls a conceptual artwork that challenges 8 to 12yearolds from a lowincome neighborhood in london to suggest ways to spend her prize money she is giving them 7 , 000 , or about 11 , 000 , of the total , and will keep the rest to run the project and document the results if they want to buy candy with the whole budget , that s ok , but they have to be able to explain it , said the 32yearold artist that can be art artists do this art is a perfect place to have them do whatever they want because art is the best place to do unpredictability ms takala s videos and performances often explore how people react when she or others break unspoken cultural rules for example , in a 2006 slide show and performance she called bag lady , she walks around a berlin shopping mall with a plastic bag full of euro bills , gauging the reactions , and several shopkeepers try to convince her to use a more discreet purse in her 2008 video the trainee , she takes a job as a trainee at the financial advisory firm deloitte , only to spend whole days at an empty desk or riding up and down in an elevator , filming the reactions of her perplexed and frustrated coworkers it is ms takala s objective as an artist to subvert the rules and to see how people react to that subversion she was not as interested in what the children decided to do with the money as in how they reached their decision i wanted to create a situation where people who are not normally in power are in power , she said just the fact that you hand over this power to a group of kids is interesting enough as art , as experiment it does n't have a clear purpose this new project began in august when ms takala went to a youth center in east london and first met with the children who are acting as her committee she told them the rules essentially , that there are none only that they had to decide how to spend the money together , as a group they took that part quite seriously , ms takala said because it was their only real instruction then she asked the children to write down their first ideas , anonymously the results of their initial brainstorming a giant water slide a house for my mom a trip to jamaica a private treehouse for everyone on the east side over the next few days , ms takala took the children to the park , then to a film studio and spent a bit more time discussing their ideas , which led to more sophisticated plans for how to spend the money one boy named taylor proposed the idea of a giant sign of his name like graffiti , but a sign , said ms takala and though the children liked the notion it led to a debate about whether it made sense to use only one person s name or should they use everyone s name \? as the discussion progressed , the children thought it might be best to make a sign with the area s postal code , e3 , to include everyone then they switched to another idea to build a new piece of furniture beyond this , ms takala has declined to disclose any information about the children and their decisionmaking to me , it s as top secret as the pentagon papers , said ms takala i do n't want anyone to guess what it is before it s done the results , she said , will be revealed at frieze london this week , but she does not expect there to necessarily be any kind of obvious product that people can see , and probably nothing that resembles fine art , like a sculpture or a painting art did n't seem to be any kind of concern for this group , she said they were just thinking art can be anything , so it does n't matter which is nice , so i did n't have to go into that conversation about what is art \? ' ms takala was born in helsinki , educated in finland and has been living in istanbul on and off since 2005 she now lives there with her husband , the turkish artist ahmet ogut she has undertaken solo shows in london , amsterdam , berlin , lisbon and stockholm , and has won the prix de rome scholarship she won the norman prize for best short film at the stuttgart winter film festival in 2011 i was initially interested in takala s proposal because of its processfocused nature , nicola lees , the curator of the frieze foundation , which is responsible for the artist commissions for the fair , wrote in an email and also because it was a project that addresses the format of a prize with a notion of generosity and playfulness she said ms takala s project reminded her of marcel duchamp s fountain , a urinal he presented at the annual exhibition of the society of independent artists in new york in 1917 because the show was meant to be open to anyone , without judges or prizes , the society s refusal to exhibit duchamp s readymade pointed out the fact that people still had very clear ideas of what was art , and what was not ms lees said that this project , however , was more of a conceptual work , in which the process of creating the piece is more important than the results she compared it to recent works by artists like michael asher and palle nielsen , who both made artwork in which children were participants and cocreators it also references a piece by the libyanitalian artist adelita husnibey , whose 201011 video , postcards from the desert island documented a threeweek workshop in which french students were asked to build a desert island in their school hall , ms lees said the video shows them grappling with how to govern themselves , without the aid of adults , and the organized anarchy that ensues ms takala s students play in a similar type of sandpit , and she documented their progress on video as well during her first week with the children , she was particularly interested by their need for her approval for their ideas , though she repeatedly told them it was completely up to them to decide how to use the money ms lees has been fascinated by this pedagogical approach to art since 2008 , when she started working as senior curator of public programs for serpentine gallery in london , and it has been central to her work coordinating the frieze foundation s interdisciplinary program this year this complements the other frieze projects , as they all have a very performative feel about them and a focus which lies beyond the notion of an object' or a product , ' ms lees said with the recent pedagogical turn in curating , the art world is very used to works that operate in a similar way is ms lees concerned that the resulting artwork will be viewed as na ve or childish , and therefore undercut the professionalism of the fair \? she says that she expected the money to be spent in a childish way , but that the project is not only about how the money is spent it is about the artist s act of giving young people the power to make decisions as we all know , many artists have continued to endorse andr breton s declaration that the mind which plunges into surrealism relives with burning excitement the best part of childhood , ' ms lees said this is an example of the continuous dialogue about the notion of childishness in contemporary art for ms takala , it is particularly interesting to learn how the children came up with their own system to decide how to spend the money i wanted it to be a group decision to see how they then negotiate within the group , she said do they think everyone has to be happy , or do they just vote so that the majority have to be happy \? within this group of children how do they negotiate the outcome \? that s what i'm most curious about
this is the third installment of a  time magazine was planning to publish a commemorative issue on lincoln keya morgan , a young , successful collector , was asked to provide a copy of o118 for the junior senator from illinois , barack obama keya morgan he wrote a full article about my photo for time magazine , and the editors got the date wrong errol morris you mean o118 \? keya morgan yes i told him that the date was the 5th of february and later on , one of the publishers of time magazine put april 10 , 1865 under the photograph errol morris but obama liked the photograph \? keya morgan obama said it was his favorite photo of all time he wrote a whole article about it i didn t know who barack obama was i thought he had a funny name i googled him and found out he was a senator i thought , wow ! that s nice here is a senator who is africanamerican i thought , that s very unusual he was very polite and very nice errol morris but you re upset they got the date wrong keya morgan to me it s very important to have historical accuracy i was fascinated by the negatives that alexander gardner took i have looked at negatives he took that are in the smithsonian , the library of congress , the national archives , the chicago historical society actually , a few hundred institutions around the world errol morris and you are particularly interested in the negatives \? keya morgan because the negative is a direct mirror reflection of that person or animal or landmark or whatever it was that was in front of the camera , 150 years ago it s a mirror reflection it s like magic pure magic when you move away , the image doesn t move away it stays there for eternity until somebody destroys it or misplaces it it s like these horror movies where your reflection does other things than you do it s this magical thing that fascinates me wow ! lincoln is dead and decomposed and long gone for 150 years almost but here we are , seeing his direct , mirror reflection , right in front of us boom smack , right there and what s amazing when lincoln was standing there , there were light waves shooting out at 186 , 000 miles per second , hitting that collodion plate that emulsion was made directly from him i mean , that s incredible errol morris that the negative somehow connects us to lincoln keya morgan also , the negative tells me if it s an authentic photo there s a famous case a photo of general grant on a horse and long story short , it s not really grant they chopped off his head from the famous leaningonthetree pose that mathew brady took in 1864 and they put it on top of the body of another civil war general and then they put it on a background it s a 19thcentury version of photoshop three photographs amalgamated into one steve repp , a historian in galena , ill , was browsing through some books on the life of us grant when he noticed this detail repp told the story in the grant network newsletter as i turned the pages of mr lincoln s general , us grant , by roy meredith , 1959 , i noticed a photograph on page 220 the caption read , general grant and cincinnati in camp in virginia , the photograph is a composite , grant on horseback , mounted over a background picture upon further research , i found that this page 220 photo is really made from several photographs the head of usg is from the more common view of grant standing by the tree , \( see frontispiece of grant takes command \) the body of the general on horseback is really that of general alexander mccook , who fought in the western theater of the war i found his picture , on horseback in the image of war , volume 5 , page 32 the background photo is also from the image of war , volume 2 , page 338 both of these volumes are from a set published by the national historical society during my research , a fellow galena historian , h scott wolfe , graciously allowed me access to his private library my thanks to him for this kind gesture 1 repp contacted the publisher of the meredith book , but he never heard back i thought that if we could find out what kind of photograph the original was , we could determine the age , or when the photograph was put together the next time you look at old photographs , take a really good look , you might be surprised at what you find keya morgan started at an early age keya morgan i was 10 years old , i bought a photo of lincoln in a flea market on 25th street at sixth avenue i paid only 2 for it and i did some research and found out i bought an actual , original photograph of lincoln taken 150 years ago that just knocked the socks off me i was amazed i thought , i m having like a private moment with abraham lincoln errol morris which photo did you buy \? keya morgan the famous cooper union portrait of abraham lincoln lincoln told mathew brady that it was the photograph that made him president it was taken on feb 27 , 1860 , on broadway and when i bought it i was like , my god ! i called someone up and i sold it for 1 , 000 so for a 10yearold kid to make 1 , 000 well , technically i made 998 it s like , wow ! i just made 1 , 000 i told my friends in school they thought i was kidding i said , no , i really did i m not kidding i had discovered something that other antique dealers and collectors had not yet picked up in the late 80s there was no ebay there was no internet there was none of that nobody knew these photos were originals they were cartesdevisite a french name people didn t understand these little photos they re like , oh ! they re just two and a half inches by four inches they re like trading cards well , no no no they re not trading cards these are original photos errol morris how did you meet lloyd ostendorf \? keya morgan somebody told ostendorf that i had bought a portion of the fay collection for 28 years , herbert wells fay was the custodian of lincoln s tomb in a blog post , rich saal , photography editor of springfield s statejournal register , called fay a historian , archivist , tour guide , and ambassador to visitors from across the world saal wrote when he retired in 1948 at age 89 , fay boasted that 4 million visitors had signed the guest register at the tomb during his tenure fay was also a relentless , lifelong collector of lincoln related items , amassing an estimated 2 million historically significant photographs and artifacts valued in 1945 at a quarter million dollars 2 in the 1990s , keya morgan bought a portion of the fay collection valued at 15 million keya morgan i bought the fay collection in three portions it was multiple photos and artifacts and some letters it was a good investment i had just made a very big sale and when this opportunity came , i just jumped on it now , this is in my teen years , not when i was 10 i was 17 years old when i opened my first store in manhattan , which was a very scary thing i was in high school and everybody told me not to do it everybody told me that i d fail my father , my mother , my uncle everyone tried to convince me how crazy i was and the more they said that , the more i wanted to do it and within a year and a half my net worth was more than all of theirs combined errol morris what was your first really big sale \? keya morgan everything s a big sale when you are a kid i handled the grant collection , which was a 45 million collection for general grant s greatgrandson i was like late teens or early 20s when i handled that sale and then one of my biggest sales was to stanford university for the hoover archives i discovered hoover s letters and documents and stuff in colorado a woman called me she said she had boxes and boxes of letters from president hoover and she was going to throw them out because she had no space for the boxes and she didn t think they were worth anything because they were old letters so she asked me if they were worth anything i said , of course they are worth something are you kidding \? so she said , ok if you don t mind , i m either going to throw it out or send it to you because i can t take looking at these anymore so i said , all right send it to me i gave her my fedex account number and she sent it over and i opened box after box after box as a teenager of letters of herbert hoover in one of them he was describing having a nervous breakdown and when his family found out at stanford university they said , don t let anybody ever find this out this has to be completely confidential we will pay anything to buy these letters but we just don t want anyone to find out that hoover had a nervous breakdown seriously i ve never shown it to anyone errol morris so ostendorf contacts you keya morgan yes until then i knew only one guy who claimed to have met ostendorf and got his autograph and got his book i was like , wow ! that s really incredible that you got ostendorf to sign your book and met him but ostendorf left me two messages on my machine and sent me a letter saying that he was so excited so i called him back and he said he was fascinated by the fact that i had this photo of eddy and tad and willie especially of eddy because it was the only one in the world he had written that a photo of eddy does not exist obviously , he was wrong morgan made headlines in the world of lincoln photography when he found a photograph of eddy lincoln in the fay collection ostendorf published the image in the 1998 edition of lincoln s photographs 3 keya morgan ostendorf had also written in his book that the famous pose of lincoln standing in front of the white house by henry warren , which i discovered , was lost that s on page 214 of his book errol morris how did you discover it \? keya morgan ulysses grant called me i mean general grant s greatgrandson , ulysses grant he called me and told me about this photo by henry warren i looked at it it was just like the clouds parted light came beaming down from the heavens it was mozart s symphony no 40 it was one of those aha moments that s just angels flying around , euphoria and ecstasy my whole life i had been waiting for that moment to be able to find that one photo of lincoln by henry warren i knew that henry warren went out there and i knew that he took several photographs on march 6 it is inscribed on the back in the hand of jesse grant , president grant s son lincoln in front of the white house you blow it up and it is obviously him when lloyd called me he said how fascinated he was , how interested he was he had so much passion for lincoln after a lifetime 60 , 70 years of collecting lincoln he still was like a little boy in a candy shop i flew to dayton , ohio he picked me up at the airport and his house was filled with lincoln photographs in fact , i have pictures with him in his house and everything every inch of the wall was a lincoln photo he had a serious obsession , this intense , intense obsession , which in psychology today would probably be considered a madness errol morris a lincoln madness \? keya morgan he loved him so much he said that he was the incarnation of willie lincoln willie , who died at age 11 in 1862 , was abraham lincoln s third son he had memories from the time of lincoln he actually had memories and flashbacks errol morris memories \? keya morgan yes who knows \? who am i to say who s right , and who s not \? it s possible and then of course , there s marilyn errol morris marilyn \? keya morgan marilyn monroe she was obsessed with lincoln she thought of him as her father and she always kept a copy of carl sandburg s biography and a photograph of lincoln in her bedroom 4 in her autobiography , my story , marilyn monroe explained why she admired lincoln i used to read everything i could find about him he was the only famous american who seemed most like me , at least in childhood 5 errol morris go back to feb 5 , 1865 as i understand it , lincoln and his son walked from the white house to gardner s studio it s about a mile from the white house whether , in fact , he walked or not , i don t know keya morgan yes he used to walk to gardner s and brady s absolutely yes errol morris he goes to gardner s and there s a whole series of images taken that day but how many of the glassplate negatives are extant \? i know that the broken one was destroyed by gardner is that correct \? keya morgan well , there s a lot of hypotheses that go into it when we discuss what happened to something back in the 19th century like where is the original gettysburg address \? it s missing where is the original emancipation proclamation \? it s missing there s the hypotheses , oh , it was burnt in the chicago fire or it was stolen but , to answer your question , with glass plates , it s very easy to break them very easy it s a thin piece of glass and can easily break it could easily drop it could snap in half there s all types of things that could happen to glass and quite often glass did break another problem was , when they tried to separate the glass let s say it was an a , b , c or d pose sometimes it would crack during the process so there were many ways it could accidentally be broken errol morris so what is left of the glass plates \? keya morgan there s two or three of a single sitting that are still around there s also some copy negatives that i ve seen not the original negatives so , to answer that i would have to do an indepth research of those specific negatives ostendorf had some copy ones that are also in his book and you can see somebody went in and they touched up what he was holding in his hand he was holding a pencil and sharpener or a knife that he was sharpening the pencil for tad but somebody went in there and drew in glasses so somebody was trying to convince me that they had the original negative but you could clearly see that he was holding glasses and in the original , he was never holding glasses most people , if they don t pay attention to detail , they are like , oh , yeah he is holding his glasses well , no so there was that alteration that was done , historically it is not just today that people use photoshop people also did that back in the days but , obviously , it was not called photoshop errol morris who has the glass negatives \? are they held by the national archives \? keya morgan there s negatives everywhere there are negatives in the library of congress and national archives and smithsonian , in private collections , everywhere i have some negatives there s negatives all over the place unfortunately , when it was first started , nobody ever thought of preserving them and keeping track of everything nobody really realized the value of these items errol morris so ostendorf didn t try to collect negatives \? keya morgan oh , he did he did he desperately would try to get negatives if he could but negatives are not a very common thing to find the problem is , when you find a negative from the 19th century that s a big deal ninetynine percent of people don t give a hoot they just don t care it s crazy i just recently bought a huge stash of the old negatives of the building of the pacific railroad by aj russell , the legendary aj russell he documented the building of the pacific railroad that s american history and there is nothing more important than that but i got all the negatives for next to nothing it was at a public auction i thought they were going to sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars and i got all of them for like 20 , 000 and i thought they were going to go for a million or something and once i got them , i realized that no auction house or nobody gave a hoot about them they said , ah ! they are just negatives we can t frame them we can t put it on the wall what are we going to do with them \? they are glass they are going to break they are this they are that so , again , it goes back to that thing of , our convenience and beauty and just wanting to stick something on the wall and just say , there it is it looks nice errol morris going back to feb 5 to o118 keya morgan a funny thing happened with that photo gardner took the crack out of it and made another photo without it , which i have i have a large oval of that and then he also made a copy of that photo with the crack which is the original \? they are both such high quality and they are both by gardner and he also made cartesdevisite of them and then he also made a larger one and he did play around with it a little bit so i could definitely tell you it was a larger negative it was most likely an imperial so he played a few little games with it , including taking the crack off of it which is what i did for obama , by the way i sat down for four hours and took out the crack and then when i sent it to him , he was upset the crack wasn t there he said , but i like the crack and i said , yes , but you don t understand i just spent four hours taking the crack out errol morris you were annoyed \? keya morgan i was a little upset by him so , i told him , just forget it , but i rescanned the photograph with the crack and he wrote the article he even paid me i was paid for copyright permission because i own the image i still don t like the picture one of the problems is the right side of it is completely out of focus i don t know if you noticed his ear and everything it s possible gardner didn t like that photo and , who knows , he may have just tossed it because it was blurry you could see his ear and his face is really blurry errol morris did he market both of them \? keya morgan yes i paid 10 , 000 for the one with the crack and lloyd ostendorf saw it and flipped he said , oh , my god ! i love that where did you get that \? blah , blah , blah so i do have that and the one that has been fixed i mean there is no crack in it it s on gardner s imprint so i have the before and i have the after but the before , who wants it \? nobody wants one with a blurry halfaface his eyes are too dark , and there s a crack in it when i met morgan , he was carrying an attach case full of memorabilia related to lincoln , marilyn monroe , and others he would reach in and pull out a pocket watch , or a piece of paper , and say , lincoln s dna is on that reminding me that history is preserved as part of the object itself sometimes he sleeps with a watch , or next to monroe s dress , and dreams of traveling back in time 6 the object itself independent of what we may believe about it has a talismanic power because of its connection to the historical figure who once possessed it the article by barack obama appeared in the july 4 , 2005 , edition of time magazine was entitled what i see in lincoln s eyes the article is accompanied by o118 with the crack obama wrote my favorite portrait of lincoln comes from the end of his life in it , lincoln s face is as finely lined as a pressed flower he appears frail , almost broken his eyes , averted from the camera s lens , seem to contain a heartbreaking melancholy , as if he sees before him what the nation had so recently endured it would be a sorrowful picture except for the fact that lincoln s mouth is turned ever so slightly into a smile the smile doesn t negate the sorrow but it alters tragedy into grace it s as if this roughfaced , aging man has cast his gaze toward eternity 1 grant network newsletter , vol 1 , no 2 , spring 1995 2 rich saal , herbert wells fay was ambassador to the world at lincoln s tomb , behind the curtain blog , feb 11 , 2010 3 the battle of lincoln experts is unending morgan cited a 1994 article in american heritage , in which holzer suggested that an 1843 daguerreotype , privately owned by a new york couple , could in fact be the earliest known photograph of lincoln holzer argued that the daguerreotype had a promising pedigree it had once belonged to john hay , lincoln s trusted secretary at the time , lloyd ostendorf was incredulous , saying that the man doesn t look anything like lincoln morgan agrees \( the daguerreotype failed to sell at auction in 1998 \) 4 marilyn monroe s photograph was of a young lincoln an ambrotype taken by t p pearson on august 26 , 1858 \( it is ostendorf 8 \) 5 marilyn monroe ben hecht , my story , florence , oregon taylor trade publishing , 2007 , p 121 6 alan duke , collector keya morgan has an unusual path to the stars , cnn , 2011 note an earlier version of this article reported that robert lincoln had claimed that his younger brother had never been photographed since that claim is still a matter of some dispute , the sentences have been removed
on jan 18 , 1863 , troops from the 64th north carolina infantry under the command of lt col james keith lined up 13 men and boys , ranging in age from 13 to 60 , made them kneel and shot them at pointblank range then the soldiers tossed the bodies into a shallow grave , from where they were later reclaimed by family members for burial this incident in madison county , nc , known to history as the shelton laurel massacre , was hardly the worst example of violence visited on civilian populations during the civil war on aug 21 , 1863 , scarcely a month after the murders in north carolina first received national press coverage , the confederate guerrilla leader william c quantrill led a raid on lawrence , kan , that killed 183 men and boys but shelton laurel provides an especially compelling look at the internecine war between confederate authorities and prounion sympathizers in the mountains of western north carolina and eastern tennessee madison county sits on the border with tennessee and in 1863 was incredibly isolated that country , wrote one confederate officer , consists of a tumultuous mass of steep hills wooded at the top , with execrable roads winding through ravines and often occupying the bed of a watercourse the county also featured one of the state s sharpest political divides over the issue of secession the vote to hold a convention lost by a 532to345 margin when the convention did convene , madison county s delegate was a unionist divergent loyalties continued to characterize the region throughout the war those who did fight for the south between 800 and 1 , 000 men from madison county served in the confederate states of america s 64th north carolina infantry were often of suspect loyalty as maj gen kirby smith , commander of the department of east tennessee , observed the very troops raised here cannot always be depended upon they have gone into service , many of them to escape suspicion , prepared to give information to the enemy , and ready to pass over to him when an opportunity arises north carolina led all confederate states in the number of deserters during the war more than 24 , 000 soldiers left the ranks and went home many men sympathetic to the union simply never joined , relying on the region s inaccessibility to keep the war at arm s length their unionism had little to do with antislavery sentiment madison county had no more than 46 slaveholders and 213 slaves , and most residents shared the era s pervasive racism rather , it stemmed from an amalgam of class resentment against the slave owners and tenant farmers who had supported secession a deeply engrained rural suspicion of urban places and a widespread feeling that the wealthy were threatening hardworking common people a traveler to the region immediately after appomattox captured the character of the northern sentiment in the region the unionism of western north carolina was less a love for the union than a personal hatred of those who went into the rebellion it was not so much an uprising for the government as against a certain ruling class by the winter of 1862 , the war was taking a toll on madison county the need for constant vigilance against confederate soldiers searching for union sympathizers kept many men from harvesting crops and caring for livestock , and the area s inaccessibility made it nearly impossible to bring in food from other regions the scarcity of salt was particularly acute in an era before refrigeration , the mineral was the primary means of preserving meat in late 1861 , the state s governor , zebulon vance , established an office of salt commissioner to manage this precious commodity a year later he placed an embargo on the export of salt from north carolina during an early january night in 1863 , 50 men , many of them deserters from the 64th regiment , carried out a raid on marshall , madison s county seat their primary target was the salt store , and they carried off some 50 bushels of the precious mineral they also raided several homes , in the process shooting a confederate officer home on leave frightening two young children of a second officer who were ill and carrying off blankets , clothing , food and money before disappearing back into the hills coincidentally , at the time of the raid , the 64th infantry was less than 80 miles away , at bristol , tenn , guarding nearby salt supplies upon learning of the raid , two of the regiment s officers , col lawrence allen and lt col james keith , immediately petitioned their commanding officer , brig gen henry heth , to allow them to lead troops on a mission to punish the raiders heth , a native virginian , west point graduate and close friend of robert e lee s , had extensive experience combating hitandrun guerrilla tactics , first in mexico , then on the western plains and in the mormon wars in utah , and most recently in west virginia keith later recalled heth s orders i want no reports from you about your course at laurel i do not want to be troubled with any prisoners and the last one of them should be killed keith and allen , both of whom were welltodo residents of marshall , set out with two columns of troops , absorbing sniper fire and killing 12 of the raiders as they made their way into the shelton laurel valley allen pushed on to marshall , arriving to find that both his 6yearold son and 4yearold daughter , recently terrorized by the raiders , had died from scarlet fever after quickly burying his children , allen rejoined keith and his regiment the next morning and set about locating the raiders as lifelong residents of the region , both officers knew that the families of the men would be able but unlikely to tell them where they were hiding when the women refused to answer questions , the troops resorted to torture they beat , whipped , hanged temporarily and robbed 85yearold unus riddle and whipped 70yearold sally moore with hickory rods until her back bled other women were treated with equal cruelty , but apparently none provided useful information keith s soldiers nonetheless eventually took 15 men prisoner and held them overnight before deciding to escort them to knoxville for trial after marching for a few miles , keith stopped the column , ordered five of the prisoners to kneel , and had them shot by soldiers standing 10 paces away an eyewitness account in the new york times six months later recorded 60yearold joe woods s last request if you are going to murder us at least give us time to pray five more were then ordered to kneel thirteenyearold david shelton , who was at first only wounded , begged the soldiers , exclaiming , you have killed my old father and my three brothers you have shot me in both arms , but i can get well let me go home to my mother and sisters no mercy was shown shelton , or the three remaining prisoners \( two had escaped the previous night \) upon learning of the murders , governor vance called on a s merrimon , an old friend and a prosecutor , to investigate within a few weeks , he reported that thirteen were killed that some of them were not taken in arms but at their homes that all the men shot were prisoners at the time they were shot and that all this was done by order of lt col james a keith on feb 28 , 1863 , vance wrote to confederate secretary of war james seddon , urging him to take action against keith for perpetrating a scene of horror disgraceful to civilization five months later , upon learning that keith had been acquitted at a courtmartial and allowed to resign , vance wrote seddon asking him to furnish me a copy of the proceedings of the court martial in his case because murder is a crime against the common law of the state and he is now subject to that law vance s request illustrates a legal anomaly according to the 1806 articles of war , which both union and confederate forces followed \( the union would adopt new standards later in 1863 \) , guerrilla fighters like those in shelton laurel valley , unlike soldiers in uniform , could be shot even if they threw down their weapons and surrendered they had no right to be treated as prisoners of war but , once they were captured , they could not be executed without legal proceedings before either a military or civilian court the execution of such prisoners without a trial was murder furthermore , the military was obligated to assist civilian authorities in bringing charges against anyone accused of breaking this regulation vance , who at one point had promised to follow keith to the gates of hell , or hang him , was ultimately frustrated in his attempts to see the confederate officer punished captured by union forces at the end of the war , keith was imprisoned , charged with individual counts for each murder and brought to trial acquitted on the first count , he appealed the additional counts on the basis that an 1866 north carolina amnesty law voided further prosecution on feb 21 , 1869 , just days before the state s supreme court ruled in his favor , keith escaped in 1871 , the state dropped its prosecution james keith was the only one ever tried for the murders in shelton laurel his fellow officer , lawrence allen , escaped any punishment , although he chose to leave madison county for fear of reprisals by families of those murdered follow disunion at or join us  sources the new

mission viejo , calif attendees at s fourth annual west passing camp each returned home with an ipad mini , an adultsize onesie and a nike backpack they also received three sets of headphones , some funky dress socks and a fancy camera a water bottle , a mug , loads of tshirts and shorts , and do n't forget the frisbee even a bottle of hand sanitizer that , in this age of twitter , was splashed with a jetswest hashtag it was a bounty of souvenirs , but also , perhaps , something else a nice parting gift jets west may not even exist next summer , the jets part at least there could be a jets south in geno smith s native florida , depending on the way the quarterback derby and the season at large unfolds not that sanchez is thinking that way , of course asked after friday s workout here whether he would win the competition , sanchez fixed his eyes on the reporter and said , absolutely smith was not among the 11 offensive players who carved a few days out of their summer for onfield workouts , film sessions and bonding neither were joe mcknight , bilal powell , greg mcelroy and some others , but their absences were not as conspicuous there are no hard feelings about anything like that , sanchez said , adding there s plenty of other things they can be doing if they can make the sacrifice and be here , awesome if they ca n't , totally fine and i 'd never hold a grudge against anybody who s not here smith is training in florida , and regardless of the potential benefits he might have received by flying here to continue developing chemistry with his receivers , there is some merit to his decision to stay back his appearance would be akin to your drinking a few beers with a colleague the night before you each interview for a promotion to your dream job sanchez pointed out that tim tebow , mark brunell and kevin o'connell had all attended in the past , but he neglected to mention that none of those three ever posed a credible threat the atmosphere here is collegial and casual practice closed friday with a waterballooncatching contest but there is no mistaking who is in charge jets west is an opportunity for sanchez to assert his primacy 2 , 800 miles from the team s headquarters in new jersey , away from the coaches and the support staff and the front office , even though it could be snatched from him in the next two months for the last three summers , this camp has served as an affirmation of his job security he invites his players , to his turf , to a gathering that he and his family organized , so he can review with his teammates the offense that he is seeking to master that still holds true , and it is admirable that sanchez added a charitable component but even if his motives are pure , the amount of work that he put in for this year s camp is not commensurate with his standing in the organization he acts like the starter , a sign of confidence as much as defiance , even if he is not anymore tight end konrad reuland , who attended mission viejo high school with sanchez , said he s running the meetings he s kind of an extension of the coaching staff basically when he s out here he s the one running everything and drawing things on the board i think that s important i think guys respect that , putting this on and having us out here kellen winslow jr , who bolstered the jets' tight end corps when he signed about a month ago , said he was impressed by sanchez s leadership so far he handles himself like a pro , winslow said , adding , he knows what everybody s doing sanchez said that he was ever more comfortable with the west coast system espoused by the new coordinator marty mornhinweg , and that he had spent film sessions answering his teammates' questions by the very nature of his position , sanchez is expected to lead there is a lot of support for him in the locker room , and his teammates respect him and his commitment no longer does sanchez feel that he enters a huddle and struggles to command attention it s becoming more and more natural , he said , and he should feel that way by now sanchez is entering his fifth season , and with every fumble or dispiriting interception he threw last year , he has moved further and further from the quarterback who held great promise during the jets' consecutive runs to the afc championship game that he has failed to lead with his onfield performance is the reason the jets , under their new general manager , john idzik , selected smith , sanchez s likely successor , in the second round you 've got to constantly improve , you 've got to constantly get better , you 've got to make the playoffs , sanchez said teams that do n't make the playoffs a couple years in a row coaches get fired , players get traded , things change , organizations blow up and start over so we 're with a new regime john idzik wants a quarterback competition i'm still here let s compete the jets report to training camp in cortland , ny , on july 25 , and the competition resumes the next day sanchez guaranteed that he would win , but if he does not , at least his hands will be clean
, who this fall was stripped of his seven titles for doping and barred for life from competing in all olympic sports , has told associates and antidoping officials that he is considering publicly admitting that he used banned performanceenhancing drugs and blood transfusions during his cycling career , according to several people with direct knowledge of the situation he would do this , the people said , because he wants to persuade antidoping officials to restore his eligibility so he can resume his athletic career for more than a decade , armstrong has vehemently denied ever doping , even after antidoping officials in october in hundreds of pages of eyewitness testimony from teammates , email correspondence , financial records and laboratory analyses when asked if armstrong might admit to doping , tim herman , armstrong s longtime lawyer , said , lance has to speak for himself on that armstrong has been under pressure from various fronts to confess wealthy supporters of livestrong , the charity he founded after surviving testicular cancer , have been trying to persuade him to come forward so he could clear his conscience and save the organization from further damage , one person with knowledge of the situation said several legal cases stand in the way of a confession , the people familiar with the situation said among the obstacles is a federal whistleblower case in which armstrong and several team officials from his united states postal service cycling team are accused of defrauding the government by allowing doping on the squad when the team s contract with the postal service clearly stated that any doping would constitute default of their agreement herman said the option to confess to antidoping officials was not currently on the table however , the people familiar with the situation said armstrong , 41 , was in fact moving toward confessing and had even been in discussions with the united states antidoping agency armstrong had met with travis tygart , the agency s chief executive , in an effort to mitigate the lifetime ban he received for playing a lead role in doping on his tourwinning teams , according to one person briefed on the situation armstrong was also seeking to meet with david howman , the director general of the world antidoping agency , that person said herman denied that armstrong was talking to tygart and said he was not looking to speak with howman , either none of the people with knowledge of armstrong s situation wanted their names published because it would jeopardize their access to information on the matter tygart declined to comment howman , who was on vacation in new zealand , did not immediately respond to a phone call and an email armstrong has hopes of competing in triathlons and running events , but those competitions are often sanctioned by organizations that adhere to the world antidoping code , under which armstrong received his lifetime ban according to the world antidoping code , an athlete might be eligible for a reduced punishment if he fully confesses and details how he doped , who helped him dope and how he got away with doping but a reduced lifetime ban might decrease only to eight years or four , at best , antidoping experts said marion jones , who won five medals at the 2000 olympics , denied doping for years until giving a tearyeyed confession on the steps of a westchester county , ny , courthouse in 2007 she spent six months in prison for lying to federal investigators about her doping and for her involvement in a checkfraud scheme the timeline for armstrong s deciding whether to confess is unclear , but it is partly based on whether the united states justice department will join the whistleblower lawsuit , which was filed under the false claims act the sole plaintiff of that lawsuit is floyd landis , armstrong s former postal service teammate , who was stripped of the 2006 tour de france title for doping if the justice department joins the lawsuit as a plaintiff , the case would be more formidable than if landis pursued it alone landis stands to collect up to 30 percent of any money won in the case , which could be in the millions the team s contract with the postal service from 2000 to 2004 was more than 30 million armstrong is also facing two other civil lawsuits , one that involves the dallasbased insurance company sca promotions , which is trying to recoup millions of dollars it covered when armstrong won multiple tours the company withheld a 5 million bonus from armstrong after he won the 2004 tour because of doping accusations that surfaced in the book la confidentiel les secrets de lance armstrong , which was published in france armstrong sued the company , and the case was settled for 75 million sca promotions is now asking for 12 million back the 75 million plus 45 million it paid for armstrong s other tour victories armstrong is also being sued by the british newspaper the sunday times for more than 15 million over the settlement of a libel case in that matter , the newspaper had paid armstrong nearly 500 , 000 after it published claims from la confidentiel that he had used performanceenhancing drugs but what worries armstrong and his lawyers most , two of the people with knowledge of the situation said , is that he could face charges of perjury if he confesses because in sworn testimony in the sca case he said he had never doped before coming forward , armstrong would need assurances from the justice department that he would not be prosecuted for those crimes , those two people said herman said he has plans to discuss armstrong s next move when armstrong returns from hawaii , where he has been spending time with his family out of the public eye he has been in limbo since antidoping officials issued their report on him a week after the report was released , armstrong s sponsors , including nike and other longtime supporters , abandoned him soon after , he cut all ties with his charity he s doing ok for a guy that has had his livelihood and his life torn from him , but he s very strong , herman said
washington a flurry of lastminute moves by the house , senate and white house late monday failed to break a bitter budget standoff over president obama s health care law , setting in motion the first government shutdown in nearly two decades the impasse meant that 800 , 000 federal workers were to be furloughed and more than a million others would be asked to work without pay the office of management and budget issued orders shortly before the midnight deadline that agencies should now execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations because congress had failed to act to keep the federal government financed after a series of rapidfire back and forth legislative maneuvers , the house and senate ended the day with no resolution , and the senate halted business until later tuesday while the house took steps to open talks but harry reid , the senate majority leader , dismissed as gameplaying the house proposal to begin conference committee negotiations we will not go to conference with a gun to our heads , he said , demanding that the house accept the senate s sixweek stopgap spending bill , which has no policy prescriptions , before negotiations begin the obama administration and the republicancontrolled house had come close to failing to finance the government in the past but had always reached a lastminute agreement to head off a disruption in government services in the hours leading up to the deadline , house republican leaders won approval , , of a new plan to tie further government spending to a oneyear delay in a requirement that individuals buy health insurance the house proposal would deny federal subsidies to members of congress , capitol hill staff , executive branch political appointees , white house staff , and the president and vice president , who would be forced to buy their health coverage on the affordable care act s new insurance exchanges but 57 minutes later , and with almost no debate , the senate killed the house health care provisions and sent the stopgap spending bill right back , free of policy prescriptions earlier in the day , the senate had taken less than 25 minutes to convene and dispose of a weekend budget proposal by the house republicans they 've lost their minds , mr reid said , before disposing of the house bill they keep trying to do the same thing over and over again the federal government was then left essentially to run out of money at midnight , the end of the fiscal year , although the president signed a measure late monday that would allow members of the military to continue to be paid you do n't get to extract a ransom for doing your job , mr obama said in the white house briefing room as the clock ticked to midnight mr obama called house speaker john a boehner of ohio , but they spoke for less than 10 minutes , without any sign of progress i talked to the president tonight , the speaker said on the house floor he summed up mr obama s remarks as i'm not going to negotiate i'm not going to negotiate the house s most ardent conservatives were resigned to seeing through their war on the health care law to its inevitable conclusion , a shutdown that could test voters' patience with republican brinkmanship cracks in the party were opening into fissures of frustration you have this group that keeps saying somehow if you 're not with them , you 're for obamacare , said representative devin nunes , republican of california if you 're not with exactly their plan , exactly what they want to do , then you 're somehow for obamacare , and it s just getting a little old it s moronic to shut down the government over this , he continued it was far from certain that republicans could remain unified on their insistence on health care concessions if a shutdown lasted for some time asked whether republicans could hold together through the end of the week , representative phil gingrey of georgia , one of the more conservative members , answered i do n't know i do n't know earlier monday , the senate voted 54 to 46 along party lines to kill the previous house plan immediately after ending a weekend break senators then sent the house a bill to finance the government through nov 15 without policy prescriptions but house leaders would have none of it , again demanding a significant hit to the health law as a price for keeping the government open mr reid laid into mr boehner and put the blame for a shutdown solely on his shoulders our negotiation is over with , he said you know with a bully you cannot let them slap you around , because they slap you around today , they slap you five or six times tomorrow , mr reid , a former boxer , continued we are not going to be bullied in addition to criticizing mr boehner , mr reid excoriated what he called the banana republican mindset of the house he called on the speaker to put the senate bill up for a vote , which would almost certainly pass in the house because of overwhelming democratic support and backing from moderate republicans in one of their final moves , house republicans attached language to a government funding bill that would delay the mandate that individuals obtain health insurance and would force members of congress , their staffs and white house staff members to buy their health insurance on the new exchanges without any government subsidies conservative activists have portrayed the language as ensuring that congress and the white house would be held to the same strictures that apply to ordinary americans under the health care law in fact , the language would put poorly paid junior staff members at a disadvantage most people buying coverage on the exchanges will receive subsidies through generous tax credits most americans will still get their insurance from their employers , who will continue to receive a tax deduction for the cost of that care under the house language , lawmakers and their staffs , executive branch political appointees , the white house staff , and the president and vice president would have to pay the entire cost of health insurance out of pocket representative peter t king , republican of new york , said junior staff members were being used as a sacrifice for a political gambit , driven by republican hardliners in the senate like ted cruz of texas , that will go nowhere they locked themselves into this situation , the dead end that ted cruz created , mr king said the budget confrontation which threatened to close federal offices and facilities , idling thousands of workers around the country stemmed from an unusual push by republicans to undo a law that has been on the books for three years , through a presidential election , and that the supreme court largely upheld in 2012 a major part of the law is set to take effect tuesday the opening of insurance exchanges , where people without insurance will be able to obtain coverage republicans argue that the administration has itself delayed elements of the law they say it should be postponed for at least a year democrats say republicans are being driven by the most extreme elements of their party to use the federal budget to extract concessions on health care that they could not win through the traditional legislative process the scary thing about the period we 're in right now is there is no clear end , said representative chris van hollen , democrat of maryland
looking back on 2013 , many of the economic and political themes seemed familiar a weak economy growing income inequality gridlock in washington partisan wrangling over fiscal policy but others , like the disastrous rollout of the affordable care act healthcaregov website and the government shutdown , were new or at least revivals below are 10 charts to illustrate a depressing first year of president obama s second term not only did trends of recent years continue in 2013 particularly the diverging fortunes of the rich and everyone else but in some ways they accelerated the stock market , as measured by the standard poor s index , was up a stunning 28 percent \( through dec 16 \) corporate profits rose to a record 21 trillion meanwhile , incomes remained nearly flat and jobs tallies grew slowly through oct 30 , earnings were up just 14 percent , an even smaller increase than in 2012 the only relative bright spot for the average american was housing thanks in part to the aggressive efforts by the federal reserve to hold down interest rates , sale prices of homes were up by 133 percent in september , compared with a year earlier economic growth a likely increase in gross domestic product of just 16 percent in 2013 , after adjusting for inflation was also unbalanced in other ways , particularly the impact of the government the nation s quickly falling deficit \( it dropped from 109 trillion to 680 billion in a single year \) cost dearly in economic activity spending by cashstrapped consumers and investment by skittish businesses both grew at slightly below customary rates a flatlining europe dented president obama s pledge to double american exports by 2015 on the other hand , home building and related residential activity , depressed since the onset of the financial crisis , provided a second annual lift to the economy employment remained an overarching problem while job growth has picked up steam in the last few months , the fall s higher pace of job creation around 200 , 000 per month would still not be nearly enough to bring unemployment down to prerecession levels according to calculations by the brookings institution s hamilton project , even if the 200 , 000 jobs per month rate were maintained , the unemployment rate would not fall to the november 2007 level of 47 percent for another five years not only has the job recovery been sluggish , but also a disproportionate number of those that have been created have been in lower wage occupations , such as retail clerks and fastfood workers and that trend is projected \( by the bureau of labor statistics \) to continue using a simple average , the 10 job categories expected to add the most jobs during the current decade \( ranked from left to right , above \) boasted a collective median wage of 32 , 386 in 2010 , roughly 15 per hour and far below the united states median of 51 , 892 at the time seven of the 10 categories pay below this average note the conspicuous absence of manufacturing it may be recovering , but it is n't what is driving new jobs wage increases have n't been paltry because the efficiency of the american worker has flagged indeed , productivity has continued to chug along but those productivity gains have simply not been passed on to workers between 2000 and 2012 , productivity rose by 22 percent while wages increased by 77 percent the divergence was particularly great over the last three years of that period productivity up 46 percent and real wages down 11 percent for this failure of the american worker to be rewarded for his growing output , blame a variety of factors , perhaps most important , globalization , which has allowed companies to move production to whatever part of the planet offers the lowest cost labor in that respect , american workers remain in a race to the bottom the troubles with the affordable care act s healthcaregov rollout sure grabbed daily headlines this fall but throughout the commotion , little mention was made of the most fundamental aspect of the law the way in which it raises nearly 2 trillion over the next decade mostly from wealthy individuals and health care providers and uses the money to fund the largest expansion in insurance coverage since medicare was created nearly 50 years ago as shown above , the end result should be better health care options for those closer to the bottom end of the income scale , through the medicaid expansion and creation of exchanges with subsidies for most participants the intended result 25 million fewer uninsured americans yes , this is redistribution on a grand scale , and we should all be very proud of it but as evidenced by obamacare s consistently poor poll numbers , most americans are not feeling charitable toward the less well off trust in many american institutions has been declining , but few institutions have fallen so far out of grace as congress last year , i showed that the previous congress was the least productive congress in modern times , including the famous donothing congress of 194748 , passing just 238 laws , 37 percent of the average of the 32 congresses that preceded it in 2013 , the first year of this congress , the number of new laws passed fell further , to 55 \( as of nov 30 \) , seven fewer than during the same period in 2011 as a result , congress now stands dead last in approval rating among key american institutions below other braches of government , below news outlets , below banks and even below big business congress well deserves that poll standing , in significant part because of the damage that it has done to the federal budget the combination of republican determination to cut spending and democratic insistence that none of the entitlement programs \( such as medicare and social security \) be meaningfully affected has resulted in the utterly inane policy of starving key domestic programs , including education , infrastructure and research and development the recent budget fight and subsequent agreement did nothing to change that trajectory as shown by the red line above , all that resulted was avoiding the worst two years of forced budget cuts to these programs for the 10 years beginning in 2008 , this important spending will rise slightly in nominal numbers but will fall by 5 percent , after adjusting for inflation the dysfunction in washington has taken its toll in other important ways not only has business confidence been shaken , but each new political battle has also been terrifying for consumers back in the summer of 2011 , when the united states had its aaa credit rating removed by sp after it flirted with default , consumer confidence recorded the second biggest twomonth drop ever , behind only the aftermath of hurricane katrina a smaller decline occurred at the end of 2012 when congress nearly went over a fiscal cliff beginning this past july , consumer confidence dropped to its lowest level in nearly two years as a result of the government shutdown , the aca problems and related battles now , a twoyear budget nearly in hand , americans' moods seem to have improved at a time when we need consumers to spend \( prudently \) , these periods of faltering confidence have real economic consequences in contrast to the mood in most of the country and the still slow economy , silicon valley is partying again , albeit not quite like 1999 the facebook initial public offering in may 2012 helped usher in a resurgence of excitement among investors for anything that looks like a sexy new hightech service this year s poster child ipo was twitter , which set a new record of one kind among recent major technology ipo s its valuation of more than 28 times its revenues that did n't daunt investors the stock promptly more than doubled and now trades at 66 times revenues \( of course , there are no profits \)
south bend , ind at his confirmation hearing today , john o brennan , president obama s nominee to lead the central intelligence agency , is likely to face tough questions on a host of topics , including the soaring use of drone strikes , which have killed at least four americans , one of them intentionally his performance as the president s counterterrorism adviser the rise of islamist radicalism in northern africa and his past comments on engagement with iran the senators should also hold mr brennan to account for one of the administration s gravest failings its refusal to openly discuss the legal basis for america s campaign of targeted killings of terrorism suspects , including anwar alawlaki , the american citizen and radical imam who was killed in a drone strike in yemen in september 2011 we , thanks to , of a 16page , unsigned , undated justice department that outlines the obama administration s legal reasoning about targeted killing the paper asserts that the government may lawfully kill a united states citizen if an informed , highlevel official decides that the target is a highranking qaeda figure or affiliate who poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the united states and that capturing him is not feasible the paper s sweeping claims of executive power are audacious for a threat to be deemed imminent , it is not necessary for a specific attack to be under way the paper denies congress and the federal courts a role in authorizing the killings or even reviewing them afterward in doing so , it cites the authorization of force that congress granted to president george w bush after 9 11 yesterday , the white house suddenly agreed to let the two congressional committees on intelligence see classified legal advice related to the white paper a good but insufficient step the administration should fully release the 2010 classified memorandum that was the basis for the unclassified , leaked white paper i was struck to find my name on page 4 of the white paper , which summarized my argument that the conflict between the united states and al qaeda cannot lawfully extend to nations outside afghanistan in which the level of hostilities is less intense or prolonged than in afghanistan itself the lawyers dismissed my view , arguing that there is little judicial or other authoritative precedent on the issue , since the nation is fighting a transnational , nonstate actor where the principal theater of operations is not in a country in conflict with america these are more than legal quibbles when hellfire missiles were first used in drone strikes to kill outside a combat zone in yemen , in 2002 six men died , including an american a united nations special rapporteur declared the action unlawful , but cia drone attacks have increased substantially since then the , a nonprofit news organization in london , in drone attacks at 3 , 000 to 4 , 500 , including well over 200 children today , the united states is involved in a true armed conflict only in afghanistan yet drone attacks have been carried out in yemen , somalia and pakistan and may soon begin in libya , mali and nigeria none of these countries have attacked america , so no right of selfdefense can be invoked under the united nations charter , as the white paper asserts the bush administration memos that attempted to justify torture , indefinite detention and illegal wiretapping have been widely rejected how , then , can mr brennan and other advisers to mr obama \( a former lecturer on constitutional law \) condone this spurious effort to justify targeted killings \? terms like armed conflict , combat and battlefield are integral to the proper functioning of human rights law and international humanitarian law , including the geneva conventions such definitions are well established and can no more be tampered with to suit the administration s preferences than can the definition of torture sadly , the justice department s office of legal counsel , which under mr bush drafted the that narrowly construed torture as severe pain causing organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or even death , has now , under mr obama , drafted the targetedkillings document the white paper cites a 2010 speech by , the state department s top lawyer and a former dean of yale law school he once testified that the main bushera torture memo was perhaps the most clearly erroneous legal opinion i have ever read having read the white paper , i think it s a tossup targeted killings are , of course , different from torture the cia s enhanced interrogation techniques were largely kept secret until the socalled torture memos came to light but the launching of hellfire missiles and the dropping of 500pound bombs , even in remote rural areas , can hardly be kept secret putting aside whether the targeted killings are even effective , the law must take precedence outside of armed conflict zones , the killing of innocent bystanders cannot be tolerated the justice department has concocted an elastic definition of necessity attempting to justify force in the absence of an immediate lethal threat without citing any treaty or decision by an international court members of the senate select committee on intelligence have a duty to interrogate mr brennan on all of these issues not just the attacks but the legal pretexts for them they should also demand the full , public release of all the legal analyses behind targeted killings secret law is an oxymoron the rule of law is the basis of our democracy and the foundation of international relations facts like operational details may properly be kept confidential , but not the law itself

laramie , wyo for state representative cathy connolly , wyoming s only openly gay legislator , this winter brought a rare moment of promise her bill to create domestic partnerships advanced further than anything like it in the history of this deep red state sailing through committee and onto the floor of the full house victory seemed possible but when a crucial vote came , the bill failed afterward , a colleague who had voted against the measure hugged ms connolly , a democrat from laramie , and told her that it was nothing personal i had to say , yes it is , ' ms connolly said , recalling the conversation several months later being gay in wyoming , known as the equality state , has never been simple , and last week s rulings , hailed as a victory for , did little to change that while many gay couples here cheered the decisions , they also said they woke up the next morning not feeling much more equal than they had the day before it s remarkably frustrating , said carl oleson , who lives with his partner of 16 years , rob johnston , in casper , near the center of wyoming s oil and gas boom there are no protections here none nationwide , the movement to legalize samesex marriage may be bolstered by court rulings , growing political support and shifting public opinion but for gay couples who live in the conservative rural heartland , like mr oleson and mr johnston , any changes in the landscape feel as slow as the upwelling of mountain ranges like 36 other states , wyoming limits marriage to a man and a woman state lawmakers have voted down attempts to include gay and transgender people in wyoming s antidiscrimination laws there are no hatecrime laws on the books , according to the , a gay rights advocacy group for gay couples , life can be a delicate balance the closest gay bar is often a long drive south to colorado some couples said they introduce their partners as friends or roommates and shy away from holding hands or kissing in public you have to balance between so many things here , said mr oleson , who said he manages a retail store but declined to be more specific i still have to be a little bit discreet wyoming has never been easy to pigeonhole when it comes to gay rights republicans dominate state and local politics , and support for gun rights , low taxes and small government runs as deep as groundwater but so does a cowboy libertarian streak , residents say , rooted in ranches , homesteads and a notion of you live your life , and i 'll live mine wyoming repealed its sodomy law in 1977 , a generation before the supreme court declared such laws unconstitutional several times in recent years , republican lawmakers have rejected efforts by social conservatives to ban the recognition of samesex marriages from other states or to add defense of marriage amendments to the state constitution eight years ago , an openly gay 27yearold named served a term as the mayor of casper people who would never support samesex marriage nonetheless gave him a fair shake , he said in a state where many voters are on a firstname basis with the governor and see their elected officials in church or cafes , it is harder to vilify people you disagree with , residents said i 've never felt uncomfortable or threatened or out of place , said mr padgett , a democrat who now lives in denver there is a strong streak in the republican party in wyoming to let people live their lives that sort of respect for space in some more conservative quarters , the supreme court s decision to strike down the federal defense of marriage act felt like an attack on that letlive ethos mark baker , a republican state representative from rock springs , said wyoming was comfortable with marriage as it stood in the state he said he had considered the arguments for allowing everyone to marry his half sister is a lesbian , he said but called samesex marriage the first step on a slippery slope once you go down that path , where do you stop \? mr baker said is it going to be legal for four or five people to marry because they love one another \? ms connolly said she was aware of that argument when she introduced her bill last winter to create domestic partnerships for gay couples the latest of several failed attempts to cajole her conservative colleagues ms connolly , a professor of women s studies at the university of wyoming , had forged friendships and close working relationships with many republican colleagues , but to at least a few of them she was still a source of discomfort this year , one legislator approached ms connolly and told her , i love you , but i do n't want to know anything about your personal life , which that legislator called offensive i had to walk away , ms connolly said , and say , i am not offensive' ms connolly found allies among several moderate republicans critical support in a chamber with 52 republicans and eight democrats the two biggest newspapers in the state endorsed the measure and it passed a committee vote , 7 to 2 when it came time to argue the measure on the floor of the wyoming house , the bill s supporters decided that their best hope was to let its republican supporters do the talking ms connolly and the other democrats sat quietly it was defeated by a vote of 35 to 24 despite the loss , to some it was a sign that things were changing slowly , but changing , the openly gay pastor of the united church of christ in casper , has been called satan s spawn at least once since coming to wyoming in 2008 , and she said she had been treated coldly at times by the city s ministerial groups but during last summer s rodeo parade , the church flew a big rainbow flag on the back of its trailer and , ms lundberg said , only got flipped off once it s a slow crawl , she said but every year there s been a teeny tiny bit of progress a generation from now , it 'll be a nonissue
washington behind the roiling conversation over is an uncomfortable reality for the white house the administration has named no more women to highlevel executive branch posts than the clinton administration did almost two decades ago the white house has taken steps to even its gender balance in recent months with like as ambassador to the united nations and as national security adviser but by most measures of gender diversity , including the proportion of women at the cabinet level , the executive branch looks little different from 20 years ago , even as the house of representatives , the senate and corporate america have placed significantly more women in senior roles there s room for improvement , and we 've seen some missed opportunities , said debbie walsh , the director of the at rutgers university we 're all watching the fed to see what will happen there mr obama is choosing from a small pool of candidates for the federal reserve position probably the most important economic appointment he will make in his second term the finalists include ms yellen , the fed s current vice chairwoman and a former clinton administration official the favored candidate among several top obama aides is lawrence h summers , the former treasury secretary and obama economic adviser over all , mr obama has named 13 women to cabinetlevel posts , matching the historic high achieved by the clinton administration mr obama has also put a record number of women in judicial slots , including two on the supreme court women make up about 42 percent of confirmed judges , compared with 22 percent appointed by george w bush and 29 percent by bill clinton yet the ratio of men to women in the administration is where it was two decades ago , if not a little more heavily male the obama administration has a smaller proportion of women in top positions than the clinton administration did in its second term , for instance women hold about 35 percent of cabinetlevel posts , compared with 41 percent for mr clinton and 24 percent for mr bush at similar points in their presidencies the president s commitment to diversity is second to none , and his track record speaks to it , alyssa mastromonaco , the deputy chief of staff , said in an email message this is a man who has appointed women as national security adviser , as white house counsel , as budget director and to lead the task of implementing our single most important domestic policy accomplishment , namely mr obama s this president has singlehandedly increased the diversity of our courts , and he will continue to select from a field of highly qualified and diverse candidates for all federal posts the fed opening has stoked an unusually lively public debate , including questions about whether the obama administration s economic team is too insulated and too much of a boy s club , in the words of some critics all else equal , i would not lightly dismiss the opportunity to break a glass ceiling , said jared bernstein , a former obama economic adviser and now at the , who lauded both mr summers and ms yellen on their merits \( mr bernstein is a contributor to the new york times s economix blog \) criticism became louder earlier this year after prominent office holders like thensecretary of state and labor secretary hilda l solis left the administration slots at the departments of state , defense and the treasury that many liberals had hoped would go to female candidates ended up being filled by men mr obama himself responded to the criticism i would just suggest that everybody kind of wait until they 've seen all my appointments , who is in the white house staff and who is in my cabinet , before they rush to judgment , he said at a news conference in january as he was starting his second term until you 've seen what my overall team looks like , it s premature to assume that somehow we 're going backwards we 're not going backwards , we 're going forward since those remarks , he has named a series of women to top posts , including for , , and  but speaking privately , some administration officials have said that imbalance has resonated within the building and caused the white house to put a priority on considering female candidates earlier this year as of june 2012 , 43 percent of mr obama s appointees had been women , according to a of federal employment data that is about the same proportion as in the clinton administration , and up from the roughly onethird appointed by george w bush the largest gains in the number of women in the executive branch occurred in the clinton administration in no administration before his did women hold more than 18 percent of cabinetlevel jobs in his second term , the share exceeded 40 percent at that level , women held a substantially larger share of senior roles in the executive branch than they did in congress or in corporate america during mr clinton s presidency , were ever serving in the senate , whereas 20 do today the share of women holding board seats on fortune 500 companies has also risen over the last two decades , to 166 percent last year from 96 percent in 1995 , the executive branch continues to have a larger share of women in senior roles than congress or corporate america , but it has also changed less since the 1990s several white house officials bristled at the suggestion that gender would play any role in the federal reserve decision , and at the notion of any sort of institutional bias within the white house , which has approximately half male and half female employees a former obama and clinton administration official said that concerns about gender had perhaps been more prominent in washington in the 1990s the clinton administration had an overt and open policy of trying to make the administration look like america the obama administration makes a priority of naming women to highranking positions , but the goal is not as pressing , the official said another former obama administration official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , suggested that mr obama might feel inoculated against criticism were he to name mr summers or another man for the federal reserve position because of his recent record in promoting women other experts argued that the administration should be judged not just on its appointment record but on its broader record it s important to look at the bigger picture , said victoria a budson , the executive director of the at the harvard kennedy school of government it s not so much about how many women , but are women represented , are the policies helping women \?
theodore reed , the keeper of the celebrity pandas lingling and hsinghsing , the playful komodo dragon kraken , smokey bear himself and thousands of other creatures while he was the director of the in washington from 1958 to 1983 , died on tuesday in milford , del he was 90 the cause was complications of alzheimer s disease , said his son , mark reed dr reed , a veterinarian and zoologist , was considered an innovative administrator he modernized the zoo s buildings , expanded its role in research and breeding , and employed a ringmaster s command of spectacle to raise the profile of the nation s official menagerie he was also known for his personal touch at his suburban home , he helped raise the first white tiger born in captivity , a couple of leopard pups and a halfdozen bear cubs he leapt into the zoo s wolf enclosure to save a pup from drowning during a hurricane in 1972 and when the two pandas failed year after year to produce offspring , dr reed adopted the fretting voice of the archetypal inlaw in his interviews with reporters looking for someone to blame , he turned to hsinghsing , the male , critiquing his posture and his foreplay technique do you realize what he is doing to the male ego \? he said to a reporter in 1982 dr reed was an early conservationist among zoo executives he envisioned zoos as sanctuaries for species threatened by the accelerating development of their natural habitats but his modestly endowed zoo the full name of which is the national zoological park of the smithsonian institution lacked the financial support for that kind of mission , until the giant panda couple arrived in 1972 zoos around the country had competed intensely for rights to the pandas , gifts from china in recognition of president richard m nixon s visit that year despite a tradition of housing animal gifts from foreign countries at the national zoo , officials at zoos in chicago , san diego and other cities argued that they were better equipped to protect and breed the pandas , of which there were fewer than 1 , 000 worldwide but dr reed lobbied hard and won the case for washington , where negotiating budgets for his publicly financed zoo over the past 14 years had made him an adept navigator of the political terrain the pandas , and their subsequent efforts to produce offspring , increased zoo attendance to about two million a year from fewer than a million , made dr reed s budget negotiations easier and helped him acquire many of the zoo s less famous but equally endangered animals , including the komodo dragon , which , in one keeper s words , proved as playful as a dog , rescued as a cub from a forest fire in 1950 and acquired after the only you can prevent forest fires public service campaign was in full swing , was designated as the official living version of the campaign s animated spokesman he received bags of mail the zoo s higher profile also helped dr reed argue successfully in 1975 for the use of 3 , 200 acres of federal land in virginia to create a new arm , the conservation and research center , which has become one of the premier centers in the country for animal research and for breeding members of endangered species \( it is now called the smithsonian conservation biology institute \) among the representatives of vanishing species there were mongolian wild horses , scimitarhorned oryxes , maned wolves , redcrowned and whitenaped cranes , bali mynas , blackfooted ferrets , clouded leopards , eld s deer and cheetahs dr reed s son , who is the executive director of the sedgwick county zoo in wichita , kan , said the pandas were probably his father s greatest achievement , as well as his greatest headache the annual panda mating watch female pandas are in heat only once a year became the groundhog day of his life , he said in 1982 , after six or seven years of trying to breed lingling and hsinghsing , dr reed told a reporter , i have come to the conclusion that unlike humans , most animals will not breed if they do n't like each other the pandas eventually grew friendlier , and lingling became pregnant five times , though none of the cubs she bore survived for more than a few days theodore harold reed was born on july 25 , 1922 , in washington , the son of ollie and mildred reed his father , a lieutenant colonel in the army , and his older brother , ollie jr , were killed in action within two weeks of each other in 1944 dr reed received degrees in veterinary medicine and zoology at kansas state college \( now kansas state university \) and served as the veterinarian at the portland zoo in oregon for several years before joining the national zoo as a staff veterinarian in 1955 he was named associate director a year later , and director in 1958 besides his son , he is survived by his wife , sandra foote a daughter , maryalyce jenkins three grandchildren and a greatgranddaughter
on a team in southern california , more than 2 , 500 miles from the center of lacrosse s universe on the eastern seaboard , kyle harrison no longer feels unsettled for many years and on numerous teams harrison , regarded by many as perhaps the greatest midfielder in lacrosse s history , was the only pair of brown legs on the field , a rare black player in a sport that is overwhelmingly white but for the last few years , harrison has caught a glimpse of what he hopes is lacrosse s future a racial balance that will eliminate the uneasiness that he and other minority players say they have felt to varying degrees in their careers half my team is black , said harrison , who plays for on the i was proud as hell the first time i walked on the field with those guys i knew we had all been through the same thing , and we 've all been the only guy on a lacrosse team before when you start getting in those situations where you 're not the only one , you 're not the token black lacrosse player on a team , you start to feel more comfortable as the popularity and the visibility of lacrosse increase , the diversity in the sport lags behind just 19 percent of division i men s lacrosse players are black , according to the most recent ncaa one of the teams \( duke \) in this weekend s men s final four in philadelphia has one black player , while another \( cornell \) has none in interviews , several players at the collegiate and professional levels said they had experienced situations or heard remarks related to race from comments by parents to slurs uttered by teammates that made them upset or uncomfortable during their careers people kind of like to brush it under the table and say that kind of thing never happens or there s none of that in this sport , said chazz woodson , a midfielder for the ohio machine of major league lacrosse but there is it s still very much alive woodson , who played at brown from 20025 , said a racial epithet had been directed at him three times during his collegiate career , once by an opposing player and twice by teammates he said he chose to tell no one at the time , revealing the instances only in an in december criticizing a viral marketing campaign by a sports equipment company that some felt had racial overtones as one of the most prominent black players of the last decade , woodson said he regularly received emails from children , teenagers and parents asking for advice or simply thanking him for being a role model and though he is always conscious of race as it relates to his sport , woodson said he was still shocked each time he heard of a new incident in which it played a role that was the case when woodson was made aware of an instance earlier this season in which an assistant coach at syracuse , lelan rogers , used the word colored to describe an opposing player drew jenkins , a junior midfielder for syracuse who is black , said the defense was going over scouting reports when rogers used the word jenkins said he considered boycotting the next game and asking the two other black players on the roster to join him before ultimately deciding against it he did , he said , demand an apology from rogers i did n't mean it in a derogatory way , rogers said i made a comment an inappropriate comment it was wrong at the time i apologized there , on the spot i apologized again to the team later i did n't mean it in a bad way i meant it in a good way but obviously it came across not in a positive way syracuse coach john desko , who has been a member of the orange coaching staff since 1980 , sat next to rogers for an interview in desko s office he acknowledged that he was not always sure what was or was not acceptable language when it came to race sometimes i think you find it confusing if you have to call someone an afroamerican or have to describe somebody , desko said i am sometimes myself confused on what is appropriate and what is n't another prominent coach , virginia s dom starsia , called it astonishing that someone in a position of authority like rogers would use a racial term as he did hakeem lecky , who is black , is a midfielder for syracuse he said he had never personally experienced any situations in which he felt ostracized or uncomfortable because of his race \( lecky was not present when rogers made his comment \) but lecky has heard stories about slurs or tense moments when he takes the field alongside jenkins on saturday in the ncaa semifinals , however , his focus will be on the game , and he hopes that is the way it will be in the future as the sport s popularity continues to grow i was fortunate enough to not face any adversity regarding race , lecky said hopefully by the time i have kids all of that will disappear
buenos aires announced sunday that it had reached an agreement with to establish a joint commission to investigate the 1994 bombing of a jewish community center here nearly 19 years ago , a into the argentina israelite mutual association headquarters , killing 85 people and wounding about 300 like a previous attack two years earlier that leveled israel s embassy in buenos aires , killing 29 , it has never been solved the initial investigation into the community center bombing was thrown out in 2005 on accusations of corruption and incompetence by argentine authorities , some of whom would later be charged for misconduct a special prosecutor , and accused , the lebanese group with strong ties to iran and syria , of carrying out the bombing and senior iranian officials of planning and financing it mr nisman declined to comment on the new agreement iran has refused to carry out international arrest warrants for nine people argentina suspects in the attacks but under the agreement , it will now permit prosecutors to interrogate suspects in tehran the suspects include a former iranian president , ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani , and iran s defense minister , gen ahmad vahidi the accord stipulates that the two countries establish a fivemember commission of international law experts none can be of argentine or iranian nationality the accord , signed in ethiopia , concluded several rounds of talks between argentina s foreign minister , h ctor timerman , and his iranian counterpart , ali akbar salehi eighteen years of effort have failed to advance the case or prove anything against iran , indicating that iran is innocent , the tehranbased fars news agency said in its lead story sunday president cristina fern ndez de kirchner hailed the accord as historic the attack was followed only by failures and scandals the trial ended up a farce , mrs kirchner wrote on social networks we will never allow the amia tragedy to be used like a chess piece in geopolitical affairs , she said , referring to the argentine mutual aid association , the center that was bombed in 1994 iran is a consumer of argentina s agricultural commodities , an especially important tie as argentina s economy slows iran s trade with argentina has grown by 200 percent in the last few years , to more than 12 billion for its part , iran is eager to counter its diplomatic isolation , expanding on the ties it has forged in latin american nations like venezuela , bolivia and ecuador jewish groups , however , were wary of the negotiations argentina is legitimizing iran s style of governance and getting nothing in return , said guillermo borger , the president of the argentine mutual aid association
paris tensions between saudi arabia and the united states over washington s approach to the middle east were brewing for months before they burst into the open last week first , there was the american inaction in syria and lack of progress on israelipalestinian peace then came america s withdrawal of aid to the egyptian military after the july coup now president obama is pursuing a very public rapprochement with iran , saudi arabia s archrival the mounting disagreements between the two longtime allies is now in full public view last week , the head of saudi intelligence warned that it would stop cooperating with the united states on certain issues that came just days after saudi arabia stunned even some of its own diplomats when it on the united nations security council , citing its anger over the world s failure to respond to the crisis in syria this spat reflects the arab world s deepening frustration with american policy toward syria , egypt and palestine as well as extreme skepticism about a possible thaw in america s relations with iran the arabs have learned from bitter experience that whether by confrontation or collaboration , whatever iran , america and israel decide to do leaves them feeling trampled like an african proverb says whether the elephants fight or play , the grass gets trampled america chose iran and israel , over their arab neighbors , as its designated regional cops in the 1960s and '70s , at the height of the cold war since the united states and iran became sworn enemies after the 1979 revolution , america s military wishes have by and large been carried out by arab proxies , often at great cost in blood , treasure and stability lebanon , iraq and syria are among the countries that have suffered immensely strikingly , until last week , it was only israel , not its arab neighbors , that had criticized the thaw in usiranian relations \( even though israel might gain a lot from a deal that curtails iran s nuclear ambitions \) but ultimately , reconciliation between america and iran will require compromise over arab , not israeli , interests and these interests are neither washington s to cede nor iran s to brush aside arab powers fear that negotiations between america and iran are likely to leave israel as the one nuclear power in the region , while allowing its occupation of palestine to continue unabated improved relations between iran and america could offer benefits a lifting of western sanctions and american recognition \( however grudging \) of iran s growing regional influence , starting with syria , bahrain and the gulf region the united states could use iran s help to stabilize syria as it helped with afghanistan after 9 11 but sooner than later , what appears to be a great diplomatic breakthrough may be revealed to be no more than hopping over a volcano that s because iranianamerican d tente will likely deepen the sectarian divisions between iran and saudi arabia , setting the stage for an allout regionwide sectarian conflict since its 1979 revolution , iran has become increasingly militarized and religiously radicalized the shiitesunni tensions that fueled the iraniraq war of 198088 have only grown worse as the saudi government made clear last week , authoritarian sunni regimes in the region will probably seek to undermine rather than accept any agreement that foresees growing iranian influence in their backyard that polarization will inadvertently help al qaeda and other extremist sunni groups , who are bound to see in iranianwestern rapprochement a tool to multiply their recruits by stoking sectarian hatred it has already happened in syria , iraq and lebanon , and it s likely to continue the consequences are potentially disastrous shiitesunni fault lines extend through most oilproducing countries the damage to the regional and global economy from a disruption in the supply of oil could be huge but none of this is preordained or inevitable the theological roots of the sunnishiite divide might go back 13 centuries , but the violence we are witnessing today is politically motivated and aggravated by foreign intervention in the region the arab states rejected america s 2003 war in iraq , which is now ruled by an authoritarian prime minister who is firmly under iran s influence they are not taking kindly to iran s continued meddling in the region , including its military support for syria s president , bashar alassad indeed , the syrian opposition has rejected any role for iran in talks over the future of their country while the elephants have been playing , and fighting , arab leaders have been watching and learning they know that longterm regional stability is a game they can play , too with 370 million people in 22 countries that range from the atlantic to the indian ocean , arabs are bound to disagree about plenty of things but they generally support a middle east free of weapons of mass destruction and that applies to both iran and israel the arab nations , because of their size and strategic significance , are indispensable in shaping the region s future and its security alienating them is wrong and dangerous if , as mr obama said recently at the united nations , he believes that it is in america s best interest to see a middle east and north africa that is peaceful and prosperous , he needs to make sure the arabs are part of , and do n't lose from , any future bargain with iran international new york times
washington larry klayman knew how to pick a legal fight long before monday , when he took the first round in a judicial crusade on behalf of the little guy against biggovernment snooping but not always a winning fight in the 1990s , he filed numerous lawsuits against president bill clinton and his administration , alleging a litany of personal and professional transgressions mr klayman later nettled vice president dick cheney over his secret energy policy meetings and claimed that members of george w bush s administration might have known in advance of the 2001 anthrax attacks in washington more recently , mr klayman , who has been called litigious larry , sued opec , accusing oilrich nations of price fixing and of trying to bring western economies to their knees and he sued facebook and its founder for 1 billion when , he said , it was too slow to take down a web page that threatened jews with death many of his lawsuits have fallen far short of the success bombastically predicted by mr klayman but on monday , a federal judge agreed with his contention that the national security agency had exceeded its constitutional authority by systematically gathering the telephone records of americans mr klayman , in klaymanlike fashion , quickly proclaimed it the biggest ruling in the history of government litigation and said it validated his repeated legal assaults against the establishment it s a little like a mirv nuking a missile , he said in an interview on monday night , referring to the use of a weapon with several warheads to take down an incoming threat if only one in 10 gets through , you 've accomplished something you 've got to keep punching mr klayman , 62 , is a fixture of sorts in washington he founded , and then parted ways , with the conservative interest group judicial watch , which continues litigating grievances despite mr klayman s bitter departure \( he sued judicial watch , too , accusing it of breach of contract and other offenses \) his 2009 book is titled whores why and how i came to fight the establishment mike mccurry , who was a press secretary in mr clinton s administration , recalled mr klayman as an annoying critic for the clinton white house and for successors from both parties but mr mccurry noted that his methods have sometimes succeeded in the courts his latest legal challenge might create some evidence that there is method in his madness , mr mccurry said mr klayman has not spared the current democratic administration at a tea party rally in october , he urged conservatives to demand that this president leave town , to get up , to put the quran down , to get up off his knees , and to figuratively come out with his hands up last year , mr klayman filed a lawsuit in florida arguing that barack obama was ineligible to be president because neither mr obama , nor the democratic party of florida , nor any other group has confirmed that mr obama is a natural born citizen' since his father was a british subject born in kenya and not a citizen of the united states mr klayman s own political career was shortlived in 2004 , he ran unsuccessfully for the republican nomination for the senate in florida , receiving only about 1 percent of the vote but it is a point of pride for mr klayman that his legal missiles have no guidance systems that aim them in only one direction he is proudly nonpartisan , he said , giving himself credit for being one of the first to call for newt gingrich to resign over ethics scandals when he was the speaker of the house mr klayman said his legal attacks on the government s spying programs are further evidence that he cares less about the party in power than about forcing the powerful to answer to their critics to me , this is completely a nonpartisan issue it does n't have anything to do with republicans or democrats , he said on monday i'm just happy for the american people in his ruling on monday , the judge in the nsa spying case embraced some of the biggerthanlife language that is mr klayman s forte in his 68page decision , the judge , richard j leon of federal district court for the district of columbia , called the nsa s use of its technology almost orwellian he added that he could not imagine a more indiscriminate' and arbitrary' invasion than this systematic and hightech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval but even as he agreed with mr klayman s accusations , the judge took pains to note mr klayman s lessthantraditional legal style judge leon wrote that mr klayman responded during arguments in court that the nsa was messing with me the judge added unfortunately for plaintiffs , none of these unusual occurrences or instances of being messed with' have anything to do with the question of whether the nsa has ever queried or analyzed their telephony metadata nonetheless , the judge agreed with mr klayman s bottom line headlines on major news organizations' websites quickly followed mr klayman s relentless legal career has won him many critics brad blakeman , a professor at georgetown university and a former official in mr bush s administration , said their paths crossed when mr klayman filed a lawsuit claiming trademark violations involving mr blakeman s conservative group , freedom s watch mr klayman lost that particular battle larry klayman fights for himself and his own delusions of grandeur , mr blakeman said on monday he s probably one of the more despicable people i 've ever encountered if you look up gadfly in the dictionary , i believe you 'll see a picture of larry klayman he s a professional antagonist he s a bully stressing that his opinions of mr klayman were only opinions , mr blakeman waved aside the ruling on the nsa and other examples of mr klayman s success a clock is right twice a day , mr blakeman said it s the 22 other hours for the moment , mr klayman seems pleased with himself and immune to criticism he said he heard about the ruling on monday while he was sitting at my desk , sipping coffee he got a telephone call and then an email that the judge had ruled in his favor frankly , it did n't surprise me legally , mr klayman said but , he added , given what i 've seen in the last 10 years , i was n't out there gloating until it came out
two weeks after president abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation , a headline in the detroit free press asked , is a negro eligible to the presidency \? the editorial that followed offered an unequivocal yes a fiercely prodemocratic paper , the free press despised the fact that the presidency , along with all official positions , could now be open to the nigger in the early weeks of 1863 , such racist invective peppered the rhetoric of those disgusted by lincoln s edict of jan 1 but the free press was not talking about the emancipation proclamation when it declared negro eligibility for the presidency a monstrous result rather , it was talking about a document that history has tended to neglect , even though at the time many saw it as a critical adjunct to the proclamation the opinion of attorney general edward bates declaring that free africanamericans born in the united states were citizens bates had written the long opinion in november 1862 , but newspapers did not get wind of the document until the eve of the emancipation proclamation when they did , bates at first downplayed his opinion s significance , saying it dealt only with the citizenship status of one specific person , a free black man named david selsey but when pressed , he conceded that the document did indeed refute the part of the supreme court s 1857 dred scott decision declaring that colored men had no rights which the white man was bound to respect the press , public and politicians went wild that bates of all people should defend black citizenship was peculiar generally regarded as the most conservative member of lincoln s cabinet , he had been born to a slaveowning family in virginia when he moved to missouri , he sold what slaves he could for travel expenses in missouri , he helped draft a proslavery state constitution when dred scott , a missouri slave , sued for freedom , bates had no problem with the opinion of chief justice roger b taney that scott , as a black person , was not a citizen and thus could not bring suit he objected only to taney s pronouncement that congress could not prohibit slavery in american territories yet bates also earned some fame by successfully representing a missouri slave who had sued for her freedom bates s credentials as a borderstate conservative made him an obvious pick by lincoln for a cabinet position with his sharp features and grim demeanor , his shock of black hair and clipped white beard , he looked the part of a statesman yet his early career as attorney general was unremarkable his voice was usually drowned out by those of secretary of state william h seward , secretary of war edwin m stanton and secretary of the treasury salmon p chase , all of whom lincoln regarded as superior legal minds yet , as attorney general , bates had a power that none of them had he could write opinions that became laws of the land although bates deserves credit for the opinion , he would never have written it had his hand not been forced by chase the treasury secretary was helping oversee the efforts of black and white louisianans to create a new antislavery , prounion state constitution knowing that free blacks might be excluded from the process of state reconstruction if they were categorized as noncitizens , chase looked for a way to have their citizenship established by law the obvious routes , the adoption of a constitutional amendment nullifying dred scott or the reversal of that decision by the supreme court , had no chance of quick success the former was achieved only in 1868 with the adoption of the 14th amendment the latter became conceivable only in 1864 , when taney died and lincoln replaced him with chase but chase knew he could get what he needed straightaway with an opinion from bates to solicit an opinion , though , he needed a specific case david m selsey was not looking to change the course of american law for more than a decade he had been in the mundane business of piloting small ships up and down the midatlantic coast , carrying small cargoes to such undistinguished ports as norwich , conn , and perth amboy , nj he was black , but so were at least eight other ship masters in the region s coastal trade the sea had long offered africanamerican men liberties and opportunities denied to them on land in may 1862 , robert smalls , an enslaved seaman aboard a confederate transport ship , donned a captain s uniform and sailed the ship to union waters , securing freedom for the black crew members and their families an instant hero , he later served in the union navy and , after the war , in the house of representatives yet in 1862 , smalls s color disqualified him from citizenship unlike smalls , david selsey would never be known as a hero , never remembered in the history books but it was selsey who , through no deliberate effort of his own , put black citizenship on sure legal footing five months after smalls s daring feat in charleston , selsey s schooner was stopped off the southern new jersey coast by a treasury cutter , a type of boat charged with ensuring that coastal trading vessels had paid their revenues and were not smuggling probably word had come down from chase for cutters to be on the lookout for black ship masters ship masters had to be citizens to be licensed , a policy that excluded blacks with selsey s ship in custody , chase had the perfect test case edward jordan , the solicitor of the treasury , nearly botched chase s plans when he told the cutter captain that the dred scott decision was erroneous , and while it might control the rulings of the supreme court , it ought not control the treasury department , or the officers under its direction so much for judicial supremacy chase knew that jordan s opinion might not hold up more important , he wanted an official legal opinion that would deal with black citizenship broadly , not just in the treasury department chase went to bates in person on sept 15 , 1862 , to ask for the opinion bates balked at first he was no doubt reluctant to say anything publicly about black citizenship to chase he offered the officious excuse that any request for an opinion had to be made in writing so chase tried again on sept 24 , two days after lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation , he wrote bates an official letter soliciting an opinion on the question are colored men citizens of the united states , and therefore competent to command american vessels \? the timing of the letter could not have been coincidental for more than a year , americans had been asking what the legal status was of slaves freed during the war , and the question became more urgent than ever after lincoln issued the preliminary proclamation chase seized the moment bates could not dodge the question he agreed to write the opinion it didn t come easily he struggled with the document for more than two months he read treatises on international law , he studied ancient greek and roman texts and he sought the counsel of francis lieber , a leading legal expert american lawyers and judges , bates complained to lieber , had failed to give a precise definition of citizen \( which i admit is very hard , if not impossible , to do \) mostly , bates read and reread the constitution the most frustrating endeavor of all as he would write in his opinion eighty years of practical enjoyment of citizenship , under the constitution , have not sufficed to teach us either the exact meaning of the word , or the constituent elements of the thing we prize so highly in the end , bates came to two conclusions first , being born in the united states made one a citizen birthright citizenship , or what bates called citizenship by accident of birth , had long been a principle of angloamerican law bates pointed out that even the bible supported the principle st paul saved himself from torture at the hands of roman authorities in jerusalem by successfully claiming that , having been born on roman soil , he was a roman citizen who could not be punished without what we today would call due process of law in the 19th century , bates went on , the principle of birthright citizenship had unraveled in the united states , leaving behind a patchwork of laws that could not be fit together into a coherent whole the result was that many americans assumed that they were citizens if they had been born in the country , even though a series of legal opinions , culminating in the dred scott decision , denied birthplace as the basis of citizenship meanwhile , naturalization still rested on the 1790 law that declared that noncitizens could acquire citizenship only if they were white bates said nothing of the naturalization law , but he did declare that anyone free and born in the united states was necessarily a citizen bates s second conclusion also upended decades of american law by denying that there could be grades or classes of american citizenship one either was or was not a citizen race , sex and age had no effect on citizenship status the child in the cradle and its father in the senate , are equally citizens of the united states , bates wrote and while some citizens might be denied political rights like the right to vote , such denial did not amount to deprivation of citizenship , regardless of whether the person was a negro or a white woman or child the final version of bates s opinion , which appeared as a letter to chase , gave the treasury secretary what he wanted chase sent copies of the opinion to his agents in louisiana , who used it to silence those who denied the right of free blacks to participate in conventions leading to a new state constitution yet , because bates had explicitly detached voting from citizenship , the opinion did nothing to advance the cause of black suffrage advocated by louisiana africanamericans and supported by chase as the day for signing the final emancipation proclamation approached , chase may have been plotting how to use the bates opinion in louisiana , but lincoln kept the opinion under wraps he said nothing publicly about the document , and it is nowhere mentioned in his writings no doubt he anticipated correctly that the opinion would become one more weapon in the arsenal of opponents who charged him with supporting negro equality only in the last days of december did newspapers somehow secure a full copy of bates s opinion and publish it for all to see the timing led the emancipation proclamation and the bates opinion to become linked in the minds of many , even though neither document mentions the other the new york tribune , generally sympathetic to the abolitionist cause , declared that the opinion properly precedes and ushers in that other great act which is to come from the president on the 1st of january some outright abolitionist newspapers printed the opinion and the final proclamation side by side more conservative newspapers , including the times , tried to defuse any explosive implications of the opinion all the document did , the times declared , was remove color as a bar to citizenship were papers like the detroit free press right in claiming that a black man could now be president \? no , said the times the free man of color could no more vote or be eligible to office than women and children as we know now , the times called that one wrong despite the disclaimers by representatives of the lincoln administration , the bates opinion was recognized by equal rights activists for what it was an effort to demolish the dred scott opinion and all other vestiges of governmentsanctioned discrimination the editor of the angloafrican , a leading black abolitionist paper , praised the opinion and congratulated bates on reaching the same conclusion about legal citizenship for free blacks that had been expressed in the angloafrican in 1859 , in an editorial penned by james mccune smith , one of the bestknown africanamerican abolitionists of the era long after the bates opinion became public , chase continued to wave it in lincoln s face , telling the president to invoke it to promote equal rights in the south on april 11 , 1865 , chase made what turned out to be his last appeal to lincoln , reminding him in a private letter that since the opinion of attorney general bates , no one , connected with your administration , has questioned the citizenship of free colored men more than that of free white men chase was no longer a cabinet secretary he was chief justice of the united states his private letter was thus a potential violation of the constitutional principle of separation of powers that fact aside , the letter revealed just how powerful chase still considered the bates opinion lincoln was less admiring on the day that he received chase s letter , he gave a speech that said nothing about bates s opinion , though it would have been natural to invoke the opinion during the part of the speech that called for giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and white the speech turned out to be lincoln s last he was shot three days later over time , the bates opinion faded from public view it was eclipsed first by the civil rights act of 1866 , then by the 14th amendment of 1868 , both of which enshrined the principles of birthright citizenship and equal citizenship in the years that followed , state and then national authorities chipped away at those principles , with less and less resistance offered by

melbourne , australia no short stories seem to make it past the publishers in this men s tennis era this is the age that has embraced and perfected the epic , allowing its public ample time , sometimes record time , to absorb the plots and the protagonists above all the protagonists , with all their foibles and virtues , all their hopes and fears and their allornothing forehands down the line so it went again at the australian open where else \? in a fourthround match that required 5 hours 2 minutes sunday and would easily have been the best of the first week if it had not ended early in the morning in the second week so it went as the thousands of lucky , hardy souls in rod laver arena and all those watching on screens , big and small , in other time zones slowly absorbed just how much this moment , this victory , this upset , mattered to the swiss underdog stanislas wawrinka and just how much , tennis s top marathoner , was determined to reserve another celebration and perhaps another australian open for himself that third straight title , if it comes , will have to wait until next sunday , but even if he falters , djokovic will still have another adrenaline rush to savor in the years ahead after this 16 , 75 , 64 , 67 \( 57 \) , 1210 victory in the fourth round we 're midway through the tournament , but it feels like a final to me , he told the crowd in rod laver arena at 1 45 am so it should have when you consider that last year s final against rafael nadal ended at nearly the same time of night on the same court and after the same sort of pushyourmutuallimits spectacle so it should have considering that both matches ended with djokovic ripping his shirt off his body in wild delight i just had a flashback of 2012 in the finals , he said it was maybe 45 minutes less , this match , than the one 12 months ago , but it was still as exciting for the record , it was 51 minutes shorter than last year s 5 53 final , in part because the pace of play was brisker without nadal s ritualistic short tugging and hair arranging and in part because of wawrinka s aggressive , resolvetheconflict approach djokovic , who took less time than usual himself , prevailed despite losing his big serve seven times , despite being down a break early in the fifth set and despite then having to fight off four more break points at 44 , any of which would have allowed wawrinka to serve for the match djokovic , the no 1 seed , also earned the victory by absorbing all the pace and ambition that wawrinka threw at him in the final bold and desperate game and ultimately by finding both the guts and the coolheaded precision to rip a backhand passing shot crosscourt for a winner off a sharply cut approach shot to finish off a 20shot rally and wawrinka there have been longer epics in this era john isner s firstround victory over nicolas mahut at wimbledon in 2010 that stretched to a preposterous 7068 in the fifth set there have been more significant epics rafael nadal s victory over roger federer in the 2008 final at wimbledon but surely no great match in this memorable stretch has had a more spectacular ending what a match point , unbelievable , djokovic said not that the aesthetics of defeat were much compensation to wawrinka as he fell to his hands and knees when djokovic s last shot sailed beyond his reach and later cried in the locker room we pushed each other to the limit , wawrinka said but in the end i lost and the disappointment is there and the disappointment is enormous but i do think it s also the most accomplished match i 've ever played despite his solid , powerful frame and abundance of shotmaking talent , which includes one of the world s best singlehanded backhands , wawrinka , 27 , has long played in the deep shadow of tennis greatness he is the second best swiss player in the age of federer , who has piled up a record 17 grand slam singles titles while wawrinka has managed to reach two quarterfinals and even on sunday night , in the match of wawrinka s life , federer still intruded in a fashion as watch commercials featuring federer played and replayed on changeovers on the bigscreen televisions inside the arena wawrinka even looked up from his chair and watched on occasion but wawrinka , seeded 15th , has beaten plenty of bigger stars in his career , federer included , even if his only two victories over djokovic came in 2006 , when djokovic was still a champion in training with lessreliable weapons and questionable tenacity and endurance those doubts have since been thoroughly resolved , and djokovic has now beaten wawrinka 11 times in a row none of those victories required an effort comparable to this , however i feel sorry that one of us had to lose , djokovic said he definitely deserved to win , but i'm just thrilled to be able to fight once again up to the last moment the fact is that i have n't played nearly my best , and i did n't feel well on the court in terms of rhythm and ball striking but the credit to him he made me run all over the court he never gave me the same ball he was aggressive from both sides i did n't know what was coming next so i'm just really full of joy after this match his quarterfinal opponent , the fifthseeded tomas berdych , could be excused for feeling a little giddy himself , considering how hard djokovic had to push himself sunday \( and monday \) but djokovic has proved repeatedly in the last two years that he can bounce back quickly from enormous efforts he did it last year in melbourne , beating nadal in five sets and nearly six hours after requiring five grueling sets to defeat andy murray in the semifinals two days earlier i know i can recover i know i have it in me , djokovic , 25 , said his coach , marian vajda , said that djokovic s powers of recuperation have built steadily over the years he got used to it , to this stuff of fitness program , vajda said the years before , he did n't practice that well , that quality and that amount , because he was not able , and his body was not ready and all his nutrition program we had , he change the diet so he s more fit nonetheless , he appeared to be experiencing back stiffness in the latter stages of sunday s match discomfort that vajda said was probably because of cramping and the effects of five hours of intense effort maybe its kind of spasm , said vajda , explaining that hydration and massage normally resolved such issues it certainly did not stop djokovic from acrobatically covering enormous stretches of court when he most needed to against wawrinka , who played the aggressor s role for much of the match though wawrinka has no formal coach , his plan was surely formulated in consultation with severin luethi , the swiss davis cup captain who also helps coach federer it required a deep level of commitment to calculated risk in order to keep djokovic off balance and , above all , superb execution precious few men can get the better of a crosscourt backhand exchange with djokovic consistently , but wawrinka did , repeatedly he also served effectively with 16 aces , two double faults and a firstserve percentage of 62 but the most surprising part was what he did to djokovic s serve , breaking him five times in the first set and a half and then getting the chance to serve for a twoset edge at 53 wawrinka went up by 300 but then lost his touch , making four unforced errors in a row djokovic went on to win the set , and it would have surprised few if he had taken the momentum and swept to a fourset victory but wawrinka reached another peak in the fourthset tiebreaker to foil those expectations , and the two protagonists were soon locked in yet another aftermidnight , 21stcentury tennis epic well i'm just pleased to be part of that era , djokovic said just pleased to be part of those matches where you push yourself up to the last drop of your energy i'm very glad to be a winner of another marathon
dyersburg , tenn as a selfdescribed true southern man and reluctant recipient of food stamps dustin rigsby , a struggling mechanic , hunts deer , doves and squirrels to help feed his family he shops

stimulus bill expires yet as lawmakers cast the fight in terms of spending , nonpartisan budget analysts and hunger relief advocates warn of a spike in food insecurity among americans who , as mr rigsby said recently , look like we are fine , but live on the edge of poverty , skipping meals and rationing food surrounded by corn and soybean farms including one owned by the local republican congressman , representative stephen fincher dyersburg , about 75 miles north of memphis , provides an eyeopening view into washington s food stamp debate mr fincher , who was elected in 2010 on a tea party wave and collected nearly 35 million in farm subsidies from the government from 1999 to 2012 , recently voted for a farm bill that omitted food stamps the role of citizens , of christianity , of humanity , is to take care of each other , not for washington to steal from those in the country and give to others in the country , mr fincher , whose office did not respond to interview requests , said after his vote in may in response to a democrat who invoked the bible during the food stamp debate in congress , mr fincher cited the one who is unwilling to work shall not eat , he said on wednesday , the department of agriculture released a showing that nearly 49 million americans were living in food insecure households meaning , in the bureaucratic language of the agency , that some family members lacked consistent access throughout the year to adequate food in short , many americans went hungry the agency found the figures essentially unchanged since the economic downturn began in 2008 , but substantially higher than during the previous decade experts say the problem is particularly acute in rural regions like dyersburg , a city of 17 , 000 on the banks of the forked deer river in west tennessee more than half the counties with the highest concentration of food insecurity are rural , according to an , the nation s largest network of food banks in dyer county , it found , 194 percent of residents were food insecure in 2011 , compared with 164 percent nationwide over all , nearly 48 million americans now receive food stamps , an 80 billionayear program that is increasingly the target of conservatives robert rector , a scholar at the conservative , argues that the food stamp program should be overhauled so that benefits are tied to work , much as welfare was revamped under president bill clinton he advocates mandatory drug testing for food stamp recipients a position that draws support from mr rigsby , who dreams of becoming a game warden and said it irritated him to see people mooch off the system but when benefits drop in november , the rigsbys , who say they receive about 350 a month , can expect 29 less people have a lot of misimpressions about hunger in america , said maura daly , a feeding america spokeswoman people think it s associated with homelessness when , in fact , it is working poor families , it s kids , it s the disabled

line in a warehouse to distribute the food more than 700 families get help each month from the charitable program , , which was founded in 2009 by mark oakes , the chairman of the local salvation army , after a string of nearby factories closed we could n't absorb the work force back into our community , mr oakes said , and people were hungry among the first in line at the fairgrounds was kathy

declares when we got married , we told each other that we want to be able to sit down at the table and eat as a family , mrs rigsby said but we do n't really get to do that in washington , house republicans propose cutting 40 billion more in food stamps over the next 10 years by imposing work requirements and eliminating waivers for some ablebodied adults the cuts would push four million to six million lowincome people , including millions of very lowincome unemployed parents who want to work but cannot find jobs , off the rolls , according to the a leftleaning research organization even if approved in the house , the cuts would face strong opposition from democrats in the senate but the arguments of mr rector , the heritage foundation scholar , are gaining traction with conservatives on capitol hill i think food stamps have in the republican mind become the symbol of an outofcontrol , meanstested welfare state , mr rector said here in tennessee , mr fincher embraces that view we have to remember there is not a big printing press in washington that continually prints money over and over , he said in may mr rigsby said his family would find a way to make do the way i was raised

new orleans almost three decades later , people remember the backtoback 50point games with the in texas , the quickrelease turnaround jumper on the way up , the preternatural ability to slither through the tiniest cracks in transition defense along the left side on the fast break they typically forget the nearmythic context in which bernard king shaped and reshaped himself as an irresistible offensive force and a hall of fame player , as of monday s class of 2013 announcement players of king s era \( late 1970s to 1980s \) who battled substance abuse and the legal entanglements they could spawn often had their careers aborted in midair and no nba player had ever recovered from what then was a virtual kiss of career death surgery to repair a torn knee ligament to regain elite status , if not the same body propulsion one early sunday morning in the summer of 1980 , the telephone rang in my brooklyn apartment it was king calling from out west to talk about sobriety , his new best friend , a fragile relationship he had cultivated during the previous weeks at a rehabilitation center in santa monica , calif king , out of fort hamilton high school in brooklyn , wanted to speak his piece with his hometown new york post after a run of years in which he compiled a lengthy social and criminal rap sheet the last straw came jan 1 , 1980 , in salt lake city , when king was charged with sexually abusing a woman after being found by the police passed out drunk on the telephone , he admitted to being an alcoholic and said that drinking had become a problem during his college years at tennessee , where he , a northeast africanamerican teenager , needed a release from the social pressures for a young star athlete in the south he spoke of having had premonitions of death , the challenge of dropping the mask of denial and his determination to rescue his life and career before it was too late he did just that in oakland , playing for the golden state warriors , in what then was one of the nba s more tempting drug and alcohol environments the comeback was spectacular and executed with a near hypnotic focus he said he learned from watching his father leave every morning for his bluecollar job king would need that same work ethic when he tore up his knee in what was a meaningless game of a lost season at kansas city against the \( now sacramento \) kings few people understood why king separated himself from the knicks , became downright reclusive , as he overcame a fear of water and learned to swim to begin a rehab that lasted two years one day in june 1986 , after the knicks had drafted kenny walker out of kentucky as king s presumed \( and ultimately pedestrian \) replacement , general manager scotty stirling was asked about king s progress in rehab he did n't know he suggested to reporters that they go ask king , who was working out at upsala college in east orange , nj i was by then reporting for the daily news a colleague , filip bondy , and i decided to take a shot we planned to sneak into the college s gymnasium early , hide and peek at king working out we did not factor in his ritualistic dedication he was already inside , working out with his trainer , when we arrived perched in the bushes , we watched through a window , though king was at the far end of the court and the view was not good several times , he turned to look , while we ducked for cover finally , king appeared from behind us , having slipped out the exit on the other side of the building , a flawless backdoor play he asked us what we thought we were doing stirling suggested we come , we said he had choice words for stirling but stopped short of the door you want to see me work out \? that s why we 're here in that instant , king had decided to take advantage of the opportunity to send the knicks a message do n't count him out against a college player , he played oneonone , ran the floor without any noticeable limp and polished his dormant jumper how do i look \? he said afterward pretty darn good , we would go home to write our exclusive was dimmed that day by the shocking , cocainerelated death of the maryland allamerican len bias , drafted that very week by the boston celtics king had to know on some level that it could have been him he would play only six more games with the knicks , though none with patrick ewing , at the end of the 198687 season the young coach rick pitino , who will be inducted into the hall of fame with king in september , did not think king fit his defense general manager al bianchi would bear the brunt of the decision not to resign king one night in january 1991 when he returned as a washington bullet with his frightful game face to haunt the knicks with 49 points while fans serenaded bianchi with al must go this is not to suggest that king has lived an incidentfree life since that telephone call in 1980 , because he has n't , far from it but in the context of what had already happened , that 1991 night at madison square garden all but completed his career circle , just one digit short of a wellrounded 50
miami matt harvey has mystified plenty of hitters throughout his allstar season but a victory against the lastplace marlins , the worsthitting team in baseball , continued to elude harvey , the mets' ace , on thursday afternoon harvey looked like his usual dominant self for five innings , holding the marlins to one hit on 79 pitches , 52 of them strikes but with the mets unable to back up their starter with any runs of their own , harvey unraveled in the sixth inning , which led to at marlins park it s not like i take this team any differently than any other of my starts , harvey said it just happens that this team finds a way to squeeze out some runs the marlins , who entered the game with a majorleagueworst 231 batting average and 241 runs , broke the scoreless tie with three runs on four hits in the inning to come out with a split of the fourgame series for only the third time in 22 starts this season , harvey failed to complete six innings all three of those starts have come against the marlins at marlins park matt certainly deserves a better fate than he s had , said terry collins , the mets' manager the teams that are a little more aggressive swing and miss , collins added these guys do n't swing and miss they put the ball in play they hit the ball to all fields , so they 're a little tougher for him harvey did strike out eight marlins and walked none , but he lasted only five and twothirds innings , giving up five hits and hitting one batter in four starts against miami this season , harvey is 01 with a 352 earned run average harvey is 82 with a 198 era against everyone else the mets fell to 510 against the marlins this season you can get to that point in the game and you can see his ball start to come up , collins said he had two or three sliders that did n't have much depth to them one of the things we 're trying to get him to understand is that he works so hard and throws so hard that late in the game , sometimes it s easier for him if he gets easy outs early on when you see his breaking ball flattening out , he s running out of gas marlins pinchhitter juan pierre and the rookie left fielder christian yelich led off the sixth with backtoback singles to put runners on first and third harvey almost worked his way out of trouble , recording outs by getting adeiny hechavarria to line out to short and striking out giancarlo stanton but first baseman logan morrison lined an 88 mileperhour changeup to right field to score pierre my job is to go out and put up zeros regardless of whatever is going on , harvey said i'm going to say that until i'm blue in the face obviously i did n't do that today , and i'm not happy about it after harvey hit third baseman ed lucas on the next atbat , marlins second baseman donovan solano fouled off five pitches until finally hitting a single to right that scored two more runs , finishing harvey s afternoon with the marlins leading , 30 i was n't able to make my pitches when i needed to , harvey said the ball came up , and i left it over the middle quite a bit it was just one of those days it happened in the sixth inning other times i 've been able to work through it the mets wasted a few chances to give harvey an early lead , leaving nine runners on base through the first six innings justin turner , who started at second for daniel murphy , delivered a twoout single in the third inning as the mets continued to work high pitch counts off koehler , who was not nearly as efficient as harvey , yet managed to keep the mets off the board the mets loaded the bases in the third inning after david wright drew a walk and marlon byrd was hit by a pitch but ike davis continued his seasonlong struggle , leaving the bases loaded by popping up in foul ground to lucas davis also came up with runners on first and second and two outs in the top of the first we 're just not driving in runs and we have to figure out what we 're doing here , collins said if we knew what it was , we 'd fix it we 're not driving them in there s nothing wrong with our approach we 're not putting good swings on pitches we can hit we 're fouling pitches off we should be hitting
inequality wonks wait eagerly for the latest update of the pikettysaez data , which estimate concentration of income at the top using income tax returns the latest edition does not disappoint it shows , as one might expect but needed confirmed , that the very rich have recovered just fine from the great recession , even as the great majority of americans continue to struggle in fact , the superelite the top 001 percent actually had higher incomes in 2012 than they did at the height of the bubble the new data also give an opportunity to emphasize a key fact that all too many discussions of inequality miss we re not talking about the rise of a broad class of highly educated workers , we re talking about a tiny elite the income share of the top 10 percent has risen to a record but you re completely missing the picture if you think of the top 10 percent as a homogeneous group here s the actual gains since the big change in inequality started to happen of the gains made by the top 10 percent , almost none went to the 9095 group in fact , the great bulk went to the top 1 percent the bulk of the gains of the top 1 , in turn , went to the top 01 and the bulk of those gains went to the top 001 we really are talking about the flourishing of a tiny elite
how better to know a place than to know the earth of a place \? michelle stuart asked recently , as she held court in the expansive , lightfilled soho loft that has been her home base since 1971 furnished with textiles , antiques and artworks , it is also brimming with collections of seeds , bones , photographs , neatly labeled bottles of soil and other souvenirs of her travels ms stuart , who is 80 , has immersed herself in the culture , history and archaeology of different regions , transforming six decades of adventures into a lifetime of art now her works are featured in a wideranging survey , michelle stuart , at the in water mill , ny , through oct 27 focusing largely on drawings and land art projects made between 1968 and 2011 , the exhibition includes more than 50 sculptural assemblages , photographs and works on paper among its highlights are two 12footlong paper scrolls created in 1973 in upstate new york , their surfaces covered with intricate marks made by placing the muslinbacked paper on the ground and rubbing pencil or graphite across it there is a photograph of , a renowned 1975 piece for which ms stuart marked up a 460footlong scroll by smashing rocks into the paper and then unfurling it down an escarpment at a spot where niagara falls was situated 12 , 000 years ago for nazca lines chart book \( 198182 \) , ms stuart created a triptych that recalls the famous peruvian geoglyphs and the constellations above them , using graphite and crystalline earth taken from the site the curator cornelia butler , who has included her work in drawing surveys at the museum of modern art and the museum of contemporary art , los angeles , said that ms stuart was one of maybe only a handful of artists of her generation who made a significant contribution during those early moments of land art around 1970 , when mostly male artists like michael heizer and robert smithson began sculpturing lakes and canyons ms butler , now chief curator at the hammer museum in los angeles , points out that not only did ms stuart incorporate the earth into her drawings , but she also brought drawing into the landscape , as with the niagara gorge project now ms stuart s work is being rediscovered by a new generation of curators , like anna lovatt , the 35yearold british art historian who conceived the idea for the parrish show after doing research for her dissertation on new york drawing practices of the 1960s and '70s dr lovatt said she was particularly struck by the artist s monumental , laborintensive scrolls , a series begun in 1970 , when ms stuart reinvented surrealist frottage by working with , and against , the earth stand before them , and you really get a sense that those were works that had not been produced before and that redefined the way drawing was understood , dr lovatt said \( the show opened last february at the at the university of nottingham , in england , and will travel to the santa barbara museum of art in january \) ms stuart s newer pieces incorporate grids of photographs ring of fire \( 200810 \) has images of people , ships , plant life and constellations , taken throughout the seismically active south pacific basin , as well as of mementos , including of love letters exchanged by her parents after she was conceived in australia alicia longwell , chief curator at the parrish , called it michelle s own creation myth warm and vivacious , ms stuart seems to have at least one fond anecdote at the ready for each piece take , a 1985 assemblage whose loose pages are covered with scrawled drawings of boats observed during a yacht trip in finland as she recalled , she had just completed an earthwork \( involving a boat made from boulders , an elk carcass and hundreds of handmade candles \) on a remote island in the turku archipelago i 'd been there for quite some time , living in a sauna with an assistant , she recalled , when her helsinki dealer took her to lunch in a nearby port town suddenly , she spotted a finnish artist she knew , waving from a race boat he said if you can get up at 4 , you can come with us no luggage ! ' ms stuart said , her eyes shining i love racing and i love to sail so i said , fine , ' and i went ms longwell said she thinks of ms stuart as this unique time traveler , because of the way she looks at ancient civilizations and our own civilization , always with this capacity for wonderment and astonishment over the years , she noted , ms stuart has also traveled between genres and movements at least in the eyes of curators and critics she has been looked at in the context of postmodernist theory , of land art , of feminism it s all there , depending on the lens you bring to it in 1984 , for instance , nazca lines star chart was included in , at the museum of modern art , a controversial exhibition that positioned her alongside modern masters like gauguin and picasso and the indigenous artworks that inspired them in 2010 , moma exhibited the same piece in a completely different context , in , a show that explored different ways of drawing a line , from dancing to sculpture yet ms stuart seems far more interested in pursuing her many interests than fretting over her art historical significance growing up in los angeles , she was fascinated by art , maps , archaeology and , especially , mexico after studying at the chouinard art institute , now calarts , she moved to mexico city , where she stumbled into a job assisting the muralist diego rivera soon ms stuart was living the artist s life a lone gringa ing nue embraced by the avantgarde at a raucous studio party in 1953 , she met the much older catalan painter and political cartoonist jos bartoli , who had just ended an affair with frida kahlo we really hit it off , she said he asked me to marry him that night , and i said yes ms stuart , then 18 , moved to paris with him and became immersed in a crowd of refugees , many of them catalonians , surrealists and deposed eastern european royals it was a big education , she said there were a lot of decent painters , but none of them could hold a candle to the energy that was beginning to happen in new york ms stuart and mr bartoli moved there four years later she loved it , and he did n't they divorced in 1963 \( but remained lifelong friends \) she found that making her way as an independent artist was tough you had to be a goodlooking chick who could be picked up in a bar , she said , and it helped if you liked to drink and argue it was n't my thing i like to be on my toes the next morning to work to support herself , she worked as a fashion illustrator and assisted a clairvoyant at the sherrynetherland hotel \( i had a pack of tarot cards and a lot of imagination , she said \) she also worked ceaselessly in her studio , first making abstract landscape paintings and then plaster sculptures you know all those things that women did of themselves \? she said i cast myself , my hands , my face , different parts of my body soon she was creating relief constructions by putting these sculptures into boxes in the late 1960s , while living in atlanta with a second husband \( the unmentionable , she called him \) , she decided to incorporate red earth from an american indian archaeological site one such piece , \( 1969 \) is in the current show the left side holds smooth earth the right bears the imprint of her hand , marking the start of a long preoccupation with human markings on the landscape since then , ms stuart has made many different sorts of artworks , traveled throughout most of the world and worked with dealers and museums in many farflung cities yet she has somehow managed to retain a wideeyed , eager approach to life and to art making i just say yes to everything , ms stuart said
domboshawa , zimbabwe for nyaradzai majuru , the choice of how to cast her ballot was simple before she and her husband received a twoacre plot of land that had been seized from a white farmer several years ago , they were penniless subsistence farmers on a scrap of communal land now , they grow green beans , sweet potatoes , tomatoes and cabbages that they sell in the market our life is better now because of president mugabe , said ms majuru , 27 , her youngest child tied to her back with a blanket , referring to robert mugabe , 89 , who has led this country since it shook off white rule in 1980 i support him all the way but for 40yearold elizabeth , a janitor at an agricultural college in this small farming town 20 miles north of the capital , life has only gotten worse under mr mugabe s rule hyperinflation wiped out her savings hunger gnawed at her family a lucky few got land , but the country s economy was destroyed , she said , declining to give her last name out of fear of reprisals by the government we need change in this country , elizabeth said we are tired of this old man they were among the millions of zimbabweans who went to the polls on wednesday in what many here are calling the most pivotal election since the nation voted out white rule despite frigid predawn temperatures , people lined up before the polling stations opened , eager to decide whether to end or extend the threedecade tenure of mr mugabe , a liberation war hero who still holds a tight grip on the country in harare , the capital , there was none of the violence and intimidation that characterized the disastrous 2008 presidential election season , when 200 people died in a statesponsored crackdown on the opposition and others seen as supporting it this is a huge change , the fact that people can stand around and talk openly about their views , said namo mariga , an agribusiness entrepreneur , after casting his ballot in the upscale suburb of borrowdale the atmosphere is much freer the election pits mr mugabe against the former union organizer morgan tsvangirai , leader of the movement for democratic change mr tsvangirai won the most votes in the first round of the election in 2008 but refused to participate in a runoff because of the attacks on his supporters a deal brokered by regional powers put the two rivals into an uneasy powersharing agreement , and both are now seeking an outright victory to govern alone it is quite an emotional moment sometimes when you see all these people after all the conflict , the stalemate , the suspicion , the hostility , mr tsvangirai said after casting his ballot i think there is a sense of calmness that finally zimbabwe will be able to move on again sporadic problems were reported in a number of regions lines were long in urban areas , raising concerns that not everyone would be able to vote wednesday the challengers said the zimbabwe election commission had deliberately reduced the number of polling stations in their strongholds to discourage voters , but the commission denied it some voters who registered recently found that their names were not on the rolls , but they were able to cast ballots using the registration receipt we ve already made clear this election is illegal , illegitimate , unfree and unfair , said tendai biti , the secretary general of the movement for democratic change , at a news conference on wednesday afternoon we are participating with a heavy heart the planning for the election has been chaotic and rushed because mr mugabe unilaterally set a much earlier election date than other political parties had anticipated but early reports from election officials and some monitors said that the voting had gone well olusegun obasanjo , the former president of nigeria who is leading the african union observer delegation , said that based on initial reports the voting had been peaceful and orderly , and appeared to be free and fair joyce kazembe , the deputy chairwoman of the zimbabwe election commission , said , i believe that the election is free and fair turnout was very high , the commission said , and it ordered that polling stations stay open until midnight to accommodate people waiting in long lines mr mugabe , after casting his ballot , appeared confident of victory in remarks to reporters asked if he would serve a full fiveyear term , he said why not \?

washington the day after a deadly assault in syria that bore many of the hallmarks of a chemical weapons attack , a sharply divided obama administration on thursday began weighing potential military responses to president bashar alassad s forces senior officials from the pentagon , the state department and the intelligence agencies met for three and a half hours at the white house on thursday to deliberate over options , which officials say could range from a cruise missile strike to a more sustained air campaign against syria the meeting broke up without any decision , according to senior officials , amid signs of a deepening division between those who advocate sending mr assad a harsh message and those who argue that military action now would be reckless and ill timed in an interview with cnn broadcast on friday , mr obama said the united states is gathering information about the chemical weapon reports , but he suggested that it is already clear that the incident will demand america s attention what we 've seen indicates that this is clearly a big event of grave concern , mr obama said during an interview broadcast on cnn s new day program this is something that is going to require america s attention mr obama said his administration does not expect cooperation from syria s regime to determine what happened in the attack but he said that when chemical weapons are used , that starts getting to some core national interests that the united states has debates about syria have played out across the atlantic france backed the use of force to counter such an attack , and turkey and israel expressed outrage but diplomats in several countries conceded there was no stomach among the western allies , including the united states , for longterm involvement in a messy , sectarian civil war while the obama administration said it would wait for the findings of a united nations investigation of the attack , american officials spoke in strikingly tougher terms about what might happen if president obama determined that chemical weapons were used if these reports are true , it would be an outrageous and flagrant use of chemical weapons by the regime , the state department spokeswoman , jen psaki , said the president , of course , has a range of options that we 've talked about before that he can certainly consider the united states first confirmed in april that it believed the syrian government had used chemical weapons , and obama administration officials responded by signaling that they would supply the rebels with weapons but to date , none have arrived , opposition officials said among american officials , there was a growing belief that chemical weapons had been used in the latest attack , early wednesday east of damascus potentially the worst of its kind since saddam hussein used chemical weapons against the kurds in iraq in the 1980s and little doubt that anyone but mr assad s forces would have used them but given how difficult it was last time to prove the use of chemical weapons , administration officials offered no timetable for how long it might take this time , raising questions about how promptly the united states could act israel said its intelligence strongly suggested a chemical weapons attack , while the syrian opposition pointed to evidence , including the use of four rockets and the locations from which they were fired , that members of the opposition said proved the attack could have been carried out only by the government s forces an opposition official described an assault that began shortly after 2 am , when the rockets , which they said were equipped with chemical weapons , were launched two were fired from a bridge on the highway from damascus to homs the others were launched from a sironex factory in the qabun neighborhood of the syrian capital the assad government has denied involvement , and russian officials have accused the rebels of staging the attack the rebels said the government s presumed goal was to weaken the opposition before a major conventional attack with tanks , armored personnel carriers and attack planes on thursday , fighting persisted in the area , raising doubts about the ability of the united nations to send investigators to collect samples from the wounded and dead among the options discussed at the white house , officials said , was a cruise missile strike , which would probably involve tomahawks launched from a ship in the mediterranean sea , where the united states has two destroyers deployed the pentagon also has combat aircraft fighters and bombers deployed in the middle east and in europe that could be used in an air campaign against syria the warplanes could be sent aloft with munitions to be launched from far outside syrian territory , which is protected by a respectable air defense system the targets could include missile or artillery batteries that launch chemical munitions or nerve gas , as well as communications and support facilities symbols of the assad government s power headquarters and government offices also could be among the proposed targets , officials said as leaders digested the harrowing images from syria of victims gasping for breath or trembling , there was a flurry of phone calls among diplomats expressing horror at the calamitous situation in syria and frustration at the lack of an obvious response they are all bad choices , said a european diplomat who asked not to be named because of the delicacy of the situation secretary of state john kerry spoke to ahmad aljarba , the president of the syrian opposition mr kerry expressed his condolences and the obama administration s commitment to looking into what has happened on the ground , ms psaki said mr kerry also spoke to laurent fabius , the foreign minister of france , who raised the prospect of military action he called turkey s foreign minister , ahmet davutoglu several arab foreign ministers the european union s senior foreign policy official , catherine ashton and the secretary general of the united nations , ban kimoon at home , however , officials said the administration remained divided about how to proceed there s a split between those who feel we need to act now and those who feel that now is a very bad time to act , said one senior official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration s internal deliberations the official did not give details about who pushed for a hawkish response to the attack and who urged caution , but he said that some at the white house meeting raised worries that it would take time to build international support for a military response , and that any strikes against mr assad s government might worsen a refugee crisis that has already placed great strain on syria s neighbors , particularly jordan neither the united states nor european countries yet have a smoking gun proving that mr assad s troops used chemical weapons in the attack , the official said but he said intelligence agencies had amassed circumstantial evidence that some kind of chemical had been used not the least of which was the hundreds of casualties the sheer number of bodies is one pretty good indicator , he said if the united states decided to move ahead with a military response with the help of western allies , it would almost certainly be one more in a lengthening series of conflicts where the united states has played a leading role that would lack the united nations imprimatur , including in kosovo , afghanistan and iraq mohammad salaheddine , a syrian reporter for al aan television , an arab satellite television station , painted a bleak picture of the situation in east ghouta , the area near damascus that was the site of the reported chemical attack mr salaheddine was reached by skype on thursday with the help of the syrian support group , an americanbased organization that backs the opposition he asserted that more than 1 , 500 people had been killed by the chemical attack and that many more had been wounded the area , he said , was cut off by the fighting , making it hard for opposition members to smuggle hair , urine and blood samples out for analysis adding to the opposition s frustration , two of its officials said that none of the weapons american officials said would be provided by the cia had yet been delivered senior united states military officials , in particular gen martin e dempsey , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , have cited the risks and costs of a largescale military intervention as has been urged by some members of congress yet the greater political risk now may be to mr obama s credibility , analysts said , given that he laid down a red line last summer to prevent mr assad from using chemical weapons again assuming that there was a largescale chemical attack , it indicates that the regime has not been deterred by the statements coming out of washington , said jeffrey white , a former middle east analyst with the defense intelligence agency who is now a fellow at the washington institute for near east policy
when asked to name the influences on my fiction and nonfiction , it s become fairly customary , and perhaps a little pretentious , for me to cite the literary gods franz kafka , samuel beckett and george orwell and while it s not untrue to say that these three legends , who broke such fertile ground in portraying the struggle of the alienated everyman , made me want to be a writer , i would be remiss if i did n't acknowledge a fourth artistic influence , one who might not come so readily to mind when thinking of literary inspiration but who is equally important to me the radio host howard stern for example , it s 2 o'clock on a monday afternoon , and rather than do work , i am listening to mr stern s show as someone called tan mom informs me , quite candidly , of , among other things , her recent attempt at sobriety , her online sexual behavior and her utter dislike of someone called mom i have no idea what tan mom actually looks like which is probably for the best but based on her name , the sound of her voice and the physical details that mr stern occasionally mentions in passing , i have formed a lurid vision in my head lurid visions , as we know from our nightmares , are often more vivid than reality here , then , is the first significant overlap between the world of mr stern s show and the world of the writer laboring at his desk to achieve , through restricted means , a visual effect on the audience in mr stern s case it s the listener in my case it s the reader yes , ours are waning skills in industries that have been given up for dead still , we eschew progress for the pleasure of our modest tools we are like primitive beings or fools dwelling in a futuristic age of technological ease , where movies and pictures can now be created and exchanged so effortlessly and yet i would no more want to see an actual picture of tan mom than i would , say , a picture of kafka s protagonist josef k , so fully formed these intimate strangers have become in my mind howard stern , as of last year , has reasserted himself in popular culture as a judge on nbc s america s got talent , appraising our nation s singers , dancers and aerial balloonists i do n't care about this after five minutes of watching episode 1 , i turned it off it s mr stern s storytelling that i'm after , his uncanny ability to create scenes on the go , to locate and draw out drama , to introduce surprise , to leaven pain with humor or to put it another way what i'm trying to do his radio show , on sirius xm radio , is usually live monday through wednesday , from 6 to 10 in the morning , but runs on a loop throughout the day , and also on the weekends , and if that s not enough , on a second channel where archived shows , some dating back 20 years , are frequently broadcast this does not bode well for me , a writer who writes from the comfort of his living room , who seeks , like all writers ,  after years of dismissing mr stern as a sexist , racist potty mouth without having ever listened to him i happened upon his radio show purely by accident one morning about 10 years ago , and i was struck by a measured , thoughtful tone that did not precede him not only was he funny , but i found that his troubled childhood as an isolated jewish boy in the predominantly black town of roosevelt , ny , also dovetailed nicely with my unhappy childhood as an isolated jewishiraniansocialist boy in pittsburgh this identity of the alienated , forged in the crucible of early youth , is the engine that drives mr stern s radio show toward the elevation of outcasts , the disassembling \( read humanizing \) of superstars , the impulse to say , no matter the cost , what you really think and feel tonight we honor the sick , the retarded , the slowwitted , the sexually promiscuous , the morally bankrupt , mr stern says by way of promotion my mother was a devoted member of the socialist workers party my father left home when i was 9 months old and the subsequent severance from the mainstream community that i underwent in my formative years convinced me that i was intellectually odd , physically ugly and doomed to be forever on the outside no doubt , this is why i have so strongly identified with characters like kafka s gregor samsa , orwell s winston smith and beckett s tramps , and why , now , decades later , i identify with tan mom and the host of other strange , deluded figures who parade in and out of mr stern s studio this procession of regulars happens to include , at 11 o'clock on a tuesday morning , jeff the drunk and eric the midget jeff is a chronic , unredeemable alcoholic , eric a dwarf who uses a wheelchair eric deplores being referred to as a midget and favors the sobriquet eric the actor mr stern , through some finagling , has arranged for them to phone in to audition for a film director for parts in a movie they are real roles in a real movie , but one of the roles is that of a gay character , and this has caused eric , who is concerned that people will mistakenly assume that he himself is gay , to refuse to audition , despite mr stern s importuning who cares what people think of you \? mr stern exclaims , a sentiment that i myself have never been able to follow is eric s reluctance a failed opportunity for comedy \? no , with any good artist a creative misstep can be turned into something better , and in this case , mr stern proudly takes on the role himself , playing it to the hilt , reveling in the freedom of the part , seemingly making a point about sexual expression and the roles we are all forced to play beneath the laughs something more serious is at work none of this would be effective if mr stern did n't submit for examination the most interesting character of all himself bathroom habits , sexual behavior , overblown insecurity all are laid bare for the inspection of the listener mr stern is , remarkably , the only one on the show who evinces awareness of his own peculiarity if these are freaks , he seems to be saying , i am a freak among them very few guests appear to have gone on mr stern s show thinking themselves at all odd even jeff the vomit guy , an emetophiliac , asks , almost as a mantra , am i the crazy one here \? the lesson is that we are all the crazy ones here we are all gregor samsa , we are all tan mom the only question that remains is how much we are really willing to reveal about ourselves any writer would do well to make this his mission
tilalyan , syria bundled in a thick overcoat against the frosty afternoon , mohamed moussa watched with concern as the town baker worked by flashlight to repair the conveyor belt on his aging oven , the town s principal food source miles from the front lines of the syrian civil war , mr moussa , the 33yearold english teacher who leads the new governing council of this rebelcontrolled town , spends his time locked in a more mundane battle against desperate shortages of almost everything until about three weeks ago , tilalyan s roughly 3 , 800 residents had bread at most twice a week , and its appearance set off a fierce melee among hundreds of families there was no consistent supply of electricity or water , to say nothing of medicine or heating fuel the people get crazy , he said they will have a revolution against the revolution because they are so hungry with syria s twoyearold civil war showing signs of stalemate , scores of new local councils in rebelheld towns like tilalyan are not only fighting deprivation but trying to set up courts , police forces and social services their efforts amount to syria s first experiments in selfgovernment after decades of tyranny under president and his father ,  they are struggling to outlast mr assad in what is increasingly a war of attrition but civilian leaders say the councils are also trying to pry power from the armed rebel brigades that are already staking out control of resources and territories in the vacuum left by the government s retreat tilalyan s council illustrates the challenge it has been forced to depend entirely on the patronage of either the westernsponsored oppositioninexile or competing armed factions , including hardline islamists three months after it was formed , though , the council can claim two achievements four hours a day of electricity and a daily ration of two pieces of flatbread for each adult and child that in turn has brought credibility and legitimacy , even in the eyes of skeptical town elders young people will be the future of syria , said mustafa osman , 39 , the imam of the local mosque , who first drafted mr moussa and other young council members into the job those modest accomplishments reflect the contradictory mix of resilience and fragility that characterizes life in the rebelheld countryside around tilalyan , a swath of farmland stretching as far as 40 miles from the turkish border in northeastern syria residents say they have not faced the threat of a government ground attack since last fall , when the rebels mined the roads the biggest threat these days is the government s attack jets , but they typically concentrate their bombs on larger towns like marea and azaz and they do not fly on cloudy days , allowing residents to walk the streets at ease , until the sun reappears on a recent visit , a tow truck was trying to haul the burnedout wreckage of a handful of government tanks and armored vehicles from the rubble of a mosque near azaz a scavenger hoped to profit by selling the scrap metal but rebel fighters stopped him , insisting that the rusted hulks remain as monument to their victory , the tank graveyard , as locals call it farmers tossed fertilizer through fields of lentils carcasses of meat hung in butcher shops , and storekeepers warmed themselves by burning scraps of wood boys played in the streets or lined up outside a barbershop there were few checkpoints and no weapons in sight when community leaders in tilalyan decided last december to form a provisional local government , they started by bringing together the patriarchs of about two dozen big families , to elect a council from among themselves but the meeting dissolved into bickering they could not agree on anything , said mr osman , the imam many were still too afraid of mr assad to link their names to a rebel government not to be slaughtered with their families , mr moussa said , chuckling the old people think bashar assad is very strong and he will never leave , he said but we think they are not thinking the right way , because we see every day that he is vanishing and going away exasperated , mr osman made a surprise announcement late last year at friday prayer a new council had already been set up and was ready to hear complaints two hours later mr osman summoned mr moussa and four others the job was theirs , the imam told them , by his own unilateral appointment all are bookish graduates of aleppo university with little aptitude for combat two are 26 , one is 27 the oldest is 34 until then , their only involvement in the war was forming a media committee to spread information \( mr osman and the town s military leader , mustafa jaber , 38 , sit on the council as well \) the elders were scornful i need men standing in front of me , i need men to talk to , i do n't need children ! one patriarch complained , as mr moussa , the imam and others recalled the local military brigades resisted more forcefully the civil council takes away some of their power , mr moussa said they say , where did we see you when they were shooting at us \? where were you when we were outside in the cold \? you were in your house and going to work , so shut up ! ' each brigade , most of them loosely organized under the banner of the free syrian army , now has its own rival relief and political wings to position itself for postassad syria , and at one point the tawhid brigade from the town of marea confiscated about a ton of flour from tilalyan s dwindling supply ahmad khatib , in charge of relief efforts for the tawhid brigade , said mr moussa had no right to make demands since his town had paid so small a price in the fight if you bring them 10 prophets from god they will still keep complaining ! mr khatib said of tilalyan s young council but the young civilians quickly shouldered their mandate with 1 , 000 given to the council by the westernbacked syrian national coalition , they fixed damaged converters to restore electricity , needed to power the well in the town they then set out to negotiate for electricity a brigade from the town of al bab had recently seized control of the generators at the tishreen dam but initially refused to share the power how did they know that the council was not a pack of thieves , the brigade demanded \? then the larger neighboring town of tal rifaat was hogging all the electricity , refusing to allow any to pass through to tilalyan or marea , mr moussa said but when it came to electricity , marea s powerful brigade and civilian leaders stepped in to help marea and tilalyan are on the same power line to supply bread , the council pleaded in vain for flour from the international groups camped at the turkish border then they tried to buy it through tal rifaat and finally in the battletorn provincial capital , aleppo the answer , council members said , came from jabhet alnusra , the islamist militia that the group has distinguished itself not only through its battlefield prowess , aid workers say , but also through its determination to capture resources like wheat silos from the government , so that the group could dispense the spoils as patronage they give us flour at less than 20 percent of the real price from the black market , said mr moussa , surveying the 14 metric tons stored in the tilalyan bakery , enough for 13 days adhan naser , 34 , another teacher on the council , interrupted him jabhet alnusra now controls the most important things for life like flour , water and electricity to make the people see jabhet alnusra as the model , the perfect thing , he said this plan is very clear to all of us but this kind of game is not going to work , because our future is not jabhet alnusra we do n't need afghanistan in syria to end the daily melee for bread , the council counted the town s 3 , 824 adults and children and arrived at a ration of two loaves of flatbread per person and arranged to have it delivered for five syrian pounds less than a dime by then , the council had spent all of its 1 , 000 in seed money and 300 more from its own pockets it would not matter if we were rich , but we are not , mr moussa said in a recent meeting in a chilly schoolroom , the council tore into mr moussa for failing to consult it before giving the garbage collector a raise of 200 syrian pounds a week , about 3 and a donor had provided 13 pounds of macaroni for local refugees , but could the council manage the backlash if they had none for others \? no , they decided , the refugees would have to wait at least there was bread for about seven days now we have had bread every day , and the people are very happy , he said or at least a part of them is happy
rome a populist with wild hair , a booming voice and untucked shirts , beppe grillo now holds the fate of and to some extent europe in his hands after winning a quarter of the votes in last week s national election , mr grillo , a comedian turned activist , is being courted by italy s traditional political players , but having thumbed his nose at them for years , he is having none of it he has ruled out such alliances , throwing italian politics into a logjam he refers to former prime minister silvio berlusconi , who sought a return to power , as the psycho dwarf and has steadfastly by pier luigi bersani , the leader of the centerleft democratic party , to join forces to govern , dismissing him as a dead man walking in a rare interview at his seaside home in marina di bibbona on sunday , mr grillo said it would be inadmissible for him to ensure the stability of a future italian government it would be like napoleon making a deal with wellington barefoot and wearing faded jeans and a gray tshirt with an image of gandhi , he said his goal was to do away with a system that had disintegrated the country and build something new that would restore italy to a true participatory democracy we can change everything in the hands of respectable people , but the existing political class must be expelled immediately , he said mr grillo typifies a new style of politician rising from the fires of the s longrunning economic crisis and voter discontent in other countries like alexis tsipras , the young upstart in greece who rode an antiausterity wave to head the secondlargest parliamentary party , or yair lapid , who tapped into a national frustration with social inequality in israel , these politicians are not extremists but generally reformist leftists in refusing to play ball with the establishment powers , whom they consider irredeemably corrupt , the newcomers are fraying nerves in brussels and berlin there is the sense that the european project is at risk with what happens in italy if grillo blames the eu for problems along with germany , the enforcer , said mois s na m , a senior associate at the in washington if he gets away with that , other politicians will also do it , and there may be contagion now that his political crusade , called the five star movement , has been handed a powerful mandate , mr grillo s challenge will be to decide how to use it to change an establishment that has long viewed him as a demagogic , even reckless , man who risks taking italy down the path of greece mr grillo rejected those charges in the interview , in which his athome persona bore little resemblance to the inflammatory populist whipping up crowds into an indignant rage how can we be accused of destroying something that s already destroyed \? he said , speaking in measured tones they 've devoured the country , and now they ca n't govern over the years , he has gathered huge followings after being barred from italian television in the 1980s for mocking corrupt politicians with a background in accounting , he has also taken on scandalridden businesses that have cost shareholders and taxpayers spectacular amounts through mismanagement , including the parmalat dairy empire , telecom italia and the bank monte dei paschi di siena his biggest edge , however , has been exploiting the power of the internet and social media to get his message out when he started a political blog in 2005 , people logged in by the millions to engage in debate buoyed by the momentum , he formed his five star movement a little more than three years ago , based on a manifesto of improving public water , transportation , development , internet connection and availability , and the environment soon , five star candidates , known in the press as grillini , began making a mark in local elections , grabbing seats in the legislatures of the sicily region and in the city of parma by addressing issues that embedded politicians rarely took on candidates mostly eager professionals younger than 45 post videos and profiles of themselves on mr grillo s blog and are then chosen through an online vote ethics standards are strict no criminal record or previous political affiliations are permitted doing without official cars and other perks of office is a must lawmakers must quit after two terms and may keep only a small percentage of the monthly salary that italian elected representatives typically earn the rest will most likely be put into a fund for small and medium businesses planning to expand and create jobs before the national vote , the most striking success had come in sicily , where the party won 15 of 90 seats in the regional assembly in october it has since scored some legislative victories on critical issues in the party s platform , largely by backing proposals sought by the movement s members , regardless of which party makes them , said francesco cappello , the party s deputy leader there recently , for instance , lawmakers approved a plan by the democratic party to halt a costly public works contract for a bridge over the strait of messina , which divides sicily from the mainland mr grillo , in a wet suit , swam it in october in one hour , a stunt he said had shown why the bridge was hardly needed such tactics may be effective at shifting legislative agendas at a regional level but maneuvering in the political shark tank of rome will require a different approach the party has the problems of a movement that grew quickly , said roberto biorcio , a sociology professor at bicocca university in milan and an author of a recent book about the five star movement so there will be some issues of inexperience mirella liuzzi , 27 , an expert on social media , is one of the 109 grillini who will enter the lower house in rome soon she said she was looking forward to standing in parliament , but acknowledged that it would be a tough mandate already , the movement s voters are begging her not to disappoint them , she said on sunday , all of the newly elected grillini kicked off several days of meetings in rome to learn about lawmaking even if it is n't a political party , it will have to do the sorts of things that a political party normally does , mr biorcio said in the interview , mr grillo said the movement would try to develop a consensus platform through discussion and set out legislative goals by may among the top measures is a socalled citizenship salary , a type of unemployment insurance for hardhit italians policies would be funded by cutting waste , corruption and rampant political spending further savings would come from withdrawing italian forces from afghanistan , capping state pensions at 5 , 000 euros a month and overturning tax amnesties , among other steps the big question is still whether five star lawmakers will simply be reactive and prone to blocking legislation they deem unfavorable after mr grillo refused to ally the movement with other parties , his detractors pointed out that most of his talk involves pulling down rather than building up his stance has rekindled fears that italy may pivot back toward the center of the euro crisis , which mr grillo blames for worsening the lives of ordinary italians he has called for a nationwide referendum on whether italy should remain in the euro zone , and declared the spread between yields on italy s and germany s bonds a hallucination a claim that rings hollow while thousands of small businesses are closing weekly as foreign investors drive up interest rates to reflect political uncertainty the departing prime minister , mario monti , saved italy at least temporarily from having to ask for an international bailout the risk is that mr grillo has the effect of reversing those gains , making the situation harder for the people he is fighting for mr grillo brushed off those concerns markets would respond positively , he said , if we work with transparency and serenely , if we are honest and abolish conflict of interest , and pass laws against criminality , and if we support small and medium businesses and transform italy into a community back in sicily , rosario crocetta , the region s centerleft president , said he was skeptical about mr grillo s ability to guide the movement s legislators in rome the time has come for grillo to decide whether he is the pied piper of a protest movement that is an end to itself , or take on the institutional responsibilities for which he asked citizens for a mandate , mr crocetta said he has to show voters whether he was elected to help the country , or to lead it into chaos
east rutherford , nj in the locker room sunday , moments after the thrashed his giants , 230 , coach tom coughlin took the blame for the humiliating defeat safety antrel rolle stood and interrupted coughlin , insisting that the loss was on the players you ca n't coach heart , rolle later said , describing his message to the team sometimes out there today , it looked like we did n't have a pulse it is unheard of for a player to intervene in the middle of a coach s speech after an embarrassing game but the giants \( 59 \) are not suffering through a routine season it is one of the worst of the coughlin era , which began in 2004 with a 610 season that had been coughlin s only losing season as giants coach sunday s defeat assures that this will be his second coughlin is not taking it well in another rare moment , he singled out the giants' offensive unit , castigating it for a lack of effort it was a pathetic offensive performance , coughlin said we did n't block anybody we did n't make any plays i expected great effort today i think defensively and with our special teams , we got it offensively , we did not later , coughlin added , i told the players who prepared and gave great effort that i appreciated what they did , and i told those that were obvious they had not , that i felt sorry for them because they 're missing the whole point throughout the giants' locker room , players were as disheartened as their coach none more so than , who had a careerhigh five interceptions it s not fun when you 're getting dominated like that , said manning , who has 25 interceptions , tying his career high it s tough to deal with , and it s not what we 're used to around here manning s woes were impossible to overlook , and they have been the hallmark of the giants' season , but he was also not getting much help from his teammates two other trademark deficiencies were evident sunday as well the offensive line was overrun by the seahawks' tenacious defensive line , and the giants' wide receivers did little to win the oneonone battles with the secondary in addition , manning was sacked three times , and the giants' running game was almost nonexistent , gaining 25 yards on 14 attempts if that was not repugnant enough , victor cruz , probably the giants' best player this season , left the game with a concussion and a knee sprain pathetic , embarrassing whatever word you want to use , it is accurate , center kevin boothe said of his receivers , coughlin said , we got outfought for the ball when asked if manning s 25 interceptions were the quarterback s fault or a case of his teammates not helping him be more productive , coughlin replied , it s been a little bit of both but do not expect the giants to turn to the backup quarterback curtis painter or the rookie ryan nassib when they travel to detroit for their next game he s our guy , coughlin said of manning , whose 169 interceptions in his 10year career are now the franchise record we dug our own hole , and we have to fight our way out of it it all added up to a desultory performance in front of mostly unoccupied seats at metlife stadium by halftime , more than half of the announced crowd of 79 , 691 had left by the fourth quarter , no more than half of those fans remained to watch a giants team that has lost 14 of its last 22 games going back to last season the wounded , lifeless giants were an easy mark for the seahawks \( 122 \) , who pounced early and dominated throughout behind quarterback russell wilson , who threw for 206 yards and ran for 50 , the seahawks scored on their second possession and methodically extended their lead to 130 by the half with the giants' offense going nowhere it did not move into seattle territory until the middle of the fourth quarter the seahawks could pick their spots and attack an overworked defense seattle added a thirdquarter field goal , and wilson threw a 12yard touchdown pass to doug baldwin to end the scoring early in the fourth quarter manning s interceptions were of all varieties the first was picked off by byron maxwell late in the first quarter on a pass intended for cruz early in the second quarter , manning was intercepted again when he underthrew wide receiver hakeem nicks on a deep sideline route and seattle s richard sherman easily snatched the ball , though nicks did not aggressively fight for it , either manning s third interception , another by sherman , was on the final play of the first half , a desperation pass heaved toward the goal line from his own 35yard line maxwell got his second interception on the first play of the fourth quarter , cutting in front of running back peyton hillis , who was running over the middle later in the fourth quarter , with the giants finally threatening to score , manning threw into the end zone , but sherman went up for it against nicks , who does not have a touchdown catch this year , and it was deflected into the hands of seattle s earl thomas i did n't play well enough , manning said some of the throws that were intercepted could have been better and we got outplayed in a lot of spots they wanted it more cruz was hurt trying to make a reception that would have given him more than 1 , 000 yards for the season he jumped to snare a high manning throw , then landed awkwardly on his shoulder and head as he fell backward he left the field walking unsteadily the play was originally ruled a completion , but seattle coach pete carroll challenged the ruling after the replay review , it was ruled an incomplete pass the giants gave no update on cruz s condition hillis was also being evaluated for a concussion and left guard james brewer , who is starting because injuries to two centers have caused boothe , the usual starter at left guard , to have to play center , left the game with an ankle injury altogether , it left the mood in the giants' locker room a mix of gloom and irritation and hours after the game , there was a hint of dissension tight end brandon myers wrote on his twitter account if ppl on this team wanna take shots at me an say i have no passion they are mistaken i give everything i have each an every week it was not clear who myers was referring to , and in a subsequent posting he seemed to want to take back his words at his locker , rolle had not forgotten the team s gathering directly after the game had ended coach coughlin ca n't take any of this blame , he said he ca n't make a player have passion about this game , and that s what we were lacking out there today
reflecting on new york city s tumultuous summer of 1863 , the rev charles bennett ray , pastor of bethesda congregational church on sullivan street in manhattan , noted later that year but when we had concluded our work with the relief committee , our missionary work with these still suffering people was not done with some of them it had just begun their claims for household goods were still unpaid , and they were destitute of everything needful for use and comfort none know , excepting those who have witnessed it , the extent of the suffering among them the suffering people were africanamericans affected by the new york city draft riots , which occurred over four days in july of 1863 and dominated the lives of black new yorkers during the rest of that summer in the aftermath , ray , the rev henry highland garnet and other black clergymen dispensed aid to those in need and collaborated with local newspapers to convey to white and black new yorkers a desire to move forward living in an atmosphere of fairness a broad range of issues , some decades in the making , related to slavery , abolition , social class , politics , ethnicity , race , labor and capital inspired the riots that summer of 1863 as a city of commerce , many new york merchants had strong financial ties with the southern planter class against whom the civil war , begun in 1861 , was being waged as a northern bastion of the democratic party , many new york democrats opposed the civil war and sympathized with their fellow democrats in the south but new york was also a center of abolitionism , with the city s presses producing thousands of antislavery tracts , and its churches and other meeting houses for decades served as gathering places for meetings denouncing slavery by the 1860s new york had also become a base of the new antislavery republican party the spark for the new york city draft riots was the federal conscription act , the nation s first draft , passed by congress in march 1863 two years into the civil war , with desertions , tens of thousands of battlefield deaths and an equal number of deaths from disease , more troops were needed for the union army than were being supplied by volunteers the conscription law targeted men between the ages of 20 and 35 , and all unmarried white men up to the age of 45 for military service the provision that enabled draftees to be released from service by paying 300 \( a year s wages for some \) to a replacement ensured that the draft would target lowerincome men many white working men in new york took this fact as proof of the rumors that , once they were drafted , their jobs would be taken by black men the draft selection began routinely on saturday , july 11 , and was scheduled to continue on monday morning but hundreds of white working men mobbed the draft office at third avenue and 47th street and destroyed the office over the next four days , groups of men \( and some women \) moved about the city , looting stores and burning warehouses and the homes of africanamericans , white abolitionists and any businesses that were thought to be sympathetic to blacks any black person caught in the mob s path was clubbed , stabbed , hanged or burned , and in some cases a combination of all four many of the male victims were sexually mutilated , and their toes or fingers cut off for trophies new york s recently elected republican mayor , george opdyke , issued a proclamation declaring new york city to be in a state of insurrection the police as well as militia units based in manhattan scrambled to thwart rioters by thursday , the fourth day of the rioting , the first of several union army regiments arrived in new york from the south by saturday , 10 regiments were in the city , sent north under orders from the secretary of war edwin stanton although the peak of the violence had passed , the city was still unsafe a comprehensive survey of the damage began estimates of white and black people killed in the four days of rioting ranged from 74 to 1 , 200 property valued at 5 million was destroyed , and it was estimated that 3 , 000 black residents \( out of a black population of 12 , 000 , and total city population of 800 , 000 \) had no place to live for black new yorkers , the riots shattered any sense of stability that they may have had new york s white civic leaders moved quickly into action to organize relief efforts , under the auspices of the committee of merchants for the relief of colored people suffering from the late riots the relief committee hired a general agent , vincent colyer , and an office was opened on fourth street notices were placed in newspapers notifying victims of the process for obtaining assistance a panel of africanamerican ministers , including ray and garnet , pastor of the africanamerican congregation at shiloh presbyterian church , located at prince and marion streets , were appointed by the committee to make home visits to those seeking aid and to determine the truthfulness of their requests they were good choices a former editor of the colored american newspaper , ray had a reputation that extended beyond new york city , as did garnet his 1843 address to the slaves , a call to resistance which he made at the national convention of colored men in buffalo , brought him to the attention of leaders in the black community across the country the clergy reached out to the black community through home visits as well as newspaper announcements in the july 21 edition of horace greeley s new york daily tribune , garnet offered a message of thanks under the heading the colored people of new york to their friends indicating that the message was offered at the request of many of the colored citizens of new york to the portion of the city press which counseled observance of the law , to the police officers who provided protection , to the ladies and gentlemen who sheltered our wives and little children , and to ministers of every denomination , it noted that we wish our persecutors no harm this message seems to have been more than a simple note of gratitude while its tone was consistent with the christian ethos of forgiveness , garnet s reference to the portion of the city press that encouraged lawfulness alludes to the common belief , prominent at the time in the black community and elsewhere , that some elements of the press had incited the rioters a critical purpose of the message could also have been to reassure white new yorkers that black new yorkers would not seek revenge leading to a cycle of violence garnet s same message appeared in the july 25 edition of the new york weekly the angloafrican the editor , robert hamilton , and his brother thomas had established the angloafrican in new york city in 1859 with the motto on its masthead announcing that man must be free , if not through the law , then above the law since that paper s readership was predominantly black , the purpose of reprinting the message of thanks to the white community in that paper could have been to inform the black community that there were white new yorkers who had assisted some blacks in the midst of the riots , even if that had not been the personal experience of the readers , and to send the signal to black residents that seeking revenge would not benefit the black community the merchant s committee ultimately raised over 40 , 000 from individuals and groups , including sunday school classes and church congregations of all denominations within the city and from other parts of the country , and assisted over 12 , 000 people the committee formally completed its work with a meeting on aug 22 , at which the black clergymen provided the committee with a proclamation of thanks for their assistance that included the following request if in your temporary labors of christian philanthropy , you have been induced to look forward to our future destiny in this our native land , and to ask what is the best thing we can do for the colored people \? this is our answer protect us in our endeavors to obtain an honest living suffer no one to hinder us in any department of well directed industry , give us a fair and open field and lets us work out our own destiny , and we ask no more nevertheless , the black population of new york city declined dramatically after the draft riots in the census of 1860 , new york s black population was 12 , 414 by 1865 it was estimated at 9 , 945 while other northern cities , including boston and detroit , experienced racial violence sparked by the inception of the draft , no response was as virulent as new york city s four days of rioting the draft , suspended due to the riots , resumed on august 19 , and with the military presence in the city continuing , it proceeded in an orderly fashion but as suggested in ray s report to the american missionary association , the deep effects of the draft riots would require a much longer period to be overcome follow

re \( editorial , oct 16 \) the european union is a limited democracy decisionmaking is distant very distant from demos , the people the european commission s decisions are popularly constrained only by widespread popular action if the commission and its allies persist in ignoring popular disagreement with their austerity policies , then it is they who are the cause of the rise of populist demagogy demos would prefer respectable leaders , but if there are none who listen , then demos will turn to the demagogues the commission and its allies are all the more culpable because there is today absolutely no serious intellectual support for austerity policy demos is right and will not be denied the question is whether the baby will be thrown out with the bath water bob nelson calais , france , oct 16 , 2013
new haven the supreme court s soaring to the core of the defense of marriage act as unconstitutional is a civil rights landmark , but the history leading up to it is poorly understood marriage equality was neither inevitable nor , until recently , even conceivable and the struggle for it was not , as is commonly believed , a natural consequence of the gay liberation movement that gained steam in the late 1960s it was not until the 1980s that securing legal recognition for samesex relationships became an urgent concern of lesbians and gay men decades earlier , such recognition was almost unimaginable in the 1950s , most states criminalized gay people s sexual intimacy newspaper headlines blared the state department s purge of homosexual employees during the mccarthyera lavender scare police cracked down on lesbian and gay bars and other alleged breeding grounds of homosexuality the lesbian and gay liberation movements of the early 1970s did not make marriage a priority quite the opposite activists fought police raids , job discrimination and families' rejection of their queer children most radical activists scorned the very idea of marriage but a handful walked into clerks' offices across the country to request marriage licenses state officials suddenly realized that their laws failed to limit marriage to a man and a woman no other arrangement had been imagined by 1978 , 15 states had written this limitation into law a traditional family values movement arose to oppose gay rights and feminism anita bryant and other activists took aim at some of the earliest local antidiscrimination laws , and by 1979 they had persuaded voters in several cities to repeal them subsequently , in more than 100 state and local referendums , gayrights activists had to defend hardwon protections this , not marriage , consumed much of their energy it was the '80s that changed things the aids epidemic and what came to be known as the lesbian baby boom compelled even those couples whose friends and family fully embraced them to deal with powerful institutions family and probate courts , hospitals , adoption agencies and funeral homes that treated them as legal strangers hospitals could deny the gay partner of someone with aids visitation privileges , not to mention consultation over treatment he could n't use his health insurance to cover his partner he risked losing his home after his partner died , if his name was n't on the lease or if he could n't pay inheritance taxes on his partner s share \( which would not have been required of a surviving spouse \) when two women shared parenting and the biological mother died , the courts often felt obliged to grant custody to her legal next of kin even if the child wished to remain with the nonbiological mother if the women separated , the biological mother could unilaterally deny her ex the right to see their children couples used wills , powers of attorney and innovative new legal arrangements like domestic partnerships and secondparent adoption to try to get around these injustices , an astounding achievement given the reigning conservatism of the '80s and early '90s but for all their virtues , none of these arrangements could provide the social security , tax , immigration and other benefits that only marriage could bestow the marriage movement emerged out of this maelstrom , but it was always about more than legal benefits historically , denial of marriage rights has been a powerful symbol of people s exclusion from full citizenship enslaved people in america did not have the right to marry before the civil war jews did not have the right to marry nonjews in nazi germany in 1948 , the united nations enshrined the freedom to marry as a that same year california s highest court became the first in the nation to overturn a state law banning interracial marriage as attitudes toward homosexuality changed in the 1990s , before accelerating ever more rapidly over the last decade , antigay activists who had already fought gay teachers in schools , gaystudent groups , gay characters on tv , domestic partnerships and antidiscrimination laws redoubled their fight against marriage equality in 1996 , when it appeared that hawaii s courts might let samesex couples wed , congress passed doma , which declared that no state needed to give full faith and credit to another state s samesex marriages it also denied federal recognition and benefits to such marriages the provision struck down on wednesday as justice anthony m kennedy wrote for the majority doma s principal effect is to identify a subset of statesanctioned marriages and make them unequal when massachusetts became the first state to let gay couples marry , in 2004 , it unleashed opposition as well as euphoria that year , 13 states amended their constitutions to ban such marriages \( 12 had already done so legislatively \) ultimately , california and 40 other states acted to limit marriage to one man and one woman by constitutional amendment , legislation or both in 30 states , the amendments are on the books as a result of another supreme court ruling on wednesday , california will soon join 12 states \( and the district of columbia \) in permitting samesex marriage , but the statebystate battle will grind on elsewhere the intensity of the backlash against marriage equality eventually produced its own backlash many heterosexuals sought to distance themselves from the antigay animus it expressed young people , who grew up in a cultural universe different from their parents' , began to wonder why marriage was an issue at all political figures as different as barack obama and rob portman described how their children had affected their thinking federal benefits will dramatically improve the lives of countless people , from the lesbian widow who needs her wife s social security benefits to hold onto her home to the gay new yorker whose foreign husband will now be able to live with him in america couples will no longer suffer the indignity of having the government treat their marriages as inferior urgent problems still confront lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people , including the endemic bullying of queer students , discrimination in housing and employment and the surge in new hiv infections among young gay and bisexual men marriage equality has singular legal , cultural and practical significance nonetheless , it was not the first issue to animate the struggle for equality and dignity nor will it be the last
beirut , lebanon seven of syria s most powerful rebel groups said that they had forged a new islamic force seeking to topple the government of president bashar alassad and replace it with an islamic state the new alliance , the islamic front , was announced in a shown on al jazeera television on friday and featured some of syria s most widely recognized rebel commanders while some rebels and opposition activists hailed the new group s formation as a major step forward for the antiassad insurgency , it remained unclear to what extent the announcement reflected a true reorganization of rebel forces or what difference it would make in practice most of the participating groups , while maintaining their own command structures , have long cooperated in battle and through two and a half years of civil war , new rebel formations have been announced frequently , many of them faring no better against government forces than those they preceded some rebels said the unification was also meant as a show of force by mainline rebel factions against one of syria s al qaeda affiliates , the islamic state in iraq and syria , or , which has recruited thousands of foreign jihadists , seized patches of territory and clashed with other groups for resources the statement announcing the islamic front described it as an independent political , military and social formation that seeks to completely topple the assad regime in syria and build an orthodox islamic state a spokesman for al tawhid brigade , which joined the group , said by telephone from northern syria that it was formed after months of discussion among rebel leaders who sought an alternative to the opposition s nominal leadership , the , which many fighters consider out of touch the opposition coalition gets its legitimacy from the civilians and fighters inside syria , so if the coalition ca n't fulfill their wishes , it should admit that , said the spokesman , who gave his name as abu harith he said the islamic front would work to integrate all the forces that joined it and create a single office to receive and distribute military aid competition for financing and arms has long created rifts among rebel groups abu harith denied that the islamic front was formed to challenge isis , but said it would oppose the group if it oppressed civilians the islamic front was born to defend the syrian people and to achieve their goals of freedom and a decent life , he said so if people complain about isis s behavior , we will have their complaints solved the formation of the islamic front is another blow to efforts by the united states and other powers to organize talks aimed at ending the war it also highlights the increasing irrelevance of the rebels' supreme military council , formed last year under pressure from the west to bolster more moderate fighting groups at the expense of extremists a number of the islamic front s founding brigades were members of the supreme military council although it was unclear if they had officially broken with it , none have spoken of the military council as a major source of support a spokesman for the council , louay mekdad , said that the groups had not quit the council and that he supported all efforts to unify the rebels we see this as a new stage with the formation of this large , respectable group , and we hope that all the forces on the ground will unify , he said the umbrella does n't matter to us the principles of the revolution do yet a highranking member of the military council who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the new group s formation could harm the rebellion by further splitting support for the fighters if the support we used to get is split between the smc and the islamic front , this means less effectiveness for both sides , he said
moscow a moscow district court ordered sergei udaltsov , , to be placed under house arrest on saturday , in one of the most assertive legal measures to date against a leader of the antikremlin protests that began more than a year ago mr udaltsov , the leader of the radical socialist left front movement , faces a charge of conspiracy to incite mass disorder under a statute that can bring a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison according to saturday s ruling , he may not leave his house , use the internet , receive letters or communicate with anyone outside his family and legal team until april 6 , the current date for the end of the investigation into his case the ruling seemed to signal a new stage in the government s effort to punish wellknown critics of president vladimir v putin though most of the prominent protest leaders have served short sentences for administrative violations and several are the subject of criminal inquiries , none has yet been held or brought to trial on criminal charges the authorities may have held back from jailing protest leaders like mr udaltsov for fear of inciting a backlash from opposition sympathizers mr udaltsov has a particular ability to mobilize young men and is one of the few opposition leaders to focus on economic issues relevant to russians outside large cities a passionate public speaker and the greatgrandson of a prominent bolshevik , , many of them middleclass russians who distance themselves from calls for revolution outside the courtroom , mr udaltsov said that he had broken no laws and that the house arrest order had a strictly political character they have gotten to the point of open fabrication and lies , he said my civic activity just angers the authorities , angers law enforcement structures , and they are taking steps to isolate me from taking part in civic life during saturday s hearing , prosecutors also claimed that mr udaltsov had threatened to attack his wife , anastasia , and that she at one point had fled to ukraine with their children a judge refused to allow mr udaltsov s wife to testify in court on saturday , but she told the daily newspaper novaya gazeta that the accusation was a total lie mr udaltsov has been accused of attacking the police and of rioting at an antiputin demonstration that ended in clashes between the riot police and protesters last may , and of attempting to organize antigovernment riots in cities across  mr udaltsov has been under a travel ban since october , but prosecutors said that he had gone outside moscow and continued to lead public rallies while under investigation a statement from investigators charged that mr udaltsov has not lived at his registered address for a long time , his mobile telephone is often switched off , making it difficult to summon the accused to investigators the statement also said mr udaltsov does not inform the investigation of his factual location saturday s ruling came at the request of the powerful investigative committee , which has recently revived several stalled criminal investigations against russian opposition leaders including and corruption whistleblower mr udaltsov , in his closing arguments , told the judge that if he was placed under house arrest , he would like the state to afford him a 13room apartment , a cook and a maid a reference to the housearrest conditions reportedly granted to a defense ministry official facing corruption charges
india lofted a marsbound spacecraft into earth orbit on tuesday , a major step in its hopes to become the fourth country in the world and the first in asia to reach mars the launch is only the first step , however , in an oftenperilous , 300day journey to mars that has ended in failure for roughly a third of all previous efforts only the united states , europe and russia have successfully reached the red planet , and none of them managed it on their first try the spacecraft will use the effects of the earth s gravity to propel it toward mars to achieve this it will have to orbit the earth for a month as a series of small bursts by its thrusters slowly nudge it to the right trajectory if all goes well , it will reach mars on sept 24 , 2014 at a price tag of 72 million , the mars project is relatively inexpensive , but that has not stopped critics from raising questions about why the government is pouring money into space programs when india has so many pressing social , educational and infrastructure needs a prominent scholar and activist , jean dreze , told india today that the mars mission seems to be part of the indian elite s delusional quest for superpower status but those concerns were not widely shared by india s leaders in the heat of an election campaign , both prime minister manmohan singh and narendra modi , the candidate for prime minister from the main opposition bhartiya janata party , were quick to congratulate the scientists on their initial success india has once again established itself in the world , mr modi said i congratulate the scientists and technicians behind the mission indian officials also defended the program as yielding technological advances that are hard to predict in advance , claims that critics were quick to dismiss g madhavan nair , the head of the indian space research organization at the time of the moon launch , told the indian express earlier this year that instead of concentrating on practical missions we are spending money to prove nothing someone has made some statement that the mars mission will prove new technologies but as a person familiar with these new technologies , he said , i believe that there is no new technology involved the space program is not only a source of nationalist pride but a weapon in india s competition with china it was shortly after the failure of a chinese mission to mars in 2011 that mr singh , addressing the nation on india s independence day , announced the plans for an indian attempt , saying that this spaceship to mars will be a huge step for us in the area of science and technology india s mars venture was preceded by a similar mission that placed a spacecraft , chandrayaani , in orbit around the moon in 2008 the moon mission also followed a similar effort by china , and officials were quite blunt about their intentions china has gone earlier , but today we are trying to catch them , catch that gap , bridge the gap , bhaskar narayan , a director at the indian space agency , was quoted by reuters as saying at the time once the spacecraft nears mars it will be maneuvered into a low orbit to assay the martian atmosphere , looking in particular for the presence of methane , a possible indicator of the existence of life processes at some point in the planet s history the modest size of the payload , at 33 pounds , is an indicator of the limitations of the mission but repeated failures in the development of a rocket capable of carrying payloads of more than two tons had led to delays sk das , a former member of the space commission , which sets out indian space policy , said tuesday that we should see this as a technical exercise , though he conceded that a more powerful rocket could have made for a less complex journey to mars it is a long journey and we can only understand the challenges and the problems by attempting it , he added the first stage has been flawless hartosh singh bal is the political editor of open magazine waters close over us , his book about the narmada river is forthcoming from harpercollins india
colorado springs don ramos is 80 his square jaw looks chiseled from rock , and his biceps , when flexed , looks as if it swallowed a softball he holds several weightlifting world records for his age group and can still lift more than 160 pounds off the ground and raise it over his head a little over two weeks ago , though , ramos was declared a cheat , the oldest steroid doper ever caught by the united states antidoping agency he does not deny that he took synthetic testosterone , a banned substance he has been taking it for 20 years , he said , with a prescription from a doctor a practice common among aging men , even those with no competitive ambitions , to combat naturally falling levels of the hormone but after a recent competition in chicago , ramos s testosterone level was found to be extraordinarily high , more than twice the typical reading for someone his age he was suspended from competition for two years and did not appeal the ruling do i consider myself a cheater \? ramos said , mulling the question i never thought of myself that way i feel like i'm just keeping myself healthy doping in sports is most commonly associated with highprofile offenders like lance armstrong and alex rodriguez , superstars with bulging contracts to match their muscles but most of the athletes caught in recent years for using steroids and other banned substances have been littleknown amateurs in smalltime competitions the list of the more than 20 athletes caught this year by usada includes a 30yearold player of boccia , a sport similar to bocce a 49yearold paralympic sailor and a 64yearold hammer thrower last year , a 56yearold paralympic archer received a warning for a doping rules violation in 2011 , three athletes in their 60s were caught none received the attention that ramos did with one urine sample , 80 years of life dissolved into a likely epitaph but ramos is far more than an easy punch line i 've got a good story is how ramos would start , again and again , on his way to detailed accounts of his life , as the son of a carousing bandleader and his dancer wife , who once hired a young girl now known as judy garland to babysit ramos s life is a forrest gumpian odyssey , most of it verifiable his claim about being a wellknown dance instructor in new york city leads to his quotations in on the latest crazes a mention of his stumble into modeling leads to , with a 30yearold ramos relaxing next to a beautiful woman in the mid1960s \( what sort of man reads playboy \? the copy begins a guy who enjoys life thickly carpeted \) ramos enjoyed life , all right , through six marriages , fortunes and bankruptcies , and , after he turned 70 , a pile of world records for weight lifting but long before any of that was a photo in the 1952 yearbook of north phoenix high in which he is winning a dance contest with his girlfriend , barbara thomason , later known as carolyn mitchell , an actress who had a role in jack nicholson s first movie \( 1958 s the cry baby killer \) , became mickey rooney s fifth wife and was murdered in 1966 a former dance instructor , ramos spent 20 years working for arthur murray dance studios , eventually managing studios across the northeast if i could do anything in the world , i would give away all my weightlifting medals if i could be on dancing with the stars , ' ramos said i 've always just wanted to dance he befriended another arthur murray instructor , sidney craig , who later started a weightloss company named for his wife , jenny the craigs became neighbors in the san diego area as ramos started a chain of women s health clubs before going bankrupt that led ramos to open five world gym locations explaining the photograph taken with arnold schwarzenegger after he moved to colorado springs in 1993 to be closer to the united states olympic center so he could pursue his latest infatuation , weight lifting ah , yes weight lifting with ramos , it is easy to become sidetracked in the onebedroom condominium that he shares with his 12yearold dog , avi , ramos unlocked a drawer to reveal a trove of weightlifting medals won over the last two decades weight lifting was merely a retirement hobby ramos is about 5 feet 9 inches and 185 pounds , his muscles partly disguised under a tshirt and shorts i have to admit , i have an extraordinary body , ramos said not for an 80yearold but for a 30yearold he can run and jump \( he wants to set highjump records for his age but cannot figure out where to practice \) his face barely sags his hair , in the mold of joe biden s , is thin , white and combed straight back he has no hearing aid and , thanks to eye surgery , no glasses his resonant voice could do voiceovers his mind is quick he drives fast he covets younger women his last serious girlfriend , when he was 66 , was 33 spend a day with him , and you could be convinced if someone said he was 58 but all that , and all those stories , is overshadowed by what happened in june in chicago , at the pan american masters weightlifting championships for his weight class , ramos nearly broke the 80andover record of about 133 pounds in the snatch , in which competitors lift the bar overhead from the floor in a single motion it might have been a surprise that he did not set a record ramos still holds world records for the snatch in three weight categories in the 7579 age group he snatched 172 pounds in 2008 but in the clean and jerk , in which the bar is raised first to the shoulders and then overhead , ramos broke the record by lifting about 161 pounds ramos was immediately escorted to drug testing it is done at international events , sparingly , mostly to authenticate records and weed out the occasional steroid suspects organizers are often ambivalent about drug testing it legitimizes the event , but at some cost the director of the pan american event , corinne grotenhuis , paid 6 , 000 for usada s oversight , she said ramos was watched closely as he urinated into a container and sealed it he had been through the procedure many times and worried little about the results he accepted his medal and a grand master award , for the best weight lifter among the 200plus competitors there was no prize money there rarely is then ramos went home , alone , to his dog about a month later , he received a notice from usada he had failed the drug test an outofbalance ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone , a related hormone in the body , gave him away ramos s doctor ordered a blood test his testosterone level on july 29 was 1 , 121 nanograms per deciliter more than twice what it should have been ramos stopped the injections a month later , a followup blood test found his testosterone level to be extraordinarily low , signaling a range of potential problems , affecting anything from the prostate to the pituitary glands ramos said he never varied his doses and could not explain the spike , or the drop the average person thinks i'm buying drugs in an alley , ramos said the stigma of getting caught taking steroids most people say , besides testosterone , what steroids did you take \?

of all the numbers in college basketball , no 1 may be the most ubiquitous you can find it on jerseys and foam hands and after victories when index fingers are shot skyward you can hear it we 're no 1 chanted on most nights this year , though , no 1 is dangerous no 1 is slippery no 1 has rarely been more attainable or harder to hold in a season defined by wild swings and regular upsets , by mindboggling balance and farreaching parity and the game of musical chairs that unfolded in the rankings , there is tumult at the top below it , too one was not the loneliest number not this season instead , it seemed like the most cursed indiana opened the season ranked first in the associated press top 25 then was no 1 then louisville then duke then michigan then indiana then gonzaga that s right , gonzaga , the small jesuit university from the west coast conference , perhaps the most unlikely no 1 in the recent history of college basketball except , perhaps , in this season , when it made perfect sense that the madness came early this year , well before march , should make for an excellent ncaa tournament , an event already among the most unpredictable in sports it s not just the no 1 ranking that switched teams like a dollar bill changing hands , moving from business to wallet to business , state to state the top of the rankings proved predictable only in its unpredictability , like a game of chutes and ladders for the college hoops set of the teams that started the season in the ap s top five indiana , louisville , kentucky , ohio state and michigan , in that order only indiana \( 3 \) and louisville \( 4 \) finished the regular season there fourteen teams made at least one appearance in the top five but none for each week of the season georgetown , which fell out of the poll at one point , ascended to fifth kentucky , the defending national champion , dropped out entirely and did not hear its name called when the ncaa tournament field of 68 was announced sunday night this trend reverberated across the country , in places like spokane , wash \( home of gonzaga \) albuquerque \( home of new mexico \) memphis \( home of the tigers \) st louis \( home of the billikens \) and elsewhere , too after st louis seized the atlantic 10 regularseason title , the billikens turned their attention to the postseason they could talk all they wanted about one game at a time , but even then , they could not ignore the larger subtext namely , that a university from a nonpower conference that is experienced \( like the billikens \) , deep \( like the billikens \) and tested \( like the billikens \) could go all butlerstyle and make a deep run in the ncaa tournament several teams could in a tournament that lacks an obvious favorite we talk about it all the time , st louis forward cody ellis said at the end of the year , when it s all said and done , people are going to be scratching their heads , saying , really , they 're the national champion \? ' that s what it feels like the way this season unfolded is a natural extension of the way college basketball is trending at programs like gonzaga and butler , with their private planes and milliondollar salaries for head coaches , midmajor is no longer an accurate description butler , after all , made consecutive appearances in the ncaa championship game in 2010 and 2011 meanwhile , at programs like kentucky and duke , the best players often jump early to the nba where traditional powers like ucla once stockpiled enough stars to fill two teams worthy of the postseason , the talent is now spread , while not evenly , more evenly and has been for a while now combine those trends more resources for smaller universities , limited longevity for elite players at larger ones and parity , what makes the ncaa tournament electric in the first place , has become even more prevalent one could argue that no team held on to the top slot this season because no team truly deserved it , because there is not one best team in the land or even five for a time , it seemed the most likely candidate for that honor would be indiana but the hoosiers lost three times when ranked no 1 , including once at unranked illinois in that game they squandered an 8point lead in the final three minutes , the kicker a defensive miscommunication on an inbounds play that led to the uncontested layup that sealed their defeat that play , bumbling as it was , defined a stretch in which the no 1 team lost for five straight weeks , which transformed the phrase one and done to no 1 and done jim crews , the interim coach at st louis , played at indiana under bob knight , the 197576 team that featured scott may and kent benson and quinn buckner , along with crews , entered the season ranked first over all the hoosiers won all 32 games they played , including the ncaa final , and finished the season no 1 , in stark contrast to the current hoosiers , who still managed to secure the top seed in the east but while crews acknowledged the differences in the current college basketball landscape , he also cited a different , more obvious reason that his indiana team went undefeated it was not because of any lack of parity in college basketball those hoosiers were , well , just that good , crews said really good , he added that was a fouryear team it was built for the long term it s different now mark few , the gonzaga coach , said in a recent interview at his office that he could not pick one team , or two teams , or four teams , that had separated from the field as the tournament approached his favorite was no favorite , the zags included it s always wild , but the tournament will probably be wilder in the second week this year , said few , whose team is the no 1 seed in the west it s probably something where seeding is n't going to matter that much , because the difference between a 1 seed and a 4 seed is n't that great michigan provided one example of the current landscape the wolverines entered the season with as much talent as any team in college basketball , albeit a young one as recently as late january , they assumed the no 1 ranking still , because it plays in the powerful big ten conference , michigan lost six regularseason games and fell to the fifth seed in its conference tournament , despite a national ranking of sixth the wolverines lost there to wisconsin , in the quarterfinals villanova , meanwhile , lost 13 games , but beat louisville , syracuse , marquette and georgetown top 20 teams , all wisconsin , loser of 11 games , followed its win over michigan in the conference tournament with a defeat of indiana michigan is capable of winning the ncaa tournament and capable of not surviving the first week , or the first game so is duke , which lost to maryland in the quarterfinals of its conference tournament villanova is capable of a run the same could be said of many teams , some from outside the major conferences regardless , one team in the tournament should be worried louisville the cardinals received the top seed over all and must break the curse that has accompanied it
speaking at a midnovember fundraiser at her dallas antiques and home furnishings store , lisa luby ryan , an eloquent republican activist , struggled to find the right word to introduce her guest of honor i so hesitate and cringe every time i use the word conservative' because its meaning had been watered down by moderates , she said turning to ken paxton , poised to make his pitch , and raise money , for his bid to be the state s next attorney general , ms ryan said , please do n't say you 're the most conservative tonight mr paxton , a state senator from mckinney , avoided that phrase , but mentioned his consistent framework of supporting fiscal and social conservatism but ms ryan s instruction underscored the difficult task facing him and his competitors in 2014 as they try to draw attention and drum up support in a crowded republican primary season full of candidates running to the right the national spotlight has already begun to shine on the governor s race , in which attorney general greg abbott , a republican , and state senator wendy davis , democrat of fort worth , are expected to battle in the november general election but with less than three months before early voting starts , the race to succeed mr abbott which also features state representative dan branch of dallas and barry smitherman , the chairman of the texas railroad commission has not caught the general public s eye there is not a natural shape to the attorney general s race , said calvin c jillson , a political science professor at southern methodist university you 've got several credible contenders , but none of them are already statewide names i do n't think that citizens , even republican primary voters , have yet begun to sort these guys out a university of texas texas tribune poll showed that about 74 percent of republican voters were undecided on the race and more than a third of participants in an recently conducted by young conservatives of texas indicated no preference other metrics are hardly more enlightening mr paxton has won six of six straw polls held throughout the state , which indicates grassroots support but does not necessarily translate to electoral victory neither does having more money in the bank at last count in july , mr branch s campaign , whose coffers include a donation from former president george w bush , had more than twice as much as his opponents at the outset of the race , mr smitherman , having recently run a successful statewide campaign , albeit a lowerprofile one , claimed an advantage in name identification among voters i do n't think anybody could call this race right now , said david jennings , who writes about conservative texas politics at and has watched the race closely all three republican candidates have pledged to continue the mission of mr abbott , who has sued the obama administration 30 times and , according to mr jillson , made the attorney general s job in texas , at least as it is visible to voters , the legal representative of the governor as he opposes federal overreach but beneath such similarities , the three candidates bring markedly different backgrounds and styles to the race for anyone looking for evidence of a rift between the establishment and wings of the , mr jennings said , it is sort of playing out in this particular race speaking last month to the downtown houston pachyderm club , a local republican organization , at a spaghetti warehouse , mr branch emphasized his three decades as a practicing lawyer and extolled endorsements from legal advisers to mr abbott and united states senator ted cruz people get that it s the chief lawyer in the state , mr branch said afterward of the office when you go hire a lawyer , most people want a good one that means someone who has done it a lot , who has practiced a lot under house speaker joe straus , whom he helped elect to power in 2009 , mr branch has served as the chairman of the house higher education committee , leading the effort to increase the number of toptier public universities in the state his campaign has also promoted his involvement in passing a bill establishing the right of public school students to observe a moment of silence i like to accomplish things , he said i can get stuff done i'm a conservative , but i like to make sure we get results we do n't just have rhetoric we actually move the ball but mr branch s connections to the leadership , derided as moderate by tea party activists , have also made him a target , despite his protests that he has been pushing limited government solutions for a long time , before it was vogue mr paxton , a fellow longtime lawmaker who has made a name for himself as an outsider , is a natural foil in 2011 , while still a house member , he excited grassroots groups with an unsuccessful bid to oust mr straus as speaker you do n't always have to be on the inside of whatever structure is in charge , mr paxton said in a recent interview leadership can be , sometimes , opposition to democrats or less conservative or more moderate republicans on the stump , both legislators indicated a willingness to continue litigating against the federal government a lot of people in this race , anyone running for office , will talk about fighting obama , mr smitherman , who has been involved in seven of the state s lawsuits against the federal administration , recently told a meeting of the clear lake area republicans i'm the only one actually fighting obama after a career as an investment banker , mr smitherman served as a prosecutor in the harris county district attorney s office before being appointed by gov rick perry to the public utility commission of texas in 2004 , and then to the railroad commission in 2011 he served as chairman of both , potentially giving him crossover appeal among establishment and tea party conservatives you need a proven conservative leader , mr smitherman told the roughly 30 people gathered in clear lake not someone who has been a parttime legislator , but someone who has led large important agencies so far , mr smitherman has generated the most media attention , largely for comments some have found jarring while he insisted that he does not advocate for secession , he has repeatedly said that texas should operate in a manner consistent with he also most aborted fetuses , had they been born , would be republican voters barring the entry of another contestant before the dec 9 filing deadline , the republican primary victor will face sam houston , a houston lawyer running unopposed in the democratic primary mr houston , who will be considered the underdog , said that after a cursory assessment of his potential opponents , he concluded , they are all the same
moscow president vladimir v putin exerted new control over russia s state news media on monday , dissolving by decree one of russia s official news agencies , ria novosti , along with its international radio broadcaster as he continues a drive to strengthen the kremlin s influence at home and abroad the decision shutters a decadesold staterun news agency widely viewed as offering professional and semiindependent coverage , while putting a reconstituted news service in the hands of a kremlin loyalist since returning for a third time as president last year , mr putin has taken several steps that critics have denounced as a strangulation of political rights and open debate , concentrating power in an ever tighter circle of allies the decree comes at a time when russia has become increasingly assertive on the world stage , most recently in the tug of war with the european union over political and economic relations with ukraine , a country with deep historical and cultural links that mr putin and others here believe bind it to russia , not the west the kremlin s intense lobbying and strongarming of ukraine s embattled president , viktor f yanukovich , have been a principal grievance of the hundreds of thousands in the last two weeks the reorganization of russia s state news media occurred only days after a meeting between the two leaders and unconfirmed rumors that they had reached a secret deal to forge a strategic partnership served to intensify the protests mr putin s presidential chief of staff , sergei b ivanov , said the decision to close the news service was part of an effort to reduce costs and make the state news media more efficient but ria novosti s report on its own demise said the changes appear to point toward a tightening of state control in the already heavily regulated media sector its executive editor , svetlana mironyuk , the first woman to lead the agency , appeared before her stunned colleagues and apologized for failing to preserve what she called the best news organization ever built by state money , according to a video recording of the meeting the two agencies will be absorbed into a new state media organization known as rossiya sevodnya , or russia today in a separate decree , mr putin appointed dmitry k kiselyov as executive director of the organization mr kiselyov , a television executive and host , is an avowed prokremlin figure who has provoked controversy with starkly homophobic remarks and virulent commentary suggesting foreign conspiracies are threatening russia the decrees caught the agencies' employees , its executives and even some government officials by surprise mr putin made the changes without prior notice or public debate , as is often the case here his decree said that the new agency would focus on providing news about russia to an international audience the agency s directors will be directly appointed by the president s office the reasons behind the timing were unclear and , to many , puzzling ria novosti is one of the official sponsors of the winter olympics to be held in the russian resort of sochi in february , and its employees have been deeply involved in organizing preparations for news coverage there there have been some calls for boycotting the games , citing russian policies , including a , that have prompted harsh criticism from rights organizations russia has its own independent politics and strongly defends its national interests , mr ivanov , a close ally of mr putin s , said in remarks to reporters , according to ria novosti it s difficult to explain this to the world , but we can do this and we must do this he suggested that russia had had some difficulties in successfully explaining its views abroad we must tell the truth , make it accessible to the most people possible , and use modern language and the best available technologies in doing so , he added ria novosti s roots extend to world war ii , when it was founded as the soviet information bureau two days after the nazi invasion of the soviet union according to the agency , it has correspondents in 45 countries and provides reports in russian and 13 other languages it was renamed after the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , and while it continued to serve as an official news agency , its reporting earned greater respect for its balance and diversity of viewpoints that troubled at least some here maxim l shevchenko , a prominent television personality , called the reorganization a sensible step in a post on twitter the nest of antirussian media forces has been destroyed , he wrote that an official news agency could be considered hostile to its own government reflected some deep divisions within russia s political elite the new agency s name , rossiya sevodnya , is the original name of the kremlin s international television network , now rebranded simply as rt and known for its jaundiced view of the united states and other western countries the decree , which takes effect immediately , did not link the two organizations aleksei a navalny , the anticorruption blogger and opposition leader , lamented the demise of a strong soviet brand in his own posting on twitter and said russia today , as a brand , was something repulsive andrei miroshnichenko , an independent media critic here , said ria novosti and the other state news agency , itartass , had in effect competed for resources and influence he said ria novosti had become the most respected news agency in the former soviet union , one he associated closely with the presidency of dmitri a medvedev , who has served as prime minister since mr putin returned to the presidency last year in that way , dismantling the news service is another step by mr putin to erase any legacy of mr medvedev s presidency , and his modernization initiative the new agency , mr miroshnichenko said , would now revert to its mission before the dawn of the postsoviet era as an arm of foreign propaganda , while itartass would focus on domestic news the most pointed criticism of mr putin s decrees focused on the choice of mr kiselyov as the new agency s director he is known for sharp commentaries in defense of mr putin s russia that often reflect his belief that there are foreign conspiracies aimed at weakening the nation he has described the current protests in ukraine as a provocation by a coalition of sweden , poland and lithuania like the one that peter the great defeated in 1709 in the in what is modern ukraine this week the coalition has shown its full strength , mr kiselyov said on his weekly talk show , vesti nedeli , or news of the week , on the state television network , rossiya it looked like a thirst for revenge for poltava remarks he made last year resurfaced during the recent debate over the new prohibitions on propaganda of nontraditional sexual relationships i think it is too little to fine gays for homosexual propaganda , he said they should be forbidden from donating blood , sperm and in the case of an automobile accident , their hearts should be buried in the ground or burned there were calls for a criminal inquiry for his remarks , but none were undertaken mr kiselyov denied that he or the remarks he made were homophobic his views on journalism , he acknowledged in a recent interview with the online news organization lentaru , had evolved significantly , particularly after he worked in ukraine during the previous political protests there that became known as the orange revolution i understood that objective journalism , distilled , is absolutely not in demand , he said in the interview the basic difference between postsoviet and western journalism is that for us it is necessary to create values and not to renew them , to produce values and not to reproduce them , as is basically done in the west
washington ronald reagan and bill clinton are now neighbors , more or less on wednesday , mr clinton and various officials past and present gathered for the renaming of the environmental protection agency headquarters in the former president s honor , the william jefferson clinton federal building the building , a 79yearold neoclassical landmark , is across a pedestrian mall from the ronald reagan building and international trade center , which is also neoclassical in style but the reagan building , finished in 1998 , lacks the heroicstyle murals , basrelief sculptures and other depressionera touches of the epa building its centerpiece is a sevenstory spiral staircase made of marble , surrounding a chandelier with lights at every floor the ceremony was something of a reunion , and a pep rally for gina mccarthy , whom president obama has nominated to lead the epa , but whose confirmation has been held up in the senate carol browner , who was mr clinton s epa administrator , pointed to several milestones during that era , including the first legal analysis to conclude that existing law gave the administration the ability to regulate carbon dioxide , an authority the obama administration is seeking to exercise the clinton administration also created an office within the epa to focus on children s health , vastly sped the cleanup of superfund sites and decreased soot and smog in the air mr clinton is also popular for having greatly expanded national parks and other protected areas and he raised the agency to the status of a cabinet department none of the advances were easy , ms browner said in a speech during your tenure , we faced an intransigent congress , a fierce , wellfunded and active opposition , she said glad to see so much has changed in washington when it was mr clinton s turn to speak , he first said he did not have his notes , then said that was ok because as a former president , you can say whatever the heck you want then he said he had found his notes but that , as a former president , if you can t read your own handwriting , you re really in trouble he spoke animatedly for more than 20 minutes , mostly without looking at his notes among the points he made , you can have a growing economy with more jobs and rising incomes , and a sustainable environmental policy you can protect our precious natural resources , and you can promote the public health , and you can fight climate change , he said in fact , from now on that s going to be the only way to have a sustainable economy besides , he said , the old economic model is not too hot anywhere the building , at 1200 pennsylvania avenue , was completed in 1934 and was occupied by the post office until that became the postal service in 1971 in 1985 it was named for ariel rios , an undercover agent at the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms who was killed in the line of duty in 1982 congress voted last december to rename the building in honor of mr clinton the change technically took effect in may senator barbara boxer of california , the senate sponsor of the bill that renamed the building , said , this is a very strong building , and bill clinton was a very strong president in the midst of a traditional washington summer temperatures in the 90s and a heat index over 100 degrees the dedication ceremony was held in a conference room named for rachel carson , an early marine biologist and environmental pioneer a choir , with middle school , high school and college students , performed a jazz gospel rendition of america the beautiful outside , the air was code orange , unhealthy for sensitive groups

the university of pennsylvania recently withdrew an invitation to gujarat s chief minister , narendra modi , who was to deliver a keynote address at the wharton school s india economic forum via video link later this month the withdrawal , based on questions raised about mr modi s human rights record , has spurred an animated debate about freedom of speech and mr modi s leadership credentials in india and among the indian diaspora on march 6 , india ink carried an with ania loomba , a professor of english at the university of pennsylvania , who helped mobilize opposition to mr modi s speech in a petition to the university , ms loomba and other professors accused mr modi of not doing enough to prevent communal riots in gujarat in 2002 that resulted in the deaths of more than 1 , 000 people , most of whom were muslim , allegations mr modi has repeatedly denied we were concerned that this conference would help contribute to his efforts to sanitize his government s record , ms loomba said but opinions among the university s faculty on the situation are far from unanimous india ink contacted aseem r shukla , an associate professor of surgery at the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania and a cofounder of the , an advocacy group , for another point of view in an email interview , mr shukla explained why he thinks the university made a mistake why do you think upenn was wrong to rescind narendra modi s invitation to speak at the wharton forum \? the rescinding of mr modi s invitation just weeks before he was scheduled to address the forum went against the most fundamental tenets of freedom of thought , speech and inquiry that the university of pennsylvania categorically upholds as published policy indeed , this university was lauded recently as among the top seven institutions in america for respecting free expression on campus in capitulating to the petition that a few of my penn colleagues initiated , this vaunted ideal of free speech was reduced to a platitude penn invited international opprobrium and the university insulted legions of indians and indianamericans who , while not necessarily supporting mr modi as a politician , have confidence in india s democracy and judiciary students and faculty of indian origin are justifiably aggrieved that their invite list encountered asymmetric scrutiny and rejection in the face of perceived controversy penn s tradition of free speech was celebrated when extreme antiisrael speakers , louis farrakhan of the nation of islam and radical occupy wall street protesters held sway on campus but free speech became an empty homily when it came to the speaker selection of a group of indianamerican business school students why do you think the university made such a decision if it would stir controversy and could potentially cause the university embarrassment \? i am not privy to the internal discussions at wharton , nor the university administration to me , my university manifestly misfired in the disinvitation on varied fronts a \) it inserted penn into the indian political square by its insult of mr modi the most popular political leader in india by most opinion polls b \) it erroneously regarded the antimodi petition as a collective representation of penn s diverse faculty and c \) it woefully underestimated that indians and indianamericans across the globe are finding their voice , exercising the shared american and indian ideal of mobilizing mass protests and articulating indignation why do you think he was invited to speak in the first place \? in any forum where business and india intersect , one may rightly presume that the politician feted by the united states business council , prominent economists and every major industrial leader in india as the paradigmatic leader for economic development and corruptionfree governance in contemporary politics would be included on a panel as a likely prime ministerial candidate , dialogue should be fostered with mr modi , rather than eschewed mr modi represents the largest opposition political party in india from the centerright wharton students had invited leaders of the centerleft ruling political party as well the panel was balanced and diverse ideologies were set to be heard this balance is now lost , and the forum will suffer loss of credibility and prestige as a result the professors whose petition prompted the revoking of mr modi s invitation argued that inviting him as a keynote speaker amounted to an endorsement of his leadership do you agree \? does the university endorse mr farrakhan because he spoke on our campus \? or house majority leader eric cantor , who was invited by wharton to address the community \? is penn antiisrael because palestinian activists calling for an electronic intifada and cessation of all relations with israel had their say here \? i have tremendous respect for the intellectual capacity and discretion of students at penn we as faculty must advocate that our university never compromise on its mission to foster the free exchange of ideas and teach students to make informed decisions after diligently gathering facts faculty is empowered to join this dialogue and air opposition to speakers as the faculty petitioners did , but faculty must not insinuate troubles and intimidate with avowals to protest portentously , in a variety of ways , as those petitioners also did to you , what does narendra modi stand for \? as a highprofile , polarizing national leader , mr modi means many things to many people he has legions of detractors and spirited supporters i am free to love him or hate him , but none of that should have any bearing on whether my students are entitled to hear directly from him and render their own judgments what would you say to the united states , which continues to deny mr modi a visa \? when the supreme court of india s special investigative team exonerated mr modi of all accusations that he did not do enough to stop the horrible riots that gripped gujarat in 2002 , the united kingdom and european union ended its boycott of mr modi several us legislators are entering statements into the congressional record that the modi visa denial should be revisited in light of the supreme court report , because the visa denial repudiates the freely democratic election of 60 million gujaratis in india , and because the visa denial could endanger the burgeoning potential for american economic investment in that state what would you say to mr modi s critics who ask , in the context of the 2002 riots if human rights can be divorced from development \? human rights and development must not be mutually exclusive indeed , as columbia university s economist jagadish bhagwati recently wrote , mr modi s gujarat model of economic growth is generating revenue that is being utilized for profound improvements in the social sector , health , and education when a democratic society such as india develops economically , a societal imperative to address human rights concerns begins to gain primacy gujarat is often considered the most developed state in india , and social indicators show concurrent improvement this week s indian government report states that malnutrition under mr modi s gujarat had the largest decline in the nation the 2002 riots were a national tragedy , but part of a tragically recurrent phenomenon in communallycharged gujarat state that preceded mr modi s government dozens , including leaders of many political parties , have been found guilty and sentenced for instigating and carrying out attacks during those riots mr modi denies culpability and gujarat s and india s supreme court , thus far , bear him out if courts find otherwise , he must face the full fury of the law , just as mr modi often states how would you react to critics who say support for mr modi and his governance stems from a deliberate and orchestrated public relations campaign \? my answers above are predicated on empirical facts in your opinion , can a polarizing figure like mr modi lead a large and diverse country like india politics are inherently polarizing , depending on one s perspective in the united states , just less than half of all americans would say that president barack obama is a polarizing figure unfit to lead this country the inability of congress to find middle ground elicits fair questions about electoral dysfunction but that is the nature of democracy that we embrace as a fair compromise for liberty and freedom to choose our leaders , and sometimes , to hear from them even when we detest what they may have to say this interview has been lightly edited

2012 now he is among at least nine republicans , a mix of former incumbents and previous challengers , who are running again but with a difference this time they have shelved their incendiary remarks about president obama and the in favor of a narrower focus on the affordable care act , which they hope will attract moderate voters from both parties , even in heavily democratic districts , who are disenchanted with its rollout the campaigns , if successful , could be an indication of change in some corners of the as many former firebrands mellow their messages and people like mr dold , who benefited from the tea party but was one of the more moderate members of the house , try to capitalize on the center at the very least , their campaigns show that some people who ran vociferously against washington appear eager to get back there they figure their odds of winning next year are much better in a nonpresidential election without mr obama at the top of the democratic ticket bobby schilling , the owner of st giuseppe s heavenly pizza in moline , ill , and a republican former representative from a district rich with democrats , is among those trying to make his way back east he said that beyond the tea party faithful who will vote in the next election , this time is going to be different , because the middleclass folks who are being affected by obamacare are going to come out , lots of both republicans and democrats good luck with that , say the democrats who disposed of four oneterm house republicans in the last election and fended off five other opponents , only to see them slide back into view a year later the 16day government shutdown this year , in which none of the current republican candidates played a role , was made possible by the tea party takeover of 2010 , democrats say , an argument they plan to make nonstop on the campaign trail my opponent has a voting record that is very much in line with tea party thinking , said representative cheri bustos , who defeated mr schilling last year as for the republicans , their focus on the has shifted from talk of a repeal to criticism over its rollout the health care law is going to be enormous in this race , said nan hayworth , a former representative who is trying to make a comeback in upstate new york but this is about people s lives and the system not working it is not a partisan issue the candidates' approach differs from that of republican incumbents , who hope to fend off challengers in the primary by focusing on undoing the law and on investigating the role the administration had in its flaws the regular republican repeal language would not be an asset to former members trying to come back in competitive districts , said nathan gonzales , deputy editor of the nonpartisan  whether the health care law or the shutdown will help candidates remains to be seen while most voters blame republicans more than democrats for the shutdown , the scorn for all of congress is historic in its depth the health care law , while under fire , remains popular among democratic voters , whom most of the returning candidates need in order to win and even among the opponents of the law , there is a sense that dysfunctional politics underlie its problems to me , the blame game is played by the whole congress , said curt snyder , a vice president of numerical precision , a component manufacturer in wheeling , ill mr dold s opponent , representative brad schneider , visited there recently to discuss the shutdown , which temporarily hobbled the company at least he is taking the initiative to stop by and say we ca n't let this happen again mr dold and other republicans trying to mount comebacks are careful to distance themselves from the shutdown and the attempt by house republicans to defund the health care program that presaged it the shutdown was a stupid tactic , and i spoke out against it , ms hayworth said mr dold took it one step further the shutdown certainly highlighted the dysfunction in washington , he said i think that s an opportunity for me to tell people that this is why you want moderates like me ms hayworth , who during her 2010 campaign aligned with the ultraconservative group tristate sons of liberty \( she said at one of its meetings \) , now brags about other affiliations i was a cofounder of the common ground caucus , she said , referring to a group formed in the previous congress to promote bipartisanship the republicans who lost in 2012 say it will be harder to tie them to the tea party because they have seen this play before and can counter it , with more name recognition in 2012 , i was being attacked right out of their national playbook , said martha mcsally of arizona , who is challenging representative ron barber , a democrat he had won the seat held by gabrielle giffords and narrowly defeated ms mcsally in 2012 they did all the typical attacks , martha is part of the war on women , ' and all that , she said i am now a known entity we have had a year to build on the momentum of the last race , and now ron barber has to stand on his own record , and there is a sense in the community that people are frustrated with incumbents whether people are thinking about the health care law , the shutdown , mr obama or something else entirely is an unanswered question the national political environment will help frame these races , mr gonzales said one of the biggest unknowns right now is what the political environment is going to be like next summer , and that s still an open question
nfl kickers last season attempted 1 , 016 field goals , each a quick , odd , almost artistic intermezzo to football s other acts of fury the field goal snap , hold and kick take about 12 seconds happens so swiftly and with such regularity , it is often treated as an afterthought , both omnipresent and overlooked but within those 12 seconds is a highly intricate threepart piece of performance art , a combination of quirky skills useless in any other walk of life yet essential to the prosperity of every nfl team like highwire trapeze artists , the fieldgoal snapper , holder and kicker must seamlessly mesh their specific and unrelated talents in rapid order and in a confined space , doing so with painstaking precision time after time their hurried threeact drama is performed under duress with 11 agitated , snarling opponents charging from yards away and a stadium full of fans sitting in judgment , ready to boo if the kick is anything less than perfect there is so much more going on than anyone sees , said steve weatherford , the giants' holder it s dozens of moving parts with nothing left to chance because every part has been analyzed , perfected and practiced thousands of times it happens so fast , but it usually happens so pure athletic art executed in the blink of an eye the giants' fieldgoal corps , synchronized but never physically connected , consists of zak deossie , a fifthyear snapper for field goals weatherford , an nfl holder in his eighth season who is also the punter and josh brown , a kicker in his 11th nfl season these specialists , in separate interviews , broke down the intensity of a ubiquitous but little understood football fundamental i'm always chasing the elusive perfect snap , deossie said last month , sitting beside the giants' practice complex there is no such thing as a perfect snap in my mind deossie , whose father , steve , was a linebacker and snapper for the giants in the 1990s , learned to heave a football upside down and between his legs as a youngster he has probably performed the peculiar maneuver at least 25 , 000 times in his backyard and at high school , college and professional practices and games perhaps 99 percent of those snaps have been serviceable enough to be caught by the holder and spotted for the kicker , but to deossie , none have ever been flawless when you watch thousands of them on videotape as i have , you see an inch here or an inch there that could be better , deossie , 29 , said maybe they could have been a little faster or the spiral tighter deossie , who was a public policy major at brown , understands the sisyphean quest but that s what keeps me fresh day after day , he said with a smile i'm never complacent it helps me deal with the idea of trying to be perfect , even if there is no perfect it keeps me trying the nearly perfect fieldgoal snap spins backward with the ball making two and a half revolutions from deossie s hands to the holder , who is kneeling 8 yards behind the snapper trial and error has taught deossie that two and a half revolutions assures that the ball will arrive at weatherford s hands with the laces facing the sky , which makes it easier for weatherford to catch it and immediately place it on the ground with the laces facing the goal post if the laces do not face the target , the kicked ball can curve unpredictably you can fire the ball faster , like a bullet , but it wo n't be two and onehalf revolutions , and the laces wo n't arrive in the right place , deossie said then again , if you shoot it back there too slowly , the laces wo n't arrive in the right spot , either it has to be the exact same tempo every time two and onehalf revolutions but snapping the ball accurately with the right pace is only part of the job he must also keep rushing linemen from blocking the kick it can be a little menacing when you 're thinking about your snap tempo and there s also a 350pounder in your face , said the 6foot4 , 249pound deossie , who was a linebacker in college but when i get to the ball , the guards on either side of me lock their big legs behind me they 're my support once i'm lined up , i turn over my shoulder and look at my kicker once he s begun his routine , i say out loud to everyone , here , we go' i always say the same thing i bend and i am looking at nothing but steve weatherford s left elbow , which is above the spot where the ball will be placed i do n't see anything else i do n't have much time i send the ball backward , and it s a loud , wild ride from there my job is like being a caddie in golf , weatherford said somebody else hits the ball , but i help them get ready to hit it and all kickers do it differently john carney , who i held for in new orleans , wore earplugs during games and would n't talk to anyone the next year , when i worked with martin gramatica , he would be talking nonstop like we were having beers at a bar nick folk with the jets used to yell , let s go ! ' when he wanted the ball snapped other kickers are quiet this year , josh just nods when he s ready weatherford was an allamerican decathlete at illinois , but he said a holder did not have to be a great athlete it might help you adjust to some extenuating situations like a bad snap , he said , but most of the time , it s more like shooting free throws anybody could do it you just need tons and tons of repetitions when weatherford leaves the sideline for a fieldgoal attempt , he looks for the ball , which is usually on a hash mark in line with the left or right upright on the goal post weatherford immediately counts 8 yards back eight white hash marks from the ball s position and locates the portion of the eighth hash mark closest to the middle of the field choosing that spot minimizes the degree the kicker has to angle the ball toward the center of the goal post and also gives the kicker a defined location where he can reasonably expect the ball to be placed josh comes out and puts his right toe down on that spot , and i place my left fingers there and keep them there , weatherford , 30 , said when he gives me the nod , i look back at zak and i lift my right hand in kind of a pointing motion that s our set' call there s this real quiet little pause , and then the ball is coming toward me about 15 percent of the time , the laces do not arrive pointing directly toward the sky if you think of the sky as noon on a clock , sometimes the laces are at 10 o'clock or 2 o'clock , weatherford said i turn them in the air before i put the ball down some guys will put the ball down and then spin the laces toward the target , but that can freak out a kicker i put it down static and let him get a clean look at it but weatherford must lift his left fingers off the ground to catch the ball with two hands how does he place the ball in the right spot , especially in the middle of the field , where there are no lines to use as markers \? weatherford , a holder for four pro bowl kickers , has a system once i get the spot , i move my left knee next to the spot , he said i catch the ball in front of me , and when i start to move the ball back , my left elbow will hit my left knee , which means i'm within two square inches of the spot that s a tactile reference point for me i know i'm in the vicinity i look down and put the ball there but his job is not done like golfers who like to hook or fade the ball from situation to situation , kickers often try to move the ball right to left or left to right that flight is aided by slightly tilting the ball after it is placed on the turf depending on the wind and the weather , the field conditions or the length of the fieldgoal attempt , the ball might be tilted a few degrees right or left or forward kicker and holder like golfer and caddie make that decision before the ball is in play but it is the holder s duty to carry out the plan just another thing to do in those 12 seconds , weatherford said , laughing being off by a quarterinch of lean can ruin everything but once i do that last part , all i have to do is make sure my finger on the tip of the ball does n't move three hours before every game , brown stands on the field and tries to find a point behind each goal post to aim his kicks it can be a bud light sign in the mezzanine or a large air vent behind the stands his system works well for home games because the background is familiar and welcoming but he often has a problem on the road , where the atmosphere changes during games most of the time , there is a massive jumbotron scoreboard behind the goal posts , brown , 34 , said and before a kick , they put all kinds of things on it to distract you like a giant picture of my face you look toward the goal posts , and suddenly you 're staring at a 75foot picture of yourself that s a pretty odd feeling home or away , the opposing players are doing what they can to sidetrack the kicker as well brown said there s always guys across the line who know you , and they start talking about your exgirlfriend , your exwife , your current wife , your kids just about anything they can think of to get you out of that moment you 're out there waiting to set up , and the whole time somebody is talking to you , somebody is yelling at you or insulting you or trying to get you to laugh it is mental toughness at its very best if you ca n't handle it , you do n't survive you disappear from the game brown is the most methodical of the fieldgoal specialists before the kick , he squares his shoulders and feet to align with the goal post , puts his right foot on the spot where the ball will be placed , and then takes three measured steps straight backward he waits for one second to take a deep breath and visualize the kick sailing to the center of the uprights , takes two small steps to his left and looks at the goal post one last time at that point , steve is usually staring at me from his crouch , said brown , who took 15 minutes to describe the chronology of a kick that lasts , at most , 15 seconds steve is usually saying something like , we 've got time , relax' but if the play clock is ticking down inside 10 seconds , he 'll tell me that i set myself , i nod that i'm ready and then i wait like a horse in a chute i have to wait because if i move too soon , it s a falsestart penalty , and that s a pretty embarrassing thing for a kicker brown does not move until weatherford s left hand leaves the ground he then takes two and a half steps toward the ball that start ca n't be a panic moment , brown said it ca n't be rushed , it must be rhythmic but it is a powerful , athletic move a kicker sprints toward the ball , gathering momentum , and as he plants one foot , his kicking leg lags behind , building torque and energy the way a golf club does late in a swing i see the ball for about a halfsecond before i kick it , brown said that may not seem like much , but if you take more time than that , the kick will be blocked and end up in your lap when foot meets ball , the thump can be heard throughout the stadium the roaring crowd tracks its flight i do n't look up until well after the ball is gone , brown said i can usually tell whether it s good or not good anyway in each of the giants' last two games , brown has missed one fieldgoal attempt you want to make every kick , but the likelihood of doing that is small , he said last week it s a very lonely feeling , but everyone has bad days at the office you ca n't dwell on it you make mistakes , and you learn to shove them wherever you have to shove them so they go away brown has made multiple gamewinning kicks and 29 field goals of 50 yards or longer , and he once converted 113 successive extra points there s always the next kick , brown said it s what we do for a living you go back out another 12 seconds to get it right of the nfl fieldgoal attempts last season , 852 , or 839 percent , sailed between the uprights and over the 10foot crossbar the mechanics of the fieldgoal operation are the same for pointaftertouchdown kicks last season , nfl teams attempted 1 , 235 pointafter kicks all but six were good , a 995 percent success rate when a kick is good , we all laugh and giggle afterward , deossie said all is right with the world weatherford said he and another kicker had sometimes gone to a sports bar after a game , unknown to the crowd watching another nfl game nobody recognizes us , he said at our size , we blend in on the television screen , a missed fieldgoal attempt will prompt groans from the bar patrons somebody will usually say come on , how hard can it be to make that kick \? it s not that complicated , ' weatherford said with a wide grin we do n't say anything everyone is entitled to their opinion but we kind of look at each other and smile
kitayamadai , japan it s been an odd start of the year for venezuelans in the three weeks since hugo ch vez flew to cuba for yet another cancer operation , we have been drawn into a sort of collective deathbed vigil , with a government spokesman intimating at a progressively deteriorating state and seeking to prepare the president s supporters for the inevitable even in japan , where i came a few months ago seeking cognitive refuge from the ch vez soap opera , i cannot extricate myself a trickle of rumors turned into a flood after dec 30 , when a somber venezuelan vice president announced that new complications had arisen following the president s latest surgery , prompting the lastminute cancellation of public new year s celebrations what complications wasn t specified , and the information void sent the caracas political rumor mill into overdrive the president is on life support , his kidneys are failing , he s in a medically induced coma , a 20inch portion of his small intestine has been removed none of this is sourced none of it can be confirmed no wonder twitter s number 1 trending topic in venezuela this week has been diganlaverdadsobrechavez tellusthetruthaboutchavez considering it s been over a year and a half since the comandante was first diagnosed with cancer and that his illness has become the central fact of venezuela s political life , it s remarkable how little we really know about it even now , no medical report on his condition has ever been published we ve never been told what kind of cancer he has , at what stage , with what prognosis we don t know what organ it originated in , what treatment protocols have been followed , or whether the bloating and fatigue ch vez has displayed over the last few months arise from the cancer or its treatment the contrast with other latin american leaders who ve fought the disease three of them close ch vez allies is startling when paraguay s president was diagnosed with lymphoma in the groin area in 2010 , both of those facts were disclosed in the initial reports of his illness , as were the outlines of his treatment protocol and prognosis when president cristina fern ndez de kirchner of argentina was diagnosed with breast cancer wrongly , it later turned out the details were made public at once and while she was running for president in brazil , dilma rousseff gave a full account of her battle with cancer of the lymph nodes and her subsequent recovery not ch vez he has even declined stateoftheart medical care at the s o paulo hospital that treated his brazilian and paraguayan counterparts in favor of the comparatively primitive care on offer in havana at the hospital of choice for the communist party elite treatment there may or may not have been up to scratch that s yet another detail that s been impossible to assess but at least care in the hemisphere s last totalitarian bastion does offer one perk total control over information flows about the patient the iron ring on reporting about the president s health has produced a bizarre situation with ch vez due to be sworn in for a third term on jan 10 , the exact timing of his passing matters in constitutional terms if he dies before that date , the chairman of the national assembly will succeed him pending fresh elections , but if he dies after that date , the vice president , who is more procuban than the assembly chairman , would take over the cubans , in other words , may have an incentive to delay any announcement about ch vez s condition for another week and given the impenetrability of cuban state secrecy , it s hard not to speculate that even if the president has already died , we would have no way of knowing it venezuelans now have a schr dinger president a leader suspended in quantum indeterminacy , simultaneously alive and dead well , they have that , as well as the uneasy feeling that somehow venezuela has managed to get itself colonized by its junior partner in the caribbean communist axis
bert lance , a smalltown georgia banker who became preeminent adviser and tennisplaying confidant to but was forced to resign after eight months as director of the office of management and budget because of accusations that he had personally traded on his ties with the president , died on thursday in georgia he was 82 his death was confirmed in a statement from mr carter , who called him one of the most competent and dedicated public servants i have ever known mr lance died at home near calhoun , ga , thursday evening , said the gordon county deputy coroner , heath derryberry the cause was not immediately known , mr derryberry said , but mr lance had been in failing health and was receiving hospice care cleared of wrongdoing in 1980 after a highly publicized 12week bank fraud trial in atlanta , mr lance resumed his business career in georgia , insisting that he held no animosity toward the government officials and journalists who had pursued him though friends said he longed for redemption , mr lance , who often prayed with mr carter , declared that bitterness breeds destruction mr lance s troubles during his brief washington tenure were a blow to the new administration , which took office in 1977 after campaigning as an antidote to the watergate era culminating in the resignation of president richard m nixon his departure meant the loss of an important bridge to the business community and a voice counseling restraint of the populist tendencies elsewhere in the administration later , mr lance was indicted and subsequently cleared in the financial scandal involving the shuttered bank of credit and commerce international , for which he served as a consultant after selling his controlling interest in the national bank of georgia to an arab business associate of the bcci president nor did he abandon political life he became chairman of the georgia democratic party in 1982 and chairman of the 1984 presidential campaign of walter f mondale after mr mondale was reportedly talked out of making him the vicepresidential nominee , turning instead to representative geraldine a ferraro in 1988 , mr lance served as a top adviser to his friend the rev jesse jackson , who sought the party s presidential nomination an affable 6foot5inch bear of a man with heavylidded dark eyes , mr lance , whom mr carter said was like a brother to him , was once described as a guy with the charm of an old songanddance man and the irrepressible guile of a safecracker he was also something of a phrase maker , widely associated with an expression that has persisted in american culture if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it at the budget office , mr lance , the first person chosen by the presidentelect for a cabinetlevel post , advocated a device called zerobased budgeting , in which each budget item has to be freshly justified each year before it is approved rather than subjected only to financial adjustment although mr lance succeeded in rolling back some spending proposals , the device failed to catch on and the goal of balancing the budget by the end of the carter presidency went unachieved thomas bertram lance was born june 3 , 1931 , in gainesville , ga his father , thomas jackson lance , was president of young harris college , a small methodist institution in northeast georgia young mr lance attended emory university and the university of georgia , but under financial pressure to support his wife , the former labelle david , whom he had married in 1950 at age 19 , and their newborn son , he dropped out shortly before he would have graduated he took a job as a 90amonth teller at the calhoun first national bank , which had been founded by his wife s grandfather he and some associates bought control of the bank in 1958 and five years later mr lance had risen to chief executive the bank , with acquisitions and easy financing that lured some carpet manufacturers to calhoun from nearby dalton , grew rapidly , and mr lance became acquainted with mr carter at a regional planning meeting after one unsuccessful run for governor , for which mr lance generated business support , mr carter was elected in 1970 and named mr lance director of the state s cronyridden and inefficient highway department mr lance set about reorganizing it , and within six years , the department had tripled the volume of contracts it let , with a staff that had shrunk by 26 percent when mr carter s term neared its constitutional end , mr lance failed in a bid to succeed him , finishing third in the primary race despite the benefit of bank loans that , while not illegal , had saddled him with the nickname loophole lance then , with two associates , mr lance acquired control of the national bank of georgia , where as president he applied his folksy touch by mingling with ordinary customers and appearing in bank commercials the bank thrived , but ultimately his millions of dollars' worth of shares in it contributed to his political undoing when the stock placed in a trust on his appointment in mr carter s administration tumbled mr lance persuaded the president to ask the senate committee that had confirmed him to extend the period during which mr lance had agreed to sell the stock close scrutiny soon led to other charges that while a bank stockholder he had lobbied against a congressional measure to require loan priority for local communities and allegations that he used his position to obtain a sweetheart loan from the first national bank of chicago by placing some of the georgia bank s money in an account paying no interest another issue was his use of a corporate plane to attend university of georgia football games mr lance denied the allegations and appeared to have survived grilling by the senate governmental affairs committee , which granted his plea for more time to sell his stock , and a detailed investigation by the comptroller of the currency , which concluded that he had done nothing illegal but after this apparent exoneration and a vote of confidence by mr carter he stated in a news conference that he was proud of his budget director critics seized on specific items that the comptroller considered unsound , like poorly secured loans to bank officers and their relatives the committee sought to investigate these and other charges , including mr carter s use of a bank plane years earlier and mr lance s role in preventing the justice department from investigating whether the calhoun bank had helped finance mr lance s 1974 campaign for governor once again mr lance appeared before the committee , accusing members of denying him due process and leading some to think he might survive but the political heat was overwhelming , and mr lance resigned and returned to georgia two years later , he was indicted on conspiracy charges and a dozen counts of banking irregularity in the bcci affair , none of which resulted in a conviction when the calhoun bank balked at paying some of his legal expenses , mr lance began and won a fierce proxy fight , installed two sons as directors and reemerged as an influential georgia banker in 1986 , the government removed him as the bank s chairman and director , permanently barred him from associating with any banking institution , and levied a 50 , 000 civil penalty as part of a settlement of charges of checkkiting and illegal use of calhoun bank funds in 1983 and 1984 the 1991 closing by regulators of the bank of credit and commerce international , reputed to have been involved in arms trafficking , money laundering , bribery and terrorism , produced more embarrassment for mr lance , this time over charges of accepting huge undocumented fees for consulting services mr lance , declaring he had had no contact with the bank for more than 10 years , said that at no time had he done anything improper for it in later years , he spent increasing amounts of time at his 500acre hilltop estate near calhoun called lancelot , where he cultivated his beloved rose garden and consulted for trucking and carpet companies and informally for democrats one side of his large home was built to resemble the white house , the other george washington s mount vernon survivors include his wife information on other survivors was not available thursday night despite his checkered career , mr lance retained the affection of many in 2000 , nearly 30 years after mr carter appointed him director of the state highway department and two decades after leaving washington in disgrace , mr lance drew a large crowd of dignitaries and other fellow georgians to the

changes in the balance of power in europe can take centuries , but when it comes to soccer , a revolution happened swiftly , in 180 minutes on the field for the second consecutive day , a german club not only defeated but also thoroughly outplayed a spanish one on tuesday , bayern munich perhaps ended barcelona s reign as the world s best team , with a 40 victory on wednesday , it was borussia dortmund behind a brilliant fourgoal performance by the polish striker robert lewandowski that  the victories came in firstleg matches of the semifinals of the uefa champions league , the top club competition in the world the return matches will be played next week in spain , but unless barcelona and real madrid , the two top teams in their domestic league , can conjure some magic , dortmund and munich are poised to play in the first allgerman continental final , in london s wembley stadium on may 25 there have been only three other singlenation finals real madridvalencia in 2000 , milanjuventus in 2003 , and manchester unitedchelsea in 2008 although the final is not yet set , the performance of the two german clubs is the culmination of a changing of the guard in europe that began with the 2006 world cup , which germany hosted , and that has continued with prudent financial management of the clubs the teams play before diverse crowds in modern allseater stadiums germany s youth development system is second to none in the world bayern munich has won four european titles \( 1974 , '75 , '76 and 2001 \) , and dortmund one \( 1997 \) real madrid still has hope of winning a record 10th , and barcelona is seeking its fifth but those hopes are quickly fading
if professional pride and strong defiance can save the neck of a soccer team manager , then tottenham hotspur might just have made its point against on sunday the game was cast as high noon at white hart lane the british news media and the bookmakers had concocted their usual seasonal head hunt of premier league managers and coaches in time for christmas one betting company , william hill , forecast that spurs manager andr villasboas would be gone by midnight on sunday it is a game of casual brutality the coaches are given survival odds similar to turkeys' at this time of year and bookmakers who complain about illegal betting and attempts to fix matches have their own league table of the doomed coaches before spurs held united to a tenacious and welldeserved 22 draw , the shortest odds in this very odd game held that villasboas , then fulham manager martin jol and norwich city s chris hughton were the men targeted by the public s bets fulham s new owner , shahid khan , did dismiss jol on sunday night , but others are holding their fire the team s response today was good , villasboas said on television moments after the final whistle i am extremely happy with the response of the players after the setback against manchester city , he said , referring to the 60 capitulation of his team in manchester the previous weekend there is obviously an agenda it s pretty clear , villasboas continued but the players showed strength of character , great team spirit , and with a not bad result against the premier league champion , they deserve respect yes , they do respect , and perhaps a period of patience and understanding from the tottenham board , which authorized the sale three months ago of the team s star , gareth bale , and spent 110 million pounds , or 180 million , on seven new players , all from other countries and none with any experience in the english league whether villasboas , or spurs' new technical director , the italian franco baldini , is principally responsible for choosing those imported players is not clear but it is villasboas who must integrate them into a team capable of at least finishing in the top four places in england , thus qualifying for the holy grail of the champions league so far , so uncertain before the collapse at city , spurs had looked solid but unexciting tottenham fans demand more their motto is glory , glory they expect soccer with a swagger they accept defeat provided it comes in an adventurous way villasboas is a careful student of coaching theory , and a cautious man in terms of setting up a team first and foremost to be hard to defeat his predecessor , harry redknapp , was the opposite , a swashbuckling coach , a man whose forte was instinct and who dared to risk everything on an attacking game enter manchester united to spurs' caldron on sunday led in the attack by wayne rooney , who scored his team s goals , one from the penalty spot , united arrived unbeaten in 11 matches , and with a 50 away victory over bayer leverkusen fresh in the memory tottenham went for united s jugular spurs took the lead after 18 minutes when paulinho , one of their brazilians , won a free kick just outside the penalty box kyle walker fired a fierce low shot straight at the defensive wall supposedly protecting the goalkeeper to a man , everyone in that line jumped , and the shot passed beneath them into the goal walker , though , was guilty of a hapless error in handing the initiative back to united a quarter of an hour later he allowed a swinging cross from phil jones to bounce off his shin , and rooney was in like a piranha to reach the ball ahead of sandro 6 yards out that was rooney s 163rd goal in the premier league , tying him with robbie fowler for fifth in league history but spurs wrested the initiative back early in the second half when sandro struck a shot from 20 yards that was beautiful in its violence the ball rose off his right foot , swerved in midair and curled inside the far top corner of the net at a pace such that no goalkeeper could have intercepted it now would tottenham consolidate its advantage \? could it hold on for its first victory over united in london since 2001 \? not even for five minutes spurs goalie hugo lloris , who sustained a concussion during a home game last month , made a rash error of judgment , diving to grab the leg of united s danny welbeck as he strode through a definite penalty kick , and one that rooney smacked with uncompromising force straight down the center of the goal that , for all the efforts of both sides and for all the intrigue , was the final swing of the pendulum the draw was just , and spurs' walker made a promise we 've bought a lot of players , good players , he said , adding it might take a bit of time , but i 've every faith in the players and the gaffer we 'll be up there at the finish , i guarantee it all bets are off , then

pleading guilty to sex abuse charges in a short story in the current new yorker , his protagonist is an older spanish woman who rejects a request to meet once more with an old lover who got her pregnant , one of franco s officers during the spanish civil war still , i ask the writer , how did this former altar boy from county wexford have the nerve to climb inside the head of the most revered woman in history \? it took a lot out of me emotionally , the 57yearold toibin conceded , calling from his apartment on riverside drive , where he stays when he is teaching english literature at columbia university in the testament of mary , a onewoman show with fiona shaw previewing later this month on broadway , toibin imagines his own version of how the virgin mary felt about crucifixion the most foul and frightening image that had ever been conjured up by men and whether she really had not known joseph in a biblical sense to borrow a phrase that nuns once applied to naughty children in my school , the play is a bold , brazen piece toibin wrote it first as a stage monologue , then turned it into a novel and has recast it again for broadway his illiterate but intelligent mary , with echoes of antigone and electra , is no idealized , asexual , docile madonna , tenderly cradling her son s bleeding body , piet style this mary runs away from the crucifixion to save herself \( the pain was his and not mine \) leaving others to watch jesus die , wash his body and bury him this mary misses sleeping with her husband this mary disdains the misfits who flocked around her son she resents his two disciples the men who come to oversee my final years as protectors or guards for pressuring her to help mythologize jesus as the son of god she notes wearily that one scowls at her when the story i tell him does not stretch to whatever limits he has ordained the men patiently explain to her what had happened to me at my son s conception and rewrite her story about fleeing the crucifixion to be more nurturing all my life when i have seen more than two men together i have seen foolishness and i have seen cruelty , she says of the disciples , but it is foolishness that i have noticed first she disdains their drive for power , which calls for hiding the truth to protect the institution they are building a story line that echoes this week as the male enclave in the vatican roils with old rituals , new scandals and the cascading shame of even more sulfurous sexual abuse revelations toibin , who describes himself as a lapsed catholic , said he was inspired when he went to venice and saw titian s radiant assumption of the virgin , and then up the road saw tintoretto s chaotic crucifixion painting the idea that we were somehow saved and redeemed by a crucifixion seems strange to me , he said the idea of human sacrifice is something we really have to think about , even people who are practicing catholics , the idea of taking a single individual for the sake of any cause he has written about visiting catholic shrines in europe and about his shame growing up gay in a church where homosexuality could not be mentioned he talks about how strange it is to see the church recede in ireland to the point that dubliners seem more obsessed with shopping than mass on sundays he was relieved when his play opened in dublin and church leaders there reacted calmly i wonder what he thinks of the pageantry in rome he is dubious about the showy helicopter exit of benedict to nearby castel gandolfo there s absolutely no reason why he could n't have gone by car the roads in italy are really good but he expresses admiration for the easy affection between the 85yearold former holy father and his 56yearold private secretary , msgr georg g nswein , whom toibin has described as remarkably handsome , a cross between george clooney and hugh grant , but in a way more beautiful than either benedict may have given up his flashy red loafers , downgrading to brown ones made for him in mexico , but he is taking gorgeous georg , as the younger german is known , to live in his new home , a monastery in the vatican some cardinals are worried about the arrangement of having g nswein serve two pontiffs , by day as prefect of the new pope s household and at night as secretary to the emeritus pope an 85yearold man having such a beautiful companion with him morning and night to talk to and walk with , toibin said it s like the end of a novel it s what all of us want for ourselves , straight or gay it s better than sex i ask him whether he thinks the church will evolve under a new pope everyone is hoping for some change , he said if you could see nuns making sermons clerical celibacy has to be abolished and soon and we must quickly begin the process of allowing women into the priesthood they need to think very carefully about not recognizing that gay people , like all other people , are made in god s image it s just possible that they have more gay priests than they know i think most gay priests are very good people in the priesthood for very good reasons , and actually faithful to the vows of celibacy on the issue of gays , benedict made things even worse as cardinal ratzinger , benedict called homosexuality a more or less strong tendency ordered towards an intrinsic moral evil as pope , he reiterated the church view that homosexuals were objectively disordered and that men who had such tendencies could not be allowed into seminaries he called gay marriage a threat to the future of humanity itself toibin says that the church must have tolerance , and that its leaders have lost any sense of how their sanctimonious denunciations clash with their scandals and imagery , causing nothing but pain i remember being at the vatican at easter 1994 , he recalled , and watching all the cardinals and bishops , wonderfully powerful old men with great chins , sitting nobly with a long row of extraordinarily beautiful young seminarians standing behind , shading them with different colored sun umbrellas , some of which were pink it was remarkable that none of them seemed to know what it looked like , and i watched it thinking , somebody must tell them

for the longtime seasonticket holders phil and joan boening and their two sons , justin and james , tensions were agonizingly high thursday evening their beloved blueshirts , down by three games to none to the boston bruins in the eastern conference semifinals , needed to stave off elimination game 4 was scheduled to begin at 7 pm james boening s wedding ceremony was scheduled to begin at 6 and so for a few hours , the new leaf restaurant at fort tryon park in manhattan became part wedding hall , part sports bar , with 64 guests waving rangers rally towels as party favors , and the groom sporting a henrik lundqvist jersey over his suit it was a great wedding , only capped off by the , joan boening said the party literally took off after that until the overtime goal by chris kreider , things were a bit nerveracking there were no televisions at the bar at new leaf , so the game was streamed through a computer , and then connected to a television monitor , which went fuzzy at times because of the foul weather the weather and corresponding traffic delays got the ceremony off to a late start the bride , amanda ely , 25 , did not arrive until nearly 7 , minutes before game 4 was to begin james said we have to move fast , joan boening said it was very short and sweet and beautiful the boenings have held season tickets since 2003 james boening , 26 , and his older brother , justin , played hockey as youngsters in the sky rink program at chelsea piers ely , too , became an avid rangers fan not long after dating james james had not missed a home rangers game for more than three years until thursday he said if i have to miss one , i 'll have to miss one , joan boening said we all heard him say it , so he could n't back out the family made the most out of the conflict of interests joan boening arranged with the rangers to order more than 60 rally towels and found rangers wristbands at a party store the bride and groom brought along their lucky jerseys friends and family from afar were instructed to textmessage score updates , in case the wedding party stepped away from the television for , say , cake but once kreider scored to give the rangers a 43 victory , all the fussing and fretting fell away , and a memorable night finished on a happy note the whole place erupted everybody was screaming and highfiving , waving our towels and hugging , joan boening said it was really pretty awesome and then we started dancing like crazy
much of the media commentary on was cynical you know the drill it s yet another reboot that will go nowhere none of it will have any effect on policy , and so on but before we talk about the speech s possible political impact or lack thereof , should n't we look at the substance \? was what the president said true \? was it new \? if the answer to these questions is yes and it is then what he said deserves a serious hearing and once you realize that , you also realize that the speech may matter a lot more than the cynics imagine first , about those truths mr obama laid out a disturbing and , unfortunately , all too accurate vision of an america losing touch with its own ideals , an erstwhile land of opportunity becoming a classridden society not only do we have an evergrowing gap between a wealthy minority and the rest of the nation we also , he declared , have declining mobility , as it becomes harder and harder for the poor and even the middle class to move up the economic ladder and he linked rising inequality with falling mobility , asserting that horatio alger stories are becoming rare precisely because the rich and the rest are now so far apart this is n't entirely new terrain for mr obama what struck me about this speech , however , was what he had to say about the sources of rising inequality much of our political and pundit class remains devoted to the notion that rising inequality , to the extent that it s an issue at all , is all about workers lacking the right skills and education but the president now seems to accept progressive arguments that education is at best one of a number of concerns , that america s growing class inequality largely reflects political choices , like the failure to raise the minimum wage along with inflation and productivity and because the president was willing to assign much of the blame for rising inequality to bad policy , he was also more forthcoming than in the past about ways to change the nation s trajectory , including a rise in the minimum wage , restoring labor s bargaining power , and strengthening , not weakening , the safety net and there was this when it comes to our budget , we should not be stuck in a stale debate from two years ago or three years ago a relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity is a bigger threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit finally ! our political class has spent years obsessed with a fake problem worrying about debt and deficits that never posed any threat to the nation s future while showing no interest in unemployment and stagnating wages mr obama , i'm sorry to say , bought into that diversion now , however , he s moving on still , does any of this matter \? the conventional pundit wisdom of the moment is that mr obama s presidency has run aground , even that he has become irrelevant but this is silly in fact , it s silly in at least three ways first , much of the current conventional wisdom involves extrapolating from obamacare s shambolic start , and assuming that things will be like that for the next three years they wo n't healthcaregov is working much better , people are signing up in growing numbers , and the whole mess is already receding in the rearview mirror second , mr obama is n't running for reelection at this point , he needs to be measured not by his poll numbers but by his achievements , and his health reform , which represents a major strengthening of america s social safety net , is a huge achievement he 'll be considered one of our most important presidents as long as he can defend that achievement and fend off attempts to tear down other parts of the safety net , like food stamps and by making a powerful , cogent case that we need a stronger safety net to preserve opportunity in an age of soaring inequality , he s setting himself up for exactly such a defense finally , ideas matter , even if they ca n't be turned into legislation overnight the wrong turn we 've taken in economic policy our obsession with debt and entitlements , when we should have been focused on jobs and opportunity was , of course , driven in part by the power of wealthy vested interests but it was n't just raw power the fiscal scolds also benefited from a sort of ideological monopoly for several years you just were n't considered serious in washington unless you worshipped at the altar of simpson and bowles now , however , we have the president of the united states breaking ranks , finally sounding like the progressive many of his supporters thought they were backing in 2008 this is going to change the discourse and , eventually , i believe , actual policy so do n't believe the cynics this was an important speech by a president who can still make a very big difference

john pelham , a young west pointtrained artillery officer in the confederate army , was buried in jacksonville , ala , on march 31 , 1863 pelham , who had been killed two weeks earlier at the battle of kelly s ford , a relatively minor engagement in virginia , had been promising and widely respected none less than robert e lee had remarked , after observing pelham s skills at the battle of fredericksburg , where he used two small cannons to disrupt the entire federal formation for almost an hour , it is glorious to see such courage in one so young the hagiography began almost immediately according to the richmond sentinel , pelham s body was placed in a metal coffin and lay in state at the capitol the mourning public poured in to see the man people quickly came to call the gallant pelham some tender hand reportedly that of susan holt letcher , wife of gov john letcher of virginia deposited an evergreen wreath , intertwined with white flowers , upon the case which contained all that was mortal of the fallen hero maj gen jeb stuart wrote the noble , the chivalric , the gallant pelham is no more how much he was beloved , appreciated and admired , let the tears of agony we have shed , and the gloom of mourning throughout my command bear witness his loss to the country is irreparable stuart later wrote pelham s father that pelham was like a younger brother to him , a hero so noble so chivalrous so pure so beloved the honors continued after pelham s body returned to alabama a lavish funeral , planned by the city leaders , was held at the first baptist church , after which a procession followed the funeral the few blocks south to the city cemetery nor was he then forgotten in 1873 a monument was placed over his grave , and in 1905 the daughters of the confederacy erected a marble statue on the site , which still stands today pelham was far from the only promising young officer to die in the war but the outpouring of collective and official grief over his death , which only seemed to grow louder in subsequent years , underlines how thoroughly pelham s memory became a part of the lost cause narrative born in 1838 , pelham grew up in northeast alabama , in and around jacksonville and alexandria his father , dr atkinson pelham , was an alabama planter with several hundred acres who owned four slaves at john s birth at the time of the emancipation proclamation , dr pelham owned 25 or 30 when john pelham died , stuart noted , he had a trunk , a sabre , two servants , and 2 horses the pelhams were cosmopolitan atkinson had trained in philadelphia his brother peter , who came with him , met his wife , martha there peter died in 1826 , but his widow and daughter stayed in touch with atkinson pelham and his family , even after he had settled in alabama interestingly , both women later became renowned abolitionists and women s rights advocates john pelham enrolled at west point in the fall of 1856 as a member of the only fiveyear class in the history of the academy when his home state voted to secede in january 1861 , though , he faced a crisis resign and return to alabama to enlist in the southern army , or stay at west point and graduate in the months prior to graduation , john wrote letters about his dilemma , including several to his abolitionist relatives in philadelphia john wrote to his mother in december 1860 , expressing his intention to return home i regret the circumstances which make it necessary , but i don t see any remedy alabama seems determined to leave the union before the middle of january , and i think it would be dishonorable in me to withhold my services when they will be needed it seems pretty hard that i should toil for four and a half years for a diploma and then have to leave without it in february 1861 , pelham wrote to jefferson davis offering his services to the new government pelham asked davis , a west point graduate , for his opinion as to whether pelham should resign immediately or wait until after graduation in june he did not receive a response in a letter to his first cousin , marianna , in march 1861 , pelham noted that it was strange that he was still at west point and , although he was very anxious to graduate , he did not know how much longer he would be able to stay i am not master of my own acts at present i have been appointed a 1st lieutenant in the army of the confederate states of america my appointment has been confirmed by the congress the appointment was made without my consent or knowledge i cannot accept an appointment from them as long as i am a member of this institution , but if i am recalled by the authorities , i will obey it i have thus far resisted every overture , on the part of my friends , to resign , disregarded their advice and braved their anger my father and brothers alone wished me to graduate although pelham decided to remain at west point until graduation , secretary of war simon cameron forced his hand after the shelling on fort sumter on april 12 , 1861 the next day , stanton directed that all west point cadets reaffirm their oath of allegiance to the united states of america pelham refused so did his texan friend thomas rosser the pair resigned their commissions , left west point and headed south together a wellliked cadet at west point , john pelham was liked and respected by his soldiers and superiors during the war pelham was a keen observer of war and warfare , as illustrated by his account of the first battle of bull run i have seen what romancers call glorious war i have seen it in all its phases i have heard the booming of cannon , and the more deadly rattle of musketry at a distance i have heard it all nearby and have been under its destructive showers i have seen men and horses fall thick and fast around me i have seen our own men bloody and frightened flying before the enemy i have seen them bravely charge the enemy s lines and heard the shout of triumph as they carried the position i have heard the agonizing shrieks of the wounded and dying i have passed over the battle field and seen the mangled forms of men and horses in frightful abundance men without heads , without arms , and others without legs all this i have witnessed and more , till my heart sickens and war is not glorious as novelists would have us believe it is only when we are in the heat and flush of battle that it is fascinating and interesting it is only then that we enjoy it such selfawareness and sorrow are hardly what one might expect from the flower of southern militarism and indeed , pelham concluded that all this loss was , in the end , worth it i see the horrors of war , but it is necessary we are battling for our rights and our homes ours is a just war , a holy cause the invader must meet the fate he deserves and we must meet him as becomes us , as becomes men pelham s brother charles fought in the war as well , and survived though during the conflict he wrote letters to his northern cousin dripping with racial animosity , after the war he began to describe himself as a reconstructed reb in a letter to his cousin he wrote now that the government is safe and slavery abolished it would seem that one could read of the courage and daring of a relative john pelham though engaged in a cause that did not meet ones approval some day the world will recognize the difference between men who precipitate a rebellion and those who go with their state indeed , charles pelham didn t have to wait long almost as soon as he died , his brother became a founding figure in the cult of the lost cause , the belief that the south fought , and its men died valiantly , to protect their freedom from a rapacious north journalists at the time and historians long after wrote paeans to his character and bravery , as a way of elevating the hundreds of thousands of men who fought for the losing side in the war in the postwar magazine southern bivouac , an anonymous poet wrote still is the heart that beat for his land , hushed is the voice , and cold is the hand never to ride with the ringing brigade never to lead with the glittering blade never to charge with the red cross again weep , light artillery ! pelham is slain pelham was a perfect candidate to pick up the lost cause banner young , handsome , brilliant and widely respected , he was also a man who embodied historian carl degler s notion of twoness , the white southerner s split identity between being american and being southern with northern relatives and a west point education , pelham could have remained loyal to the union and yet he chose the south , and began his lonely march into confederate mythmaking follow disunion at or join us  sources 1840 and 1860 slave census sherry h penney and

washington kenneth t scott opposes abortion , and he says so in public sometimes he holds up large pictures of aborted fetuses sometimes he makes his points near churches that he believes are not doing enough to combat abortion a couple of years ago , that hateful antigay protests at military funerals deserved first amendment protection it will soon decide whether to hear a sequel , this one involving mr scott on palm sunday in 2005 , he and other protesters turned up near an episcopal church in denver as the parishioners reenacted jesus' entry into jerusalem in an outdoor ceremony , mr scott stood on a parked car on public property and addressed the procession from about 20 feet away some observers said he was loud others said he was screaming he showed large pictures of aborted fetuses about 200 children were present , and some of them became upset the church sued , and a colorado court issued an order barring mr scott from engaging in various kinds of disruptive conduct near the church when services are under way most of the restrictions were not based on what he had to say those parts of the order were , as lawyers would put it , content neutral but one part of the order raises a difficult first amendment question it bars mr scott from displaying large posters or similar displays depicting gruesome images of mutilated fetuses or dead bodies in a manner reasonably likely to be viewed by children under 12 in last year , the colorado court of appeals said the order was meant to suppress mr scott s speech based on its content , something the government can do only if it has an exceptionally good reason there was such a reason here , the court said a compelling government interest in protecting children from disturbing images the court noted in passing that the ban might seem to bar some depictions of the crucifixion in urging the justices not to hear the case , the church , st john s church in the wilderness , said it had no interest in suppressing petitioner s message and just wanted to let its parishioners pray and worship in peace the congregation could not pray and participate meaningfully in the palm sunday service without being forced to view gruesome images , the brief said mr scott is represented by , a prominent first amendment specialist at the university of california , los angeles religious institutions , like other institutions that play an important role in spreading ideas , are often fitting targets for criticism , he wrote in his  nailing 95 theses to a church door might today be a technical trespass , he said , referring to the manifesto from martin luther that helped spark the reformation but displaying signs containing those theses on a nearby sidewalk has to be constitutionally protected lower courts have issued conflicting rulings about whether pictures of aborted fetuses may be banned from public places because they disturb children in 2008 , for instance , the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit , in san francisco , about a truck that displayed enlarged , graphic photographs of earlyterm aborted fetuses around the perimeter of a public middle school some students started crying others discussed throwing rocks at the truck the appeals court said that none of that mattered and that it would be an unprecedented departure from bedrock first amendment principles to allow the government to restrict speech based on listener reaction simply because the listeners are children the wyoming supreme court , by contrast , last year banning the display of disturbing images of aborted and dismembered fetuses turned on evidence concerning the injury or potential injury to children from viewing the images the united states supreme court has endorsed different standards where children are involved only for materials concerning sex or that are broadcast over the airwaves in 2011 , the court refused to go further , that barred the sale of violent video games to minors professor volokh said that allowing the presence of children to limit what adults may see could justify all sorts of pernicious restrictions on speech mr scott s images , he added , provided valuable information to young people regrettably , many american girls are getting pregnant , and participating in the making of decisions about abortion , even in their teens , he told the justices , adding children must be allowed the freedom to form their moral , religious and political views about abortion on the basis of uncensored speech before they reach the age when they have to decide whether to have an abortion mr scott s petition in the case , scott v st john s church in the wilderness , no 121077 , is supported by an impressive array of first amendment lawyers and scholars , including floyd abrams , jack m balkin , david d cole , sanford levinson , geoffrey stone and nadine strossen many of them are liberals who support abortion rights the decision below represents a startling and dangerous departure from fundamental first amendment doctrine , said the constitution does not permit the government to restrict speech because it offends or disturbs others , from religion scholars , was critical of mr scott for his incivility but this is not a case for miss manners , it said , from art historians , traced how disturbing images have shaped public understanding of conflicts from the civil war to iraq photographs of abuses at abu ghraib prison , for instance , are incontrovertibly gruesome and to say that they would be disturbing to children is an understatement in an interview , professor volokh said vivid images are very often the most effective way of conveying a moral truth as far as his client was concerned , professor volokh said , the gruesomeness of the image reflects the gruesomeness of the act
warner , n h i did n't start hallucinating immediately for two or three years after i lost the central vision in my left eye to wet macular degeneration a condition caused by the leakage of blood vessels in the back of the eye i could see relatively normally central vision is what you see faces with it s how you read words , fork up a piece of pie or tie your shoes but my right eye worked fine , so the grayishblack blur i saw in the middle of things with the other eye was n't particularly disconcerting i just looked around the edges of the blur the visions did n't appear all at once , either first , riding in the passenger seat of the car , i started noticing , from the corner of my eye , vistas opening in the landscape out the window i saw little woodland trails i could follow dreamily , even as we drove down city streets after dark once we were out of the city , trees by the side of the road morphed into towering brick walls suggestive of a maximumsecurity prison , sometimes intricately patterned with what looked liked droplets of colored sugar when i faced front , things returned to normal these were the beginnings of my hallucinatory adventures one day , as i was reading an engrossing story by alice munro , the lines of print were invaded bold patterns in vivid colors , striped , polkadotted , some outlined in black like a rouault painting , took over they even danced onto the normal edges of what my right eye could see i forced them away by repeatedly blinking now the hallucinations both fascinating and frightening were everywhere when i walked outside , the bare branches of trees oozed into thick green ropes stretches of plaid in lipstick red and cobalt blue overtook gray cobblestone walls in a dimly lighted room , the shapes of hooded people occasionally appeared as if summoned by some higher power they were not exactly menacing , but they made me uneasy who were these faceless beings and who had invited them \? then they melted away , only to reappear as clumps of weird vegetation that swayed in place , as if stirred by high winds when i first went to the eye doctor , i described the blur , but not the visions i was prescribed doses of vitamins and zinc , and endured photodynamic therapy a treatment involving laser beams but none of these succeeded in arresting the destruction of retinal cells at the back of my eye in 2008 , i was finally referred to a retinologist who had experience with two injectable drugs avastin and lucentis that can be used to treat agerelated macular degeneration and so i began my monthly treatment sessions first would come a series of numbing drops , followed by several rounds of antibiotic drops then the examiningroom chair was flattened and the iron maiden device that forces the eyelid open was applied brilliant lights focused on my face , causing my unimprisoned eye to squint and tear then came the silent plunge of the needle the injection itself is physically painless , but every time i heard the sterile syringe being unwrapped i gripped the arms of my chair and tried not to hyperventilate my terror never diminished with repetition afterward , i was left lying flat to marinate \( the retinologist s word \) for 20 minutes lastly , a techie came to check my retinal pressure and i was released i did this 15 times , and after a year and three months , photos of the back of the eye showed that the leakage of blood vessels had slowed i was spared further injections to this day i continue to return at threemonth intervals for followup pictures before each checkup i pray like a good atheist in a foxhole to be spared any further deterioration i was about midway through my monthly ordeals before i could screw up the courage to describe my visitations to the retinologist he was quick to reassure me what you are having , he said , are nonpsychiatric visual hallucinations it was a stilted pronouncement , but i knew the nonpsychiatric was meant to comfort me i was n't going crazy there was even a name for my condition he called it the charles bonnet syndrome charles boyay , famous romantic lead \? once i got the spelling straight i went online charles bonnet , an 18thcentury swiss naturalist , first became aware of these fictive visual percepts medspeak for visual hallucinations in his nearly blind , 89yearold grandfather , who was hallucinating birds , carriages , battlements apparently sometimes , when the visual part of the brain does n't understand why the eye is no longer sending it images , it makes some up itself i was disappointed not to be able to find many discussions of this percept , at least in english , before the 1980s surely people with intact cognitive status another useful bit of jargon had been seeing things these last two centuries , and surely some of them had confided their visions to others , as bonnet s grandfather valiantly did i would give a great deal to know what they saw did the hooded figures visit their living rooms \? did they see the paths through the woods \? as mysteriously as they arrived , my hallucinations faded away , recurring only occasionally as pale blue fleursdelis running along the top of a wall the dead spot in my left eye will never heal , but apparently my brain , after casting about wildly to compensate for it , has been satisfied that eye sees no more wonders
since the late 1960s , the dealer and philanthropist virginia dwan has quietly donated art to museums all over the country among her gifts are duchamp s famed , a reproduction of the mona lisa with a mustache and beard in pencil , which has gone to the norton simon museum in los angeles , and , one of michael heizer s monumental pieces of land art in nevada , which she has given to the museum of contemporary art in los angeles ms dwan also donated six photographic images by mr heizer to the whitney museum of american art , and works by robert smithson and sol lewitt to the museum of modern art in new york , the art institute of chicago and the walker art center in minneapolis but it is her own collection , a time capsule of the art world from the late 1950s through the 1970s , that museums around the country have been coveting for years ms dwan was a pioneering presence in los angeles and new york , opening her first gallery in a los angeles storefront in 1959 and later in new york , where she ran a space on west 57th street until 1971 ms dwan s own holdings reflect her commitment to earth artists like smithson , walter de maria and mr heizer to contemporary french figures including yves klein , arman , tinguely , martial raysse and niki de saint phalle and to minimalists like sol lewitt , carl andre and dan flavin statuesque and elegant , ms dwan , 81 , is as passionate about these artists today as she was decades ago i want the collection to have the largest audience of people possible , not just art world types who have a todo list , she said on a recent afternoon , showing a visitor through her upper west side apartment that is why , she explained , she has promised 250 works to the national gallery of art in washington the gift consists of works by 52 artists and includes 34 sculptures , 15 paintings , 159 prints and drawings , 39 photographs , 2 films and carl andre s seven books of poetry it also complements other contemporary art collections that have been left to the national gallery , including that of and the  attracting the largest numbers of visitors was n't ms dwan s only reason for choosing the national gallery she has also known james meyer , associate curator of modern art there , since 1991 when he was working on his dissertation , and eventual book , minimalism art and polemics in the sixties so important is the collection that when the national gallery reopens its east building in late 2016 after a threeyear renovation and expansion , the inaugural show there will be from los angeles to new york the dwan gallery , 19591971 this gift reflects five areas virginia identified and trailblazed , mr meyer said , which are pop , nouveau realism , minimalism , conceptual art and land art although she began by showing betterknown artists like franz kline , he said , she was the first to introduce los angeles to yves klein and to the whole gang of nouveau realists asked what she saw in minimalists and earth artists before others did , ms dwan replied , i have always found it to be more contemplative and quieter than most contemporary art today a recent tour of her apartment offered a peek at what is going to washington among the art in her living room is a floor piece by carl andre , and a photo work on canvas by mr heizer perched on a pedestal is a multipart prism table piece by charles ross there are also sculptures by fred sandback and lewitt , and a wall piece by william anastasi unlike scores of art world personalities who have portraits of themselves by andy warhol , ms dwan is perhaps the only one of her generation who was the inspiration for edward kienholz , jean tinguely and mr heizer , each of whom created sculptures of her larry rivers made a drawing of ms dwan , too i do n't really keep up anymore , she said when asked about her impressions of the art world today but every surface of her apartment that did n't have art had a catalog from a recent museum exhibition this month she and rotraut kleinmoquay , yves klein s widow , attended the first new york performance of klein s , at the madison avenue presbyterian church i thought the music was amazing , she said you could really hear the different instruments although she has been immersed in art her entire adult life , she remembered a moment when she closed her gallery in 1971 and had serious thoughts of going in a different direction i just wanted to do something else , ms dwan recalled , perhaps filmmaking , perhaps photography but she never quite made the leap the art world just kept pulling me back in , she said eric clapton s taste in art veers toward the abstract , to canvases by masters like twombly , de kooning and gerhard richter a year ago when the musician sold abstraktes bild \( 8094 \) , a colorful 1994 canvas by mr richter in london , it brought a record price for any living artist at auction \( in may , that record was broken by mr richter when one of his photorealist paintings , domplatz , mailand , in new york \) mr clapton had bought his painting , as well as two other abstract canvases by mr richter made the same year , when they were sold as one lot at sotheby s in new york in 2001 he paid 34 million for all three he is trying his luck again , this time at christie s on nov 12 , where a second painting from the group will be offered for sale as part of its postwar and contemporary art auction experts estimate this painting will bring 18 million to 22 million the magic of mr clapton s name and the timing of last fall s auction , which came on the heels of a blockbuster richter retrospective that went to berlin , london and paris , accounted for the recordbreaking price it also brought a rash of other paintings by mr richter to auction from collectors hoping to capitalize on his rising popularity some did better than others , but none have come close to the giant prices paid for mr clapton s painting or domplatz , mailand the painting that mr clapton is putting up for sale in november is similar stylistically to the one he sold last year the surface has layer upon layer of paint applied with a squeegee until the surface has a watery depth to it but it has more golden tones than the others it has the sense of a full fall abstract landscape , said brett gorvy , worldwide chairman of postwar and contemporary art at christie s
s unconventional working methods spreading a piece of unstretched , unprimed canvas on the floor of his long island studio and then pouring , splattering and literally flinging industrial paints across its surface have long been part of his myth , performance art executed without an audience on the floor i am more at ease , he once wrote i feel nearer , more part of the painting since this way i can walk around it , work from the four sides and literally be in the painting during his lifetime pollock was famously photographed creating these seminal works , known as drip or action paintings his process and his canvases have been so extensively studied that it would seem there could be nothing else to learn yet a 10month examination and restoration of his , by conservators at the museum of modern art , have produced new insights about how the artist worked the conservators also revealed a mysterious missing chapter in the painting s history restoring one has been on s todo list since 1998 when the work often called a masterpiece of abstract expressionism was featured in a retrospective seen in the context of paintings from the same period , one showed its age , with its canvas yellowing and years of dirt and dust in its crevices but it was n't until last july that work finally started and almost a year later , on tuesday , one will be rehung in its place on the museum s fourth floor , considerably cleaner and its conservators a bit wiser the process began , as most restorations do , with a feather dusting from there , james coddington , chief conservator , and jennifer hickey , project assistant conservator , began to tackle the decades of grime covering the large painting , which is 9 feet high by 17 feet across they used sponges , moist erasers and cottontipped swabs soaked in water and a gentle , phadjusted solution pollock s drip paintings are complex , highly textured compositions with multiple coats of dripped and poured paint in some areas paint is applied so thinly it seems to just stain the canvas in others the paint is denser , with colors blending , swirling and bleeding together there are also places where the paint has a smooth , glossy surface , and places where pollock applied paint so thickly that it dried like curdled milk , with a puckered , wrinkled surface but when the conservators started to study these layers with xrays and ultraviolet lights , certain portions of the canvas did n't resemble pollock s style of painting at all the texture was different , suggesting repetitive brush strokes not seen elsewhere in his work another kind of paint was used in these areas too , one that did n't have the typical characteristics of poured house paint that we know pollock used , mr coddington explained the style of painting , he said , had a kind of fussiness that has nothing to do with the way pollock applied paint he and ms hickey then took microscopic paint samples from various parts of the canvas they found household enamel paint known to have been used by pollock , but they also discovered a synthetic resin that pollock was not known to have used how had it gotten there \? records showed that nobody at the museum had touched the painting since it entered moma s collection in 1968 and there was no evidence that it had been restored before coming to moma museum officials did know that one had once belonged to ben heller , a dealer and a close friend of pollock s the painting had also been in a traveling exhibition in the early 1960s when they began researching that show they unearthed crucial evidence a photograph taken in 1962 by a scholar in portland , ore , revealed that the painting had none of the questionable , uncharacteristic areas they had discovered that meant they were added after 1962 , mr coddington said and since pollock died in 1956 , those photographs confirmed they were put there after his death it is still unclear , however , who added them and why we presumed it was to cover up some damage , but we did n't know how extensive it was , he said studying these areas with an ultraviolet light , the conservator saw small cracks below the surface of the paint presumably the later painting was an attempt to cover the cracks , perhaps to make the painting more salable that was n't the only surprise when examining the painting with scholars and curators it became clear that some of the brown drips in the center and bottom of the canvas could not have been painted while one was on the floor they 're vertical drips , mr coddington said of the downward trickles of paint they then examined photographs of pollock in his studio taken by hans namuth , who photographed many artists , and these showed how pollock hung paintings toward the end of their creation they 're like final edits applied late in the game , mr coddington said of the downward drips they showed that the artist was not just looking at these paintings as the big gestural achievements that they appeared to be to mr coddington this indicated that these canvases were really carefully conceived compositions pollock he said , looked at these paintings with a level of detail that was so great even we ca n't understand it once they felt confident about pollock s original intentions , mr coddington and ms hickey painstakingly removed the paint that was applied after pollock s death but they also made sure to preserve certain quirks in the painting , like a fly , still intact , stuck in the righthand corner and tiny blobs of pink paint that they believe landed on the canvas by accident there is no pink anywhere else in the composition when the cleaning was complete and the extra paint removed , the white and black underneath suddenly became visibly sharper , and fine , spiderlike skeins of paint appeared like strands of silk , ms hickey said so did more pronounced areas that almost look marbleized toward the end of the restoration there was one final step the conservator wanted to put the painting flat on the floor to see it as pollock did , mr coddington explained on an early may afternoon , three art handlers , two curators and the two conservators gathered as the giant painting was taken off the wall of the conservation studio and gently placed on the floor not only did the canvas suddenly appear smaller , more human in scale , but ann temkin , moma s chief curator of painting and sculpture , pointed out that when looking at the canvas on the floor , it was possible to see the rhythm pollock created with areas of bare canvas where the eye could rest before taking in the complex , layered ribbons of paint now that it s been cleaned , the white and the black are far more pronounced , she said there s more electricity only when it was on the floor did mr coddington discover what he described as toasty areas , darker portions deep in the middle of the canvas that still need to be cleaned we have to see how it looks upright first , he said that s how it s seen he added , the point is to bring it back as close as we can to how it was when it left the studio
for his success on the field and humanity off it , deserves the praise , gifts and money he has earned as the greatest closer in major league history yet as rivera prepares to leave the stage , it is time to let the secret out the importance of a proven closer is a myth rivera blew the save thursday in a 98 loss to the , undone by a sequence with echoes of 2004 a pinchrunner stole second and scored on a gametying single , and boston won in extra innings it was rivera s sixth blown save in 47 chances , a solid ratio , but not otherworldly no disrespect to rivera , but lots of relievers could probably do the same i do n't want to take away anything from what i did , dennis eckersley , a hall of fame closer , said thursday before the game but it s not as tough as you think as a broadcaster for the red sox , the leaders in the american league east , eckersley has seen up close the folly of a heavy investment in pitchers with a lot of career saves boston s closer , koji uehara , was the team s third choice for the role this season he has not allowed an earned run since june , a streak that continued when he shut down the in the bottom of the 10th uehara is in the first year of a twoyear , 85 million contract that barely registered around baseball last winter , when teams again spent foolishly for saves the los angeles dodgers gave brandon league a threeyear , 225 million contract the cincinnati reds gave jonathan broxton roughly the same between them , they had three allstar appearances and 171 saves before this season both have been busts this year , yet their teams have survived just fine and are rolling toward the playoffs so it is in boston before last season , the red sox traded three players to oakland for andrew bailey , who had 75 saves the previous three seasons bailey got hurt last season , so the red sox traded four players for joel hanrahan , a twotime allstar who had 96 career saves hanrahan is out after reconstructive elbow surgery bailey is out after shoulder surgery uehara , who was left off the texas rangers' world series roster in 2011 after giving up three homers in the playoffs , is in his numbers are sick , eckersley said that s not normal uehara had 13 saves in 2010 , none the next season and one last year yet after his 123 save thursday , uehara had converted 18 of 21 chances this season , with a 114 earned run average and a 26inning scoreless streak he has retired 76 of his last 83 batters uehara said that plenty of other setup men could have similar success i think it s just that the opinion toward the setup guys is not high enough , uehara said through an interpreter but there is a pretty good group of guys that can pitch in the setup roles the trick is to find the right ones the smart organizations can do it the st louis cardinals have won two championships recently despite losing their seasonopening closer both times the san francisco giants won last year after replacing the injured brian wilson with his setup man , sergio romo , who filled in seamlessly several teams that have signed expensive closers in free agency have not been rewarded francisco rodriguez \( 3 years , 37 million \) was not the cureall the mets expected heath bell \( three years , 27 million \) fell apart with the miami marlins jonathan papelbon \( four years , 50 million \) has been a oneinning hood ornament for a flawed philadelphia phillies team rafael soriano \( two years , 22 million \) has six blown saves and has had a diminishing strikeout rate for the washington nationals what happened to the supposedly rare mindset those pitchers had , that vaguely superhuman ability to handle the ninth inning \? it sure seems like lots of others can perform just fine to suggest that a setup man cannot deal with pressure is silly you can find somebody to do it , eckersley said you could groom somebody to do it who s on the staff , if you manage it the right way i mean , think about it the tougher job is to come in with guys on base , because he s got to be quicker to the plate and he has to hold runners on that is what the red sox did after losing hanrahan and bailey they even contemplated using junichi tazawa before giving uehara a chance , because they worried that uehara , 38 , could not pitch on consecutive days as it turned out , manager john farrell said , uehara thrives with regular work the one thing you like is the swingandmiss capability , farrell said , explaining the reasons for signing uehara and that s not just this year he s done it in the american league east he s done it in hitters' ballparks he did it in japan , as well as close farrell is right the numbers clearly show that uehara , a master of the splitter , could succeed in the late innings after a 12start cameo for baltimore in 2009 , uehara had three seasons in a row with more strikeouts than innings and a whip \( walks plus hits per inning pitched \) under 100 in other words , he gets a lot of strikeouts without many runners reaching base , just what teams want in the late innings sometimes it does work to acquire an established closer the red sox showed that in 2004 with keith foulke and the phillies in 2008 with brad lidge both helped lead their teams to titles with a magical first season , but could never repeat that success rivera is the standout exception at the most overvalued position in baseball yet even he is far from perfect , and on thursday , uehara was better
an abomination of epic proportions vulgarly ostentatious the death of the noble game if classics are the books people praise but do not read , the indian premier league is the cricket tournament that people claim to hate but still watch make no mistake they are watching according to business standard , viewership numbers for ipl season 6 , which started on april 3 , are up from 79 million to 100 million in 2008 , when the ipl franchises were first auctioned off , the priciest franchise was mumbai , which fetched about 1119 million in 2011 , when the pune franchise was created , it was bought for a whooping 370 million so what is it that actually makes ipl such a national obsession \? well for starters , this is one tournament india is guaranteed to win given that we are an unmitigated disaster at almost all international sports \( marginally less so in cricket \) , that is a most comforting realization then of course there is the provincial angle some of the biggest schisms in india are between regions , languages and cities the ipl allows us the opportunity to taunt and scream and celebrate our regional identities , in a reasonably goodnatured way , to pit pune against delhi , punjab against bangalore , chennai and kolkata against more or less everyone but like everything else in india , things are never that simple in fact , the ipl is creating new fault lines and forging brandnew alliances , of the kind that could have scarcely been anticipated gautam gambhir and virat kohli , india s two resident hotheads , both of whom are from delhi and lead rival franchises \( kolkata and bangalore \) recently forgot their common roots and had an ugly onfield altercation mahendra singh dhoni from the hindispeaking northern state of jharkhand , has become a muchloved son of chennai , the capital of a state that was once the nerve center of the antihindi agitation , thanks to his exploits for the city franchise and if that isn t complex enough , sample this shoaib akhtar , the flamboyant and muchhated pakistani bowler , appears for the kolkata knight riders in a game against delhi in ipl season 1 \( 2008 \) the 50 , 000odd spectators at the eden gardens , never known to be not jingoistic , forget the baggage of history and the duty of nationality , and raise the roof cheering for akthar as he rips through the delhi batting lineup as he does so , he counts among his victims a certain manoj tiwary of delhi daredevils , who comes from the suburbs of kolkata and plays regional cricket for the state of which kolkata is the capital does tiwary get any sympathy or a clap of support \? no he does not still not convinced about the ability of ipl to define a brave , new world \? harbhajan singh has had a bloodfeud with australians running for decades , none more than with andrew symonds and ricky ponting for those who do not know , symonds once famously accused harbhajan of racially abusing him onfield , an incident that almost led to a tour being canceled the history between ponting and harbhajan had been somewhat akin to that of the israelis and the palestinians , both having clashed countless number of times with mutuallydirected verbal barbs given this tumultuous history , how heartwarming it is to see harbhajan and symonds laughing heartily together as they turn out for the same franchise , or the inspirational freezeframe of harbhajan and ponting in the warm throes of embrace as they congratulate each other after a wicket , while playing for the mumbai indians \? it all just goes to show that we human beings can overcome years of hatred and conflict once we are paid insane amounts of money there is hope for us yet for those who favor negativity to such pure optimism , ipl has enough of that too alleged lack of transparency in financial matters alleged excess transparency in cheerleader attire an indian international \( harbhajan singh again \) slaps another indian international player \( the intensely volatile sreesanth \) in ipl 1 and gets banned for the season the echo of that slap resonates in season 6 , as the one who was slapped has a meltdown on twitter a poisonpen blog under the pseudonym fake ipl player , comes up during ipl 2 , goes viral , and creates much drama and mistrust before the blogger outs himself during ipl 3 , post 26 11 franchises with tensions running high , franchises are told not to select pakistani players at the auction leading to much heartburn among some owners in ipl 6 , sri lankan players are banned from playing in chennai in order to honor local sentiment shahrukh khan , the king of mumbai and bollywood s biggest star , is declared persona non grata at the mumbai stadium because of an altercation with the ground staff and then above them all is the mother of all controversies sourav ganguly , calcutta s hero and legendary indian captain , is blamed for his own city s team , kolkata knight riders s abysmal performance in season 1 by the time season 2 comes along , a new coach is hired for the knight riders , whose first job is to sideline the hometown boy the franchise slips to the last spot this sets in motion the greatest star wars this side of the death star as ganguly fans lock horns with devotees of the franchise owner , bollywood s biggest star , shahrukh khan , creating deep fissures between father and son , brother and brother , husband and wife a multiyear saga that would put the game of thrones to shame begins in which ganguly wanders from one franchise to another like a grenade with the pin taken out , generating not much light , but a lot of heat and entertainment finally , and this is perhaps the most important reason of all why we love the ipl despite claiming not to it makes us feel good that we have one of the richest sporting leagues in the world there was a time not so long ago when many british and australians cricketers were highly reluctant tourists to india , complaining about the crowd , the filth , the food and the people now , we get to watch players from the same countries choose to play in the ipl over their home leagues and hear oncepowerful british and australians complaining about india s financial muscle in the cricket world \( of which the ipl is the most reviled symbol \) it gives us nothing less than a national sense of achievement not that we would say that aloud by the light of day , arnab ray is a research scientist at the fraunhofer center for experimental software engineering and also an adjunct assistant professor at the computer science department of the university of maryland at college park come night , he metamorphoses into , novelist \( may i hebb your attention pliss and the mine \) and columnist he can be followed at on twitter
salt lake city brawn battered brains on saturday hope was swallowed by arizona s size there went , among the darlings of this ncaa tournament , a life powerhouse turned basketball underdog whose charmed appearance here ended on the wrong end of a blowout arizona dominated , with its swift guards and towering post players , who if they did not run by or around the crimson , simply threw the ball inside for hardly contested layups the wildcats \( 277 \) ripped open a 172 advantage on the way to a 7451 victory that pushed them into a west region semifinal next week in los angeles they pounced on us from the beginning , harvard guard christian webster said it kind of took us by surprise harvard \( 2010 \) made 1 of its first 14 shots and 7 of its 28 attempts in the first half the crimson tried to stem their significant size disadvantage , but that only left the wildcats wide open on the perimeter , with harvard susceptible for easy backdoor cuts when arizona lobbed the ball inside to kaleb tarczewski \( 7feet \) , grant jerrett \( 610 \) , angelo chol \( 69 \) or brandon ashley \( 68 \) , it sometimes looked like high schoolers against middle schoolers the wildcats' perimeter players \( guard mark lyons , forward solomon hill \) did most of the scoring , but that often resulted from simple math one team tall , the other one not asked if this was harvard s worstcase scenario , coach tommy amaker said , yeah , it was guard siyani chambers added the film did n't give them as much credit as they deserve they were great on defense tonight the numbers indicated a mismatch at the outset arizona could point to nearly 30 straight winning seasons harvard four arizona had played 32 games in the tournament since 2000 harvard had played two , a tally that included its firstever win on thursday night arizona had more than 30 players drafted by nba teams since 1988 harvard none , although jeremy lin made his professional mark anyway in victory , arizona bucked the curse that had befallen so many of the top seeds in the west region already , the no 3 seed \( new mexico \) , the no 4 seed \( kansas state \) and the no 5 seed \( wisconsin \) had fallen in the first round , new mexico to harvard of the top eight seeds , only gonzaga \( 1 \) , ohio state \( 2 \) and arizona \( 6 \) managed to advance , and gonzaga lost to wichita state later saturday perhaps that elevated the expectations for harvard , its players bent on denting the stereotypes of them as nerds or brainiacs , more versed in books than basketball the junior guard laurent rivard knocked down 12 3pointers in three ncaa tournament games \( counting this year and last \) kenyatta smith and steve moundoumissi held their own against the lobos' own sizable frontcourt sean miller , arizona s coach , said that harvard s big guys are somewhat misrepresented such talk , combined with all the upsets , made a crimson win seem possible , or more possible , at least then the teams took the court , and there were all those arizona posts , standing tall , as if they were raised on stilts in their ncaa opener , arizona outrebounded belmont , whose tallest starter was 67 , by 4418 of harvard s starters , only smith at 68 stood taller than 65 beyond its height advantage , arizona also fielded a far more athletic lineup that was evident in backtoback lobs to lyons in the first half that went for automatic layups , plays in which lyons cut through the defense and leapt toward the rim , his waist above the heads of the defenders early into the second half , chambers crashed into a wildcat defender he crashed to the floor and grimaced as he stood up , his hands covering his mouth from courtside , it looked as if arizona had chipped one of his front teeth an arena official looked for it along the sideline no foul was called for the crimson , it was that kind of night chambers did return , though , and his 3pointer from the left corner trimmed the deficit to 4430 for the most optimistic of optimists , hope remained , at least a sliver of it miller worked the sideline , hands up , palms out , face red his best college teams at pittsburgh twice lost in the first week of the tournament , bounced by lower seeds he knew that harvard had lost two of its best players to a widespread academic scandal , that the crimson lost backtoback games against princeton and penn down the stretch but he also knew , from personal experience , how hard it was to beat anyone in this tournament harvard included it does n't matter the name on the jersey , hill said we 're not taking anyone lightly for harvard , the blowout materialized instead of another upset bid harvard could not match arizona athlete for athlete it could not mitigate all those tall trees in the post and if somehow the crimson had overcome those deficits , their players made too few shots in the first half to beat columbia , let alone the wildcats as the second half continued , harvard s fans continued to cheer and hope and implore a crimson comeback so did the neutral members of the crowd it never happened , though , and down went another darling
on oct 5 , american special forces captured nazih abdulhamed alruqai , an operative of al qaeda living in libya five days later , a group of libyan militiamen kidnapped their own prime minister , ali zeidan after five hours , having faced no opposition from the police or the army , they the prime minister s captors made no demands for cash , nor did they overtly request any changes in current government policy nor was anyone hurt an aspect that gave the whole affair the air of a vast publicity stunt some have described the kidnapping as a pseudocoup but coups usually aim to overthrow one government and replace it with another things are different in libya none of the country s competing armed factions are capable of governing alone each wishes to protect its special privileges while preventing its opponents from governing libya is truly ruled by everyone and no one in the early days of the antiqaddafi rebellion , the rebels' top brass attempted to form a nascent national army , yet various civilian \( read islamist \) groups refused to submit to the proposed chain of command in july 2011 , islamists were suspected in the murder of the national army s leader , gen abdul fattah younes since then , myriad civilian militias have proliferated they dwarf the national army and police force combined the government has tried to coopt some of the civilian brigades with big salaries and fancy titles , but most remain loyal only to their commanders consequently , the libyan government lacks even 100 armed men who would lay their lives on the line to defend the abstract concept of the state conversely , the militias can rely on thousands in western libya , the most staunchly antigovernment forces are a loose alliance of islamists and certain powerful militias from the city of misurata counterbalancing them are nonislamist militias from the city of zintan in the east , militias seek to obtain justice \( meaning more power and money for their region \) as a result of this multipolar struggle , the country has become virtually each group has its supporters inside the parliament the martyrs and the muslim brotherhood blocs have worked to of the revolutionaries operations room the group that kidnapped mr zeidan with the islamists' support , nouri abusahmain became libya s president in june and he quickly bolstered his power as a counterweight to the prime minister by endowing the revolutionaries operations room with 700 million prime minister zeidan s various opponents have to force him out of office despite his waning popularity and effectiveness , they failed to oust him via a secret noconfidence vote on oct 1 he survived the vote not because he enjoys widespread support but rather because no one can agree on who should replace him the american raid that captured mr ruqai , also known as abu anas allibi , fueled outrage within certain sections of the population mr zeidan s opponents tried to capitalize on this by highlighting the prime minister s alleged complicity with washington upon seizing the prime minister , the abductors proclaimed that they were defending libya s honor and sovereignty rather than their own narrow interests their use of political symbolism was astute their actions said , in effect , america came here to libya and violated libyan sovereignty by kidnapping allibi in return , we will retaliate by kidnapping someone whom the west cares about so they abducted their own prime minister in tripoli s corinthia hotel , the place most associated in the popular mind with westerners and their dealings with the regime of col muammar elqaddafi by linking mr zeidan to the west and the old regime , the islamist militias cleverly positioned themselves as the defenders of the revolution but this symbolism is built on myths , hyperbole and lies it is an attempt to deflect attention from the militias' blatant abuse of power libya s leadership must put an end to the militias' mythology by finally defending itself in the court of public opinion in his postrelease news conference , mr zeidan pointed out that armed protesters routinely force their way into his office , demanding money or jobs on the occasions that their requests are declined , they turn to the media in an attempt to win public support by claiming that mr zeidan is installing in government how mr zeidan emerges from this crisis will depend on his political savvy his government might fall because of his public humiliation or he could muddle through either way , western policy makers should seek not to support mr zeidan or any other politician , but rather to in libya the cancellation of some military aid to egypt could grant president obama a novel opportunity to redirect some of the funds withheld from egypt toward institution building in libya without the need for to date , the obama administration has been hamstrung by republican obstruction on libya , which has focused on scoring political points through endless investigations of last year s attack on the united states diplomatic mission in benghazi mr obama should now seize this opportunity to create a virtuous precedent by switching his financial support from those who have perpetrated a coup to a country that might suffer one
tampa , fla explained that additional soreness in s surgically repaired ankle would most likely force jeter onto the disabled list , which would ensure that he would miss opening day moments later , cashman , the ' general manager , was asked if everything else was all right with his team suffering through a staggering array of injuries a list so long that it includes cashman himself there was no happy answer that s a loaded question , cashman said sunday while perched on a scooter with his own broken leg i do n't think anyone is all right we all have whatever we have but we 're yankees we 're supposed to get through them cashman insists that jeter , too , will eventually overcome his injury but jeter s most recent setback has prompted concern that his issues may linger longer than anyone anticipated , perhaps even well into the season if he is placed on the dl , the earliest jeter can return is april 6 , but even that may be an optimistic bet he s just not ready yet , cashman said we 're not dealing with any new injury or anything of that nature it s just general soreness he plays a massively demanding position shortstop is not something at the major league baseball level that people can easily handle he s coming off a broken ankle from october cashman said he had already decided that he would place jeter on the 15day dl to open the season , meaning that jeter would join alex rodriguez \( hip surgery \) , curtis granderson \( broken arm \) and mark teixeira \( strained wrist tendon \) as absentees on april 1 , opening day all of them will probably remain in tampa to complete their recoveries , but not cashman he is expected to be present for the opening day festivities , either on crutches or with the help of his scooter , which he inherited from jeter my rehab s going great , he said jeter s had been going well , too , until last week he was injured in game 1 of the american league championship series on oct 13 and had an operation a week later in which he had a metal plate and four screws inserted into the ankle the soreness began tuesday , and he was scratched from that day s game he was given a cortisone shot and said that the ankle felt better almost immediately jeter took ground balls and then had four atbats in a minor league game saturday , but he did not run full speed to first base on his four groundouts even that light workout was too much he arrived at the stadium sunday morning and told the trainers that the soreness had moved to a different part of the ankle , farther back cashman said the additional soreness might be a result of overcompensating for the original soreness , but cashman added that the doctors said none of this was particularly unexpected jeter left the stadium without speaking to the news media , but cashman said jeter would take at least two days off and would be reevaluated tuesday cashman also said that although jeter resisted going on the dl when the soreness first cropped up , he had come around after the most recent setback i know derek extremely well , cashman said obviously , i 've been with him for a long , long time , and i can read his face his face today tells me the reality of the circumstances are starting to sink in , that the disabled list situation might be necessary cashman said that in jeter s absence , the team would go with eduardo nunez at shortstop although he has had some success at the plate , nunez has a history of fielding miscues that has made fans wary of him as a longterm solution at shortstop the yankees have moved the 25yearold nunez to several other positions in the past , but they left him at shortstop during spring training as insurance in case jeter had to miss time nunez had two hits in sunday s 76 victory over the tampa bay rays , including a runscoring triple , and he made a fine spinning throw on a ball up the middle manager joe girardi said that it was a play that nunez had worked hard on at camp , and that he was happy with the way nunez had progressed defensively a year ago , that throw might have sailed into the stands it shows the type of progress he s made , girardi said still , nunez is not jeter with all the injuries , the yankees' opening day infield will have only one player from last year s lineup , second baseman robinson cano either francisco cervelli or chris stewart will replace catcher russell martin , who signed with pittsburgh as a free agent kevin youkilis is expected to be the third baseman , and the leading inhouse candidate at first base is juan rivera in the outfield , the yankees have still not decided on a fulltime replacement for granderson , who hit 43 home runs last year but is expected to miss the first month of the season one candidate is the recently signed brennan boesch but boesch sustained a strained ribcage muscle friday and has not played since , even though he says he feels fine he thinks we 're overly cautious , cashman said after everything that has happened since game 1 of the alcs last year , the yankees know it would be foolish to be anything else
ok , ok so you probably didn t pick harvard on thursday night or wichita state but you had oregon s upset , right \? and cal \? well , fine , but a lot of people disrespect the pac12 , so your bracket is probably still alive in the office pool and you need to keep up with friday s action zach hillesland , mike huguenin and times editors and reporters will supply updates from around the country the second day of the 2013 ncaa tournament forever will be remembered for 15thseeded florida gulf coast s shocking upset of no 2 seed georgetown just the seventh win by a no 15 seed in tourney history the stunner came in fgcu s firstever tourney game \( and , hey , how soon will we be hearing hey , why don t we play football \? talk from some fgcu folks \) there were five other upsets friday , as well no 9 temple over north carolina state , no 10 iowa state over notre dame , no 11 minnesota over ucla , no 12 ole miss over wisconsin and no 13 la salle over kansas state interestingly , four of the six upsets \( all but temple s and la salle s \) had doubledigit victory margins in all , there were 10 upsets in the tourney s first round \( two of those were no 9s beating no 8s \) the biggest damage has come in the west region , where half the upsets have occurred when the second round gets under way saturday , the region will be without the no 3 \( new mexico \) , no 4 \( kansas state \) , no 5 \( wisconsin \) , no 7 \( notre dame \) and no 8 \( pitt \) seeds and topseeded gonzaga barely escaped thursday against southern there were two upsets apiece in the east and south regions and just one in the midwest , which was considered the strongest of the four regions the east is missing its no 5 and 8 seeds the south its no 2 and 6 seeds and the midwest its no 5 seed in terms of remaining conference representatives , the big ten which had seven selections leads with six the atlantic 10 has all five of its selections left the acc , big east and pac12 each have three left , while the big 12 , missouri valley , mountain west and sec have two each the atlantic sun , conference usa , ivy and west coast have one apiece the big east has been the biggest disappointment , with five of its eight selections already gone from the tourney one overriding theme the big east s losing teams lacked topflight athleticism  mike huguenin ucla cut the lead to five early in the second half , but it was all minnesota after that as the 11thseeded golden gophers rolled to a 20point win in what almost certainly was his last college game , bruins freshman shabazz muhammad scored 20 points but on 6of18 shooting the bruins shot 323 percent as a team  mike huguenin kansas is going to close out 16thseeded western kentucky from the foul line , and while the jayhawks were far from dominant far , far from dominant the idea in march is to survive and advance and the jayhawks did that but kansas better had show up with a better effort sunday when it plays offenseminded north carolina ku should be able to hammer unc in the lane , but kansas backcourt could be in trouble  mike huguenin pleasing a hugely projayhawks crowd in kansas city , kansas has opened a 10point lead with a bit less than four minutes left against 16thseeded western kentucky the hilltoppers seemingly have forgotten how to shoot in the second half  mike huguenin western kentucky s hopes for an epic upset of topseeded kansas probably just ended with the fifth foul on hilltoppers forward george fant , who was one of two western players in double figures kansas leads 4842 with about five minutes left western has scored just 11 secondhalf points  mike huguenin seventhseeded notre dame fell to iowa state , 7658 , and the fighting irish s performance put a capper on a dismal firstround performance by the big east the conference had eight teams selected for the field , but just three remain \( louisville , marquette and syracuse \) to add to the misery , three league teams lost to worseseeded squads \( no 2 georgetown to no 15 florida gulf coast , notre dame to iowa state and no 8 pitt to no 9 wichita state \) and if no 14 davidson hadn t melted down in the final minute , it would ve taken out no 3 marquette the other league losers were cincinnati and villanova also worth noting the three big east winners beat teams from lowmajor leagues \( louisville over north carolina at from the mideastern athletic conference , syracuse over montana from the big sky and marquette over davidson from the southern \) final 7658 iowastate runs notredame out of ud arena just a throttling from start to finish cyclones might just give ohio state a test  zach schonbrun \( zschonbrun \) 23 mar 13  mike huguenin was looking forward to the ucla dance team s routine at halftime but like the bruins , it stalled when the wrong music was cued up the dancers recovered nicely now we ll see if the players do ucla shot 26 percent \( 8 of 30 \) as minnesota took a 3525 lead behind a nice mix of man and zone defenses austin hollins had 11 for the gophers , who got hot after a foulplauged start they shot 46 percent \( 14 of 30 \) if minnesota wins , this will have to stand as the high drama in austin top seeds miami and florida won impressively illinois just won  tom spousta minnesota was one of the best teams in the nation early , starting the season 151 but the golden gophers were barely mediocre in the second half of the season , losing 11 of their final 16 games they had lost three in a row and five of seven heading into the ncaa tourney minnesota looks to have found a salve for its woes , playing sixthseeded ucla tonight the golden gophers lead by 10 at halftime they have shot the ball well , and have put the clamps on the bruins ucla has hit just 26 percent from the field and star forward shabazz muhammad is 0of7 from the field thing is , ucla has been pitiful , yet is within striking distance and minnesota showed in the second half of the season that it is far from a sure thing  mike huguenin iowa state is spanking seventhseeded notre dame , leading by 16 with seven minutes gone in the second half the cyclones enjoy a huge advantage in athleticism and the irish look overmatched georges niang , a highschool teammate of nerlens noel at tilton , leading the cyclones w 15 points irish trailing , 5335  zach schonbrun \( zschonbrun \) 23 mar 13  mike huguenin there is no fathomable reason to expect 16thseeded western kentucky to take down topseeded kansas , especially in kansas city but western actually leads 3130 at halftime western is 2015 overall and finished fourth in the east division of the relatively lowrent sun belt conference before getting hot and winning the conference tourney title in its one game against a powerconference foe that made the ncaa field , western lost by 23 to louisville on dec 22 and this is a team that was swept this season by florida atlantic not florida or even florida gulf coast florida atlantic the athletic hilltoppers are shooting 46 percent from the field and have outrebounded the taller jayhawks , 1811 in addition , western has done a great defensive job on kansas guard ben mclemore , who has just two points western has thrown a variety of defensive looks at the jayhawks , who don t seem fully engaged in the contest  mike huguenin oklahoma and san diego state looked evenly matched on paper , and it has been that way on the court , too the 10thseeded sooners lead 3331 at halftime the winner faces florida gulf coast on sunday sooners coach lon kruger is the first coach to take five schools to the ncaa tourney he previously attended the dance with kansas state , florida , illinois and unlv  mike huguenin no 10 seed iowa state has received balanced scoring and is wreaking havoc with its defense in taking a 3523 halftime lead on notre dame the irish look slow and plodding against the cyclones , who have seven steals and have forced 14 turnovers clyburn with a 3 at the buzzer to give isu a 3523 lead going into halftime the cyclones are pumped up  zach schonbrun \( zschonbrun \) 23 mar 13  mike huguenin so does defense still win championships , or is there just some bad basketball being played here in austin \? except for florida of course the gators just held northwestern state , the nation s highest scoring team \( 81 points per game \) to 15 points in the second half in a 7947 rout florida , though , does play defense , allowing the third fewest points in the country this season i wasn t really pleased with our defense in the first half , said gators coach billy donovan they shot too high of a percentage that wasn t a problem for illinois the illini earlier friday scored only 20 points in the second half and won by 8 and now we bring you the no 6seed ucla bruins vs the no 11 minnesota golden gophers if you took higher seeded ucla , you took the underdog minnesota is favored by about 3 points hey , this could be a good one , you say five minutes into the nightcap , it s gophers 2 , bruins 0 ugh  tom spousta the kansaswestern kentucky game , at least early , is looking a lot like thursday s gonzagasouthern 116 matchup as with southern , western kentucky is athletic , playing some junk defenses and is fearless going to the basket southern was able to hang close all game given that kansas basically is playing a home game in kansas city , it seems unlikely that western can do the same then again , if tourney neophyte florida gulf coast can beat georgetown , why can t western a midmajor blueblood do the same to kansas \?  mike huguenin depending on which forecast you trust , four to eight inches of snow are expected in kansas city from late saturday into sunday it shouldn t cripple the city but will make things messy for folks driving in for sunday s games , so dan gavitt , son of the late dave gavitt and the ncaa s vice president of men s basketball championships , issued this statement minutes ago we are monitoring the weather situation on the ground and in our tournament control center and are fully prepared we do not anticipate any game delays prior to the tournament , all venues submit emergency management plans to the ncaa national office for review during the tournament , ncaa onsite coordinators are in regular contact with facility management at every venue to manage any situation that may arise in kansas city , all of the teams and officials are already onsite we are exploring extending their hotel stays if their travel is delayed after the games because of inclement weather this region routinely has winter snow and has the appropriate equipment and procedures to manage these winter conditions we encourage fans planning to attend games to pay attention to the weather , use good judgment and follow any directions from local authorities regarding travel and weather i think i can sum this up in four words be smart carry on  pat borzi kansas looks a bit distracted in its 116 matchup with western kentucky the topseeded jayhawks lead by just two at the second tv timeout western is athletic but usually is a poor shooting team  mike huguenin if you re feeling a bit tired after a long day of watching the tourney , an easy way to wake up is to tune in to the iowa statenotre dame contest for some reason , notre dame thinks it is smart to again wear neongreen shoes and

couldn t handle the tar heels perimeter players the tar heels almost certainly will play kansas in the next round \( the topseeded jayhawks have western kentucky later tonight \) while heels coach roy williams \( who earned his 700th victory with the win \) has been gone from kansas for 10 seasons , there still almost assuredly would be a few tears shed by ol roy regardless of the outcome if the heela and jayhawks meet  mike huguenin the announcement of no 2 seed georgetown s demise was met with loud cheers here , mostly from no 3 forida fans the gators , like the hoyas , were put in the

minutes remaining , ohio state has as many assists as iona has field goals \( 20 \)  zach schonbrun going into the tourney , florida gulf coast was a nice , quirky little story the eagles are in just their second season of full division i eligibility and their coach , exnba assistant andy enfield , is married to a former model who graced the covers of magazine such as maxim and elle but come on a team that was swept by a 12win lipscomb team was going to hang with secondseeded georgetown \? yes , fgcu did beat miami , but it also lost 10 games well , the 15thseeded eagles who finished second in the atlantic sun in the regular season have pulled the shocker of the tourney , stunning the hoyas who won a share of the big east title with a 7868 decision in busting brackets everywhere , florida

is getting and hitting its shots , but florida is scoring easily inside because of its height advantage frankly , if gators center patric young had any offensive skills , florida would be up by 14 or

but it leads georgetown by 13 with 14 minutes left the eagles scuffled some early , but they are just as athletic as the hoyas and are playing extremely loose georgetown , meanwhile , lost as a no 3

and fundamentals in college basketball exhibit awhatever illinois 57 , colorado 49 good lord calling this game mediocre would be kind the illini shot 136 percent \( 3 of 22 \) in the second half the buffs shot 32 percent \( 9 of 28 \) illinois looked angry with itself as the final horn sounded , and aside from a few lowkey highfives , didn t really celebrate colorado just looked defeated still , when xavier johnson nailed a 3pointer from nba range with 169 seconds left to pull within 5549 , it seemed like the buffs had a chance survive and advance was never more true than this one  tom

field for the game  mike huguenin illinois leads colorado by four with 3 14 left , which means another close finish in a tourney that has had too few of those illinois offense has been brutal in the second half , but building a big firsthalf lead obviously has its advantages  mike huguenin it was an epic shooting slump so cold and astounding that it was hard to turn away illinois just went 11 minutes , 27 seconds without scoring a basket , going 0 for 15 in that stretch nothing that coach john groce scribbled on his board during timeouts worked and it s not like the buffs were playing lock down defense tracy abrams finally ended the drought with a lay up , but now colorado leads 4442 and now illinois can t miss , going on a minirun to take a 4844 lead with 5 58 to play ugly , but amazing welcome back to the tourney , buffs  tom spousta illinois just hit its first field goal of the second half with 8 32 left in the game the illini trail colorado by just three , though  mike

a 142 run and has cut iillinois lead to four at the first tv timeout of the half the buffs had good defensive numbers this season , but they sure played lousy defense in the first half , illinois hasn t hit a secondhalf field goal , and the buffs are feeding off that on the offensive end colorado enjoys an advantage in athleticism , and coach tad boyle obviously told his players to use that advantage at halftime  mike huguenin colorado has opened the second half with a 92 run against seventhseeded illinois and has cut the lead to nine the buffs have hit some 3pointers to get back into it now they have to get more physical on defense to stay in it  mike huguenin victor oladipo , a candidate for national player of the year , has been quiet here against james madison , with only 6 field goal attempts in the first 30 minutes of the game he has been more of a facilitator , while yogi ferrell \( 14 points \) , cody zeller \( 11 points \) , jordan hulls and will sheehey \( 8 points each

each won by more than 40 on thursday miami won by 29 earlier today and louisville by 31 thursday night  mike huguenin la salle s upset of fourthseeded kansas state means that for the third tournament in a row , there will be a 1213 matchup in the round of 32 la salle plays 12thseeded ole miss on sunday in addition , although there was no 1213 matchup in the 2010 tourney , sunday s game will be the sixth 1213 contest in the past six tourneys there were two in 2008 the bad news for la salle \( which already has won two games in this tourney , as it downed boise state in a playin game \) is that the no 12 seed is 41 against the no 13 but that 13 win came last season , when ohio downed usf as for ole miss , the rebels were the third no 12 seed to win in this tourney but don t necessarily think the no 12s are cinderella stories each is a powerconference school \( ole miss is from the sec , and the other two no 12s to win cal and oregon are from the pac12 \)  mike huguenin it s illinois 3721 at halftime , and the buffs are on the verge of getting blown out for one simple reason guard play , the axiom for greatness in march the illini start three guards dj richardson , brandon paul and tracy abrams and they controlled every aspect of the first half they combined for 27 points on 9 of 19 shooting colorado s backcourt of askia booker and spencer dinwiddie totaled just 8 points , going 2 of 9 well , somebody from the pac12 eventually had to lose , and it looks like the buffs are it  tom spousta yogi ferrell followed up his hot start with a complete first half performance 14 points , 7 rebounds and 3 assists the rest of the scoring was quite balanced and the hoosiers are looking every bit a number one seed i m already getting anxious for a potential indianasyracuse showdown in the sweet 16 indiana is a better team with better psychological and emotional balance , but if syracuse can properly orchestrate for one game , things could get very interesting much like yesterday , this tournament has thus far proven that only oneseeds and twoseeds are sacred everyone else is up for sacrifice , and game after game has shown seeding to be utterly inconsequential my bracket hasn t been this ugly since i was ten , and that s only because i used crayons and glue that time there are so many good games still to be played today but i m already starting to fantasize about some of the weekend matchups michiganvcu , butlermarquette , and dukecreighton have already started to wrinkle my brain with that being said , minnesotaucla and north carolinavillanova should provide enough action to keep me placated until then  zach hillesland just had to share this after listening to pacific coach bob thomason following his team s blowout loss to miami thomason is retiring after 25 years as coach of his alma mater , and his postgame comments were among the classiest i ve ever heard , any sport after saying he had never been to austin before , and thanking everybody for their hospitality , he continued i d like to thank and congratulate miami on advancing great team , great pieces , they played tremendous , shot the ball well , rebounded the ball well , played good defense and i ll be rooting for them the rest of the time so maybe they can win a national championship if i had to go out in coaching , you want to go out to a great team , but also to a great coach and a class coach , and jim larranaga is that  tom spousta they went back and forth in the final minute , but creighton made enough free throws and cincinnati s sean kilpatrick had a potentially beautiful prayer go unanswered , and the bluejays were able to hang on and advance mcdermott finished the day with 27 points and 11 rebounds , and creighton heads off to the next round to play duke i can t wait to watch that one i wonder how much time plumlee will spend on mcdermott and vice versa in another down to the wire finish , lasalle was able to hang on and win after they blew an 18point lead in the second half kansas state s bruce weber looked like he was absolutely on fire on the inside as he was walking through the handshake line that one will undoubtedly be a tough one to swallow the wildcats hurt the most , my bracket next most  zach hillesland it s on in austin clearly , these two teams don t like each other c mon big ten an illinois fan shouted just before tipoff and when an illini player went to the foul line , colorado fans countered with this clever chant quiet ! he s shooting a free throw ! quiet ! he s shooting a free throw ! and it s only illinois 16 , colorado 15 eight minutes into the game the frank erwin center here suddenly has the atmosphere of a college basketball game loud , proud , packed and the crowd obviously very aware that , so far , the pac12 has fared better than the big ten  tom spousta kansas state decided to play the second half of the kansas state game they ve followed a pitiful first half with a spirited second and have claimed the lead in the final quarter of this one they ve cut down their turnovers , improved their shooting as well as their second chance opportunities this was the game that was officially bumming me out the most in terms of my bracket choices , but the wildcats have made this once extremely lopsided affair a true contest  zach hillesland shaquille thomas is having himself quite the highlight party shaking guys out of their socks , jumping out of his own for a guy who only averages 28 points a game , and therefore theoretically less than or equal to only one highlight per game , shaq t is really having a blast his boost has been absolutely necessary , as the bearcats would be dead in the water without his efforts today but so far , it s still been too much mcdermott for cincinnati to handle mcdermott is so good at using efficient moves to combat any lack of athleticism or size he has down low he s proving he s a master of angles and timing , and both have played a huge part in his 23point tally \( so far \) today  zach hillesland indiana s yogi ferrell opened the game on a personal 90 run , exceeding his season average in just under four minutes these are the kinds of sparks no 1 seeds need throughout the tournament you ve been scouted relentlessly \( hopefully \) and there s a lot of pressure , and play like that from ferrell goes a long way to both sparking a top team and easing them into the rhythms of the game it also makes the other team think that their scouting report either isn t up to par or that they aren t  zach hillesland shane larkin clearly is the floor general of these talented and veteran hurricanes but my new favorite guard at least until someone shuts him down is his backcourt mate , durand scott , a senior from the bronx especially after reading the following quick hits in his media bio heart and soul of the miami hurricanes with a junkyard dog game uplifting personality makes him popular on campus and with campers slasher to the rim and for short floaters exactly scott adds the spice and flamboyance that makes these two arguably the best guard tandem in the tourney he drilled three consecutive 3 pointers in the second half , and after his third one dropped , he shrugged and smiled , then formed two circles around his eyes like he had just donned sharpshooting glasses scott finished with 21 points on 6 of 10 shooting \( 5 of 8 from 3point range \) with 3 rebounds larkin had 10 points , 3 rebounds and 9 assists combined , they made all 9 of their free throws can t wait till they meet indiana in the east regional final  tom spousta kansas state had an abysmal first half against the no 13 lasalle explorers sub40 percent from the field , seven turnovers , six allowed made threepointers one of many recipes for an 18point deficit most of these midseed higher seed games have seemed completely flipflopped in terms of team psychology the little guys are acting like big dogs , the bigger guys like house cats you really had to do your homework to get your bracket bulletproofed this year  zach hillesland doug mcdermott is adjusting nicely to the pace and physicality changes that cincinnati has offered he s looked a little offbalance at times , but for the most part has kept his bearings , confidence , and nose for the rim mcdermott has 17 points and 7 rebounds and there s still more than 15 minutes to play coaches kids are always tough and mcdermott no exception he s been demanding the ball , and this is just another game in need of winning to him doesn t matter that it s the tournament , you just get the feeling that he wants to win every game regardless of circumstance  zach hillesland nc state threatened in the last stanza , the refs made several horrible calls affecting both sides , teams traded free throws , but temple was able to hang on in a very strange and painfully slow final 30 seconds temple s khalif wyatt finished the game with 29 points , including a pair of late free throws as part of a 1012 showing at the stripe nc state won the battle in nearly every statistical category , except for trips to the line and number or turnovers , two very important stat groups this time of year  zach hillesland the cincinnati uniforms have a real credits from saved by the bell kind of appeal ncaa marchhuhness  linda holmes \( nprmonkeysee \) 22 mar 13 cincinnati s titus rubles \( another fantastic name \) is extremely busy putting on a big east rebounding lesson for the creighton bluejays rubles has been all over the offensive boards , being extremely physical and active down low on one particular play , he ripped two offensive boards from creighton grasps and looked demonstrative doing so i always thought that the big east let their players play more physically on the boards , and so far the refs have let them play today  zach hillesland i ve had my eyebrows raised for the last two minutes , and it s because of a play just executed by creighton big man gregory echenique first , he s wearing pink shoes , which i think is another strong move in terms of taunting and player psychology second , he s wearing corrective goggles , which is an honest admission of ocular deficiency third , he just performed a dropstep , lefthanded thunder smash in traffic it s not a play you see much in college , and not even that much in the professional ranks either the best example ever of this is undoubtedly hakim warrick s college dunk several years ago against notre dame it is to this day still the most impressive feat of basketball athleticism and length that i have ever seen echenique made me think for a second i can t possibly be watching creighton , but it just goes to show how much ability and potential and skill exists at some of these smaller programs and we re not even talking about doug mcdermott creighton winning in a close one  zach hillesland all eyes are on creighton s doug mcdermott here in philadelphia , and for good reason he enters the game with the country s most impressive stat line 231 points per game on 561 percent shooting , including 497 percent from 3point range , and 75 rebounds he has displayed his scoring prowess against cincinnati with a pair of nifty moves around the basket but the blue jays have gotten a lift from an unexpected source in the early going ethan wragge , a 67 forward , has come off the bench to drill a pair of long 3pointers to keep cincinnati s aggressive defense at bay wragge is a capable scorer he had 15 against wichita state in the missouri valley conference tournament final creighton leads , 1412 , midway through the first half  scott cacciola temple has done a good job of keeping nc state at bay i also just realized that i don t know what it means to keep something at bay i know what it means , but what did it originally mean \? who was the first person to keep something at bay \? is that a naval reference \? google time it s that last , howling dog , sense of bay that gave us at bay when bay first appeared in this sense in english around 1300 , it meant the chorus of howling barks of a pack of hunting hounds in hot pursuit of their prey \( this bay as howling bark also is used in the phrase baying at the moon , which some dogs lacking access to television are known to do \) \( some random internet forum , circa 2011 \) ok so all i learned is that i m a dog that has access to television meanwhile temple continues to keep nc state at arm s length \( this one makes sense \) with less than eight to go , nc state is going to have to string together a couple of defensive stops and get back into transition or start getting hot from deep  zach hillesland miami is up , 4019 , at halftime no worry about a letdown against a lesser foe here the canes look as focused as when they cut down the acc tournament nets they pounded pacific with an array of lobs for dunks and layins nine players have scored , led by shane larkin s 10 points and 5 assists \( dad barry and family are here , sitting behind the miami bench \) it s already ugly , and not just because pacific fans are riding the refs with ridiculous comments \( not to be shared here \) tigers shot 29 percent and were 0 for 9 during one stretch  tom spousta i always love seeing bigtime scorers from smalltime schools go up against teams from power conferences , and that s exactly what we re blessed with in the cincinnaticreighton game doug mcdermott averages just under 24 points per game and scores in a variety of ways so it s not quite a david vs goliath setup but it s somewhat akin to that he hasn t touched the ball much early on , but when he has he has made strong and convincing moves and attacks his first basket was created by a strong drive down the heart of cincinnati s defense , capped with an acrobatic finish , something i didn t know mcdermott had in his arsenal  zach hillesland nc state is having an uptick in vital signs for the first time this afternoon for most of this game , temple has been absolutely slapping the wolfpack around , but thanks to an increase in tempo , nc state has been able to get out into transition and use its athleticism a 16point halftime lead has been cut in half in less than seven minutes that s exactly the kind of start nc state needed to give itself a fighting chance time for temple to respond , or risk suffering another body blow from the wolfpack  zach hillesland miami looks absolutely terrific so far against pacific the hurricanes are playing with energy , poise and just the right amount of flash it s the kind of flash that isn t gratuitous in any way , but instead displays all the different ways in which they can attack and dissect a defense shane larkin has been doing it all 7 points , 5 assists , 3 steals and 2 rebounds just for good measure i have these guys in the title game , and so far i m pleased with what i m seeing  zach hillesland wisconsin ended up being no match for hendersonled ole miss the badgers couldn t muster any offense down the stretch , and the ole miss sharpshooter came to life just in time to make this a relatively easy win down the stretch henderson is a very dangerous player in a tournament like this as we saw on day 1 , shooting comes at a premium for a lot of these teams different arenas , different shooting backgrounds , different balls and nerves all play roles but henderson is a shooter through and through he s going to keep shooting until he misplaces his right hand , and even if he does that he ll probably keep shooting president obama s 2013 ncaa women s basketball tournament bracket last year , president

who transferred from boston university last summer , carried the owls in the first half against nc state , with 13 points \( 3 of 5 from 3point range \) and 4 rebounds the students serenaded him with jake o buckets heading into the locker room at halftime , and , as a 6foot9 forward who can pull out and shoot it , he has been problematic for nc state so far the ninthseeded owls lead , 3822 , at halftime  zach schonbrun ole miss is going to win this game unless wisconsin can find its own 3point maestro ole miss has been methodically scoring , hitting free throws and benefiting from an improved marshall henderson henderson has shot himself out of his firsthalf slump , and now it s almost as if it never happened certainly doesn t look like he remembers with just over a minute to go , wisconsin is in serious trouble , down by 7  zach hillesland this one is going to go down to the final ticks it seems , ole miss clinging to a 4point lead with just over three minutes to go wisconsin has done a good job of making this as ugly a game as it usually plays , and it s going to come down to which team can generate enough offense down the stretch ole miss knows where to get its offense , wisconsin seems to be searching a bit  zach hillesland here we go from austin , where beware of meat sweats should be listed on the menu at stubbs barbq the university of the pacific tigers mascot just saluted me and gave a highfive and a couple of cheerleaders said , hi , go tigers ! miami and pacific seem to have an equal number of fans here should the no 15seed tigers threaten in any way , you can bet the neutral observers will jump behind the underdog it s one of the cool things about these early round games  tom spousta save for a comeback of truly epic proportions , it looks like duke will indeed advance it wasn t exactly comfortable , but it wasn t all that uncomfortable either a very mature and wellexecuted game plan by the blue devils never really had this one in doubt , and albany put up a respectable fight in the end , just too much talent from the likes of curry and plumlee for albany to handle on his 635th shot of the game , the real marshall henderson finally stood up it took two shots on the possession , but the second one was as true as can be , and it has henderson fired up , and has led to a quick little ole miss run that has them out in front ole miss has switched to mantoman and has the badgers completely out of sync this game is definitely trending the way of ole miss if henderson even hits one more three in the next stretch , watch out could be another fiveseed dropping early from the tournament  zach hillesland my 5 12 s and 8 9 s have been absolutely slaughtering my bracket , temple being the latest bracket monster they re smacking nc state around , shooting a hot 13of19 from the field , including 4of6 from 3point range nc state looks out of sync on the offensive end and could use some kind of leadership to draw their focus back to the task at hand  zach hillesland the badgers still quite haven t figured out how to attack ole miss 23 zone , and marshall henderson still hasn t quite figured out how to shoot in this building i have the feeling that whichever problem is solved first might be the definitive swing in this game henderson is getting good looks , but has drawn back iron on several of his shots wisconsin still hasn t found a way to consistently get inside against the zone , but have been able to get some points in transition they need to get the ball into the high post and work from there , instead of relying on crosscourt skip passes to relieve pressure  zach hillesland ah , march madness or as the northwestern basketball fan knows it , march  seth meyers \( sethmeyers21 \) 21 mar 13 backtoback airballs by traevon jackson of the badgers , the son of exnbaer jim jackson the last time i saw somebody do that , i think it was me  pat borzi albany coach will brown had plenty of reasons to be concerned about his team s openinground matchup there was duke s history , and duke s size , and duke s talent the list went on , but he cited one factor that weighed on him in particular the revenge factor last season , as a no 2 seed , duke fell to no 15 lehigh in one of the tournament s most improbable upsets ever before friday s game here brown said he wished that had not happened lehigh didn t do us any favors , that s for sure , brown said duke , once again a no 2 seed , looked prepared this time around the blue devils are up , 5036 , as things are edging toward the danger zone for the great danes and their yellow sneakers duke s seth curry , a handful on the perimeter , has 17 points  scott cacciola a quickerpaced start to this second half has benefited the more efficient blue devils albany has hit some difficult shots to keep this one respectable , but we re getting into that territory where you feel like it s just a matter of time until duke completely blows this one open seth curry has continued his hot shooting , and overall the duke team appears to be playing with a sizable amount of confidence and swagger nolook passes from big guys , from point guards , all good and necessary meanwhile , albany seems to be running out of steam while duke is just picking it up  zach hillesland a badass move for harvard would be to just drop out the ncaa tournament voluntarily that s what bill gates would do  mike birbiglia \( birbigs \) 22 mar 13 marshall henderson wrapped up a miserable first half for ole miss 1for11 from the field and 04 beyond the arc for two points twice late in the half , sam dekker buried 3pointers for wisconsin after henderson misfired on the previous possession but ole miss only trails 2522 and badgers fans beware the rebels are a secondhalf team  pat borzi albany certainly isn t laying down in this one , but it doesn t really seem like duke has been disturbed by anything it has seen the blue devils have been very even keel and businesslike throughout the first half , and while they certainly haven t jumped out to quite the lead they were going for , they re still very much in control  zach hillesland well , this is getting interesting albany s jacob iati just nailed a 3pointer in transition to cut duke s lead to 3123 with about two minutes left in the first half coach k not happy , calls timeout if the iati name sounds familiar , there s a reason in 2006 , iati s older brother was part of the albany team that nearly upended heavily favored connecticut in the first round of the tournament , right here in this very same building \( back then , it was the wachovia center \) the great danes are clearly hoping for some similar iati magic this time around  scott cacciola the 23 zone of ole miss is giving wisconsin all sorts of fits the badgers haven t been able to penetrate the gaps , and have had to settle for poor outside looks they were able to get an offensive board on one possession \( one of the weaknesses of a zone \) but will have to either shoot ole miss out of it , or find a way to attack those gaps and find some penetration  zach hillesland albany hanging around , hanging around one thing that seems clear in the early rounds of the tournament this year \( with a handful of notable exceptions , like montana \) is that 15 and 16 seeds simply are not intimidated by the atmosphere or by their opponents that was not always the case , of course call it parity , or diluted talent at college basketball s top ranks few teams are pushovers in the ncaa tournament that said , one of the major issues for albany is size duke , which leads 2416 , is 9 of 12 from the field the blue devils are getting too many easy shots , while albany has to fight for every single open look at the other end all that hard work could have a cumulative effect albany doesn t have tremendous depth  scott cacciola mostly cheers , some boos , for polarizing ole miss guard marshall henderson in introductions the sprint center in kansas city , mo , is about a third full , with probably as many kansas fans as those from wisconsin \( the jayhawks play friday night \) henderson then misses his first two shots , a 3pointer and a driving layup off a fast break  pat borzi well , this was my 512 upset pick , and looking at how things went thursday , it will probably prove to be an idiotic choice , unless this is the year where all no 5 seeds lose in the first round not a great start for ole miss forced shots and a lack of flow have defined their offensive attack and it s making them look unprepared for this methodical wisconsin team  zach hillesland seth curry looks a lot more like dell , but still shoots as well as his brother he has a quick 9 points in this one , all on jumpers , and he has looked incredibly smooth doing so i ve often wondered how the dna pedigree plays a role in the drafting of players you ve seen several sibling pairs in the nba over the years , and it seems to be increasing i wonder if general managers are more likely to take a risk on a player because he has a proven sibling i think the answer has to be yes i needed a brother  zach hillesland give the albany great danes , with their matching mustardyellow sneakers , a lot of credit in the early going here at wells fargo center you might have heard about duke s recent tournament history does lehigh ring a bell \? and the blue devils seemed determined to obliterate albany after the opening tip by trapping in the half court and getting the ball inside to mason plumlee , duke s national player of the year candidate but albany has hung around at least for fourplus minutes a 3pointer from peter hooley , one of three australians on albany s roster , cut duke s lead to 85 heading into the first media timeout word of the day so far \? scrappy not certain how long this team can keep it up , though duke has too much size and experience  scott cacciola there needs to be a steeper penalty for flopping the block charge annoys me enough as it is , but when i see someone taller than six feet flopping , i want to put a sword through my television the only thing making this ok is that i have yet to acquire a sword but it s one of my least favorite things about watching duke and it s how i know i would never draft certain players if you re a big man , don t flop have some selfrespect play defense stop begging for mercy your ancestors are embarrassed  zach hillesland is there an ncaa mandate that all low seeds have to wear ugly jerseys \? two days in a row now , i ve had to watch littleknown teams dressed as easter eggs , and while it is putting me in the mood for candy , it is stressing my eyes and sensibilities  zach hillesland i love how duke and coach k have decided to start this game they re going with intense defensive pressure and overall high energy i think that s one of the best things you can do as a highly seeded team i think there s a tendency sometimes for teams to try to act too cool for school , and by doing so instill confidence in the underdogs and let them hang around i thought that was part of gonzaga s problem thursday they were almost too polite no 1s aren t supposed to be polite they need to be mean duke is trying good for them  zach hillesland
malibu , calif the battle between malibu beachfront homeowners and a less privileged public that wants to share the stunning coastline has been fought with padlocks , gates , menacing signs , security guards , lawsuits and bulldozers there seems little question who is winning 20 of the 27 miles of are inaccessible to the public yet this month , the homeowners including some of the wealthiest and most famous people in the country , but also a hearty colony of surfers , stoners and oldfashioned beach lovers are confronting what may be the biggest threat to their privacy yet the smartphone jenny price , an environmental writer who has pressed the battle to open hidden beaches , has developed offering a beachbybeach battle plan for anyone wishing to explore what are , by design , some of the most secluded beaches around it has maps to often hidden entry gates , housebyhouse descriptions showing public property boundaries and spinestiffening advice on dealing with counterfeit noparking signs \( feel free to enjoy and then ignore \) and threatening property owners \( they 're welcome to call the sheriff \) in a is stirring questions of land use , property rights and privilege that have long been a source of tension in southern california , a fight made all the more alluring because long stretches of beachfront are owned by wellknown hollywood figures , including , and  by state law , california beaches are public property , though the dividing line between private property and public beach is as changeable as the hightide mark and the easements a homeowner is granted for development rights and the beachfront homes in malibu tend to be crammed together , making it impossible to catch even a glimpse of long stretches of the beach , much less walk onto it i sort of see this as one of the most egregious problems we have with public space in a region that s plagued with problems with public space , ms price said as she walked along carbon beach , lined with glistening estates , the only sign of life being the clipclipclip of the occasional landscaper later , strolling along malibu road beach as the sun cracked through the morning marine layer , ms price stopped in front of a house that had seven variations of a no trespassing sign you need to stand behind the tide line , she said last time we were here , the owner called the sheriff the release of the has set off waves of anxiety among homeowners here , fearful that a hightech weapon in a longfought war will open the gates on what has been a largely secret world the despair cuts across demographic lines malibu is a more complicated place than is commonly portrayed , a mixture of the very wealthy and people who bought relatively modest homes and cabins here a generation ago and hung on there are plenty of places that have bathrooms , lifeguards , parking , said wendy ledner , who grew up on malibu road beach there are none of those facilities at these beaches people come through , they urinate , defecate , they leave their garbage there are no garbage pails they ca n't park there is no parking , so they block driveways arnold g york , the publisher of the malibu times , said the uproar was feeding longheld and incorrect stereotypes about the community one of the things that makes for a wonderful story is how malibu is elitist and we do n't want anyone here , he said the reality is we get 15 million people coming out each year to the beaches the biggest problem is not access but parking he said he understood the concern of homeowners that these remote and often small beaches , some with rough surf and jagged rock formations , were not made to accommodate large influxes of sunseekers a drive through malibu testifies to the utility of such a guide although there are some parking spaces , particularly along the pacific coast highway , there are not many , and beachgoers have to compete with homeowners and people who work on the estates and wily homeowners drop orange cones on the street or build fake garage doors to block off what are , in fact , legal parking spots one beach access gate was mostly obscured by hedges planted by property owners the gates are often weighted down with all kinds of signs , some legitimate , some not right to pass by permission and subject to control of owner , a sign at lechuza beach , fell in the latter category there are 17 public access ways to the malibu coastline under state law , there should be more than 100 the last time one was opened was in 2005 there is a lot of resistance to opening new access ways there are 15 additional easements that have yet to be opened , said linda locklin , who leads the coastal access program for the our record is frankly not so good it takes us forever to open them much of the information in the malibu beach app has been available to the public , but in the form of bulky , 300page regional coastal guides , which cost 25 apiece ms locklin called the app a big deal that would greatly advance the commission s goal of making these beaches more accessible it is easier to use than the books and , at least for now , free \( an android version of the app is expected to be released in the fall and cost 199 \) this tug of war has always had overtones of class warfare one of the beaches is known as billionaires' beach , and ms price has named the access way to that beach hurray for hollywood still , she said she resisted any attempt to frame the battle along those lines , even as she stood in front of the home of mr geffen , who at first fought the coastal commission when it tried to open a public walkway by his home even geffen , despite his fake garages , he s been a decent neighbor , and i do n't call him out , ms price said it s not about who lives down here it s not a takedownthebillionaires project this is not a political statement people are constantly asking us , can you show us pierce brosnan s house \? ' yeah but no ms price cast her arm across billionaires' beach this is one of the premier beaches , and look how many people have come , she said , pointing to a largely empty swatch of beach the hordes have not descended

new delhi after crossing the finish line at the indian grand prix on sunday , sebastian vettel yelled into his car radio , yes ! yes ! then , disobeying his engineer s request to return to the pits , he drove to the middle of the track in front of a grandstand containing thousands of cheering indian fans , and spun his car in series of smoking donuts he climbed out , walked to the front of the car , got down on his hands and knees and did several bows of appreciation vettel had not only driven another perfect race in his red bull to win the indian grand prix and take his sixth victory in a row this season and his third victory in a row in india most important , he had just won his fourth world drivers' title in a row he may have been left speechless , but his team director , christian horner , had put it into words over the radio moments before you 've done it in style , sebastian you are a fourtime world champion you have joined the greats the german driver , 26 , had just become only the fourth driver in history to win four drivers' titles , after juan manuel fangio , alain prost and michael schumacher none of his predecessors has done it so young , with prost having not yet even won his first grand prix by the same age it was the 36th victory of vettel s career his teammate , mark webber , dropped out of the race with an alternator problem on lap 40 , but the 25 points that vettel earned for the victory , were enough to hand their red bull team its fourth constructors' title in a row as well vettel finished an astonishing 298 seconds ahead of nico rosberg in second in a mercedes romain grosjean finished third in a lotus , 10 seconds farther back in a long press conference after the race , vettel , who was also the youngest world champion , double world champion and triple world champion , looked emotionally overwhelmed , and said repeatedly that he had no idea how to put the series of titles and achievements into perspective i am overwhelmed , i do n't know what to say , he said i think it is one of the best days of my life so far when i was small , formula one was always so far away , and to race against these drivers was so far away i might be 60 some day and then understand , he added it is difficult to realize something that no one can take away from you before the race , there had been only one other driver capable of preventing vettel from taking the title fernando alonso , of ferrari but for that to happen , alonso had to finish first or second if vettel , however , finished in the top five , he would take the title in a desperate bid to overcome his slower car s faults , alonso s ferrari team decided to try a different tire strategy to that of vettel the german had started on the softer , faster , but more easily wearing tires , while alonso s ferrari was equipped with the harder , slightly slower but longer lasting medium tires the idea was that alonso , who qualified only eighth , would stay out longer and make up positions , while vettel did his pit stop earlier in the race but alonso s chances were all but gone when on the first lap he made contact with webber s car and damaged his front wing , and steering , and had to make a pit stop after one lap he never regained position , finishing the race in 11th place and failing to score points for only the second time this season with three races left , vettel has a 115point lead on alonso , and only a maximum of 75 points remain to be earned i was a bit unlucky because i think mark was also having contact with someone and the third part of that equation was me , alonso said of webber , adding that he had lost time in a battle with the mclaren of jenson button as well the race was uphill from that moment webber had tried the same tire strategy as alonso , and after starting fourth on the grid , and then dropping to seventh on the first lap , he led the race from lap 9 to lap 28 vettel made a pit stop after only one lap and dropped down to 16th position , and it looked like his race might be compromised as well but he scythed his way up the pack and was in second position by lap 21 when webber made his first pit stop after lap 28 , vettel took the lead again , while alonso was still only in 12th position vettel then made another pit stop after lap 31 , and returned in second position webber then made another pit stop , handing the lead back to vettel , and then dropping out of the race after lap 40 although vettel had been booed at several races this year some fans , praise came in from the other ferrari driver , felipe massa , who finished the race in fourth position today , he signed his name as one of the best formula one drivers in history together with senna , together with schumacher , together with other drivers who are all the time at the top , said massa martin whitmarsh , the director of the mclaren mercedes team also praised the competing driver he once again drove faultlessly to put the title beyond the reach of his closest rival , whitmarsh said to win four world titles particularly four in a row is incredibly impressive stuff having put his fourth title behind him , and now winning six victories in a row this season , vettel is aiming to equal the record of alberto ascari of nine consecutive victories , set between the two seasons of 1952 and 1953 schumacher is second in the record books with seven consecutive victories , in 2004 when asked about all of his achievements , vettel again looked overwhelmed if you try to write a story like that , you ca n't you ca n't be creative enough basking in the euphoria of his fourth straight formula one world championship title , sebastian vettel of red bull moved toward making peace with fans from other teams who have booed his victories at several races , the associated press reported from greater noida , india vettel , who claimed his fourth title after winning the indian grand prix on sunday , has been greeted by booing during his podium appearances in italy , singapore and other races by fans who appear not to appreciate the clinical manner in which he wins them it hurts not to get the reception you expect , but i'm clever enough to know why they do it , vettel said i'm not blaming them the german remains more concerned with getting the respect of his f1 rivals i think the most important thing for me is to get the respect of the people i know and race against , and i feel respected among the drivers , he said you have to fight for getting that respect when you come into f1 on the podium sunday , nico rosberg and romain grosjean hoisted vettel on their shoulders as for the less appreciative crowds , vettel says he understands their emotions i do n't blame the people that booed if i go to a football stadium i cheer for the home team , he said maybe if i was a fan of mclaren , ferrari , one of the traditional teams , i would n't like it if the same guy and the same team wins again and again vettel s postvictory celebrations on sunday led to a reprimand by formula one s governing body along with a fine , reuters reported from greater noida he was summoned by the stewards for ignoring postrace procedures and performing crowdpleasing doughnuts with the car spinning in a circle of tire smoke at the end of the pit straight vettel then climbed out , bowed down in front of the car and clambered up a wire fence to throw his driving gloves to spectators the stewards noted in a statement that he had failed to proceed directly from the circuit to postrace parc ferm without unnecessary delay in a breach of the sporting regulations parc ferm refers to a secure area due to special circumstance the stewards accepted the explanation of the driver , the statement added red bull , which also celebrated its fourth successive constructors' title , was fined 25 , 000 , or 34 , 500
be careful what you wish for the closed hearings into the political activities of a conservative group in austin are slowly coming into the open that obliterates the excuse for not going the notion that a secret hearing is a horrible thing and that we would otherwise line up to watch the truly fascinating inner workings of government actually , we sometimes would a formal hearing about the alleged lobbying activities of empower texans could clear up some questions , like whether someone who talks to legislators and gets paid for it should have to register and pay fees as a result to pose it the other way should the state allow anyone to pay lobbyists without revealing who the lobbyists are and who is paying them for their work \? groping around in the dark did not work on this one , and what had been a semiprivate matter arguably for defensible reasons is probably headed for a public hearing a related question about the group s electioneering , and whether a group of individual donors can legally hide their support behind a corporate veil , is still pending in private at least this one will be open the closed proceeding over a political gadfly s influence on lawmakers and whether it constitutes illegally unreported lobbying or not is on its way to open hearings that could set a precedent a couple of lawmakers complained about the group and its leader , michael quinn sullivan , contending that because of his legislative activities \( and his previous registrations as a lobbyist \) , he should again register as a lobbyist they also complained that he should be required to report details of his political work as you might guess , the complaints were from people who found themselves or their allies targeted by mr sullivan s efforts they made their complaints , which otherwise would have been secret , public the texas ethics commission called preliminary hearings on the allegations , informing the parties but not the public the idea was to let the commission decide whether something suspicious has been going on before someone s name was attached to a complaint mr sullivan and his lawyers , however , let the world know that the hearings were going on and tried to get the commission to open them so that the public could hear their side of the argument that did not happen , but the next step was interesting the ethics commission suggested a settlement on the lobbying question mr sullivan would admit no wrongdoing , pay a 1 , 000 fine , register as a lobbyist and pay the fees for 2010 and 2011 the reason we know that is because he wrote nuts on the settlement offer and sent it back to the commission , copying reporters and other interested parties as a procedural matter , that response sends it back to the commission , which will either drop things here do n't bet on it or call a full public hearing to air the question the next step from there , if there is one , would be in district court , where it would all start over again the terms might be different , too the darkmoney question whether the donors to empower texans should be revealed is still pending , and the commission has not proposed a settlement or reached any conclusions , at least none that it has shown to empower texans or the public this has all the appearance of two political dogs snarling over a bone , but there s more to it empower texans and its affiliates believe the law lets them talk to lawmakers without registering as lobbyists and registering as a lobbyist includes saying who the clients are and what they 're paying they also contend that the law allows corporations to take part in elections and that nonprofit corporations like theirs are not compelled to reveal the names of donors just because they are exercising their political rights if those arguments prevailed , it would remake the advocacy business , both at the legislative and electoral levels it would be easier to take an unpopular stand on a public issue without fear of reprisal if the complainers prevailed , those who dabbled in politics and lobbying would have to show their hands at least some of the time it would be easier for the little red riding hoods out there the public to see when the big bad wolf was posing as granny whoever wins , it will be a public fight
i love tennis and travel balancing those two addictions during the year s four tennis majors is never easy last june , before visiting the greek island samos , i emailed the manager of our hotel to confirm it would have a channel broadcasting the french open i was told , we have more than 500 channels , surely one will have what you were looking for alas , he was wrong , and i resolved to never again leave the country during a major but then an opportunity surfaced to visit spain during the middle of this year s united states open i rationalized that spain , with its topranked tennis players , would surely be an easy place to follow the tournament after all , spain had a whopping 13 players , six of them seeded , in the men s draw but after a week in catalonia and basque region \( which some would argue are not spanish at all , but that s a topic for another time \) i have concluded that spain is not as tennis crazy as i had hoped hotels i stayed at in barcelona and san sebasti n had dozens of channels , but none offered even a glimpse of the open i ve ambled into a lot of bars with tvs in both places , but when i ask them to switch from soccer or whatever else is on to tennis , i ve gotten nothing but strange looks at one establishment , i sat at a table next to a guy from majorca who was visiting his girlfriend in barcelona i thought we might be able to find common cause in rafael nadal , but even he had no interest in the tournament print publications in spain also appear to be providing scant coverage of the open for example , on thursday , i checked five daily newspapers at a tapas bar in the basque town hondarribia , and only el pa s , which carried a 600word piece on tommy robredo s upset of roger federer , had more than a couple of paragraphs on the tournament gara , a basque paper , devoted four sentences to the open gipuzkoa gave it two paragraphs , el diario vasco three a newspaper called berria gave it all of three sentences in between reports on soccer , cycling , whale boat racing and jai alai \( the basques have their own sports they are fond of , including stone lifting , wood chopping , whale boat racing , pelota and so on \) perhaps these two regions of spain aren t reflective of the country as a whole , and the time difference makes it tricky for european networks and newspapers to cover the open i have tried to find legal streams on the internet , with no luck my assumption that spain would be an acceptable place to ride out the open was dead wrong when it comes to tennis , we may not have that many great american players to root for , but there is no place like home
we may never see worse clockrelated decisionmaking by two teams than we witnessed late sunday afternoon at lambeau field with the game tied at 3131 and just over a minute and a half remaining , the steelers were given a new set of downs inside the packers' 10yardline after outside linebacker nick perry jumped offside on a fourthand3 fieldgoal attempt the packers had just one timeout remaining , so all the steelers had to do was kneel the ball three times and kick a chipshot winner instead , steelers coach mike tomlin and the offensive coordinator todd haley the packers , who should have yielded the touchdown to give their offense time for a comeback , foolishly played aggressive defense , tackling le 'veon bell at the one packers coach mike mccarthy then called a timeout on the next play , the steelers again handed it off this time , the packers let them score which raises the question also , why did n't the steelers kneel on the second play \? fittingly , the packers rookie micah hyde returned the ensuing kickoff 70 yards , matt flynn completed two quick passes and the packers wound up inside the steelers' 10 with a chance to tie the game in the final seconds a false start by right tackle don barclay helped stymie the drive and preserve a steelers victory but the game should never have reached that point next time , tomlin will \( hopefully \) just kneel the ball to set up a field goal as time expires the lions lost for the fifth time in six weeks , and coach jim schwartz almost certainly lost his job \( expect it to be official by this time next week \) schwartz has had a solid run he inherited the lions after they went 016 and led them to the playoffs in his third year but it s clear that schwartz s club , which went 412 last season , is not fulfilling the promise of its talent when this job opens up , it might be the most attractive of the nfl s 2014 offseason detroit is not a prosperous city these days , but the lions are a prosperous enough franchise with a relatively new stadium and passionate fans they 're well stocked at key positions on both sides of the ball and they have a patient owner in william clay ford do n't be shocked that the cardinals handed the seahawks their first loss at qwest field since christmas eve 2011 in terms of weektoweek schemes , bruce arians and the defensive coordinator todd bowles are running in the nfl we saw that sunday , particularly with arizona s defense , which came in ranked first against the rush and held seattle s topranked ground game to 103 yards the cardinals also used their variety of designer blitzes to befuddle the seahawks' passing attack russell wilson completed only 11 of 27 attempts and was sacked four times the chargers have won three straight to give themselves at least a respectable crack at the postseason entering week 17 \( they need a win and losses by the ravens and the dolphins \) they 've done it on the ground , where ryan mathews has looked like the back the previous front office and coaching staff thought it was getting when they traded up to draft the smooth fresno state star 12th over all in 2010 mathews , who has had durability problems throughout his career , has been a steady chainsmover the past three weeks he carried the ball 25 times for 99 yards and a touchdown against oakland at denver in week 15 on a thursday night , he ran 29 times for 127 yards and a score the week before that , in a win over the giants , mathews went for 103 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries joe flacco s knee injury was not dire enough to prevent him from playing , but he was clearly not his usual self at 6 feet 6 inches , he s a pocket passer with underrated functional mobility , meaning he s adept at moving within the pocket to create opportunities to pass and , from time to time , moving the chains with a scramble if flacco is even slightly hobbled , you take away a lot of his potential through the air that s something for ravens fans to worry about heading into week 17 and , possibly , the postseason the last time these teams met , the dolphin offensive line , which still had jonathan martin and richie incognito on the left side , played well for more than 50 minutes but then saw the veteran right tackle tyson clabo give up two costly sacks in the closing minutes , including one that resulted in a lost fumble to set up buffalo s gamewinning field goal this time , clabo and his fellow protectors did n't wait until the end to give the game away ryan tannehill dropped back 34 times and was sacked on seven of them that was one more than the number of total first downs the dolphins had , and it was only three fewer than tannehill s completion total there was no running game to speak of , either , as miami s leading rusher , lamar miller , had 8 yards on three carries break up the bengals at least when they 're at home in each of their last four games at paul brown stadium \( which , by the way , is refreshingly bereft of a corporate sponsor \) , the bengals have broken the 40point barrier twentyeight of the bengals' 42 points against the vikings came in the first half , which was a leaguehigh third time this season the team has reached that mark before intermission this victory , coupled with the ravens' loss , clinched a second straight division title for the bengals , which means they 'll have a chance to build on their 40point home mark in the postseason quietly , the colts appear to be righting their ship at the perfect time after giving up big yardage and points to the cardinals , the rams and the bengals in a fiveweek span , the colts' defense has surrendered a combined 10 points in its last two outings the win at arrowhead was marked by big plays , as the colts forced four chiefs turnovers , got stops on seven of eight third downs and sacked alex smith four times speaking of sacks rams defensive end robert quinn had three more sunday , working on st louis s fast indoor track against the reeling bucs left tackle donald penn quinn leads the nfl with 18 sacks , and he has also drawn a handful of holding penalties and impactful double teams in short , there is n't a more explosive edge rusher in the country it would not at all be rash to vote him as the defensive player of the year rex ryan told some of his players that he expects to be fired after the season how in the world will general manager john idzik justify that \? not only have ryan s jets played hard down the stretch \( ask the browns \) , but they 've all played above their natural talent the jets have a rookie quarterback , a soso offensive line and a depleted receiving corps on defense they have no dominant edge rusher or uppertier safeties yet they 're near 500 and showing improvement in most of their areas of weakness \( one of the latest examples the offense converted 12 of 18 third downs in this game \) if idzik fires ryan , the first question he should be asked is , if you 've wanted to bring in your own guy all along , why did n't you can ryan at the start \? and were there financial factors that your owner thought were more important than winning or rebuilding \? the cowboys ran the ball late in the fourth , and football america was reminded why that s not always a good idea \( even when hindsight says it is \) after demarco murray was stuffed twice at the goal line and tackled for a huge loss on third down , tony romo had to complete a seasonsaving fourthandgoal from the 10 romo , who was battling a back injury , did what he 'd done brilliantly all game long extend the play from the pocket in this case , he used the extra time he bought to complete a checkdown pass to murray , who was uncovered and had a fairly clear path to the end zone a key factor on the play was the protection romo got on the edges from tyron smith \( the best left tackle in the nfl this year \) and doug free \( the most improved right tackle , if not offensive player , in the league \) those two bookends have been stellar most of the season and spectacular in recent weeks cam newton s three completions on carolina s gamewinning touchdown drive in the final minute were three of the strongest throws in the nfl this season they were the types of plays that only a few quarterbacks can make remarkably , the panthers got this win despite converting on none of their thirddown tries in the game much of the credit is being heaped on the defense , specifically the secondyear middle linebacker luke kuechly , who recorded 24 tackles and an interception those are great numbers , but they 're also indicative of how lopsided the ball control in this game was kuechly was able to get 24 tackles in part because the saints ran a whopping 81 plays come playoff time , carolina s defense will have to figure out how to leverage its dominance to get off the field quicker the titans got this win \( their first in the division \) the way they wanted to get wins heading into this season by running shonn greene carried 19 times for 91 yards chris johnson carried 22 times for 90 yards it s almost encouraging that johnson s longest rush went for just 12 yards that signals that johnson , who relies too much on finesse , was consistently productive \( generally 4plus yards per carry \) for the second time in his hall of fame career , peyton manning broke the nfl s singleseason touchdown record his 51st touchdown pass , however , came in a somewhat pyrrhic victory , as a firsthalf knee injury to von miller is feared to be a seasonending anterior cruciate ligament tear the broncos were already stammering on defense coming into this game they 'd recently reshuffled their base and nickel personnel at linebacker and safety that s a bad sign this late in the season and now they may be without their top pass rusher one of those nights for the bears they 're not comfortable in mantoman defense and they simply ca n't stop the run that s a bad formula for facing the eagles on offense , jay cutler took far too many hits some were his fault some were protection breakdowns \( matt forte had a setback in his progress in blitz pickups \) it was a little surprising that marc trestman did not take cutler out early in the second half considering the bears have an nfc north championship to play for next week
fort meade , md defense lawyers for and four others accused of being accomplices in the terrorist attacks of sept 11 , 2001 , asked a judge in , cuba , on tuesday to let them stay in prison with their clients for 48hour periods every six months but military prosecutors called that request unreasonable , saying the defense should be allowed only a single twohour visit the idea that they are entitled to walk around for 48 hours in their clients' shoes is unsupported by anything , said maj robert mcgovern of the army , a member of the prosecution team the requested visit was one of several issues raised at a pretrial motions hearing that focused on information that could become a central focus if the defendants are eventually convicted and they face the possibility of a death sentence a closedcircuit video feed of the hearing was shown to reporters at the base and at fort meade while all five defendants were present at a hearing on monday , none chose to attend court on tuesday defense lawyers urged the judge overseeing the case , col james pohl of the army , to allow them to have lengthy , repeated visits to their clients' cellblocks , along with the ability to speak freely to guards and make their own photos and diagrams , so that they can document their clients' lives and behavior in custody such information , the lawyers said , could help them develop mitigating arguments against execution if we get to sentencing , we need to articulate mitigating factors , particularly the defendants' adaptions to conditions of confinement , said cmdr walter ruiz of the navy , a defense lawyer for one of the detainees , mustafa ahmed alhawsawi commander ruiz acknowledged security and logistical concerns and suggested that it would be acceptable to be in an adjoining cell , but said the defense needed to see sleeping cycles and what goes on at night the defense is also seeking correspondence with the red cross about their clients' confinement issues colonel pohl appeared sympathetic to the defense , pressing major mcgovern skeptically about the necessity of the government s proposed limitations on the visit , but did not rule on tuesday colonel pohl also put off consideration of another highprofile motion a defense request that he order the government to preserve evidence at any central intelligence agency black site prison where their clients were held and interrogated for several years before the tribunal can take up that motion , colonel pohl must first decide whether the defendants could be excluded from the courtroom during the classified discussion joanna baltes , a prosecution lawyer , said the detainees could be removed from pretrial evidentiary proceedings if the classified information will not be used as affirmative evidence against them defense lawyers object to excluding their clients from any aspect of the case i'm not sure how we could have a closed session without the accused until there is a ruling on that issue , said colonel pohl , who asked the lawyers to quickly draft briefs on the question the bush administration s original version of military tribunals allowed prosecutors to introduce classified evidence that would be kept secret from defendants after the supreme court struck down those tribunals , congress enacted statutes in 2006 and 2009 resurrecting and overhauling the system one of the changes lawmakers made was to outlaw secret evidence , and the statutes authorize the exclusion of defendants from the courtroom only if they disrupt the proceedings but the motion over the issue of secret cia prisons may raise a new wrinkle , because the chief prosecutor , brig gen mark s martins , has said that he will not use evidence polluted by torture in the trial and that he has enough evidence from sources other than the cia the defense wants to gather blacksite information in order to argue at any sentencing that their clients should be spared the death penalty the hearing also opened with a brief discussion of an unexplained blackout on the courtroom feed on monday colonel pohl had appeared angry that the feed was cut , saying no one had said anything classified , but on tuesday appeared somewhat mollified he did not explain what had happened , but emphasized that only he , as the judge , could authorize closing the courtroom to public viewers
boston the explosives that killed three people and injured more than 170 during the boston marathon on monday were most likely rudimentary devices made from ordinary kitchen pressure cookers , except they were rigged to shoot sharp bits of shrapnel into anyone within reach of their blast and maim them severely , law enforcement officials said tuesday the pressure cookers were filled with nails , ball bearings and black powder , and the devices were triggered by kitchentype egg timers , one official said the resulting explosions sent metal tearing through skin and muscle , destroying the lower limbs of some victims who had only shreds of tissue holding parts of their legs together when they arrived at the emergency room of massachusetts general hospital , doctors there said law enforcement officials said the devices were probably hidden inside dark nylon duffel bags or backpacks and left on the street or sidewalk near the finish line forensic experts said that the design and components of the homemade devices were generic but that the marking 6l , indicating a sixliter container , could help identify a brand and manufacturer and possibly lead to information on the buyer new details about the explosives emerged as president obama announced that the fbi was investigating the attack as an act of terrorism , and made plans to come to boston on thursday for an interfaith service at the cathedral of the holy cross but officials said they still had no suspects in custody and did not give the impression that they were close to making an arrest as they repeatedly noted that the investigation was in its infancy the range of suspects and motives remains wide open , richard deslauriers , the special agent in charge of the fbi s boston office , said at a televised briefing on tuesday afternoon and , he added , no one has claimed responsibility at this stage of an inquiry , officials said it was not unusual for there to be no suspects but with the paucity of leads , mr deslauriers and others pleaded with members of the public to submit any photographs or video they may have taken at the blast site to help in the investigation at the briefing , mr deslauriers said that someone somewhere almost certainly heard a mention of the marathon or the date of april 15 someone knows who did this , he said cooperation from the community will play a crucial role officials said that as of tuesday afternoon , they had received more than 2 , 000 tips from around the world as marathoners left through logan airport on tuesday , security personnel reminded them of the importance of sharing their pictures with the fbi counterterrorism specialists said the authorities would aim to match the faces of any possible suspects , using facial recognition software , against an array of databases for visas , passports and drivers licenses it s our intention to go through every frame of every video that we have to determine exactly who was in the area , edward davis , the boston police commissioner , said at the news briefing this was probably one of the most wellphotographed areas in the country yesterday boston was deserted on tuesday morning , not only because many of the runners and spectators were leaving town , but also because yellow police tape and metal barriers still marked off a nearly milelong area encompassing the two explosion sites , one that the police described as the most complex crime scene they had ever encountered at the morning commuter rush , the city s subway system was uncharacteristically quiet , watched over by the police and swat teams stores on newbury street , boston s busy retail thoroughfare , were closed , and tables on the patio at stephanie s , a restaurant there , were still covered in dishes left there on monday among the three dead was an 8yearold boy , martin richard of dorchester the boy had been watching near the finish line and then moved back into the crowd the blast killed him and severely injured his mother and his sister another spectator , krystle campbell , 29 , of arlington , mass , also died monday from injuries she suffered while watching the marathon , her grandmother lillian campbell said tuesday
los angeles torture terror mental illness revolt where s uggie the dog when you need him \? the 85th academy awards season jolted into place on thursday as the heaviest number of oscar nominations including nods for best picture went to lincoln , about a president s struggle with the civil war life of pi , about a shipwreck survivor and a tiger silver linings playbook , a comedy , of sorts , about a man with bipolar disorder and les mis rables , filled with songs of the oppressed close behind were argo , about political captivity amour , a frenchlanguage film about aging and dying and django unchained , a tale of slavery and retribution  beasts of the southern wild , which chronicles a child s encounters with rising floodwaters in the bayou , and zero dark thirty , about the murky pursuit of a national enemy , also received best picture nominations but the shocker was a triple snub in the best director category kathryn bigelow \( zero dark thirty \) , ben affleck \( argo \) and quentin tarantino \( django unchained \) were passed over despite widespread expectations that one or all of them would be nominated instead , the nominations went to steven spielberg \( lincoln \) , ang lee \( life of pi \) , michael haneke \( amour \) , david o russell \( silver linings playbook \) and benh zeitlin \( beasts of the southern wild , his first film \) we didn t destroy the hotel room too badly , but it was definitely a blind celebratory panic that we went into , mr zeitlin said in a telephone interview in all , nine films received best picture nominations in a field that can include as many as 10 or as few as 5 , depending on how voters from the academy of motion picture arts and sciences spread their hand mr spielberg s lincoln was considered the picture to beat , and it led the field with 12 nominations it remains to be seen , however , if lincoln will end up more like the artist , which last year established dominance \( with help from its cheery jack russell terrier costar , uggie \) and won best picture , or mr spielberg s own saving private ryan , which seemed to lead through much of the 1999 awards season but lost out to shakespeare in love the nominations were announced at the academy s beverly hills headquarters in an earlymorning ceremony that paired the actress emma stone with the host of this year s oscar telecast , seth macfarlane the unusual inclusion of mr macfarlane , creator of the animated television show family guy , was an effort by the academy to increase his public profile only once before \( in 1972 , when charlton heston did it \) has a host announced nominees mr macfarlane worked hard to squelch skepticism about his selection as host and to hint at what will come on oscar night , cracking a series of oneliners that mocked the selfseriousness of the oscars and the craft of moviemaking the directing nominees , he said , are the very best at sitting in a chair and watching other people make a movie of the foreign film amour , he said , the last time austria and germany got together and coproduced something , it was hitler \( cue nervous laughter from the 400 or so reporters in the room \) hollywood faces a somewhat longer than usual campaign period a new digital voting system despite its reported hitches allowed the academy to announce nominees two weeks earlier than it did last year , and more than six weeks before the awards ceremony , which abc will broadcast on feb 24 lincoln was followed closely in the balloting by life of pi , which surpassed expectations by coming up second with 11 nominations , even as zero dark thirty , an early favorite , fell into the pack , with just 5 mr spielberg s directing nomination was his seventh , while daniel daylewis received his fifth best actor nomination , this time for his portrayal of lincoln \( he has won twice \) sally field was among the lincoln nominees , as a supporting actress for playing mary todd lincoln , as was tony kushner , for writing the film s adapted script all of that , as well as an aggressive promotional campaign that found the film playing as a civics lesson of a sort when it was screened for the united states senate , has helped create a sense that lincoln is the most important picture in a selfconsciously important field you never ever know how these things are going to go , so it s really gratifying , said kathleen kennedy , a producer of lincoln , who spoke by telephone on thursday morning she noted , however , that it was not a perfect day for the lincoln team i was very disappointed that our makeup and hair people weren t recognized , she said though no slouch when it comes to importance , zero dark thirty , about the pursuit of osama bin laden , may have been hurt by controversy , as several senators and a number of political critics tore into the film for the way it portrayed torture but oscar voters gave the film a nomination for mark boal s screenplay and nominated its star , jessica chastain , for best actress all of the year s best actress nominees hailed from movies that have yet to find a broad audience \( zero dark thirty did not have widespread release until this weekend \) along with ms chastain the nominees in that category are jennifer lawrence \( silver linings playbook \) , emmanuelle riva \( amour \) , naomi watts \( the impossible \) and quvenzhan wallis \( beasts of the southern wild \) , at age 9 the youngest best actress nominee ever joining mr daylewis in the running for best actor are bradley cooper \( silver linings playbook \) , joaquin phoenix \( the master \) , hugh jackman \( les mis rables \) and denzel washington \( flight \) among the clear winners on thursday was walt disney studios , which had three of the five nominees in the category for best animated feature brave , frankenweenie and wreckit ralph the rival dreamworks animation had none the pirates ! band of misfits , released by sony pictures , and paranorman , from focus features , were the other animation nominees silver linings playbook , from the weinstein company , also came up a winner , as seven of its eight nominations came in prominent categories robert de niro was nominated for best supporting actor and jacki weaver for best supporting actress the film was the first to be nominated in all four acting categories since reds , released in 1981 , according to libby wertin , a researcher with the academy it slightly outstripped lincoln in the major categories , and handily surpassed life of pi , which had no acting nominees in keeping with recent tradition the academy brushed off the best boxoffice performers there were no nominations in acting or directing categories for the hobbit an unexpected journey , the dark knight rises or skyfall the oscar process has been especially rough this year , as the academy began phasing out paper ballots in favor of online voting the idea was to get quicker results , which allowed the group to break precedent by announcing its nominations before the presentation ceremony of the rival golden globes , set for sunday but some of the academy s roughly 6 , 000 potential voters remained unaware of the shift until balloting was near others had trouble accessing a heavily secured voting system the oscar nominating vote was ultimately extended by a day , after the documentary branch members got an extension for voting on their shortlist , which was selected under new rules the new documentary process , intended to broaden the pool of voters making a first cut of the candidates , yielded what appeared to be a fairly conventional list of culturally hip or politically progressive nominees those were 5 broken cameras , about palestinian resistance to the israeli army the gatekeepers , about the israeli security apparatus how to survive a plague , about aids the invisible war , which deals with rape in the united states military and searching for sugar man , about the lost career of the singer rodriguez tom hooper was bypassed as the director of les mis rables , from universal but the film received eight nominations overall , and its presumed strength among actors anne hathaway was nominated for best supporting actress , along with mr jackman s best actor nomination still make it a force to be reckoned with on abc s oscar telecast skyfall will presumably be part of a special retrospective on the 50yearold james bond franchise any other year a bond montage might be a routine bid for the pop audience but after the mass killings in newtown , conn , and aurora , colo , and with hollywood receiving criticism for its reliance on showy violence , the tribute may pose a challenge for the event s producers , neil meron and craig zadan , who will have to decide whether to serve up their killerspy with or without his guns blazing the academy has fought a perennial battle to win younger viewers and to maintain the ratings for its telecast , even as its voters have leaned toward smaller

madrid the other day , during a rambling chat with another boy , my 5yearold son peppered his speech with a few delightfully spanish interjections anda ! ol ! t o it struck me my son , born in plantation , fla , but raised in madrid from the age of 1 , is a bona fide spaniard he s chosen his soccer team \( real madrid \) he attends a spanish school his cusses are those of any good spaniard worth his linguistic salt the prophecies of friends and relatives back in the united states , uttered gravely over the years , were becoming true if i didn t immerse my son in my native tongue , spanish would forever be his dominant language and english , halfstarved and scratching at a closed neural door , would remain dimly secondary don t get me wrong i love my adopted country and its language the trilling idioms that roll off the tongues of my madrile o colleagues , the way the vernacular energy of quixote lives on in the pitch of contemporary speech i ve also warmed to the more relaxed spanish parenting customs children here generally aren t turned into marriage anchors or mommy me cultfigures , but form a natural part of family life in a country where it s not unusual for three generations to live under one roof , crisis or no crisis my husband is spanish , and i feel privileged to be raising our son here but at the same time , as a bilingual american who was raised in venezuela by expatriate parents , i feel the guilt of expats who don t dutifully teach english to their infants from the cradle on bilingualism was once just the natural consequence of immigration today , it s high on the childrearing agenda of globalizationconscious parents study after study confirms that speaking more than one language has many benefits from career options to cognitive development researchers at the university of granada and york university recently found that bilingual children have better working memories than their monolingual peers and the effects last a study published in january in the journal of neuroscience showed that older adults who were bilingual from childhood could switch between cognitive tasks faster than those who spoke only one language but none of this research addresses the challenges of talking to a headstrong toddler until about the time our son turned 2 , my husband and i preserved a strict division he spoke only spanish to him , and i spoke only english it felt natural sometimes , a spanish phrase would escape my lips , and my husband would rush over and protest hey , you re speaking to him in spanish ! as though i d just sneaked some rioja into our child s bottle but when our son started uttering words and phrases , they were invariably in spanish i would say , ready for your bath \? and he would answer , no , estoy jugando ! \( no ! i m playing ! \) if i pushed him to make the linguistic shift , i would get the furrowed brow and the unequivocal no english ! english began to feel like a forced and intrusive presence between us i simply felt he didn t get me in english , even if his literal comprehension was there my communication with him felt didactic , not intuitive so i switched not entirely , and not consciously but before i knew it , i was speaking to my son in spanish about 70 percent of the time it was easier our conversations flowed i gave up the battle of wills english was reserved for bedtime books and interspersed phrases here i was an english teacher of intermediatelevel university students in madrid chucking my own best advice to practice , practice , practice i know how hard it is to learn a second language outside the home spanish children dutifully pore over english grammar books many of them can spot a past participle much faster than their american counterparts but conversation is not widely included in formal instruction , and oral skills lag far behind in the years since spain joined the european union , madrid has seen the rise of englishlanguage academies and corporate classes for executives , as well as more creative programs , like english flamenco dance and cakedecorating classes every september , after the ritual august beach getaways , many madrile os return home with a rejuvenated commitment to improving their english classes fill up books are sold then the reality of learning a new language in a nonimmersion setting creeps in , and a fastpaced life that doesn t include english takes over perhaps not surprisingly , my shift away from englishdominant parenting made some friends and relatives here and back home indignant i ve been emailed articles about how bilingualism helps delay the onset of symptoms of alzheimer s disease i was told my son was probably already receptively bilingual and it would be akin to abuse not to teach him his maternal heritage language i got stern lectures about the brain s language center and how it works in young children i imagined the silly putty of my son s brain a postbabelian dream of language receptivity hardening into a monolingual clod to make matters worse , my husband recently declared that the window of true bilingualism was now closed for our son that s it he ll never speak fluent english and he ll never be a real american whenever my son does utter a few phrases in english , it s in the rich , guttural tones of his castilian spanish chhai mam ! he ll say or i m chhungry this will send a guilty shudder through me and i ll have a brief vision of his adult self chopping through an interview in my mother tongue at a company that hires only fluent english speakers the grim words of a spanish friend you re condemning him to a mediocre life will echo again but then , when we re reading an english storybook at night , i ll watch my son lean in and shout out three or four english words at a critical juncture in the story , he might also say , jopetas ! \( darn \) followed by peals of laughter and slowly , thoughts of parental failure recede english will come in its own good time so long as real , mutual understanding prevails , bilingualism can wait tal abbady is a freelance writer who teaches english at the universidad pontificia comillas
karma shut john mayer up at least , it was easy to believe that was the case when news came out in 2011 that he 'd developed a granuloma near his vocal cords , treatment for which effectively rendered him mute for months , he could n't make a peep in the years before that , mr mayer had peeped plenty kissing and sort of telling about his highprofile love life to tmz letting loose with a racial slur in a playboy interview microphones seemed to call to mr mayer , reach down his throat and disinter all manner of frisky , eyebrowraising statements except on his albums , that is as a musician , mr mayer has almost always been sober , a bluesrock guitar wunderkind with a medium voice put in service of lightweight songs even as his tabloid life took on outsize proportions , he remained the heartthrob next door , safe and clean it was tough to know which part of his personality was a front for the other and now mr mayer , 35 , is talking again , but the dynamic has switched in interviews , he is respectful , even a bit reluctant and on paradise valley \( columbia \) , his unexpectedly impressive new album , he has quite a lot to say yes , mr mayer is speaking about others on this , his sixth solo studio album , but let s table that for now paradise valley is meant to represent his staking a claim to maturity , both as a musician and as a person he does that by acknowledging past wrongs , obliquely variously he describes himself as a runaway train , a feather in a hurricane and the breeze , and he waxes nostalgic for that peaceful wandering free i used to know on dear marie , he addresses someone who knew him before he learned to insert his foot in his mouth remember me \? i'm the boy you used to love when you were 15 now i wonder what you think when you see me in a magazine later , he moans , i got my dream , but you got a family now it s mr mayer s turn for stability waitin' on the day is one of a few declarations of domesticity and calm on this album , which includes some of his strongest songwriting finally , mr mayer sings , he s not running away , but rather holding on for the moment when you 'll love me all the way when you take my side in every little firefight when you hang your things and stay that song goes hand in hand with the slightly dull lament of i will be found \( lost at sea \) , one of a few places where he renounces his rolling stone ways it does n't matter where you roam when no one s left to call you home i might have strayed a bit too far i'm counting all the moonlit stars on wildfire , he virtually whispers , you can rest your head on my shoulder if you want to get older with me \( there s also a second wildfire , a wonderful 85second interlude with frank ocean , who sings heartbreakingly about tough love \) another part of growing up is moving past the overcompensations of your youth musically , he accomplishes that here with guitar playing that s emphatic but not ostentatious one of mr mayer s longstanding tensions has been between his urge to be virtuosic and his understanding that virtuosity is a crutch and a muzzle his live shows have often toed the line between croon session and extended jam but there s almost nothing complex about this album there are blues , soul , maybe a hint of bakersfield country on a cover of j j cale s call me the breeze , but not much more mr mayer wants his feelings to be heard can you blame him \? in 2010 , taylor swift a former paramour released dear john it was , by any measure , savage , one of the great romantic eviscerations in modern pop whether it was merited , only two people know , but certainly the glowing ms swift could n't help seeming justified in her angst against the oily mr mayer mr mayer has returned the favor here it does n't matter whether paper doll is really about ms swift it only matters if people think it is unlike dear john , which wore mr mayer s bluesrock dna like armor , paper doll is unflashy , apart from the barbs you 're like 22 girls in one and none of them know what they 're running from a few of mr mayer s taunts are cruel and clumsy strap into some heels that hurt you shoulda kept my undershirt and sure was fun being good to you , which can be read with varying levels of ickiness as if taking back the power from a 23yearold pop icon were n't enough , mr mayer ups the ante with who you love , a duet with katy perry , his current girlfriend the softrock arrangement is as warm as angora , and ms perry sounds great , less shouty than on her own songs , singing in mr mayer s defense my boy , he ai n't the one that i saw coming and some have said his heart s too hard to hold and it takes a little time , but you should see him when he shines cause you 'd never want to let that feeling go whether she knows it or not , ms perry has been weaponized here , on a song that is from one angle a tender display of mutual affection , and , from another , a huge middle finger which one is it really \?

nagpur , a city of nearly 25 million in central indian state of maharashtra , has the slow rhythms of a small town the noise and edginess of the new indian metropolis , the gargantuan shopping malls and luxury automobiles , have yet to overwhelm it nagpur seeks halfhearted recognition as india s orange city , for being a major trade center for oranges cultivated in the region nagpur makes an appearance on the national stage when the rightwing guardians of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh \( rss \) , pronounce their views on indian politics or society from their headquarters in the city among other things , they have often aired their dissatisfaction with cricket their chief complaint being that , as a game , it is not sufficiently indian in a corner of a foreign field , a magisterial history of indian cricket , ramachandra guha reproduced parts of a speech ms golwalkar , one of the rss s founders , had given in the 1950s mr golwalkar argued that the costly game of cricket , which has not only become a fashion in our country but something over which we are spending crores of rupees , only proves that the english are still dominating our mind and intellect in 2011 , following the indian team s progress through the cricket world cup , i was in nagpur to attend india s match against south africa one morning , i decided to visit the offices of the rss to understand why they resented cricket nobody seemed to know where the rss office was at badkas chowk , a chaotic roundabout barely a hundred meters from the rss office , two shopkeepers had no clue a puzzled autorickshaw driver asked me , what is rss \? a shop \? i had expected the headquarters of the powerful hindu nationalist organization in india to be a prominent address in town i was amused by the sight of locals scratching their heads about its whereabouts after several fruitless forays , i finally spotted a pale , unremarkable building , tucked inside a lane off from the main square two policemen surveyed the street from a watchtower behind its gate the rss headquarters had no signboard the boundary wall was not high , but several rolls of barbed wire had been added to it prohibitive barricades were placed outside the main entrance inside the complex , there were bunkers and tents , where security personnel slept when not on duty a few years ago , this was a relaxed place , a colleague and friend had told me after the reports of involvement of fringe hindu groups in bomb attacks on several muslim religious institutions in india , in which the rss was accused of aiding and abetting the perpetrators , the mothership of india s hindu right was scared of reprisals at the reception area , an inordinate number of details were sought name , father s name , address , occupation after an official at the reception area examined my details with a grave , diligent expression , he pushed a button behind him and waved me in i was led to harish , a portly man , who used only one name he wore a checkered shirt and a sarong , and had smeared his forehead with tilak i asked mr harish if i could speak to someone about cricket the office is empty , he said everyone is in mangalore for a meeting i might have seemed incredulous you can have a look inside if you like , he said i wandered about for a while the inner courtyard had a temple with a krishna idol a few group photographs of the rss workers on the walls did not have a single woman in them it had the feel of a military barrack i eventually returned to mr harish he seemed to specialize in a form of nonconversation , almost as if being drawn into a discussion was a breach of organizational discipline are you from nagpur \? i asked yes how long have you worked here \? a few years do you watch cricket \? what do you think of cricket \? i have no views on cricket , he said i don t even have a television our nonconversation went on for several minutes each question was followed by a long silence mr harish was calm after a while , utterly pleased with the visible exasperation on my face , he suggested that i should visit the rss office in reshimbagh area , about five kilometers away we do our shakhas , our maharaj satsangs , our big meetings there , he said you may be able to speak to someone there in reshimbagh , a dusty area populated with vocational institutes and rundown hostels , the rss complex , which seemed like a high school compound , merged seamlessly into the landscape the buildings in the complex sat opposite a muddy , grassless field the rooms shared a small porch , which served as a place for socializing and gossip inside the reshimbagh complex of the rss , i met vinod nalgaonkar , a mild , bespectacled man mr nalgaonkar worked as a midlevel bureaucrat in india s ministry of finance and ministry of civil aviation he had retired from the government service and devoted himself to working for the rss , which he had been a member of throughout his employment with the indian government mr nalgaonkar was an unabashed cricket enthusiast after i told him i had come to nagpur to write about the cricket world cup , he promptly proceeded to comment on the indian bowler ashish nehra s last over against the south african team , which cost india the match with south africa needing 13 runs to win , mr nehra had conceded 16 runs , which included two fours and a six , in just four balls mr sunil , who did not wish to share his last name , was another retired bureaucrat and lifelong rss follower he joined mr nalgaonkar as most indians do , mr nalgaonkar spoke authoritatively about the indian cricket team he analyzed why the indian team lost the match against south africa and recommended measures for improving its performance mr sunil sat in silence as his friend spoke he seemed bored by the talk of cricket i took this to be a natural aversion to the game that many members of the rss shared i was startled a few minutes later when mr sunil broke his silence , discussing the performance of the players munaf patel and yusuf pathan munaf and yusuf should be dropped , he said they are no good at all there was no attempt at subtlety or veiled criticism mr sunil was forthright in directing his ire at the two of the muslim players in the indian cricket team mr patel and mr pathan , who both hailed from the western state of gujarat , had not performed well in the match against south africa mr patel , a fast bowler , had given away too many runs while mr pathan had been dismissed for a duck they were not alone several other players had performed poorly in the match against south africa i think his outburst slightly embarrassed mr nalgaonkar he tried to steer the conversation in a different direction look at sachin ! he is from our maharashtra , mr nalgaonkar said there is no one like him at 37 , he is still performing so well at his age , none of the others will even be able to run mr nalgaonkar and mr sunil helped organizing the shakha , the annual physical training and indoctrination camp among the shakha s activities were the practice of yoga and the playing of kabaddi do you ever play cricket in the shakha \? i prodded them on cricket no chance , they both replied together we have kabaddi and other indian games , said mr sunil no cricket the rss doesn t approve of it after our conversation , mr nalgaonkar gave me a tour of the complex a part of the building housed a small hostel , where 20 children were being lodged and educated most of them were poor orphans , while some had been sent by parents who admired the disciplinarian ethos of the rss when we stepped into the recreation room of the hostel , the children , between the ages of five and 15 , were glued to a solitary television set , watching highlights from the previous day s game a little later , i was struck by a map of india hanging on a wall india s peninsular shape appeared strangely bloated , its bulge extending towards both east and west a closer look explained it the rss version of the indian map included the territories of pakistan , bangladesh and myanmar i pointed out to mr nalgaonkar that the saffroncolored map was perhaps incorrect what does it represent \? i asked akhand bharat , he said in an admonishing , berating tone , undivided india that s what we believe in i followed mr nalgaonkar to the shrines of kb hegdewar and ms golwalkar , the founders of the rss mr hegdewar in black marble sat imperiously on a pedestal wearing the rss cap , his moustache unperturbed by the breeze , his legs crossed a little ahead , mr golwalkar was represented by a small flame an inscription in marathi and hindi stated his desire not to have a memorial in 1925 , mr hegdewar founded the rss in a small ground in nagpur upon his death in 1940 , mr golwalkar succeeded him as the chief of the organization , a position he held for more than three decades mr golwalkar , who had a fondness for antimuslim invective , was one of the more rabid public speakers in modern indian history another of his personal hatreds concerned the game of cricket , which became the reason for the organization s opposition to cricket but beyond the boundary of the rss complex was a modern cricket facility , where the children of nagpur filled the impressive nets of reshimbagh gymkhana , oblivious to mr golwalkar s passions and commands vaibhav vats s first book , triumph in bombay travels during the cricket world cup , will be published by penguin random house india in july
the political fireworks and highoctane drama that accompanied lawmakers' 2011 fight over women s health care and have been absent this legislative session they have been replaced with some semblance of concession , as legislators on both sides of the aisle work quietly to restore financing for women s health services they have done it with little more than a handshake agreement democrats will not die on the sword of bringing planned parenthood back into the fold , and republicans will not put up additional barriers to women s access to care the major difference is we 're not fighting about it we 're just doing what s right for women and the state , state representative sarah davis , republican of west university place , said last month at a texas tribune symposium on health care there has not been a drawnout public debate on abortion or women s health in either chamber this legislative session none of the 24 abortionrelated bills filed have reached the house or senate floor and ms davis , the only republican member of the house women s health caucus , brokered a bipartisan grand bargain , as lawmakers refer to it , to prevent amendments to the house budget bill that could have jeopardized an agreement to restore women s health dollars for some republicans , this bargain hinged on the ballot box ms davis said several of her colleagues had faced blistering attacks after last session s familyplanning cuts an effort , in part , to drive planned parenthood out of business closed clinics in their districts that were not affiliated with abortion providers ms davis , a survivor who opposes abortion but will not support legislation she believes interferes with the doctorpatient relationship , said the best way she had found to help lowincome women was to remove emotion from the debate the arguments about abortion and planned parenthood in 2011 did not advance the ball , she said in fact , it just threw family planning into a tailspin bolstered by the s gains in the state s 2010 elections , last session s ultraconservative legislature approved a law requiring women seeking an abortion to have a sonogram and hear a description of the fetus at least 24 hours before the procedure in a targeted effort to exclude planned parenthood and other clinics affiliated with abortion providers from taxpayerfinanced programs , lawmakers also cut the state s familyplanning budget by twothirds as a direct result , 117 texas familyplanning clinics stopped receiving state financing and 56 of those clinics closed , according to researchers at the university of texas at austin who are conducting a threeyear study to evaluate the legislature s policy changes the researchers estimate that 144 , 000 fewer women received health services and 30 , 000 fewer unintended pregnancies were averted in 2012 than in 2010 the state s savings from the programs dropped by an estimated 163 million a lot of people really felt they got snookered by some of the people in the prolife movement about that familyplanning issue , said state senator bob deuell , republican of greenville , who has been a strong advocate for restoring familyplanning financing for lowincome women by way of primary care dr deuell , a primary care physician , is an ardent opponent of state money going to planned parenthood clinics but he said the vitriol of some abortion opponents last session had prevented the state from pursuing good policy decisions he recalled being compared to margaret sanger , the founder of planned parenthood , when he argued that cutting familyplanning services would lead to more unwanted pregnancies , and therefore more abortions and more children living in poverty in the tentative 201415 state budget , which is being worked out in conference committee , lawmakers have devoted more financing to women s health services than before the 2011 budget cuts the house version of the budget doubled financing for familyplanning services to 75 million , while the senate version increases financing to 43 million both chambers have added 100 million to a staterun primary care program to serve women of all ages and set aside 71 million to support the texas women s health program , formerly the medicaid women s health program , which lost a 9to 1 federal match over state leaders' decision to eject planned parenthood clinics from it legislative budget writers earmarked the money under strict rules that none of it could go to health providers that were affiliated with abortion clinics abortion providers are already excluded from state health programs , but abortion opponents argue that state dollars that went to affiliates of abortion providers like planned parenthood clinics that provide only family planning services indirectly support abortion once that s taken off the table , oh , it s wonderful , it makes it so much easier , state representative bryan hughes , republican of mineola , said at the tribune s health care symposium because we agree we want to make sure these services are provided and women get the health care that they need the federal government has responded in part to the state s efforts to exclude certain providers by granting the women s health and family planning association of texas not the usual recipient , the texas department of state health services 6 million in socalled title x familyplanning dollars to distribute in the second half of fiscal year 2013 fran hagerty , the association s chief executive , said the financing gave providers a range of benefits , like the ability to offer confidential services for teenagers and to provide patients discounts on only two planned parenthood clinics have asked for and received a portion of the title x financing , she said these funding sources are meant to work together to support these providers , ms hagerty said , adding that she hoped to work with the state to rebuild the state s network of familyplanning providers there are already plans to reopen some clinics , she said , like a familyplanning provider in bell county that closed because of the state s cuts after 42 years of operation with the familyplanning financing nearly settled depending on negotiations in conference committee the last lingering battlefield is abortion gov rick perry has thrown his political weight behind a bill that would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks current law bans abortions in the third trimester , except in cases of medical emergency abortion opponents believe fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks of gestation because they reflexively respond to stimuli , but there is no scientific consensus a 2005 study published in the journal of the american medical association found it was unlikely that fetuses felt pain before the third trimester a house committee approved the bill on friday dr deuell has written a bill to tighten restrictions on facilities that provide abortions , saying lawmakers can do things to improve the quality and safety of abortions only 5 of the state s 42 existing abortion facilities would meet the bill s standards abortionrights advocates counter that existing regulations are sufficient and that the added precautions would ultimately endanger women by limiting legal access to the procedure the bill is currently stalled in the senate for her part , ms davis thinks delving into such abortion fights is unnecessary we should not be playing political football with women s health , she said , because it does n't do either side any good
washington on the endgame for the budget showdown looming in washington this fall , only this is clear president obama thinks republicans cannot risk another debt crisis or government shutdown , and republican leaders agree that consensus suggests that the odds of an economydamaging stalemate are relatively low , despite rising jitters in the capital yet everything else about how the white house and congressional negotiators will try to strike a deal , and then coax majorities to approve it , remains opaque even those of us quite close to it have a hard time saying how the movie ends , said representative chris van hollen of maryland , the ranking democrat on the house budget committee the showdown encompasses three interlocking fiscal disputes that will challenge mr obama and his republican interlocutors to bridge seemingly irreconcilable goals perhaps easiest to resolve is the effort by some conservative republicans to eliminate financing for the new health care law in return for keeping the government open beyond sept 30 , the end of the fiscal year as expected , mr obama is unyieldingly opposed to undercutting his signature domestic policy achievement the house republican leader , eric cantor of virginia , has already rejected the republican strategy as doomed to fail most senate republicans have not signed on , and senator richard m burr of north carolina has called it the dumbest idea i 've ever heard even one supporter , senator rand paul of kentucky , recently suggested that the threat was simply a tool to provoke negotiations a second challenge is determining the fate of the acrosstheboard budget cuts known as the sequester if congress avoids a shutdown by extending government financing republicans remain adamant that the level of budget cuts required by the sequester , about 90 billion per year , be continued but with increasing complaints about the effects of those cuts on the pentagon and elsewhere shown by house republicans' inability to pass their own transportation spending bill last month some party leaders want to rearrange the burden of those cuts so they fall instead on entitlement programs like medicare and social security the white house and congressional democrats , however , rule out that trade , except as part of a larger longterm deal that also includes new tax increases and republican resistance to tax increases , which has precluded such a grand bargain in recent years , has stiffened since the bush tax cuts for topearning americans expired at the end of 2012 the third challenge may be the most worrisome while the sequester pinches particular constituencies , and a government shutdown would inconvenience millions , economists warn that a default resulting from a failure to raise the government s debt limit could tip the economy back into recession that challenge also appears , at least on the surface , the most intractable speaker john a boehner of ohio has reiterated that republicans will not raise the debt limit without offsetting spending cuts mr boehner s demand would require fewer cuts than during the 2011 debt crisis , when the debt ceiling needed to rise by about 110 billion per month to avoid default that amount has shrunk to around 70 billion , according to the bipartisan policy center , because the topend tax increases and revenue from a stronger economy have helped shrink the deficit substantially but mr obama , burned by the downgrade of the united states debt rating after those 2011 negotiations , insists he will not negotiate on the issue this time it is as imposing a fiscal puzzle as veterans of washington budget fights have seen in years this is , for me , very , very difficult to figure out , said stephen bell , a longtime senate republican budget aide now at the bipartisan policy center no formal negotiations have begun , although the white house chief of staff , denis r mcdonough , has been meeting with a few senate republicans in search of common ground congressional aides have also started exploring potential stopgaps they begin with a temporary extension of government funding to allow budget talks to continue through year s end under one situation sketched out by democrats , temporary funding for discretionary programs like pentagon spending would be set just below 1 trillion closer to the 967 billion in the house republican budget than to the 1058 trillion in the senate democratic budget the aim of negotiations after that would be to come up with new savings approaching 200 billion part of the savings would come from entitlements , but programs like farm subsidies , rather than the more politically volatile social security and medicare part would come from new revenues , but user fees tied to special government services , rather than broadbased tax increases that could allow both sides to tell key constituencies that they did not violate core principles and it would be enough to replace cuts in military and domestic programs for about two years , without increasing the deficit it would not , however , allow republicans to argue that they achieved their own condition for raising the debt limit on this issue , both sides are counting on bitter memories from the 2011 crisis , which damaged the republican party s reputation , to help mr boehner and mr cantor rally enough of their caucus to vote aye one path would be returning to the mechanism that the senate republican leader , mitch mcconnell , came up with in 2011 , which allows most lawmakers to vote against a higher debt limit if the president takes responsibility for raising it another path is the option republicans accepted temporarily earlier this year , which simply suspended enforcement of the debt limit without raising it a third is linking a debt limit increase to the effort to achieve a different , if potentially quixotic , republican priority overhauling the federal tax code none of that would go down easily for conservative republican activists , who in the early days of the current congressional recess have urged their lawmakers to fight some republicans point , if sometimes nervously , to the shared determination of their leaders to avoid political damage as they seek to hold the house and recapture the senate in 2014 there are two things they all agree on you ca n't shut down the government , and you ca n't default on the debt , said representative tom cole , republican of oklahoma at some point , leaders have to lead
for more than 100 years it hung in the seward family home in auburn , in central new york state a large oil painting by thomas cole , the founder of the hudson river school , that was given to gov william h seward to thank him for his work expanding the erie canal cole s held pride of place as the house was turned over to seward s son , then his grandson and ultimately became the historic museum in 1951 but early one morning last month movers escorted by the police pulled up to the house , removed the cole landscape , which measures roughly 7 by 5 feet , from the drawing room and hauled it away the , which owns the artwork and once oversaw the museum , says the canvas and appraised five years ago at 18 million is too valuable to be left in an institution that does not have the resources to protect it fully the foundation plans to sell the painting at christie s , share the proceeds with the museum and hang a copy in its place but members of the seward family , patrons of the museum , auburn residents and museum professionals are criticizing the decision some of them call it unwise others describe it as a betrayal this is like the louvre giving away the mona lisa , said michael botwinick , director of the in yonkers , who serves on the board of the you 're giving away the centerpiece of the seward house the picture is integral to the museum it does n't make any sense the museum s members , donors and others first learned of the removal in a letter dated feb 21 that said the painting had been moved to a secure undisclosed location which pretty much sent everybody over the fence , said julie pearsall , seward s greatgreatgreatgranddaughter seward s grandson william h seward iii had given the seward house and its contents to the foundation in his will , to be maintained as a memorial for the grandfather of decedent , william h seward , former governor of new york state , united states senator , and us secretary of state during the civil war and for the father of decedent , brigadier general william h seward \( seward s work as a cabinet member was recently depicted in the film lincoln \) but seward s greatgreatgrandson , ray messenger , has now gone to state surrogate s court to block the sale and to seek appointment as an administrator of william henry seward iii s estate we want to see the painting put back on the wall and the ownership transferred to the seward museum , he said a sale of the painting must be approved by the court and evaluated by the state attorney general s office the emerson foundation , with assets of 75 million according to its most recent tax return , donates about 4 million a year in support of a variety of causes , like education and hospitals as well as the museum in 2008 the foundation set up the house as an independent institution so that the museum might qualify for financial support from new york state at the time it had an appraisal done to establish the value of the cole painting and other items the foundation then transferred the house and its contents except for the cole painting to the newly incorporated museum but continued to pay the bulk of its operating expenses we left that back because we knew there was a lot of value there and really were n't sure what we were going to do , anthony franceschelli , the foundation president , said of the painting the board of the newly created museum was told at the time that the foundation would hold onto the cole until it decided what to do , though the decision was not otherwise made public the current museum board has since approved the sale we worked in lock step with them , mr franceschelli said of the museum board daniel j fisher , president of the seward house , said that the proceeds from the sale would help ensure the museum s financial future and independence we are overreliant on one source of funding , he said , referring to the foundation s contributions to the operating budget , which is now 480 , 000 a year mr fisher declined to say how the proceeds of the painting s sale would be apportioned between the museum and the foundation mr franceschelli said that the foundation worried that the artwork might be damaged if the roof leaked or a tree branch broke through a window or a museum visitor fell into it he said that the foundation hoped the painting would end up in a museum , preferably one in new york state critics say the decision to sell portage falls on the genesee is misguided this painting is much more than an asset , said a recent in the auburn citizen , which has been tracking the dispute for weeks it s fundamental to this city and this state s history the thought of it hanging in the private gallery of a wealthy collector is , to be frank , revolting seward family members said that the museum s financial uncertainties have been overstated , as have the potential risks from water damage or other threats none of that has been an issue in that part of the house , said ms pearsall the museum is chartered by the , which curtails how museums may use money from the sale of a painting , known as deaccessioning several such recent sales have been controversial because museums used the proceeds to pay operating expenses , which is not allowed but deaccessioning rules do not apply to the cole painting because it is owned by the foundation , not the museum we looked at it and found out it is not in our purview , said harry phillips iii , a regent still , some said that the museum s support of the decision to sell the painting is objectionable the larger issue is the professional issue , not whether the regents can slap them on the wrist , mr botwinick said to the extent that the house represents the seward legacy there are few items that could be more important mr franceschelli said the decision to take the painting out of the house was made after four years of planning and that the family has not been supportive of the house financially over the years they have n't been involved , he said the family disputed that account sue messenger , ray s wife , said that the family had made contributions in the form of artifacts returned to the house to be part of the collection she said the painting symbolizes more than can be measured by its mere value as a commodity it s really the centerpiece of the house , she said it s also a major piece of new york history , of american history
andy pettitte was at home thursday night when he and , in turn , the yankees were reminded once again of their collective fragility the 40yearold pettitte was getting off his couch when his lower back locked up pettitte had been scheduled to pitch sunday instead , he hoped to pitch tuesday or wednesday , should his muscle spasm ease , manager joe girardi said on friday girardi brushed off questions about pettitte s age or the weather being a factor it just happened , girardi said in the third inning tuesday night , pitching against the indians , pettitte first felt tightness in the center of his back but he felt he was able to get the ball fairly where i wanted to , he said , so he gutted through it and lasted seven innings , getting his second win of the season in the yankees 141 victory the next day , his back was sore and he got treatment on thursday , he felt fine during his bullpen session but on thursday night , as he got off his couch , his back locked in a different spot , slightly lower from where he felt tightness on tuesday he had a hard time moving standing at his locker , another yankee addressing another injury , none of which can been deemed insignificant , pettitte was asked if his back worried him there s no doubt , he said , adding it s frustrating you don t ever know i had seven weeks of spring training , not one problem it is a worry for me , but i want to be healthy and i want to make my starts yet , i also know it is just a muscle spasm , and if it goes away i m going to be fine to pitch pettitte pitched masterly in his two starts , allowing two runs in 15 innings back spasms is something that comes up , said girardi , who got them about once a season when he was playing if it reoccurs all the time , then it becomes a concern , he said but i ve had them plenty in my lifetime , didn t think that it was going to keep me from playing it might knock you out for a few days hopefully , it s just a onetime event ready to return to the field the bronx was cold and chilly friday afternoon , the wind whipping , the dirt behind home plate still damp from the rain , as the yankees lounged in the clubhouse before their game against the baltimore orioles their previous two games in cleveland had been postponed because of rain , and the mood in the clubhouse was sleepy but anxious seems like we were in a clubhouse for two straight days , joe girardi said and when we weren t in the clubhouse , we were in the hotel because it was raining wednesday s game was called off quickly , so the players were not bothered too much , lyle overbay said but on thursday , after about an hour delay , the players were told the first pitch would be at 8 30 pm , overbay said they started to loosen up , then were told the game was back on hold about 30 minutes later , the game was called all the while , they tried to keep busy a few bullpen pitchers played cards other baseball games were on tv some of them watched the replay of the first round of the masters they were back in new york by about 12 30 am earlier than they would have arrived had the game been played on friday afternoon , the second round of the masters was on tv as overbay discussed the twoday break before the postponements , the yankees had scored 32 runs , and hit nine home runs , in their previous three games coming back , overbay worried about their timing you get so used to seeing pitches , he said now all of a sudden , you take two , three days off , it s tough you hope to take that first atbat to try to get it ironed out , see where you re at girardi , too , worried about rust we were playing pretty well at the time , he said hopefully , it carries over
, a photographer whose intimate images from the front lines of war , the streets of chicago s south side and his own family life in the middle of the 20th century , died on wednesday at his home in orinda , calif he was 94 his death was confirmed by his granddaughter inga miller gilbert mr miller , the chicagoborn son of a doctor and a nurse , was given a camera as a high school graduation present and a few years later enrolled in art school quickly determining that it did not suit him , he joined the navy , and that , perhaps surprisingly , was where he got his first real chance to do what he wanted to do to photograph mankind , he once put it , and explain man to man mr miller was one of a halfdozen photographers asked by the photographer and curator to join a special navy photography unit he had formed during mr miller traveled the world in his new role , capturing american soldiers in battle from the philippines to the south of france , hopscotching his way through combat zones with rare freedom for a soldier he was among the first americans to photograph hiroshima after the atomic bomb was dropped in 1945 one of his bestknown images is of a wounded airman being pulled from a damaged plane mr miller had been scheduled to be on that plane a photographer who had asked to replace him was killed after the war , mr miller returned to chicago , where , living on grants from the guggenheim foundation , he spent three years photographing black life on the city s south side in the wake of the great migration of blacks from the south he photographed construction workers , families living in shanties , a little girl on crutches he did not treat his subjects as art objects he identified them , if not by name then by their job or task or where they lived the project was formally titled the way of life of the northern negro his pictures have none of that title s polite anthropological squeamishness , the critic margo jefferson wrote in 2001 in the new york times about a book by mr miller published in 2000 that featured images from the project miller s work is intimate but never presumptuous each blackandwhite image retains its mystery , ms jefferson wrote you realize there is more to know about this community than a camera s eye or ours can find it is part of his gift that he knows this , too mr steichen recruited mr miller again in the early 1950s to help him organize an ambitious exhibition at the museum of modern art , that show , which included more than 500 photographs taken by more than 250 photographers in 68 countries , was intended , as carl sandburg wrote in a prologue to a book of the same name , to portray one big family hugging close to the ball of earth for its life and being the exhibition , and the book published shortly afterward , included that mr miller had made showing his wife , joan , in labor , then giving birth , then nursing their son david the doctor delivering david is mr miller s father , who had given him that first camera wayne forest miller was born on sept 19 , 1918 he studied banking at what is now the university of illinois at urbanachampaign , and later enrolled at the art institute of los angeles mr miller worked as a freelance photographer for life , ebony , national geographic and other publications for many years he also took pictures for a baby s first year , by dr benjamin spock and john b reinhart in 1958 he published the world is young , which captured the lives of his four children growing up in orinda from 1962 to 1968 he was president of the magnum photos collective in addition to his granddaughter ms gilbert , his survivors include his wife of 70 years , the former joan baker four children , jeanette , david , peter and dana blencowe eight other grandchildren and a greatgranddaughter mr miller largely stopped working as a professional photographer in the 1970s and took up the cause of protecting ancient redwood forests in northern california he replanted many acres of trees on his own land and helped found , which successfully lobbied for changes to state laws to encourage forest preservation
all composers draw upon various musical styles very few are completely original the challenge is to fashion the diverse influences into a distinctive voice it is hard to describe what makes a composer s voice authentic , but you know it when you hear it has a voice , a muhly sound , and it comes through consistently in his opera two boys , a dark , ambitious and innovative work that had its on monday night at the metropolitan opera with a libretto by the acclaimed playwright craig lucas , the opera , based on real events 10 years ago in manchester , england , tells the story of a 16yearold boy who nearly killed a younger boy egged on , the attacker claimed , by mysterious people he encountered in an internet chat room commissioned by the met , two boys was in london in a coproduction with the english national opera in 2011 and was significantly revised for new york the director staging , which employs inventive projections and animation from 59 productions , is suitably fluid , ominous and shadowy the dreamlike set by michael yeargan consists of movable black walls that slide into position and double as projection screens mr muhly , just 32 , is the the met has ever commissioned before two boys , during the james levine era of more than 40 years , there had been only five commissioned operas at the met mr muhly s work originated as part of the company s troubled commissioning partnership with lincoln center theater , begun in 2006 it is the first from that program to be produced so there has been inordinate pressure on two boys to be a success it must have been deeply gratifying for mr lucas and , especially , mr muhly to receive such an ardent ovation at the end on opening night i wish i could say that two boys is that longedfor success the score , rich with intriguing harmonies and textural intricacy , shimmers in mr muhly s vivid , subtle orchestration , especially as conducted by the impressive david robertson mr muhly has acknowledged many musical influences , including britten , meredith monk , steve reich , his mentor philip glass and even certain complex modernists with his keen ear , mr muhly is able to fold these inspirations into his own style but having a compositional voice is not enough in the elusive form of musical drama that is opera the score does not sufficiently penetrate the complex emotions and shocking interactions between the characters in this story , set in 2001 mr muhly excels at conveying the obsessive world of internet chat rooms , a bazaar of masked identities , sexual yearning and fantasies several gripping choral episodes depict a frenetic multiplicity of young people mesmerized by their laptops as they communicate the choristers sing multilayered babble catchphrases of conversation in chat lingo sputtering repetitions of u there u there delivered like mumbled mantras collages of muttered phone numbers in london , these choral episodes were thought to be musically engrossing but dramatically inert , with rows of people just staring at laptops for this staging , a roster of dancers has been added , choreographed by hofesh shechter as the choristers sing , the dancers writhe and twist , all undulant slouching with jerky gyrations the idea is to convey the teeming emotions beneath the numbing chat i found the dancing distracting and a little forced two boys unfolds like a police procedural the main character is anne strawson , a detective inspector charged with figuring out why the older teenager , brian , stabbed the 13yearold , jake , who is comatose in the hospital anne s character was fleshed out after the london premiere and given a more revealing back story a hardworking , frustrated woman in her 50s , anne lives with her invalid mother and is loath to face her loneliness she is essentially computerilliterate , which is hard to believe of a detective in 2001 but she is mainly reluctant to take on this case because a boy she gave up at birth for adoption would be the same age as brian the excellent mezzosoprano sings anne , and her rich , mellow sound and expressive directness are ideal for the role still , her part has significant stretches in overlapping riffs and churning figures in the orchestra , which reveal mr muhly s debt to minimalism where anne sings slowmoving , intoned vocal lines that come across as stiff and plodding mr muhly too often conveys the drama through murmuring , ritualized episodes rather than activating the words and altering the approach to the vocal writing i wanted more bursts of conversational dialogue to alternate with the flights of searching lyricism the impressive , youthful tenor gives his all as brian , a young man struggling with his sexuality who feels oppressed by his wellmeaning parents \( here , maria zifchak and kyle pfortmiller \) and seeks refuge in chat rooms , where he can connect with other rootless youths and be what they want him to be the person who first draws him into the world of jake appears to be jake s older sister , rebecca , a toughtalking temptress sung here with brash coolness by the soprano  though jake does have an older sister , she is actually a mousy young woman who keeps running away from home it turns out that the lonely , gay and hurting jake has surrounded himself with a madeup roster of manipulating figures , including the sexually bold rebecca , a maniacal aunt fiona \( sandra piques eddy \) and a depraved and dangerous gardener , peter \( keith miller \) anne , the detective , finally realizes that jake lured brian into carrying out the horrific attack both the music and mr lucas s libretto are fairly convincing at taking us inside the mind of the troubled jake , with his suicidal wish and it is poignant to see two personifications of jake there is the idealized teenager , a lonely , goodlooking young man who seeks a romantic connection online , sung here by the boyish and solid baritone christopher bolduc in his met debut then there is the real jake , a timid , nervous , nerdy 13yearold , sung achingly by the boy soprano andrew pulver but the opera never satisfactorily illuminates what drives brian to go so far as to stab jake viciously whole stretches of brian s music are impulsive and dynamic , even though he seems too aware and decent to be manipulated into murdering a boy to his credit , mr muhly has avoided the obvious in this score there is none of the cheap melodrama of neoromantic styles that you hear too often in new operas mr muhly s musical world in this work is dreamy , hazy and strange there are wondrous passages , especially the final choral scene with all the main characters , invented and real , taking part , with ethereal and shimmering music , reminiscent of a strange church chorale but with jabs of dissonance yet the denouement does not feel earned we are left baffled by this disturbing story over all , though , this was a worthy project for the met the opera s subject is topical and important , though anything about the internet is in danger of becoming dated quickly chat rooms are already kind of pass
pierreemerick aubameyang , a striker from gabon , scored a hat trick in his debut in germany s bundesliga to give borussia dortmund a 40 win at augsburg on saturday aubameyang a 17 million offseason signing from the french club stetienne opened the scoring in the 24th minute , made the game safe in the 66th and added another in the 79th before robert lewandowski scored a penalty with four minutes left hertha berlin celebrated its return to the bundesliga with a 61 rout of visiting eintracht frankfurt , thanks to two goals each by adrian ramos and sami allagui , and one each from ronny and the germanamerican defender john anthony brooks brooks recently declared his international allegiance to the united states bayer leverkusen won , 31 , at home over freiburg hannover beat nineman wolfsburg , 20 , at home and nuremberg drew , 22 , at hoffenheim insisting it deserves the chance to stage the world cup , soccer officials in qatar responded to comments by an english official suggesting that fifa consider taking the 2022 tournament away from the desert nation greg dyke , the new chairman of the english football association , upset the qataris by arguing that the heat in the emirate could be very dangerous and calling on fifa , the sport s world governing body , to find a new location for the world cup or anger european leagues by rescheduling it in the northern hemisphere s winter concerns about qatar s plans have mounted since its bid prevailed in 2010 despite being declared high risk by fifa s inspection team , which highlighted the summer heat in the persian gulf where temperatures can hit 120 degrees fahrenheit but the qataris insisted saturday that they could deliver soccer s biggest event and that the 2010 vote was the right decision football is the most popular sport in the middle east and the people of our region deserve the opportunity to have history made in their part of the world , the qatar world cup supreme committee said in a statement we are committed to delivering on the promises we made in our successful bid we are ready to host in summer or winter although the english fa is open to rescheduling the tournament for the cooler winter in qatar , england s premier league is against any changes that would disrupt its augusttomay season the fifa president sepp blatter recently agreed that his executive committee should consider in october whether the event should be moved to the winter , having described a summer tournament in qatar as not rational and reasonable qatar planned to counter the extreme heat by building airconditioned stadiums , but potential health concerns remain for players , fans and officials traveling around the country an issue the organizers did not address on saturday qatar prevailed over rival bids from the united states , japan , south korea and australia to land the world cup austria s leading international goal scorer , toni polster , was fired saturday by lastplace admira wacker after only three league games polster , who scored 44 goals in 95 appearances for austria , was dismissed one week after a 71 defeat by promoted gr dig left his team in last place of the austrian bundesliga with three straight defeats and 11 goals conceded the assistant coach oliver lederer took over from polster barcelona said that lionel messi would miss the final friendly match of its preseason tour of asia with a muscle strain in his left leg with messi out , the club said that the brazilian striker neymar would start saturday s match against malaysia xi at the shah alam stadium two mexican league players who tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol have escaped punishment after the substance was traced to contaminated meat , the mexican football federation said because of the exceptional circumstances , no suspension will be applied , the federation said in a statement given that no doping rule was broken and that the players asked to keep their identity confidential , the names of the players will not be made public the tests took place between july 19 and 21 in 2011 , five members of the mexican national team tested positive for clenbuterol , also traced to contaminated meat , at a training camp held shortly before the concacaf gold cup none of the five were allowed to take part in the tournament although they were later cleared of any doping offense more than 100 players tested positive for the substance during the under17 world cup held in mexico in the same year they were also acquitted of any wrongdoing after fifa said they were victims of a health problem in the country mexican authorities admitted at the time that the country has been affected by the practice of injecting cattle with the anabolic agent , which is banned by the world antidoping agency
once upon a time , the national hockey league s owners locked out their players it really was n't that long ago , only a matter of months but in the midst of a particularly gripping stanley cup finals series between chicago and boston , two clubs from traditional hockey markets , it seems now like ancient history , if it is remembered at all the only lockout references one hears now involve the delay in the league s draft , which will take place at the prudential center in newark next sunday , about a week later than usual , and the announcement of the league s major individual awards before games 2 and 3 last saturday and monday and only because the annual televised awards show from las vegas was a lockout casualty from september to january , while the lockout wore on , some predicted the league s fans would punish the owners and players by staying home and not tuning in but as basketball fans did after the nba s 2011 lockout , nhl fans came back immediately and in droves nhl teams played to 975 percent capacity , and average attendance was 17 , 768 , up 26 percent compared with last year s fullseason figure average attendance for 25 of 30 teams was up or equal to their full season 201112 attendance average there were healthy leaps in regularseason network television audiences on both sides of the border nbc s viewership increased 15 percent \( compared with a 201112 figure that omits the winter classic , which was canceled this season because of the lockout \) , and nbc sports network posted an 18 percent jump , for the nhl s strongest national cable audience since 199394 on local television , 22 clubs had double or tripledigit percentage increases in viewership stanley cup finals viewership is also up in both the united states and canada , with nbc and nbc sports network averaging 5356 million viewers over the first four games , the largest network audience in the united states since that figure was first tracked in 1994 rather than channel their rage against the league , fans have turned the channel to its games it s all quite a contrast to the nhl s other lockoutshortened halfseason , 199495 , in which attendance was flat and american viewership decreased in addition , the hockey was rarely entertaining and the poorly contested playoffs in 1995 limped along once the first round ended , with four of the seven remaining series including the devilsred wings finals resulting in sweeps and none going the full seven games not only has this most recent lockout become a nonissue , its results have been seamlessly incorporated into the game s landscape , something that would have been hard to fathom during the contentious months of negotiation for example , among the most spirited discussions in hockey circles is which famous , wealthy players will be let go under the compliance buyout provision of the new collective bargaining agreement there has already been one such buyout announced flyers forward danny briere was bought out last week , shaving 65 million from philadelphia s payroll and making briere a free agent rangers fans are mulling the possibility of center brad richards getting similar treatment brian cooper , the president of the toronto sports management company se sponsorship group , was one of many business analysts who said the lockout , coming so soon after the lockout that wiped out the 20045 season , would hurt the nhl s business what people want from a brand is consistency of product , accessibility and emotional connection that s uninterrupted , he said in december but , cooper also pointed out , the nba came back from a truncated season and had its best metrics across the board if that can happen , maybe the nhl can come back too , he said that is what commissioner gary bettman and the owners were counting on , and that is what happened they shut the league down , achieved their goal of sharply reducing the players' share of revenues , and came out the other side with no lasting damage to the league s image we recovered last time because we have the world s greatest fans , bettman said in august , just before the lockout commentators reacted in high dudgeon at the time , but bettman had it right when the actual hockey got started , the lockout would be forgotten now the stanley cup may wind up going to the bruins , who are owned by jeremy jacobs , chairman of the nhl board of governors and the chief hardliner during the lockout at least in a business sense , that would be a fitting end to a highly unusual season

many were delighted by john podesta s decision last week to join president obama s white house staff , none more so than the environmental community and the people in charge of the federal agencies that are most responsible for the environment as counselor to the president , mr podesta , who served as white house chief of staff during president clinton s last three years , will have a broad portfolio touching on the economy and congressional relations but his biggest contribution will be to bring his passion on environmental and energy issues to a president who has to be constantly reminded of their importance mr podesta s appointment should further elevate the issue of climate change in the white house that is something he cares deeply about it is also an issue that mr obama has committed himself to mr podesta s main task will be to give the environmental protection agency the support it needs to devise new rules controlling greenhouse gases from new and existing power plants , a complex and politically fraught task and his very presence could influence mr obama s thinking on the proposed pipeline from canada s oil sands even though mr podesta has said that he will recuse himself from the final decision because the liberal think tank he founded 10 years ago , the center for american progress , has been unsparingly critical of the entire enterprise mr podesta can be of particular assistance to the interior secretary , sally jewell ms jewell , an engineer by training , had earned widespread praise as chief executive of rei , the recreational equipment retailer and the nation s largest consumer cooperative but in her present job , there are enemies everywhere , and , unlike most of her predecessors , she came to it with little political and policy making experience , and no strong connections to the white house mr podesta could help her fill those gaps , not least because he believes deeply in the interior department s mission it was at his urging , and that of interior secretary bruce babbitt , that mr clinton became something of a bornagain environmentalist in his later years , promoting everglades restoration , protecting vast areas of the national forests from commercial exploitation , saving redwood forests in california and establishing a dozen or so major national monuments by presidential proclamation crucially , mr podesta also persuaded mr clinton to veto any congressional attempt to undercut basic environmental law \( urgent memo to mr podesta a water resources bill doing just that to the bedrock environmental policy act could soon land on mr obama s desk \) the clintonbabbittpodesta partnership left a remarkable legacy on land conservation ms jewell has said she wants to do the same thing in a speech to the national press club in october that a nervous environmental community found reassuring , she said that if congress would not move forward to protect ecologically valuable public lands , the administration would do so unilaterally but the task of protecting public lands is formidable , and the opponents of enlarging them , which include the oil and gas industry , are powerful and wellheeled to realize her vision , ms jewell will need president obama s full support which is another way of saying she will need mr podesta
over the last few years , the government of canada led by stephen harper has made it harder and harder for publicly financed scientists to communicate with the public and with other scientists it began badly enough in 2008 when scientists working for environment canada , the federal agency , were told to refer all queries to departmental communications officers now the government is doing all it can to monitor and restrict the flow of scientific information , especially concerning research into climate change , fisheries and anything to do with the alberta tar sands source of the diluted bitumen that would flow through the controversial keystone xl pipeline journalists find themselves unable to reach government scientists the scientists themselves have organized public protests there was trouble of this kind here in the george w bush years , when scientists were asked to toe the party line on climate policy and endangered species but nothing came close to what is being done in canada science is the gathering of hypotheses and the endless testing of them it involves checking and doublechecking , selfcriticism and a willingness to overturn even fundamental assumptions if they prove to be wrong but none of this can happen without open communication among scientists this is more than an attack on academic freedom it is an attempt to guarantee public ignorance it is also designed to make sure that nothing gets in the way of the northern resource rush the feverish effort to mine the earth and the ocean with little regard for environmental consequences the harper policy seems designed to make sure that the tar sands project proceeds quietly , with no surprises , no bad news , no alarms from government scientists to all the other kinds of pollution the tar sands will yield , we must now add another the degradation of vital streams of research and information
the term transdisciplinary is heard a great deal but what does it actually mean \? does it go beyond using text in your dance piece , or video in your play \? does its very nature ask artists to question our understanding of genre , or to destabilize what it is that audiences think they are seeing \? the notion of breaching borders is written into the name of the french institutealliance fran aise s annual festival , which wraps up this weekend the event s curators take pains to position their artists within a larger , fluid network of influences , beyond traditional categories there is a distinct political tenor to this stance , a challenge to audiences to move beyond conventions and limitations \( this stance has , of course , been fashionable enough in recent years to have developed its own conventions and limitations \) to meet its challenge , spectators must also reinvent or at least reexamine themselves in a crossing the line lecture , the british artist , writer and director described the expectations of a traditional audience , what he called the season ticket holders in his talk , which was delivered by the actress kate valk , he said of the sometimes bewildered responses to his work they know how to read robert wilson , or pina bausch , but faced with this it looks too much like what \? like nothing \? like mess \? that they do n't see decisions \? i 've been thinking about these issues and questions in recent weeks , particularly while watching festival events from nature theater of oklahoma , annie dorsen and mr etchells artists who are deeply informed by the same theater traditions they 're pushing against none of them presented traditional plays , and yet they 're all examining our relationship to an essential element of plays language here is mr etchells again , speaking of the clumsy homemade animism within a performance the mysterious process of inhabitation , of giving voice especially when it comes to text , this is an interest that goes across all the areas of my work from theater performance to visual art and fiction what is it that makes a text present , what makes it take \( or make \) a place in space and time mr etchells could n't be present himself in new york because of illness hence ms valk as his avatar but this reallife difficulty was artistically serendipitous after all , in this mysterious process of inhabitation as she works with the wooster group to give historical texts new , unexpected lives the wooster strategy relies on juxtaposition and collage , often across genres , to make the familiar strange and , therefore , present once more you saw this strategy in ms dorsen s crossing the line offering , here was karaoke with a wonkish twist instead of pop songs , individuals tackled speeches by the likes of margaret thatcher , osama bin laden and the 2007 miss teen usa contestant from south carolina how do you make material so widely read or youtubed truly visible once again \? one possibility take it out of its natural habitat there was something bracing about hearing winston churchill s we shall fight on beaches speech delivered in the humid , badly lighted karaoke cave near union square , surrounded by an uneasy mixture of jaded performancegoers and nonplused members of a birthday celebration \( that party soon beat it , though not before some ended up participating \) the setting was disorienting , as was the use of machines a favorite dorsen move to mediate human speech ms dorsen s tactics are transdisciplinary they also belong to a timehonored theatrical tradition characters and incidents from ordinary life , from our immediate surroundings , being familiar , strike us as more or less natural , bertolt brecht explained in 1940 alienating them helps to make them seem remarkable to us brecht would recognize the game being played in nature theater s presentation of life and times , which has for its script the verbatim , rambling transcription filled with um and like of one woman s telling of her life it will eventually stretch to 16 hours crossing the line presented episodes 45 and 5 , which take the forms of and a sexually explicit illustrated book made in the style of an illuminated manuscript these are obvious genre departures from the previous staged episodes of this personal epic yet , in other ways , nature theater is sticking to its script traditional theater is often derided by more adventuresome artists as so much you could make the case for 45 and 5 as televised and read theater there is the nagging sense that , having hit upon a fresh way of making people hear the everyday , nature theater is now settling complacently into that way of working or perhaps it is that yesterday s remarkable is today s familiar the more i hear life and times , the less i hear life and times and so , back to mr etchells in addition to his lecture , crossing the line presented his nofrills monologue sight is the sense that dying people tend to lose first performed by the inimitable jim fletcher , sight was the most recognizably playlike event in the festival it was also the most quietly strange and compelling as mr fletcher stood , widelegged , in the french institute s intimate tinker auditorium , making occasional eye contact with audience members and calmly delivering deceptively straightforward observations , timeworn truisms and almost non sequiturs , it became clear how even the simplest words can mean so much , and how badly they can fail a story is a lot of words and sometimes pictures arranged in a certain order to keep children happy , mr fletcher stated and the human brain is not really like a computer and karaoke is more tricky than it seems by alienating these sentences from surrounding contexts \( another sort of linecrossing \) , mr etchells and mr fletcher gave them a fierce , different sort of life this is one way to make the traditional contemporary not to make it new , but to make it present

to the sports editor re for rodriguez , suspended animation 12 other players agree not to fight mlb punishment , aug 6 the suspension of alex rodriguez was deserved his storytelling and denials have done nothing to promote what credibility , if any , he has left as the only player contesting his suspension , he looks even more foolish arod should just go quietly into the sunset and reflect on why , having been paid such an enormous amount of money , he found the need to cheat fortunately , he owns no major league baseball records that would be tainted  to the sports editor if major league baseball , its owners and the players union ever come to their senses , they would include a mandatory clause that voids any player s contract if he is convicted of taking banned substances i'm not pretending that this would eliminate the problem , but it would be akin to an effective publicservice message to all young , aspiring major leaguers that taking illicit drugs could make their field of dreams evaporate  to the sports editor i am no fan of arod , whether or not he can be called a real yankee but i am drawn to his defense by the derisive scolding to which he has been subjected granted , this is a man who has betrayed his exceptional talent and his promise to the sport who has , if the charges are true , fundamentally blown it is there no room for compassion here , or must he be relegated to the role of selfpreoccupied object lesson for the ages \? i am sure alex rodriguez feels mightily the weight of his mistakes and knows that this remaining wisp of a season may well be his last can we not let him play it out with whatever dignity and resolve he can summon to help his team \? as dylan said , we all wear the same thorny crown  to the sports editor a 50game penalty hardly makes a dent for a player earning millions per season a one strike and you are out rule will end all cheating with drugs this is the only real deterrent to end doping in sports  to the sports editor clearly , major league sports do not have the ability to police themselves effectively , as there is a slight conflict of interest in their doing so it is time for a single , transparent federal agency to be responsible for screening all professional sports let s clean this up once and for all so we can get back to playing games on a level field , to the sports editor the fans should remember that none of the current bunch of suspended players failed a drug test , and only the testimony of a supplier scared them into accepting suspensions it s likely that many other players who used different suppliers are using growth hormones and other performanceenhancing drugs and are free as birds to keep using them a handful of players may be caught , but the clever chemists will find ways to defeat any test that major league baseball can come up with the best and fairest solution may be to let the players use whatever drugs they want to and stop pretending they are role models for children  to the sports editor alex rodriguez and the powers that be in baseball deserve each other neither protected the game , and those who have played the game honestly and the fans who want to believe in the integrity of their game have not been well served arod will eventually disappear from the scene , as have a number of stars who misused drugs to enhance their success , and as will the baseball executives who failed in their duties as for the fans , most know that even after the worst of seasons , there is always next year  to the sports editor alex rodriguez used substances that were banned or are about to be banned he tried to cover up his involvement with the biogenesis clinic and has stonewalled baseball for the past year he was rightfully suspended by commissioner bud selig and must face his punishment the fact that the labor agreement between owners and players allows him to appeal is a disgrace if the yankees insist on playing him , i will refuse to watch if he does well and they win , i will feel like it does n't count if he plays poorly and they lose , it is just but does not satisfy me as a yankees fan so , i feel that i am in a nowin situation i suggest that all yankees fans boycott games until this cheat admits his offenses and serves his suspension until then , the yankees are just as complicit and should not receive our support  to the sports editor knowing full well the deceitfulness the selfishness and the narcissistic behavior of alex rodriguez , the yankees' organization could not muster one ounce of integrity and decide to not play arod how hoggish and selfindulgent the yankees are , knowing a cheat might help them win a few more games and raise their television ratings what a sad chapter in yankees history  to the sports editor official records now show that lance armstrong has won the zero times a truly meaningful penalty for baseball cheats would be to expunge their names from past awards and perhaps engraving an asterisk on the yankees' 2009 world series trophy would encourage team owners to open their eyes  to the sports editor re between players and doping , a valet seen as middleman , aug 7 michael weiner , the executive director of the players union , holds juan carlos nunez , a lowly employee at the aces agency , responsible for the suspensions of six players while going out of his way to exonerate sam and seth levinson , who hired nunez weiner is clearly in denial about the misuse of drugs , the outrage that is sweeping the game and the complicit stance that the union has taken he should be barred from making further comments and required to absent himself from any further participation in the process to the sports editor re root for rodriguez \? league s power grab makes it tempting , sports of the times , aug 2 we have spent too many years questioning greatness clemens , bonds , mcgwire and sosa , braun and rodriguez we are left with far more asterisks than exclamation points arod , like so many of the others , is an unsympathetic character in this longrunning play although he may be a scapegoat for a sport that turned a blind eye to its own imperfections , his immense wealth pales in comparison with his even larger ego like roger clemens and barry bonds before him , he is driven by an insatiable desire to be anointed even though ownership may be an unindicted conspirator , i will shed not a tear for rodriguez and his hundreds of millions if he is punished for making the game less , by trying improperly and imprudently to make himself more  to the sports editor it seems quite absurd to characterize major league baseball s tepid oversight of the steroids era as bullying alex rodriguez has made a king s ransom off a career forged in lies and cheating , aided by his many enablers along the way in this regard , he has occupied a space more akin to the decidedly unlevel playing fields of wall street or k street as with those examples , in which ideals like public interest and democracy become tropes of the past , a cherished national pastime becomes usurped by greed and selfdealing those who care about integrity of baseball , and about basic issues of justice and fairness , would like to see ryan braun and rodriguez unable to profit from their con
has grown into a multisponsored , millionfooted behemoth , the urge to reduce each season to a few personalities has become ever more absurd , and more necessary you have to believe there are some actual people under all those piles of money last season , the sport gave us texas am quarterback johnny manziel the first freshman heisman trophy winner and the only quarterback to beat the machinelike alabama crimson tide in 2012 , manziel was a marvel of watchability talented when everything worked but a real genius of the busted play , one of football s great disaster capitalists and as we learned in the offseason , manziel s gift for improvisation extends well beyond the field , into bars , casinos , fraternity parties and twitter for pundits facing seven long , dry months of injury reports and replay footage , manziel was a windfall the last college player to attract this level of attention was tim tebow , but tebow was famous without being all that interesting he was nice and polite and dependable , and at 2 am on a saturday , you pretty much knew where he was in recent weeks , manziel s flirtation with catastrophe appeared to be blossoming into a fullfledged romance after an espn report that he charged fees for autographs if proved , the allegations could blow up his college career or they could lead to a backlash over the ncaa s rules on amateurism and blow up the whole system either outcome would make a sort of sense i was in hoover , ala , a few weeks before all this came out , and stopped by the annual southeastern conference media days carnival to watch him up close after kevin sumlin , the texas am coach , faced the stern accounting of reporters \( i guess johnny has n't tweeted in more than a month did you have anything to do with that decision \? \) , manziel was brought out , clearly unhappy about the chore but flashing his muppetlike grin his answers were fine he talked about hype , focus , hanging out with the rapper drake but sticking to the script was never his appeal , so reporters trailed manziel from interview to interview in hopes that he would start adlibbing chase goodbread of did get something good enough to broadcast on twitter , early in the morning when manziel was at espn s college gameday set and turned to a cameraman standing nearby nice pants , he said the next day , nick saban came college football is a coach s sport , and i suspect this is one reason it inspires its most intense loyalty in the deep south the south , like certain postsoviet republics , has long had an inclination for the autocrat , the personality cult , the big daddy huey long , george wallace , leander perez , the whitesuited planter baron , the omnipotent smalltown sheriff bear bryant , of course it is at the university of alabama where the doctrine of the primacy of the coach has perhaps its purest expression there are people living right now whose given names are bear and saban , the way ancient egyptian children were named after kings there may be some parents in michigan who named their son schembechler , but i have not heard of them since the first heisman was awarded , in 1935 , seven notre dame players have won , while notre dame has claimed eight national championships oklahoma s heismantochampionship ratio is five to seven ohio state s is seven to seven this is a nice balance of individual and institution the tide s heismantochampionship ratio in this period is 1 to 11 we , the fans , boast about this now we have saban saban s control over the program at alabama is unparalleled but that control is just a logistical extension of his coaching philosophy , which is called the process , a name it happens to share with the argentine military dictatorship the process is a way of thinking about effort and achievement that goes beyond football , and so it shapes every aspect of an alabama player s life the ideal process disciple knows he is part of a larger system and is wholly committed to his role within that system , regardless of the chaos around him or the scoreboard or the importance of the game the refrain is consistency , doing the right thing the right way the right time all the time , saban said in his media days appearance it is all very ancient sparta , with saban its lycurgus this system is made not for a jazzy freelancer but for a highly effective system quarterback , which is why there is an article every other week during the season saying that alabama s a j mccarron is more than just a highly effective system quarterback why the protest \? mccarron s national profile may be lower than , but his play approaches a coldeyed precision last year he was college football s most efficient passer , a quintessential saban statistic at media days , mccarron talked of god , family and the university , and called saban his second dad i 've always done it how it s supposed to be done that s the way i want to be remembered , mccarron said i do n't want to be remembered as some offthewalltype guy doing all this crazy stuff this is a sabanized man it is so far from johnny football it is hilarious one must be careful not to exaggerate without sumlin s airraid offense , without the stellar linemen and receiving corps , there would be none of texas am s success , and manziel has never denied that but manziel s institutional loyalty has never been of the same fiber as mccarron s , even if manziel did n't really mean it when he said on twitter that he could n't wait to leave college station , tex , the home of the aggies i 've spent a lot of time in tuscaloosa , ala , and i would find it perfectly understandable if someone looked forward to leaving it at some point , but i cannot imagine mccarron saying so , certainly not publicly manziel flourishes in sumlin s system , but the plays everyone remembers are when the system collapses and he is suddenly his own man things fall apart , the center cannot hold , the left guard is in trouble , the lines descend into anarchy and the defense is populating the backfield then a miracle occurs ! and manziel has just connected downfield for 6 points as an alabama fan , i can say a little about what this feels like to watch it feels horrible when manziel was dancing around the tide defense in last year s game , i began to think of the movie die hard hans gruber had devoted years to devising the perfect heist recruiting safecrackers , assembling the armed goons , acquiring the getaway truck and practicing the timing until the entire operation was like clockwork , precise and efficient then along comes this averagelooking guy named john mcclane , the fly in the ointment , and through smarts and agility and with a joyful irreverence , he leaves gruber s plans in shambles all over nakatomi plaza that was what it was like to watch manziel play what would the bear do with a talent like that \? coach bryant was hard on the guys that were good athletes , especially hard , said joe namath , who was suspended for the last two games of his junior year at alabama for sipping on a 7 and 7 he suggested a charitable reading of manziel s extracurriculars things could be so much more out of whack , namath said sometimes you slip up sometimes you take a chance he s taken some chances it s in his blood i 've got to believe he s somewhat of a gambler in a recent fascinating article , the web site deadspin uncovered , a story of cockfighters , wildcatters , grifters and confidence men it is a tale of the frontier , profoundly texan an immigrant family on the make , always out for the angle , deferential to no one , getting rich by the gusher rather than by the steady rhythm of the workweek or the patient austerity of savings this is not sparta i hope manziel stays lucky , namath said alabama has a middling schedule , but there are trap games , questions about the offensive line and cornerbacks les miles , the louisiana state coach , will almost certainly unveil some new and exciting tactic against the tide , possibly involving musical instruments but the biggest game of the season will undoubtedly be on sept 14 when alabama travels to texas am perhaps by then manziel s luck will have run dry , and he will have been kicked off the team , barred from playing , arrested or beaten up in a bar fight perhaps the distractions will just make him a sloppy player but i wonder if , late at night when the world is quiet , saban s concerns about manziel run deeper not as a strategic riddle to be solved , but as a more existential threat , a disruptive future that looms for a game that now submits to a large degree to order , design and control manziel s onfield success , within sumlin s system and outside it , has already contributed to an accelerated , less deliberative rhythm of play , a quickening across college football that saban has repeatedly lamented manziel s possible autographing side business has renewed questions about the fairness of not paying college athletes , which could rattle the ncaa to its foundation and his whole johnny football persona has helped along the steady uncoupling of elite players' personal brands from the institutions they play for saban may very well win in september but historically , when order has been threatened , entropy has been the longrun favorite yippeekiyay
it would certainly be a stretch to call noah rubin a workinprogress from the mold he is not lefthanded and does not play serveandvolley tennis in an era of baseline slugging he does n't throw oncourt tantrums , or at least did not lose it like mcenroe even once during his firstround junior boys' match tuesday at the  then again , there was nothing much to vent about as rubin , 17 , cruised past his german opponent , hannes wagner , 63 , 60 , for his first singles victory at the billie jean king national tennis center it may have been the secondmost significant victory of rubin s embryonic career after his victory over mcenroe , the seventime grand slam tournament winner we played four sets and i might have gotten two or three games off him , rubin said of mcenroe , who is something of a mentor and then i got him , 76 , and that s it i think he s not playing me anymore he delivered the punch line with a nice touch of sheepishness and timing so maybe he does have something in common with mcenroe , the sardonic voice of american tennis , in addition to having to compensate for his lack of size and power with an impressive blend of quickness and shot making rubin is from long island , currently rockville centre , and a product of the john mcenroe tennis academy when mcenroe launched his partnership with the sportime randall s island tennis center in 2010 , he said he wanted to challenge the industry orthodoxy that called for full immersion in the sport from preadolescence on mcenroe said he grew up playing other sports and had a relatively normal school and social life to keep myself sane his oncourt behavior may have contradicted that claim , but he contended that 21st century young players could still succeed in the sport without becoming a ward of a sunsplashed tennis academy rubin , who already had trained at another sportime club on long island , bought into the concept i always wanted to stay here and have something of a social life even though i have none , he said , again demonstrating a knack for getting a laugh i just thought it was important to have a split between tennis and family and friends inevitably , tennis at any serious level is a sport that demands a commitment to transience rubin has been taking high school classes online for the past two years he has been traveling to play tournaments about two to three weeks a month but rubin s father , eric , who taught his son tennis , said just being based at home created a more balanced experience he did n't want to go to an academy at all because he felt he had such a good thing , eric rubin said he had 100 percent of my attention i do n't put the academies down , but he was n't going to be the lone guy there he s with me in rockville centre he still hits with my dad , who s 80 he hits with me we have dinner that alone makes it more normal increasingly , rubin s and mcenroe s travel schedules have made it more difficult for them to practice together rubin works closely with lawrence kleger , the academy director he has played in several junior grand slam tournaments , reaching the quarterfinals at the 2012  rubin may be the best prospect at the mcenroe academy but the question of his size he is a slender 5 feet 9 inches raises the question of how much of a future he might have in an evolving pro game eric rubin is about 6 feet tall noah s mother , melanie , is about 58 i'm not a doctor , but i always said he s going to be 6 feet , 61 , eric rubin said , pointing out that the sport s true greats from pete sampras to roger federer to rafael nadal have been midsize by today s standards sizing up the situation more pragmatically , kleger said , he s very athletic , but if you have any way for him to grow , let me know he added , the thing , if noah does n't grow , he s got to be david ferrer ferrer , at 59 and the sport s foremost grinder , has been a consistent top10 player and is the men s fourth seed at the open by no coincidence , he is noah rubin s favorite player rubin said he remains open to accepting a college scholarship after this year mcenroe attended stanford for a year but his heart might be set on turning professional rubin s parents , who are divorcing , seem to have different takes on the most prudent approach there are wonderful opportunities on the college level , said melanie rubin , whose daughter , jessie , played at binghamton university personally , i think he should take advantage of that but that s the 64 , 000 question eric rubin called it the question of the moment he added obviously , he has a lot of opportunities i try to put it more and more on him it s his life but asked what his son had been telling people who want to know what is most likely to come next , eric rubin admitted , he s really good in saying , talk to my dad'

los angeles if was bothered that his teammate ryan dempster plunked , he found a new source of exasperation as he stood at his locker friday afternoon that people were still asking him about it ortiz , the slugger , declined at first when he was asked to clarify remarks that appeared thursday in usa today , in which he said that dempster might have awakened boston s rivals through his actions but ortiz eventually warmed to the subject , peppering his comments with a few expletives and doing his best to emphasize that he was neither criticizing his teammate nor defending rodriguez , the star with whom he had dinner last saturday , the night before he was hit all i say was i do n't think hitting arod was right at the time because that kind of woke them up and we ended up losing the game , ortiz said did i lie about that \? i think it was what everybody saw i did n't say i was mad at my teammate for hitting arod i said we got to make sure to win every game possible we 've got tampa breathing down our neck i did n't mean anything else what also irked ortiz is the possibility that the yankees , who declined to retaliate during their 96 comeback victory sunday that was sparked by rodriguez s subsequent home run off dempster , would do so during the seven games that remain between the teams boston travels to yankee stadium for a fourgame series beginning sept 5 it s up to them i 've got no control over there , ortiz said of the yankees at least they 've got a reason red sox manager john farrell maintained on friday that dempster was not trying to hit rodriguez but was just pitching him inside and as for ortiz s decision to question what dempster did \? david s comments were coming from the standpoint of not trying to give added incentive to the opponent regardless of who the opponent is at that time , said farrell , who danced around the question of whether he agreed with ortiz dempster , who is serving a fivegame suspension , worked out at dodger stadium earlier friday but then left the ballpark as mandated by major league baseball ortiz , who went hitless , was not able to provide much impact in boston s 20 seriesopening loss to the dodgers if the red sox were supposed to catch a break by missing clayton kershaw and zack greinke in this series , ricky nolasco suggested otherwise , allowing just two hits in eight innings hanley ramirez , a former red sox prospect , belted a tworun home run off john lackey , who allowed only three hits that is how the season has turned lately for the red sox , who dropped into a tie for first place in the american league east with tampa bay , which beat the yankees , 72 boston has dropped nine of its last 14 games , which may have contributed to ortiz s frustration , as for any lingering tension between him and dempster , ortiz insisted there was none ortiz said that he made his views known privately to dempster on sunday but that they had not spoken since i'm pretty sure he understands , ortiz said it s not like we 're trying to fight or i'm trying to be his dad or anything like that several red sox players have stated their displeasure with the fact that rodriguez is even able to play for the yankees while appealing his 211game suspension one of them was outfielder jonny gomes , who on friday shrugged off the possibility that ortiz s remarks , which could be seen as a defense of rodriguez , would create any lingering problems in the red sox clubhouse we 've got 25 guys with the same goal , gomes said , but i do n't think everybody sees things the same way for 162 games whatever debate ortiz has inspired within his team , he brings a solid standing as the only member of the red sox remaining from a decade ago , when the storied rivalry with the yankees reached a new level of intensity , and animus , thanks to a pair of epic american league championship series the yankees won in 2003 on aaron boone s seriesending home run in extra innings of game 7 the next year , the red sox staged a historic comeback from a threegamestonone deficit and went on to win the world series for the first time in 86 years ortiz was in the middle of all of that , often tormenting the yankees with key hits he was also present for two infamous benchclearing incidents that took place between the two teams in that period one of them involved pedro martinez s throwing the yankees coach don zimmer to the ground during the 2003 alcs then in july 2004 , jason varitek used his catcher s glove to massage rodriguez s face after what else \? he had been hit by a red sox pitch ortiz said he did not have either of those incidents in mind when he made his remarks earlier this week but the confrontation between varitek and rodriguez seemed to awaken the red sox that season at the time , they were nine and a half games behind the yankees but boston was the best team in baseball after that , playing at nearly a 700 clip for the final two and a half months of the season the dodgers were involved in two benchclearing brawls this season , which may not have sparked their run of 46 wins in 56 games but did appear to bring together a clubhouse filled with new faces dodgers manager don mattingly said , it tells you if your guys are going to protect each other , because if your guys do n't protect each other , then it causes a rift in the clubhouse mattingly added that the umpires last sunday night , should have either ejected dempster after he hit rodriguez or allowed the yankees to retaliate without being ejected then it s over , mattingly said but if you do n't let anybody retaliate , now somebody s going to get hit down the road somewhere and everybody s going to go , why \? that s why the yankees , who had begun to play well before their series in boston , followed that with a sweep of toronto before losing to the rays on friday whether the yankees can sustain their momentum is uncertain , but teams in contention are gearing for a final playoff push at this point and time in the year , farrell said , everyone is looking for ways to gain momentum , to keep momentum going in their favor , whether that s through a certain incident or adding a player that can come from many different ways and that seemed to be ortiz s point dempster might have been sending a message , but instead he might have thrown the yankees a lifeline
not so long ago , it seemed the debate over immigration reform was all about borders politicians competed to offer the most draconian solutions higher fences , longer fences , electrified fences , armies of guards , fleets of drones , moats and crocodiles never mind that the border patrol had already more than doubled in a decade never mind that many of those here illegally never hopped a fence but simply overstayed a student or tourist visa the nativist mythology has us under siege from relentless hordes striding toward arizona on , in the fevered imagination of tea party congressman steve king , calves the size of cantaloupes because they 're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert to pacify the border neurotics , authors of the bill that passed the senate last summer included 463 billion to militarize our southern flank now , with the bill stranded in the house , it seems the immigration debate is all about citizenship to opponents , the idea of offering 11plus million undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship even a 13year slog like the one envisioned by the senate bill is anathema , so politically toxic that the measure s most prominent republican sponsor , senator marco rubio , pulled back as if he 'd put his hand on a lit stove to proponents of comprehensive reform , or at least to activists on the issue , citizenship is the prize , and nonnegotiable it s beginning to look as if advocates of fixing our broken immigration system will face an unpleasant choice no bill at all , or a bill that legalizes the foreigners who are already here but does not offer most of them a chance to become citizens on capitol hill several lawmakers are quietly drafting compromises that give the undocumented millions little hope of full membership in america the first thing to note is that this is progress the republican mainstream view has moved in the last year or so , from mitt romney s selfdeportation to something considerably less callous most republicans in congress now say they can live with legalizing the undocumented as long as \( a \) we do n't call it amnesty and \( b \) we do n't reward lawbreakers by bestowing the precious gift of citizenship the second point that needs making and my times colleague julia preston last week is that while citizenship is the priority for proimmigration activists , to immigrants living here as a fearful underclass the aim is not so clear cut for many of them , the priority is to be made legal , to come out of hiding and live their lives without the threat of deportation , without the risk of exploitation by unscrupulous employers , without wondering whether your spouse will make it home at night the entire narrative behind comprehensive immigration reform has elevated the path to citizenship as this musthave component of an acceptable bill , said oscar chacon , executive director of the national alliance of latin american and caribbean communities , a network of immigrant organizations that includes many foreigners here without visas what you hear from the undocumented is we like the idea of citizenship , but what really hurts us is that we are vulnerable , that i ca n't easily get a job to feed my family , that i ca n't drive a car without being at risk , that i want to be able to visit relatives back home and come back safely just to be clear , i believe \( and so does oscar chacon \) that deliberately creating a class of disenfranchised residents goes against the american grain there are few precedents for consigning whole categories of people to a subcitizen limbo , and they are not proud moments in our history \( see the and the \) it is clearly in the public interest to have people become assimilated , taxpaying , participating stakeholders in our democracy most americans , including a majority of republicans , agree that those now in the country illegally should be allowed to eventually apply for citizenship if house speaker john boehner is willing to brave the fury of his extreme flank and put the matter to a vote , a path to citizenship stands a decent chance of passing the house with a majority of democrats and a minority of republicans you might even think republicans would want to get immigration settled and off the table so they could begin wooing hispanic voters on more favorable ground social issues , taxes , education but among the people most immersed in this issue , i ca n't find many who expect boehner to suddenly become a statesman and defy his fanatics in part , let s be honest , that s because the republican stance is , we protect america from obama it is also in part because they fear newly enfranchised hispanics will become democrats which the republicans , by opposing citizenship , make a selffulfilling prophecy so it may well be that supporters of immigration reform have to choose between half a loaf and none at all half a loaf might include a prospect of citizenship for some undocumented immigrants the socalled dreamers , who entered the country as children , and those in the military but not the majority if that s the option , should democrats swallow hard and take it \? yes , and here s why first , even without a prospect of citizenship , legalization would make the undocumented much safer from the familywrecking heartbreak of deportation , which has continued at record numbers under president obama it would free them to press for better education for their children , to approach the police when they are victims of crime , to challenge abusive employers , to seek medical care without fear of exposure some advocates of citizenshipornothing suggest that the president should simply use his prosecutorial discretion to stop deportations altogether , as he has done for the dreamers and undocumented soldiers but the public would view that as a grievous abuse of power , and congress might very well take away his authority an executive order is no substitute for a protection enshrined in the law second , the legislation has other good things going for it it puts a little sense into our archaic legal immigration system , and establishes some meaningful protection against future illegal immigration \( like holding employers rigorously accountable for assuring their workers have legal status , much more important than fortifying the border \) third , this is not the end of the story we elect a new congress in 2014 , and another in 2016 , and so on , and the electoral clout of hispanics will continue to grow i'm a firm believer in the notion of incremental change , chacon told me the best public policies look at gay rights have evolved , they did n't happen all at once and fourth , even if many undocumented workers never make it to citizenship , the injustice will last for just one generation their children are citizens by birth young latinos are reaching voting age at the rate of about i suspect many in that rising generation will remember , and punish , the politicians who decided their parents should remain less than american
at 82 , with several decades of work as a costume designer and art director , five oscar nominations \( beginning with the 1978 film days of heaven \) , an emmy \( for twin peaks \) and a lifetime achievement award from the art directors guild , patricia norris knows hollywood and its vanities actors used to pick up the phone , she said but now you call the number you re given and they don t call you back and their agent says , what do you want to talk to him about \? she replies , the fact that he won t be naked when he s in this movie while the director steve mcqueen grappled with the emotional , social and political struggles that went into 12 years a slave , the story of a free black man \( solomon northup \) kidnapped into slavery in the antebellum south , ms norris , the film s costume designer , was simply working to get clothes on the actors we made so many shirts on this , it was unbelievable , ms norris said the film has actors laboring in cane and cotton fields you d have to have maybe five or six of each piece because of what happened to them it was a magical moment of shirtmaking , she said well , cheery looking slaves don t cut it , she said a designer friend of mine called me up and asked why i used so much beige in this film it s like , i don t know it seemed right as a history buff , period films are her passion i can t do a modern movie unless it s sort of twisted , she said , to which her long working relationship with the director david lynch attests \( her oscar nominations include one for his elephant man \) other than that , they re very boring to me i m not a shopper , if you know what i mean during a recent phone call from her home in los angeles , ms norris spoke about her research and thought process behind the designs for several of the 12 years a slave characters , including northup and patsey , the slave tormented by her owner , edwin epps here are edited excerpts from the conversation the process research was very difficult because there are no photographs of slaves and if there are etchings from the period , you d think they were done by a white guy in new york because it s always the happy slave leaning against a tree eating his lunch so i just went to reading and when you figure out how people were brought there and how they tried to take their identity from them , you kind of understand the picture if you died , you were buried naked and your clothes went to the next slave it s just a matter of early goodwill , so to speak i figured , well , if i backdated like 20 years for the slaves , we d be ok so , that s what happened dressing patsey those salmoncolored dresses patsey wore that are kind of empire , i figured mommy epps got tired of them and gave them to her and patsey s nightgown is really a slip it s very simple and she had to have some clothes on her for those scenes but other than that , they would probably sleep almost naked solomon northup in syracuse free black men dressed like free white men the styles were pretty simple it was the fabrics that were better edwin epps as fabio steve said he wanted epps to be romantic , so i just made his sleeves longer and floppier and i kept thinking of fabio , which i shared with michael and we laughed a lot you know , the eppses are real nutcases in their own happy way she s so uptight and he s this , ugh , well , what was there to do on plantations in those days \? seeking out the strange the party scene was a way to do something over the top for the rich and juxtapose these poor slaves mardi gras had been going on since the 1700s , and that s what that was about the masks , some we found at western costumes in los angeles , and some we found at the metropolitan opera in new york i go anywhere they are some wonderful , strange pieces and that s what i was looking for preening kidnappers taran killam and scoot mcnairy , who played solomon northup s kidnappers loved their clothes they d really peacock around and you could make them really kind of strange at the time suits had not come in yet , so you had trousers and a waistcoat and a coat and none of it quite matched the brad pitt gamble i ve worked with brad whose character befriends solomon three or four times you d better guess right , because you re not going to see him until an hour before the fitting and he changes sizes , so you just cross your fingers steve mcqueen s faith we would discuss an overall picture , but he actually thought you knew what you were doing and that s why he hired you you d be amazed how many people don t think that you get , well , my wife buys her clothes at name a place you should go there and look and she s a 2 , and the actress is a 12 and it s like , no fortunately , he liked what i did , which was my lucky day he just wanted it to look as real as possible on her oscar chances you never know the great gatsby is there , and the academy just loves its sequins
bredasdorp , south africa as anene booysen lay dying , she whispered to her medics the name of the man who had assaulted her and left her lying in the dirt on a construction site , her bowels spilling from her abdomen zwai , ms booysen , 17 , told at least two people before she died zwai the nickname of a close friend , jonathan davids and his friends had done this to her , she said the next day , the police arrested mr davids , 22 , and another man , charging them with rape and murder the attack , in february , produced such revulsion and outrage that it quickly became a national symbol of the epidemic of violence against women in south africa , much as other recent cases have forced national soulsearching on sexual violence plaguing india , egypt and brazil with the swift arrest of two suspects , hopes were high that the attack on ms booysen would be prosecuted quickly but just as the trial was about to start last week , the prosecutors made a dramatic announcement despite ms booysen s dying declaration , they did not have enough evidence to prosecute mr davids , and he was set free we understand the sense of shock and outrage that was induced by the incident , eric ntabazalila , a spokesman for the , told reporters however , as the prosecution we can only prosecute successfully on sufficient evidence the trial of the second suspect began monday , but the failure of prosecutors to make a case against mr davids has shaken the public s faith in south africa s ability to address its rape problem and hold perpetrators accountable everybody is terribly disappointed and feels incredibly let down , said rachel jewkes , an expert on violence against women at the south african medical research council the question is , did the police really go all out to investigate \? about 64 , 000 cases of sexual assault are reported here each year , and south africa has one of the highest rates of nonpartner rapes in the world but studies show that number vastly understates the epidemic , suggesting that hundreds of thousands of cases are not reported of those that are , fewer than 10 percent result in convictions , a product , analysts say , of shoddy police work and ineffective prosecution by a criminal justice system that has largely failed to take crime against women seriously the dismal conviction rate leaves victims feeling helpless , ms jewkes said many women wonder why they should bother to report , she said like many others in bredasdorp , a dusty , remote farming town about 100 miles southeast of cape town , ms booysen had a difficult childhood her mother died when she was young , and she was passed between relatives and bounced in and out of foster homes , relatives and neighbors said she dropped out of high school , and like many young people here , where jobs are hard to come by but alcohol and drugs are omnipresent , she spent her days idly drinking cheap beer and wine with friends the day she was attacked was no different on the afternoon of feb 1 , ms booysen was at a neighborhood bar , witnesses said so was mr davids , though the two had not arrived together , and were not seen drinking together , the witnesses said another young man , johannes kana , was also there early the next morning , ms booysen was found at a construction site near her house , bleeding and near death she was taken to the hospital but died that day what happened after she left the bar is disputed in an interview , mr davids said that he saw ms booysen at the bar , but did not drink with her , did not know the people she was with and did not see when she left he said he left the bar to continue drinking at a friend s house mr kana admitted raping ms booysen , according to the government , but denies killing her he has been charged with rape and murder and is now the only suspect on trial the national prosecuting authority did not respond to multiple requests for comment in the case ms booysen s rape and murder brought a furious response the singer annie lennox led a protest march in cape town a radio station played a chime every four minutes as a reminder to listeners of how often a woman is raped in south africa politicians gave speeches expressing shock and promising tough new actions to protect women and girls from predators the whole nation is outraged at this extreme violation and destruction of a young human life , president jacob zuma said in this act is shocking , cruel and most inhumane it has no place in our country we must never allow ourselves to get used to these acts of base criminality to our women and children despite the protestations of politicians , such crimes are neither new nor uncommon a 2009 found that onequarter of men admitted to raping someone , and nearly half of those men said they had raped more than once one research study on a small town in mpumalanga province examined about 250 reported rapes from 2005 to 2007 more than half of the victims were minors arrests were made in 60 percent of the cases , but more than twothirds of those cases were dropped and never came to trial ultimately only nine of the accused were convicted , and only seven received jail sentences several men were suspects in five or six different rape cases none of those cases ever made it to court , the study found analysts point to the history and culture of south africa , a deeply patriarchal society that devalues crimes against women and where 19 years after the end of apartheid the criminal justice system is still struggling to transform itself from a security force aimed mainly at protecting the white minority into a professional crimefighting organization the police do not take rape allegations seriously and fail to perform basic detective work , like collecting forensic evidence , said lisa vetten , a researcher who worked on the mpumalanga study victims are intimidated by perpetrators , who are quickly released on bail prosecutors shy away from taking tough cases , especially those where physical evidence is not available in some cases , appellate court judges set aside guilty verdicts because they simply do not believe the victim two young men in limpopo province were convicted of raping a 17yearold girl in the bushes near her home in 2007 the girl had been walking to a public telephone when the two men waylaid her , forced her into the bushes and took turns assaulting her , according to the appeals court record but in 2012 , an appellate court judge set aside the conviction because her account of the assault has some defects which cannot be ignored the victim had failed to run away or scream to passersby , the judge said she made up the story about being raped , the judge reasoned , to explain the bleeding from the loss of her virginity it is fascinating that a judge would believe that a girl would wish to have her first sexual experience with two men she never met in a bush , ms vetten said the judge simply decided , without any real evidence to support it , that she made it up as to ms booysen s dying testimony pointing to mr davids , the prosecution has offered no further public explanation as to why the case against him was dropped mr davids , glassyeyed and reeking of alcohol in the middle of a recent afternoon , was smoking marijuana and fuming about the case he seemed to regret what happened to ms booysen , who he said was like a sister to him , and insisted he had nothing to do with the crime what was bothering him was that he spent four months in jail as a suspect , which he found devastating i have nothing left inside me to feel , he said my pain is so deep i ca n't go any further

madrid spain s national court has approved the indictment of hu jintao , the former chinese president , as part of an investigation into whether the chinese government tortured and repressed the people of tibet as part of an attempted genocide the court s decision , made thursday , follows an appeal by tibetan exile groups against a june decision by one of the spanish court s judges to drop the case instead , a criminal review panel of the national court decided to overturn the judge s decision and proceed with the indictment , given china s refusal to carry out its own judicial investigation into the allegations of human rights violations and because one of the plaintiffs , thubten wangchen , holds spanish citizenship the spanish lawsuit was filed in 2006 by a group of exiled tibetans and also targets other former leaders of china s ruling communist party , including jiang zemin , mr hu s predecessor as president the others had already been indicted it was filed in madrid because the plaintiffs also hoped to take advantage of the fact that spain s judiciary has long been at the forefront of efforts to apply universal jurisdiction to crimes involving human rights abuses retired chinese leaders do not travel abroad , and none of the indicted leaders , including mr hu , who stepped down as president in march , is likely to ever face the prospect of defending himself before a spanish court the chinese ministry of foreign affairs promptly criticized the spanish court s latest decision a spokeswoman for the ministry , hua chunying , said at a daily news conference in beijing on friday that china adamantly opposes any state or individual using issues related to tibet as a pretext for interfering in china s domestic affairs the chinese government has repeatedly rejected accusations that it has perpetrated genocide or other widespread human rights abuses in tibet , which came under the control of communist party forces from 1949 instead , china maintains that its economic support has been a boon to the region associations defending the rights of tibetans welcomed spain s judicial uturn and the decision to indict mr hu , who lost his right to immunity after leaving office this year alan cantos , the president of a spanish association called that is a plaintiff in the case , said of mr hu , the person who began the year as president of china , embraced by heads of state , kings and ministers of the economy throughout the world , is since yesterday the number one accused of genocide in tibet
new delhi snaking down one of this city s dusty back streets on a recent afternoon was a line of autorickshaws , the motorized buggies that course through this city by the tens of thousands , carrying ordinary citizens on their daily rounds unless you looked closely , you could miss the fact that they were part of a political insurgency one after another , drivers were plastering their vehicles with posters for the aam aadmi , or common man , party , which hopes to end the ruling congress party s 15year dominance in delhi in state elections two weeks from now the idea seemed quixotic at first founded last year out of the fading embers of an anticorruption street movement , the party had only one recognizable face , that of a former tax commissioner , arvind kejriwal most striking , it avoided the redmeat topics that drive most indian political forces caste , religion , region and family focusing instead on the lone issue of stamping out corruption seen from a distance , india s forthcoming state elections are a gladiatorial showdown between the congress party , which has governed india for 53 of the last 65 years , and its hindu nationalist opposition , the bharatiya janata party but aam aadmi has broken that pattern in delhi , in large part by capturing votes from the city s working poor , a fastgrowing group that has slipped out of congress s grip aam aadmi has risen steadily in the polls , startling the heavyweights and setting the stage for a genuinely triangular contest asked why they would use their vote on an untested newcomer , the autorickshaw drivers responded with a stream of grievances over bribetaking transport inspectors and thuggish police constables , but also over the price of onions , registration fees , potholes and a growing sense of disconnection between the governing class and the governed the common man is fed up , said pawan kumar , extracting from his shirt a wad of paper documenting a fine that he had contested , desperately and fruitlessly nearby stood gaurav , who said his frustration had grown so intense that whenever he overheard procongress talk from passengers , he stopped his vehicle and told them it had malfunctioned congress has been the ruling party for the last 60 years , said gaurav , who does not use a surname and who migrated with his family to delhi as a child they say all the right things , but look at the condition of the country other countries have come much farther in 60 years why do n't we have better medical facilities , educational facilities , roads \? why \? who is answerable for this \? even if aam aadmi wins only a small number of delhi s parliamentary seats a real possibility , given india s firstpastthepost system it will challenge assumptions that have long undergirded indian politics congress , with its socialist roots , addressed the rural and marginalized poor bharatiya janata , created as a party of urban traders , spoke to more affluent , urban indians , those more likely to hold hindu nationalist views but that calculation is being scrambled in the black box of urban india , where new categories of voters are coming into existence though the new party had little chance of winning the very rich \( bjp voters \) or the poorest of the poor \( congress s \) , the fat layer in the middle is expanding with waves of migration from northeastern provinces yogendra yadav , a softspoken political scientist who has become aam aadmi s main strategist , said support for aam aadmi had grown fastest among those who are a little uprooted , who come and are lost for identity , lost for a grouping those who have latched on to the common man bandwagon include many in delhi s fastgrowing informal economy this vast army of drivers , blacksmiths , locksmiths , cobblers , domestic workers , the guys who sell paan on the sidewalk , said ashutosh varshney , a political scientist at brown university voters like these interact constantly with lowlevel government officials , and their resentment has mounted to the point at which it trumps other political messages there is a certain helplessness that comes from dealing with the malfunctioning state at the street level , mr varshney said while more affluent people can telephone their way through or bribe their way through , he said , the working poor look to politicians to address their complaints they vote , and in large numbers there are still some gaping holes in the new party s platform , which is not surprising , considering the group s swift transformation from a street movement though mr kejriwal has pledged that his first major act will be arranging an independent ombudsman to look into complaints against government officials , the party has been slow to issue a clear manifesto beyond opposing corruption that has left it unclear where aam aadmi stands on basic political and economic questions dipankar gupta , a sociologist , described the party s appeal as superficial , another way of saying none of the above' as its poll numbers have improved , the party has made compromises that smack of politics as usual , alienating purists who were among its early supporters on monday , as mr kejriwal tried to counter a fresh rebuke from , the gandhian social activist who was his partner in the anticorruption movement , a man who identified himself as a hazare supporter sprang up and flung a can of black ink at his face party leaders have quietly replaced some of their common man candidates with more politically experienced ones mr yadav acknowledged that some of those decisions had been painful , but that party leaders had begun to feel this close to actually making it and become focused on running candidates who would be seen as viable to be honest , i am stunned with the response that we are getting , he said all i can say is that we have stepped into something not of our making as the last days of campaigning ticked away , earnest volunteers continued to comb delhi on aam aadmi s behalf anita pandey , 43 , was plastering kejriwal posters onto the back of autorickshaws on a recent afternoon if a driver refused , saying the police were singling out drivers who carried the poster , she hectored him cheerfully and at high volume why \? why \? she cried show courage ! if you will not show courage , who will \? she worried , though , about what would happen when party workers began blanketing lowincome neighborhoods with the freebies known here as sops , most often bottles of whiskey and 500rupee notes sure enough , a campaign worker from bharatiya janata or rather the employee of a subcontractor , adventure media showed up at the same spot a few days later , offering drivers brandnew lemoncolored canvas covers for their vehicles the covers had a retail value of 500 rupees \( about 8 \) , a day s takehome pay for many of them , and came complete with sewnon campaign posters declaring support for the bjp the drivers murmured their admiration from across the street , debating whether accepting such a thing amounted to selling their vote each of them could recall the waves of gifts that arrived in their impoverished neighborhood ahead of elections , delivered in crates to the homes of the slum s rainmakers , year after year a driver named rakesh kumar glanced over at the stack of autorickshaw covers and smiled many people will take it , and they will paint it over , he said then , he said , we will vote for kejriwal
washington as investigators sought answers to what or who may have radicalized the suspects in the bombings , leading lawmakers said tuesday that potentially important clues about at least one of the men might not have been widely shared within investigative circles months before the attack emerging from a closed twohour hearing with three senior law enforcement and intelligence officials , several members of the senate intelligence committee raised new questions about how the and the apparently handled information about tamerlan tsarnaev , 26 , the suspect who was killed in a shootout with the police on friday i'm very concerned that there still seem to be serious problems with sharing information , including critical investigative information , senator susan collins , republican of maine , told reporters that is troubling to me that this many years after the attacks on our country in 2001 , that we still seem to have stovepipes that prevent information from being shared effectively , not only among agencies but also within the same agency , in one case senator saxby chambliss , a georgia republican who is the committee s vice chairman , also voiced worries that efforts to break down barriers of communication between federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies after the sept 11 , 2001 , attacks may have started to erode there have been some stone walls and stovepipes reconstructed that were probably unintentional , he said we 're going to continue to look at whether or not all the information was adequately shared and given to all the law enforcement agencies if it was n't , we 've got to fix that senator dianne feinstein , a california democrat who heads the panel , said every investigation revealed flaws , but when asked at a briefing after the hearing if the fbi had dropped the ball , she said , no none of the senators would identify what information was not shared adequately or which agencies were involved , but the issue seemed to center on mr tsarnaev s sixmonth trip in 2012 to dagestan and chechnya , predominantly muslim republics in the north caucasus region of both have been hotbeds of militant separatists testifying earlier in the day before the senate judiciary committee , homeland security secretary janet napolitano sought to clarify what the authorities knew about mr tsarnaev s trip he left the country on jan 12 and returned on july 17 his flight reservation set off a security alert to customs authorities when he departed , ms napolitano said , in spite of a mismatch in the spelling of his name on his airline ticket , his travel document and the passenger manifest of his flight as a result of redundancies in the system , the error was detected , the secretary said , and there was a ping on the outbound to customs but when mr tsarnaev returned , more than a year had gone by since the fbi closed a background review of his possible links to extremist groups that had been requested by the russian government in january 2011 it was determined that he posed no threat the security alert at that point was more than a year old and had expired , ms napolitano said it is not clear , however , that the customs security alert , flagging mr tsarnaev s travel to russia , was ever passed on to the fbi and even if it had been , it is not certain what the fbi would have done with that information once investigators closed the background check , it would have been a violation of federal guidelines to keep investigating mr tsarnaev without additional information , a senior law enforcement official said two months after he returned from russia , mr tsarnaev applied for naturalization the application prompted homeland security department officials to review a 2009 domestic abuse arrest , and they found he had not been convicted in that case they also contacted the fbi and learned that no derogatory information on him had emerged from an interview that the agency conducted in january 2011 according to federal law enforcement officials , homeland security department officials left the naturalization pending , without approving it , as a precaution to see if new information would emerge , but they did not open a new investigation ms napolitano said that a bipartisan bill in the senate to overhaul would further tighten security , because it would require all passports to be electronically readable , to avoid errors in flight records more questions surfaced tuesday evening when house members attended a classified hearing with ms napolitano and robert s mueller iii , the director of the fbi some lawmakers emerged saying they still felt uninformed about many aspects of the case representative michael mccaul , a texas republican who heads the house homeland security committee , said he and other members of congress were frustrated by the lack of answers on why mr tsarnaev s trip to russia slipped through the cracks
washington the british say that there have been 14 syrian chemical attacks since 2012 and that the last , the most horrific , killed at least 350 syrian civilians the americans count fewer attacks , but put a stunningly higher , quite precise number on the casualties 1 , 429 the french argue that only president bashar alassad of syria and the closest members of his clan can order chemical attacks publicly , the americans say that , at least in the aug 21 attack that led president obama to call for military action , it is unclear where the orders came from in classified briefings they are far more specific in saying that the commander of syria s infamous unit 450 , which controls its chemical weapons , gave the order in short , the differences in intelligence estimates among the united states and its closest allies are considerable but , in their view , not very significant all come to the same bottom line all the attacks involved sarin gas , only the assad government had control over the chemical agents , and , whether they were premeditated or the result of sloppiness , as one senior american official put it , the results were devastating as they emerge from unclassified and classified briefings , members of congress say the obama administration s case against the assad government is convincing and leaves them with little doubt that it was responsible for the attacks even those most conscious of the intelligence errors that preceded the invasion of iraq concede that this case is different iraq was about assessing whether weapons existed , they say , while syria is all about who used them , and whether a military strike would prevent or encourage their use again more and more members of congress are finding the evidence that assad used chemical weapons compelling , said representative adam b schiff , a california democrat on the house intelligence committee , who has been briefed on the administration s evidence and is skeptical about whether the united states should intervene without the help of traditional allies the question now is , what should our response be \? still , the very public way that the americans , french , british and israelis have felt it necessary to publish their evidence even where it differs underscores the huge postiraq sensitivities involved in justifying the need for new military involvement in the mideast and until the most recent gas attack in syria , reliable assessments of the use of chemical weapons proved particularly difficult the americans say their assessment is based on multiple streams of information , including reporting of syrian officials planning and executing chemical weapons attacks , code words for intercepts of conversations it also refers to human , signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities connected to attack preparations but a look at the intelligence judgment made public by the united states , britain , france and israel suggests that the united states was reluctant and slow to conclude that smallscale chemical weapon attacks began in syria last year and even today , washington cannot agree with its allies on exactly how those attacks began the israelis were the first to press the case , declaring in an april 23 presentation at a security conference that it had clear evidence that syrian forces had used chemical weapons on a small scale but no sooner had a senior official of israel s military intelligence unit laid out his case than secretary of state john kerry , seeing the reports , called prime minister benjamin netanyahu , apparently out of concern that such a declaration would force mr obama s hand mr kerry told reporters that the israeli leader was not in a position to confirm the intelligence assessment american officials said later that they had concerns about the chain of custody on hair , blood and urine samples from some of those attacks , and feared the evidence might have been tinkered with by the opposition
what if everyone in the world could play a game at the same time \? is an ambitious mobile game that wants to make that prospect a reality and , most notably , to enable every player to understand what the others are saying while they play the game s most impressive feature is an instantaneous translation of textbased online chat if someone writes mdr in french \( for mort de rire , or dying of laughter \) , an englishspeaking player sees it as lol , the company behind the game , says it will release game of war in apple s app store sometime this month since the 1990s , a single , giant , global game has been the alluring promise of what are called massively multiplayer online games by the middle of the last decade , at the peak of virtualworld fever , edward castronova , an economist at indiana university , that we were facing the equivalent of an emigration crisis the prospect that hundreds of millions of people would be leaving this world for digital ones , where they would spend the vast bulk of their time and money and yet , while these games have indeed proved to be immensely popular world of warcraft still has more than eight million subscribers they have , for the most part , failed to follow through on the conceit that they are enormous global spaces nearly all massively multiplayer games would be better called decently large multiplayer games to begin with , the millions of subscribers for a single title are divided among millions of computer servers called shards that create a multiverse of virtual worlds that do not intersect or interact with one another for most of these games , only several thousand players compete alongside one another at a time in a single virtual place , a sciencefiction game from the icelandic company ccp games that has a halfmillion subscribers , is the most notable game to avoid having multiple shards but eve online has never had more than about 65 , 000 people playing it simultaneously that s clearly a lot , but it s well shy of seven billion game of war fire age does n't have anywhere near a billion , or even a million , players yet it s now being tested by tens of thousands of players in a beta version in australia , france , mexico , new zealand and singapore but that s the goal the basic premise of the game is we want to answer the question what does it feel like to rule the world \? said gabriel leydon , the chief executive of machine zone in order to get that feeling what does it feel like to be a napoleon \? you have to get a lot of people in the game game of war is basically a medieval farmville crossed with risk you start out with a small city that you improve by building farms , logging camps , mines , barracks for soldiers and more each action requires a certain amount of time to complete it could be minutes , or it could be hours or even days eventually , you join an alliance with up to 100 other players who help you speed up your construction and assist in simulated battles with other people s cities the game exists on a single map that includes every player s city , and the action unfolds whether you log on to participate or not i 've been playing game of war for about a week , and i found it more engaging than its closest analogue , , a hugely popular mobile game that is helping the finnish developer supercell to gross millions of dollars a day like clash of clans , game of war is free to play , a business model that allows a minority of players to subsidize everyone else s gameplay , because those players pay for optional items to make themselves more powerful or to make the game move along at a faster clip last spring , three of machine zone s games ranked among the top 50 highestgrossing apps in apple s mobile store and none of those games had the chat translation software that makes game of war s potential so intriguing a good chunk of the fun i had with the game is the notion that i was playing alongside kiwi and aussie and french players in a genuinely worldwide competition the translation software is not perfect , mind you at one point , an englishspeaking player tried to explain to me that my battering rams would be destroyed during an enemy attack by typing \( complete with misspelling \) , seige die first in defense the game interpreted it as an attempt to write in german , victories first in defense machine zone has eliminated other bugs like the translation of a player s name , medusa , into the word jellyfish in spanish most of the time , however , i had little trouble understanding what frenchspeaking and spanishspeaking players were saying , even if on occasion the translations were garbled this allows monolingual players to engage in global alliances across multiple time zones , recruiting allies in other countries to defend their cities while others sleep or go to work or \( gasp \) spend time with their families the translation software is made possible by gameplay , by the desire of the game s players to become more powerful , more respected , more famous inside the game players are given rewards for translating phrases that the system does n't understand , translations that the system later uses to improve its own performance machine zone can mint those rewards virtual silver , logs , ore , wheat and the like with impunity , and players freely and eagerly provide their labor for them in one instance , i explained to the machine zone computer that a player who wrote in chat slang , no coz i haf no lab 2dae , meant to say in proper english , no , because i have no lab today right now , the ingame text instructions and labels are published in only six languages english , french , german , spanish , portuguese and russian but it can translate players in chat rooms who use many more languages , from arabic to ukrainian whether game of war becomes the first truly global game is unknowable while it is compulsively clickable , it is not the kind of skillbased test that most dedicated gamers respect but it does seem to have cracked a formidable barrier , perhaps the final one , that stood in the way of everyone in the world being able to play the same game together , all at once i want to intensify competition , and communication intensifies competition , mr leydon said it s the difference between playing silently with someone online and playing next to somebody
politicians across the political spectrum herald job creation , but frightfully few of them talk about what kinds of jobs are being created yet this clearly matters according to the census bureau , onethird of adults who live in poverty are working but do not earn enough to support themselves and their families a quarter of jobs in america pay below the federal poverty line for a family of four \( 23 , 050 \) not only are many jobs lowwage , they are also temporary and insecure over the last three years , the temp industry added more jobs in the united states than any other , according to the american staffing association , the trade group representing temp recruitment agencies , outsourcing specialists and the like lowwage , temporary jobs have become so widespread that they threaten to become the norm but for some reason this isn t causing a scandal at least in the business press , we are more likely to hear plaudits for lean and mean companies than angst about the changing nature of work for ordinary americans how did we arrive at this state of affairs \? many argue that it was the inevitable result of macroeconomic forces globalization , deindustrialization and technological change beyond our political control yet employers had \( and have \) choices rather than squeezing workers , they could have invested in workers and boosted product quality , taking what economists call the high road toward more advanced manufacturing and skilled service work but this hasn t happened instead , american employers have generally taken the low road lowering wages and cutting benefits , converting permanent employees into parttime and contingent workers , busting unions and subcontracting and outsourcing jobs they have done so , in part , because of the extraordinary evangelizing of the temp industry , which rose from humble origins to become a global behemoth the story begins in the years after world war ii , when a handful of temp agencies were started , largely in the midwest in 1947 , william russell kelly founded russell kelly office service \( later known as kelly girl services \) in detroit , with three employees , 12 customers and 848 in sales a year later , two lawyers , aaron scheinfeld and elmer winter , founded a similarly small outfit , manpower inc , in milwaukee at the time , the future of these fledgling agencies was no foregone conclusion unions were at the peak of their power , and the protections that they had fought so hard to achieve workers compensation , pensions , health benefits and more had been adopted by union and nonunion employers alike but temp leaders were creating a new category of work \( and workers \) that would be exempt from such protections to avoid union opposition , they developed a clever strategy , casting temp work as women s work , and advertising thousands of images of young , white , middleclass women doing a variety of shortterm office jobs the kelly girls , manpower s white glove girls , western girl s cowgirls , the american girls of american girl services and numerous other such girls appeared in the pages of newsweek , business week , us news world report , good housekeeping , fortune , the new york times and the chicago daily tribune in 1961 alone , manpower spent 1 million to put its white glove girls in the sunday issue of big city newspapers across the country the strategy was an extraordinary success not only did the kelly girls become cultural icons , but the temp agencies grew and grew by 1957 , kelly reported nearly 7 million in sales in 1962 , with 148 branches and 24 million in sales , it went public meanwhile , by 1956 manpower had 91 branches in 65 cities \( and 10 abroad \) and , with sales at 12 million annually , employed some 4 , 000 workers a day in 1962 , manpower also went public , boasting 270 offices across four continents and over 40 million in sales the temp agencies kelly girl strategy was clever \( and successful \) because it exploited the era s cultural ambivalence about white , middleclass women working outside the home instead of seeking to replace breadwinning union jobs with lowwage temp work , temp agencies went the culturally safer route selling temp work for housewives who were \( allegedly \) only working for pin money as a kelly executive told the new york times in 1958 , the typical kelly girl doesn t want fulltime work , but she s bored with strictly keeping house or maybe she just wants to take a job until she pays for a davenport or a new fur coat protected by the era s gender biases , early temp leaders thus established a new sector of lowwage , unreliable work right under the noses of powerful labor unions while greater numbers of employers in the postwar era offered familysupporting wages and health insurance , the rapidly expanding temp agencies established a different precedent by explicitly refusing to do so that precedent held for more than half a century even today temp jobs are beyond the reach of many workplace protections , not only health benefits but also unemployment insurance , antidiscrimination laws and unionorganizing rights by 1967 manpower employed more workers than corporate giants like standard oil of new jersey and the us steel corporation manpower and the other temp agencies had gained a foothold , and temporary employment was widely considered a legitimate part of the economy now eyeing a bigger prize expansion beyond pinkcollar work temp industry leaders dropped their kelly girl image and began to argue that all employees , not just secretaries , should be replaced by temps and rather than simply selling temps , they sold a bigger product a lean and mean approach to business that considered workers to be burdensome costs that should be minimized for example , in 1971 the recently renamed kelly services ran a series of ads in the office , a human resources journal , promoting the nevernever girl , who , the company claimed never takes a vacation or holiday never asks for a raise never costs you a dime for slack time \( when the workload drops , you drop her \) never has a cold , slipped disc or loose tooth \( not on your time anyway ! \) never costs you for unemployment taxes and social security payments \( none of the paperwork , either ! \) never costs you for fringe benefits \( they add up to 30 of every payroll dollar \) never fails to please \( if your kelly girl employee doesn t work out , you don t pay \) around the same time , the new york agency olsten temporary help services announced a new product the semipermanent employee comparing its innovation to the wireless , the phonograph and the telephone , company leaders presented the semipermanent as a new kind of temporary employee not for days or even weeks , but for two and threemonth periods to help your business grow more profitably this new invention , olsten told businesses , would boost profits by shrinking the payroll \( to a slim , trim personnel budget , not one which chokes profitability \) by smoothing over the ebb and flow of the business cycle \( you needn t carry dead wood for months when business is slow \) and by cutting training costs \( employers would get trained personnel without having to engage in expensive and unprofitable retraining \) by peddling products like the semipermanent employee , the nevernever girl and more , temp industry leaders promoted a model in which permanent employees were a costly burden , a headache that needed relief stop paying help you don t use , western services advised in 1969 it even urged employers to convert their own permanent employees to temps , as in a 1971 advertisement in the personnel journal just say goodbye then shift them to our payroll and say hello again ! according to the temp industry , workers were just another capital investment only the product of the labor had any value the workers themselves were expendable paradoxically , this model ran counter to the conventional management wisdom of the day the same year that the nevernever girl appeared in the pages of national business journals , one of the bestselling management books was up the organization how to stop the organization from stifling people and strangling profits , in which the former avis rentacar president robert townsend argued for treating workers as valuable assets rather than headaches to be squelched the human relations school of management touted employee satisfaction as the best route to boosting profits but temp industry leaders continued to encourage companies to rent workers rather than buy them and perhaps even more persuasive than their arguments were the practical tools they were able to offer thousands of lowcost temps , without the hassle of having to hire , train , supervise and fire them becoming lean and mean had never been easier , and thousands of companies began to go the temping route , especially during the deep economic recessions of the 1970s temporary employment skyrocketed from 185 , 000 temps a day to over 400 , 000 in 1980 the same number employed each year in 1963 nor did the numbers slow when good times returned even through the economic boom of the 90s , temporary employment grew rapidly , from less than 1 million workers a day to nearly 3 million by 2000 the temp industry s continued growth even in a boom economy was a testament to its success in helping to forge a new cultural consensus about work and workers its model of expendable labor became so entrenched , in fact , that it became common sense , leaching into nearly every sector of the economy and allowing the newly renamed staffing industry to become soughtafter experts on employment and work force development outsourcing , insourcing , offshoring and many other hallmarks of the global economy \( including the use of adjuncts in academia , my own corner of the world \) owe no small debt to the ideas developed by the temp industry in the last halfcentury a growing number of people call for bringing outsourced jobs back to america but if they return as shoddy , povertywage jobs jobs designed for nevernever girls rather than valued employees we won t be better off for having them if we want good jobs rather than just any jobs , we need to figure out how to preserve what is useful and innovative about temporary employment while jettisoning the antiworker ideology that has come to accompany it , an assistant professor of sociology at the state university of new york , buffalo , is the author of the temp

during an onstage interview halfway through a on thursday night at the miller theater at columbia university , the conductor brad lubman asked the composer how he had become interested in writing microtonal music it was a simple question that might have occurred to anyone in the hall mr haas s works , some of which have become staples of the contemporary repertory , make striking use of sounds that lurk between the semitone steps of the conventional western scale mr haas sidestepped a simple answer microtones exist , he said why not use them \? anyway , it s only a problem for the conductors and performers who have to interpret faithfully pieces like his latest opera , in which mr haas used some 1 , 600 different pitches pushed gently , he divulged some history , but he had a more important point to make using microtones is not an end in itself , but a means by which to provoke strong emotional responses from his listeners the concert , the first of the theater s 25thanniversary season , served to welcome mr haas to new york , where he the composition faculty at columbia for the uninitiated , the program neatly demonstrated how mr haas s music works for the admirer , it was a chance to hear pieces other than the handful that have attracted wide attention , like in which mr haas uses lighting and its absence as provocative tools none of the three pieces played by mr lubman and the excellent on thursday followed suit still , the unusually deep , quiet darkness between them subtly recalled that facet of mr haas s oeuvre first on the bill was tria ex uno , a 2001 sextet that mr haas based on a splendid canon from the renaissance composer josquin s in the first brief section , mr haas assigns the canon s three voices to violin , cello and bass clarinet in the second , he adds flute , piano and vibraphone in a kaleidoscopic fragmentation redolent of webern mr haas s voice emerges in the third section the music is clearly derived from josquin , but mutates into sighs , gasps and shimmering cascades , awash in metallic overtones from cymbals and a tamtam next came de terrae fine , also from 2001 , a violin soliloquy prompted by an expansive view of the atlantic ocean from a house on the irish coast as olivia de prato confidently handled the work s minute , exacting tonal fluctuations , attention to technique fell away what you noticed was the music s dramatic , ceaseless roil , the otherworldliness of the sounds mr haas imagined , the joyous luminosity in a fleeting tonal chord similar devices writ large come into play in atthis , a dramatic 2009 solo scene for soprano with five strings , clarinet , bassoon and french horn intentionally , the band of schubert s octet singing verses from amorous poetry by sappho , the mezzosoprano rachel calloway gave voice to isolation , despair , longing and desire with penetrating clarity around her , the music billowed and heaved fitfully , its bruised harmonies , obsessive repetitions and sudden , stark silences an almost shockingly intimate conjuring of the emotional intensity at play in the words
melbourne , australia the year s first grand slam tennis tournament is already taking a toll , even in a year when the temperature at the australian open has rarely spiked to levels that call for a legionnaire s cap you could see it as gilles simon walked gingerly around the grounds sunday afternoon , a day after his potentially pyrrhic victory over ga l monfils you could see it as angelique kerber , the no 5 women s seed , lay flat on her stomach being treated for a back problem on a changeover during her 75 , 64 loss to the australian open upset specialist ekaterina makarova you could see it as the japanese star kei nishikori , his left leg wrapped tightly below the knee , struggled to get low for david ferrer s umpteenth ground stroke two strong legs would seem a requirement to challenge the hardrunning ferrer , and though the first few games against nishikori were hardfought , nishikori eventually lost his edge and his patience as ferrer finished him off , 62 , 61 , 64 , to become the first man in the quarterfinals for a change , none of the socalled big four are waiting for him with his spanish compatriot rafael nadal still absent because of knee problems and , this time , a stomach virus , ferrer was bumped up to a no 4 seeding and will soon pass nadal in the rankings so ferrer s opponent in the next round will not be the customary roadblocks nadal , novak djokovic , roger federer or andy murray but 10thseeded nicol s almagro of spain , who advanced when janko tipsarevic of serbia retired trailing , 26 , 15 kerber , a quick and versatile german , will have to wait for another opportunity she was one of the surprises of 2012 , but she said back pain limited her ability to serve effectively i actually feel it for like two or three days , kerber said i was thinking it will be maybe not too bad , but in the first set , i was feeling that , and it was actually worse and worse but the news has been good again for makarova in melbourne last year , she pulled off one of the biggest upsets of the season , defeating serena williams in the fourth round and she has now repeated that run to the quarterfinals but as the men and women headed out to the hardcourts on this sunny sunday , the players' lounge was still buzzing about the thirdround match between simon and monfils that had ended shortly after midnight in an era of epic men s matches , it was a new breed of marathon defensive to the point of passivity at times , featuring one rally that extended to 71 shots it required 4 hours 43 minutes for simon to finally beat his fellow frenchman , 64 , 64 , 46 , 16 , 86 , with both players receiving treatment on changeovers near the end it was too painful everywhere i do n't even know where , simon said on sunday , pointing to various parts of his body i had a cramp here , cramp here he will have to heal quickly he is scheduled to face murray in the fourth round on monday i do n't have a lot of chance to win this one , simon said
london on a particularly hot summer day in 1858 , the smell of raw sewage from the river thames became so unbearable that legislators had the curtains of the houses of parliament soaked in chloride of lime when that failed to repel the odors , members of parliament simply abandoned the place the leader of the house and chancellor of the exchequer , benjamin disraeli , was seen fleeing from the chamber , his handkerchief to his nose , according to stephen halliday in his history , the great stink of london at the time , nearly all of london s sewage ended up in the thames , which was also one of the city s main sources for drinking water , and the city endured three cholera epidemics , which killed more than 31 , 000 people the thames stank famously , and many doctors and politicians believed that it was the stench itself that caused cholera pressure grew to follow the recommendation of a prominent civil engineer , joseph w bazalgette , to build a system of tunnels that would catch the sewage and divert it farther downstream , below the capital , and construction soon got under way the tunnels of the 1 , 100mile system lined with 314 million bricks meticulously laid by victorian masons remain in surprisingly good condition today built for a city half london s current size , however , the system is now overflowing as often as once a week , raw sewage is forced into the thames , a sharp change from the 19th century , when the newly built system overflowed less than once a year the increasing flow of raw sewage the result of the loss of green spaces to absorb rainwater as much as population gain violates european environmental law , the european commission said in 2009 , and the government has promised to act but in an era of austerity and strained budgets , it is not the government that is paying the 66 billion bill but , a private company with shareholders the government is to underwrite the risk , which means that it will act as the financier of last resort in the case of major problems during the construction , but it will otherwise not pay for the new system there is a catch , of course it is actually the customers of thames water who are paying for the project with higher water bills , a prospect almost as horrendous to today s londoners as the river s stench was to their 19thcentury forebears water bills for thames water s 14 million customers in and around london are to rise to as much as 700 annually from 570 for the foreseeable future , the company said the money will be used to repay the initial investors , who will also own the new system and even then , the tunnel will remain the property of the company , a prospect that further rankles a variety of local politicians and industry experts say the plan is akin to pouring money down the drain , that construction estimates are far too low , and that there are cheaper and less disruptive alternatives the costs might end up at 10 billion pounds , or about 1616 billion , said nicholas botterill , council leader of hammersmith and fulham , districts in southwest london , and i do n't want the country to waste that much money it would also be unpleasant for people living close to the construction sites , he said even the engineer who initially planned the new sewage tunnel , chris binnie , is now saying two smaller and far less costly tunnels might suffice mr bazalgette s system cost about 6 million , now the equivalent of about 6 billion , according to thames water , but it transformed central london for example , he narrowed the thames by building victoria embankment , an elegant road and walkway that housed not only the sewerage tunnel but also one of the first subways the scope of today s planned project is no less intimidating the new tunnel would run mainly beneath the thames to intercept sewage before it reached the river and to transport it to sewage treatment plants the tunnel would be more than 15 miles long , more than 200 feet deep and large enough to fit three london doubledecker buses next to one another ann rosenberg , a retired bbc journalist , lives a block away from one of the planned construction sites for the sewer in parsons green the thing that sticks in my throat , she said , is that i will be paying for this until i die , and then my children will pay for this tunnel , which none of us will own but which will go into the asset base of thames water and its investors ms rosenberg is also concerned about other problems it s going to be intolerable and will affect people s health , she said from her threebedroom house , where she has lived for 30 years they talk about large vehicles every 15 minutes it will impact our air quality michael gerrard , the managing director of the sewerage project for thames water , said londoners have to contribute to their city s future if you want london to grow you must invest in the infrastructure , he said if nothing is done you 'll have a public health issue thames water does not deny that there will be some disturbance and said it would pay for the double glazing of residents' windows to protect against the noise or even move residents should the construction become unbearable but details of when and under what circumstances such help would be offered remained vague there will be disruptions and costs and people want it to go away , but i do n't have the power to do that , mr gerrard said i wish there were alternatives ms rosenberg and others say there are mr binnie , who recommended the new sewer in 2006 , now argues that two smaller sewers would suffice and cut costs by about 24 billion new ways to treat sewage and prediction of total sewage flows have changed over the last six years , and thames water should at least revisit its options , he said one of those options , according to , a nonprofit organization that opposes the supersewer , is to create more green spaces in the city that could naturally absorb rainwater instead of pushing it down the sewer another is to improve the water quality by injecting oxygen into the river we want the project to be looked at again , said mr botterill , the council leader we want a better environmental , social and economic solution everybody who looks at this seriously comes to the conclusion that it s not the best solution thames water has said that such ideas are both ineffective and short term it would take new green spaces the size of 40 hyde parks to start alleviating the sewage problem , the company said and anyway , said phil stride , a thames water executive , you 're not going to make everyone happy all the time
mumbai last saturday night , adilur rahman khan arrived home in dhaka after visiting his family over eid to find a group of men waiting outside his house mr khan , secretary of the prominent bangladeshi human rights group odhikar , had been expecting this day might come , but being confronted by members of the detective branch , who were there without a warrant late at night , was a surprise the police detained mr khan , accusing him of publishing false information about killings by security forces during mass demonstrations by supporters of the extremist hefazateislam movement in may mr khan is now in dhaka s central jail awaiting a court hearing later this week mr khan s arrest is yet another dark spot in the continuing struggle over the identity of bangladesh , one that has already led to major human rights abuses in the name of both islam and democracy this year has seen many mass protests in bangladesh with national elections scheduled for early 2014 and no agreement on how they should be conducted , many more demonstrations are likely , and they may well end up killing more people protests in dhaka and other cities in bangladesh broke out in february after a verdict in a war crimes trial enraged the public after a leader of jamaateislami , the country s largest islamic political party , was convicted of rape and mass murder but not sentenced to death , huge numbers of protesters took to the streets in what became known as the shahbagh movement \( named after its location in dhaka \) , calling for the death penalty for all those convicted of atrocities during the 1971 war of independence from pakistan in february , when another jamaat leader was sentenced to death by hanging , others affiliated with jamaateislami protested the guilty verdict , at times resorting to violence in may , it all happened again , for ostensibly different but ultimately related reasons on may 5 , tens of thousands of madrassa teachers and students , including many boys under the age of 18 , converged on dhaka from different parts of the country they were supporters of the previously littleknown hefazateislam \( protectors of islam \) movement , which demands a strict adherence to islamic teachings hefazateislam began its campaign in the aftermath of the shahbagh movement , accusing some of the shahbagh organizers of being atheists and insulting islam large numbers of protesters were killed and injured by a heavyhanded police response to these protests this month , human rights watch published blood on the streets the use of excessive force during bangladesh protests , a report documenting the shocking spike in deaths and injuries of civilians at the hands of security forces this year while in many cases witnesses described how security forces responded to violence in an appropriate fashion , using nonlethal methods to disperse crowds , in many other cases witnesses said the police , the rapid action battalion and the border guard bangladesh responded with excessive force many in the dhaka elite say that jamaateislami and hefazateislam represent the kind of religious fundamentalism that challenges the very concept of bangladesh as an independent and secular state , which broke away from the more religious and authoritarian state of pakistan in 1971 many also wished for a separate cultural and linguistic identity after the may protests , mainstream newspapers like the daily star warned against the degradation of ideals and values that islam stands for , and the odious misrepresentation of religion and denigration of position of women in our society prominent bloggers have complained about religious extremism and the use of religion in politics at the heart of the violence threatening bangladesh now are incidents and ideas related to the nation s bloodied birth when it seceded from pakistan in 1971 , the east pakistanbased awami league won the national elections the pakistani government , led by the military ruler general yahya khan , refused to accept the results on march 26 , it began operation searchlight , sending troops into east pakistan to arrest awami league leaders and put down protests the army and vigilante groups supporting them , some of them affiliated to jamaateislami , embarked on a massive wave of violence , including widespread rape as many as 10 million people were displaced and fled to neighboring india , carrying tales of unspeakable horror after nine months of violence , the indian army intervened and joined resistance forces to defeat the pakistani army an independent bangladesh emerged in december 1971 , and its successful secession has remained a flashpoint of distrust between india and pakistan in 1973 , the bangladesh parliament passed the international crimes \( tribunals \) act but trials never took place as politics shifted in bangladesh in fact , many of those widely believed to have collaborated in the violence won elections or gained political positions bringing those responsible for the 1971 war crimes to trial still has considerable popular support after sweeping to power , the awami league government in 2009 set up the international crimes tribunal to prosecute those bangladeshis responsible for the 1971 atrocities finding evidence for crimes that occurred several decades ago was always going to be a challenge , but despite repeated calls for amendments to the law to ensure fair trials , the government quickly began putting people on trial , leading to serious due process concerns the tribunal has handed down six judgments so far controversy erupted after the second judgment , issued feb 5 , found abdul qader mollah , assistant secretary general of jamaateislami , guilty and sentenced him to life in prison when leaving court , mr mollah flashed a v for victory sign to an assembled crowd and the media outraged that he appeared unrepentant , and fearful that a future opposition government would release him , many segments of the public called for mr mollah to be hanged the protests were initially based in the shahbagh neighborhood of dhaka but soon expanded , with hundreds of thousands of people demanding the death penalty on feb 28 , the tribunal convicted the vice president of jamaateislami , delwar hossain sayedee , of war crimes and sentenced him to death demonstrations broke out around the country , organized by both supporters and opponents of the verdicts the violence resulted in dozens of deaths and injuries that included security forces , bystanders and protesters like manzila begum , a clothes seller , who was killed on march 3 in bogra she was shot in the back of the head while trying to flee the violence a 17yearold who had joined a prosayedee demonstration in ranjpur district on feb 28 said the protesters started throwing stones because they could not bear the tear gas two officers climbed a raised platform and fired into the crowd when they started shooting , two people behind me got shot , one of them near the ear , one in the throat , the boy said jamaateislami is a proislamist party , but the hefazateislam movement is much more radical it has campaigned for its 13point demands , which include a ban on the public mixing of the men and women and the criminal prosecution of atheists the may 5 rally in dhaka was organized to push for the implementation of its demands government forces broke up the demonstration early the next morning precisely what happened on may 5 and 6 , when security forces dispersed the gathering , has become hugely controversial the opposition bangladesh nationalist party has accused the government forces of killing hundreds of protesters , describing their actions as genocide the leaders of hefazateislam said that they feared some 2 , 500 to 3 , 000 of their supporters may have been killed the government , on the other hand , says the security forces conducted a wellplanned and disciplined operation designed to minimize casualties according to findings by human rights watch , none of these accounts is accurate while the claims of the bangladesh nationalist party lack credibility and those of hefazateislam were overstated , the government s version is also misleading serious human rights abuses were committed by the security forces and in total , based on hospital logs , eyewitness accounts and wellsourced media reports , at least 50 people died on may 5 and 6 , including seven members of the security forces the death toll may be higher , odhikar said in the report that resulted in mr khan s arrest the demonstrators committed vandalism and arson , attacking security forces with sticks and stones , but victims statements suggest that security forces used excessive force , and in some cases fired at close range a 25yearold hefazateislam volunteer said he was shot from barely a threemeter \( 10foot \) distance i was not armed i did not a have a stick , he said i was hit 19 times now i cannot see anything from my right eye video footage shows security personnel beating apparently unarmed men an 18yearold madrassa student said that he was beaten after he surrendered the moment i stepped out , i was struck by rubber bullets on the leg i started bleeding and i ran away , but i fell down and they beat me with their sticks , he said since the protests , security forces have initiated sweeps of neighborhoods thought to harbor individuals believed responsible for violence , but they have also focused on others , including jamaateislami supporters while authorities arbitrarily arrested many protesters and supporters , there has been no effort to hold security forces accountable for abuses opposition media has been harassed and human rights groups feel at risk , particularly after the arrest of mr khan the government appears confused in how to deal with islamists and their opponents in an effort to appease religious sentiment , the government arrested four bloggers in april , with the police describing them as known atheists and accusing them of instigating negative elements against islam a bangladesh court has recently upheld a petition seeking that jamaateislami be banned from participating in national elections scheduled to be held by january 2014 , while government supporters want to put the brakes on hefazateislam , which they believe will work with opposition parties to destabilize the country with regular hartals , or strikes , likely by opposition political parties in the runup to national elections , there is a significant risk that bangladesh could descend into a vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness to avoid this , the government should ensure that the rights to freedom of assembly and expression are upheld peaceful protesters and bystanders need to be protected from unlawful use of force organizers of demonstrations and political parties should also take steps to minimize the risk of violence those responsible for abuses need to be held accountable government accountability is the first step towards stemming the possibility of more blood on the streets then a more sober and peaceful discussion about the future of bangladesh will be possible meenakshi ganguly is south asia director at human rights watch
london that s that theater taken care of , then ! the above could be the catchphrase of london s west end at the moment , as various playhouses pair up with directors in an attempt to brand a theater , so to speak two prominent west end theaters have each hitched themselves to directors who not long ago were regularly seen at a particular off west end address i m referring , of course , to michael grandage , the former artistic director of covent garden s intimate donmar warehouse , and jamie lloyd , who one could argue came of age as a director under mr grandage s tutelage at the donmar \( among mr lloyd s donmar credits was the best production i have yet seen of the stephen sondheim james lapine musical passion \) the current season finds the two men embarked upon the stewardships of a pair of commercial theaters all of five minutes from each other mr grandage got in first , beginning a 15month tenancy at the no l coward theater in december with privates on parade , the 1977 peter nichols denis king playwithmusic that in effect is a revival of a revival mr grandage staged the same show with a different cast at the donmar late in 2001 in a production that won its star , roger allam , an olivier award and here the title is again , this time with simon russell beale in endearingly frothy , flouncy form as the army captain terri dennis , an englishman abroad who never met a double entendre or innuendo to which he couldn t apply liberal dollops of camp \( the piece is set at the start of the malayan emergency in 1948 \) the show , first seen in the soulbaring confines of the 250seat donmar , is perhaps inevitably more presentational at the no l coward , with its traditional proscenium and more than three times the seating and correspondingly less revelatory that said , the flatout brio of the revuestyle show marks a most agreeable start to a fiveplay lineup that only gets starrier next up is the one world premiere of the lot peter and alice , a new play from john logan \( red \) , that marks the return to the london stage of judi dench , whom mr grandage directed four years ago in yukio mishima s madame de sade after that come two shakespeares \( a midsummer night s dream and henry v , the latter with jude law as the king \) , that pair preceded by daniel radcliffe in the first london revival of martin mcdonagh s cripple of inishmaan harry potter takes on the part of cripple billy a short walk across trafalgar square , mr lloyd s sequence of shows at the trafalgar studios hasn t been announced beyond an opening title a new macbeth , which began performances this weekend and stars james mcavoy , the scottish film actor \( atonement , the last king of scotland \) who , incidentally , was in that first privates on parade undertaken by mr grandage at the donmar the intention here remains the same as it is for the trafalgar s glitzier rival up the road to position a commercial theater as the stomping ground of a specific director , who in turn can leave an imprint upon a series of shows rather than just going from one adhoc production to another as is the directorial norm this sort of endeavor isn t new to the ecology of the west end the haymarket is just one of several addresses to have given itself over in recent years to one or another name director jonathan kent , sean mathias and trevor nunn have all shepherded their own parades of shows to that theater , none of which made much of a noise beyond mr nunn s wonderful flare path , starring sienna miller and sheridan smith , and a patrick stewart ian mckellen waiting for godot from mr mathias that looks as if it is going to be revisited on broadway  one can see the appeal of the enterprise couple a building with an artist who can create an identity for it and you are spared the vagaries of commercial production that can at times leave weeks or months between bookings and what director is going to balk at a scenario whereby he or she is the selfevident draw \? mr grandage and mr lloyd are \( so far , anyway \) scheduled to direct all the shows in their respective seasons , whereas his former leadership of the donmar inevitably meant that mr grandage could only direct a percentage of the offerings at a noncommercial house where he or any artistic director would be expected to share the wealth throw in kevin spacey s ongoing stewardship of the old vic , a oncetroubled playhouse that has become profitably associated in the minds of the london public with the double oscar winner , and the virtues of branding a theater are on view before you what happens to the theaters when these men move on \? the answer , or part of it , may be on view at the donmar , where josie rourke is now in the artistic director s chair
here s the thing about most first graders they are brittle , accusatory and ruleobsessed they tense up or lay blame when something goes wrong , and they can spend an entire recess articulating regulations for games they never actually play they are also adorable and amusing thank goodness , because any adult who tries to play cards with first graders soon discovers that they are incredible cheats and fourth graders \? they form real and lasting friendships , cultivate hobbies and curate cherished collections all the while their selfesteem plummets from previously skyhigh levels and they come home from school feeling less sure of themselves than ever who is to blame for the nerves and moral failings of the first grader and the sagging confidence of the fourth grader \? a \) incompetent parents b \) schools that fail to promote mindfulness , ethics and selfesteem c \) our competitive world s sway over its youngest citizens try d \) none of the above normal development is , and always has been , the culprit first graders act like first graders because the conscience of a 6yearold sees right and wrong in stark , dramatized terms when coloring outside the lines or losing at cards feels like a capital crime , it is no surprise that first graders are quick to panic , accuse others or cheat as for fourth graders , their selfesteem is actually correcting to normative levels the second grader who plans to be a pilot after i win an olympic gold medal and am done with being president grows into a fourth grader who sees herself and her peers more realistically and receives increasingly accurate feedback from adults every age comes with its own challenges that unfold in a predictable , unstoppable sequence if this has always been true , why articulate it now \? because we live in a time when some anxious parents believe that the path to adult success must be unmarred by conflict , distress or boredom these parents can press schools especially expensive schools or schools competing for students to partner with them in pursuit of this fantasy in doing so , both parties set up a disingenuous conversation about what is actually involved in normal development not that school should be a slog beautiful schools , devoted teachers and pedagogical excellence should be available to children everywhere but they should not be accompanied by the promise , stated explicitly or implied , that a child s education will be an enriching romp from one joyful day to the next when the day inevitably arrives that things go poorly when a first grader becomes unduly anxious about his work , when a fourth grader cries because she is bested by a classmate parents and schools will regret having painted themselves into the corner of wondering what went wrong or worse , wondering who s to blame a far better arrangement involves embracing the reality that normal development is not always pretty when talking about the year to come , parents should ask teachers to share their wellconsidered curricular plans and their knowledge about the bumps ahead imagine a backtoschool night where the firstgrade teacher lets parents know that this is a year when children can become very tense about mistakes here s how we manage this at school and a fourthgrade teacher says your children will feel less confident as the year unfolds because they become more perceptive and realistic here are some helpful ways to reassure your child after a hard day of course , not all childhood difficulties can be chalked up to normal development parents and schools sometimes make choices that hurt children , and some children have problems that exceed the norm at these times too , we are best positioned to address concerns if an open , honest relationship has already been established between the adults at home and at school growing up isn t easy when a child struggles , parents should not assume a shortcoming in the school any more than the school should assume a shortcoming in the parents everyone benefits when the strains of normal development are expected even welcomed and taken in stride
the failure of the writers to pick barry bonds or roger clemens was not a surprise given the low vote totals received in the past by mark mcgwire and rafael palmeiro , other players associated with the use performanceenhancing drugs but the vote totals for bonds and clemens , just 36 and 38 percent , were lower than expected craig biggio , who received 682 percent of the vote in his first year of eligibility , will almost certainly make it into the hall of fame someday still , his profile is quite similar to robin yount and roberto alomar , two players who did better in their first year on the ballot \( yount got 775 percent of the vote in his first year on the ballot in 1999 , while alomar got 737 percent of the vote in 2010 and made it in the next year \) perhaps the clearest effect of the crowded ballot , however , was realized among candidates who were returning to the ballot from last year of the 13 players who carried over from the 2012 ballot , nine received a lower share of the vote , including lee smith , alan trammell , fred mcgriff , don mattingly and bernie williams this is atypical instead , players usually add votes with each additional year they spend on the ballot since 1967 , when the hall of fame adopted balloting rules similar to the ones it uses now , about twothirds of holdover players gained ground from their prior year s vote percentage it is possible to be a bit more precise about this pattern based on an analysis of hall of fame voting between 1967 and 2011 , i found that the increase in a player s vote total is typically proportional to his percentage from the previous year in his second year on the ballot , for example , the typical player s vote share increases by a multiple of about 11 thus , a player who received 10 percent of the vote in his first year would be expected to receive about 11 percent on his second try , while a player who got 50 percent of the vote would go up to 55 percent the pace of improvement is typically highest in the first several years that a player spends on the ballot , slowing down once he has been eligible five or six times \( the exception is in a player s 15 and final year of eligibility , when he may receive a fairly large boost \) but these small percentage gains can add up , something like the way in which interest compounds over time for example , as shown in the chart below , a player who gets just 30 percent of the vote in his first year on the ballot would be projected to make it in on his 14th year of eligibility if he follows the formula each year in practice , the growth in a player s vote share is rarely this smooth and you should not necessarily expect the pattern to hold for bonds and clemens \( instructively , the vote shares for mcgwire and palmeiro have actually been declining \) nonetheless , hall of fame candidates typically have a tailwind as time passes this year , however , veterans on the hall of fame ballot faced a headwind instead the next chart compares the actual vote that each player received against that projected by the historical formula twelve of the 13 players underperformed their projection the exception was dale murphy , who got a largerthanaverage boost in his final year of eligibility , but still came nowhere close to winning election even some players who gained ground did not necessarily help their chances jack morris went from 667 percent of the vote to 677 percent , below his projection of 694 percent the small difference could be important because next year will be morris s final year of eligibility , and he projects to be very close to the 75 percent threshold for election \( perhaps the player who had the best year , instead , was tim raines , whose vote share grew to 522 percent from 487 percent , and who is now a clear favorite to be elected someday by the writers \) most other players lost ground outright trammell , in his 12th year of eligibility , declined to 336 percent from 368 percent of the vote he was an underdog to make it in before , but now he seems to have very little chance the same also holds for smith , who lost most of what he gained last year after years of stagnant vote totals mcgriff , as joe posnanski writes , seemed to be a plausible candidate to gain ground this year as writers sought out players who were perceived as clean , as opposed to known or suspected of steroid use instead , his vote share declined to 207 percent from 239 percent williams had received just under 10 percent of the vote in his first year of eligibility , but his case was not entirely hopeless players like bob lemon and carl hubbell were eventually selected by the writers with a similar vote total in their first year instead , williams fell below the 5 percent threshold required for a player to stay on the ballot the crowded and confusing ballot may be affecting these players in several ways the most obvious is that the writers are limited to voting for a maximum of 10 players this year , according to the sample of ballots collected by the twitter user leokitty , 24 percent of writers used all 10 of their picks that compares with 12 percent in 2011 , and just 4 percent in 2012 did the 10vote limit keep biggio and morris out of the hall of fame , perhaps along with other players \? actually , it was almost certainly not responsible all by itself of the 24 percent of writers who used all 10 ballot slots , 90 percent did name biggio , meaning 10 percent did not at best , therefore , if all writers who exhausted their ballots would also have named biggio if they had unlimited votes , he would have gotten only 10 percent of the 24 percent , adding only 24 percentage points to his overall vote total the logic here is that it s hard to make a case that biggio was only the 11th or 12th best player on the ballot instead , most of the writers who left him out were probably more like jon heyman of cbs sports heyman wrote that he saw biggio as the eighth best player on the ballot but he also thought that only six were worthy of inclusion most of the writers who left biggio out , in other words , were those who take a conservative overall approach to how many players they want in the hall of fame , and not those who ran out of ballot positions morris is a more debatable case if all writers who maxed out their ballot slots had included him , he would have come very close to 75 percent of the vote however , morris is also a highly polarizing candidate those writers who included him often thought he was among the very best players on the ballot on several ballots , in fact , morris was the only player named but other writers think he falls fall short of hall of fame standards and would not have picked him no matter how many votes they had to spare nor , obviously , were bonds s and clemens s totals affected to any material degree by the 10player limit nobody left bonds off their ballots because they thought he had only the 11thbest statistical record they did so because they don t think steroids users should be in the hall of fame \( in fact , most of the writers who maxed out their ballot slots included bonds and clemens the writers who are willing to consider performanceenhancing drug users have much more crowded ballots than those who are not \) instead , players like mcgriff , trammell , williams and edgar martinez were probably most affected by the 10player limit the logic for mcgriff , for example , is very close of the opposite of that which might be applied to biggio it s fairly hard to sustain a case that mcgriff was one of the best six or seven players on the ballot this year but you might credibly argue that there is a glut of a dozen or so qualified players , mcgriff among them , and you had to leave mcgriff out because of the ballot limit however , the players are not only being affected by those writers who ran out of ballot slots there were a higherthanaverage number of writers this year who listed very few players , or even none at all some 10 percent of voters named two or fewer players this year , according to leokitty s spreadsheet that is lower than in 2012 , an underwhelming year on the ballot , when 16 percent of voters did so but it is less than 2009 , 2010 or 2011 , when between 3 and 8 percent of writers listed so few players some writers are deliberately listing very few players as a protest vote , whether against the steroids era or the hall of fame balloting process between the protest voters on the one hand , and the maxedout voters on the other , the players are being squeezed at both ends finally , some players may be harmed by the psychology of the ballot if clemens were not on the ballot , for example , then you could credibly make a case that curt schilling was the best pitcher on the ballot \( if you don t think that morris is \) but schilling s accomplishments look poor by comparison to clemens s , as do those of almost any pitcher even if you aren t willing to vote for clemens because of his steroids use the same holds for outfielders whose statistics might be compared with barry bonds s there is even something to be said for the socalled paradox of choice that when presented with too many options , we may be overwhelmed with information and have trouble making any decisions at all hall of fame voting is ultimately designed to be a consensus process one reason that players tend to gain votes over time is because the writers are looking at what their peers are doing and value the endorsements of their colleagues moreover , because they have as many as 15 chances to elect a player , many writers tend toward conservatism initially there is no way to remove a player from the hall of fame once he has been elected , but you can change your mind to include him later when a writer initially votes no on a player , it really means wait and see in many cases but consensus is harder to achieve when members of a group have divergent values and ideologies instead of the typical friendly arguments about how a player s lifetime accomplishments might be weighed against how dominant he was in his best seasons , or how to compare players at different positions , the writers are now spending most of their time arguing about who used steroids and when , and how this should affect hall of fame consideration many have passionate beliefs about this , whichever side of the argument they take an increasing number of writers would like to elect a dozen or more players an increasing number would like to lose the whole steroids era to history goodnatured debates may be replaced by tactical considerations , as voters make guesses about who everyone else might vote for , or where their ballots might be wasted next year will place even more pressure on the voters , when greg maddux , tom glavine , frank thomas and mike mussina are added to the list of candidates those who apply little discount for steroids use may credibly claim to identify 15 or more qualified candidates , and even those who do not may have to drop one or two names that they otherwise see as worthy the new york times will probably not have to publish a blank page again , but no one but maddux seems sure to make it in
it looks as if president obama has successfully set a political trap over the minimum wage raising the minimum is very popular even a narrow majority of republicans \( pdf \) are for it but republican leaders are opposed and they d like people to believe that their opposition is driven by sincere concern for workers who might lose their jobs well , this isn t likely to work the public won t believe in their sincerity , and for good reason here are two examples of why it won t wash 1 the truth is that top republicans have so little regard for ordinary workers that they can t even manage to pretend otherwise case in point on the last labor day , eric cantor declared , today , we celebrate those who have taken a risk , worked hard , built a business and earned their own success yep even on labor day , cantor had nothing positive to say about workers , just praise for their bosses 2 consider a working couple with two children , earning the current minimum wage how much federal income tax do they pay \? if i m doing the math right , the answer is , none they get a refund \( they pay plenty of payroll taxes , sales taxes , etc , but that isn t supposed to count \) in the minds of republicans , this makes them lucky duckies , members of the 47 percent , part of what s wrong with america the gop just can t credibly claim to suddenly be deeply concerned about their job prospects maybe once upon a time , when republicans were less intellectually inbred , they could have pulled off the stunt of seeming to care about the people supposedly hurt by a higher minimum wage but i really don t think they re up to it at this point
on the tiny mediterranean island of malta , two italian hackers have been searching for bugs not the island s many beetle varieties , but secret flaws in computer code that governments pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to learn about and exploit the hackers , luigi auriemma , 32 , and donato ferrante , 28 , sell technical details of such vulnerabilities to countries that want to break into the computer systems of foreign adversaries the two will not reveal the clients of their company , revuln , but big buyers of services like theirs include the which seeks the flaws for america s growing arsenal of cyberweapons and american adversaries like the revolutionary guards of iran all over the world , from south africa to south korea , business is booming in what hackers call zero days , the coding flaws in software like microsoft windows that can give a buyer unfettered access to a computer and any business , agency or individual dependent on one just a few years ago , hackers like mr auriemma and mr ferrante would have sold the knowledge of coding flaws to companies like microsoft and apple , which would fix them last month , microsoft sharply increased the amount it was willing to pay for such flaws , raising its top offer to 150 , 000 but increasingly the businesses are being outbid by countries with the goal of exploiting the flaws in pursuit of the kind of success , albeit temporary , that the united states and israel achieved three summers ago when they attacked iran s nuclear enrichment program with a computer worm that became known as  the flaws get their name from the fact that once discovered , zero days exist for the user of the computer system to fix them before hackers can take advantage of the vulnerability a zeroday exploit occurs when hackers or governments strike by using the flaw before anyone else knows it exists , like a burglar who finds , after months of probing , that there is a previously undiscovered way to break into a house without sounding an alarm governments are starting to say , in order to best protect my country , i need to find vulnerabilities in other countries , ' said howard schmidt , a former white house cybersecurity coordinator the problem is that we all fundamentally become less secure a zeroday bug could be as simple as a hacker s discovering an online account that asks for a password but does not actually require typing one to get in bypassing the system by hitting the enter key becomes a zeroday exploit the average attack persists for almost a year 312 days before it is detected , according to symantec , the maker of antivirus software until then it can be exploited or weaponized by both criminals and governments to spy on , steal from or attack their target ten years ago , hackers would hand knowledge of such flaws to microsoft and google free , in exchange for a tshirt or perhaps for an honorable mention on a company s web site even today , socalled patriotic hackers in china regularly hand over the information to the government now , the market for information about computer vulnerabilities has turned into a gold rush disclosures by edward j snowden , the former nsa consultant who leaked classified documents , made it clear that the united states is among the buyers of programming flaws but it is hardly alone israel , britain , russia , india and brazil are some of the biggest spenders north korea is in the market , as are some middle eastern intelligence services countries in the asian pacific , including malaysia and singapore , are buying , too , according to the center for strategic and international studies in washington to connect sellers and buyers , dozens of wellconnected brokers now market information on the flaws in exchange for a 15 percent cut some hackers get a deal collecting royalty fees for every month their flaw is not discovered , according to several people involved in the market some individual brokers , like one in bangkok who goes by the grugq on twitter , are well known but after the grugq spoke to forbes last year , his business took a hit from the publicity , according to a person familiar with the impact , primarily because buyers demand confidentiality a broker s approach need not be subtle need code execution exploit urgent , read the subject line of an email sent from one contractor s intermediary last year to billy rios , a former security engineer at microsoft and google who is now a director at cylance , a security startup dear friend , the email began do you have any code execution exploit for windows 7 , mac , for applications like browser , office , adobe , swf any if yes , the email continued , payment is not an issue for startups eager to displace more established military contractors , selling vulnerabilities and expertise about how to use them has become a lucrative opportunity firms like vupen in montpellier , france netragard in acton , mass exodus intelligence in austin , tex and revuln , mr auriemma s and mr ferrante s maltese firm , freely advertise that they sell knowledge of the flaws for cyberespionage and in some cases for cyberweapons outside washington , a virginia startup named endgame in which a former director of the nsa is playing a major role is more elusive about its abilities but it has developed a number of tools that it sells primarily to the united states government to discover vulnerabilities , which can be used for fighting cyberespionage and for offensive purposes like revuln , none of the companies will disclose the names of their customers but adriel desautels , the founder of netragard , said that his clients were strictly us based and that netragard s exploit acquisition program had doubled in size in the past three years the average flaw now sells from around 35 , 000 to 160 , 000 chaouki bekrar , the founder of vupen , said his company did not sell to countries that are subject to european union , united states or united nations restrictions or embargoes he also said revenue was doubling every year as demand surged vupen charges customers an annual 100 , 000 subscription fee to shop through its catalog , and then charges per sale costs depend on the sophistication of the vulnerability and the pervasiveness of the operating system revuln specializes in finding remote vulnerabilities in industrial control systems that can be used to access or disrupt water treatment facilities , oil and gas pipelines and power plants they are engaging in willful blindness , said christopher soghoian , a senior policy analyst at the american civil liberties union many technology companies have started bug bounty programs in which they pay hackers to tell them about bugs in their systems rather than have the hackers keep the flaws to themselves or worse , sell them on the black market nearly a decade ago the mozilla foundation started one of the first bounty programs to pay for bugs in its firefox browser since then , google , facebook and paypal have all followed suit in recent months , bounties have soared in 2010 , google started paying hackers up to 3 , 13370 the number is hacker code for elite for bugs in its web browser chrome last month , google increased its cash prize to 20 , 000 for flaws found in some of its widely used products facebook began a similar program in 2011 and has since paid out 1 million \( one payout included 2 , 500 to a 13yearold the most it has paid for a single bug is 20 , 000 \) the program undermines the incentive to hold on to a bug that might be worth nothing in a day , said joe sullivan , facebook s chief security officer it had also had the unintended effect of encouraging ethical hackers to turn in others who planned to use its bugs for malicious use we 've seen people backstab other hackers by ratting out a bug that another person planned to use maliciously , he said microsoft , which had long resisted such a program , did an aboutface last month when it announced that it would pay hackers as much as 150 , 000 for information about a single flaw , if they also provided a way to defend against it apple still has no such program , but its vulnerabilities are some of the most coveted in one case , a zeroday exploit in apple s ios operating system sold for 500 , 000 , according to two people briefed on the sale still , said mr soghoian of the aclu , the bounties pale in comparison to what the government pays the military establishment , he said , created frankenstein by feeding the market in many ways , the united states government created the market when the united states and israel used a series of flaws including one in a windows font program to unleash what became known as the stuxnet worm , a sophisticated cyberweapon used to temporarily cripple iran s ability to enrich uranium , it showed the world what was possible it also became a catalyst for a cyberarms race when the stuxnet code leaked out of the natanz nuclear enrichment plant in iran in the summer of 2010 , the flaws suddenly took on new value subsequent discoveries of sophisticated statesponsored computer viruses named and duqu that used flaws to spy on computers in iran have only fueled interest i think it is fair to say that no one anticipated where this was going , said one person who was involved in the early american and israeli strategy and today , no one is sure where it is going to end up in a in 2007 , charlie miller , a former nsa employee , described the profitable alternatives for hackers who may have otherwise turned their information about flaws over to the vendor free , or sold it for a few thousand dollars to programs like tipping point s , now run by hewlettpackard , which used them to enhance their security research he described how one american government agency offered him 10 , 000 for a linux bug he asked another for 80 , 000 , which agreed too quickly , mr miller wrote i had probably not asked for enough because the bug did not work with a particular flavor of linux , mr miller eventually sold it for 50 , 000 but the takeaway for him and his fellow hackers was clear there was serious money to be made selling the flaws at their conventions , hackers started flashing signs that read , no more free bugs hackers like mr auriemma , who once gave away their bugs to software vendors and antivirus makers , now sound like union organizers declaring their rights providing professional work for free to a vendor is unethical , mr auriemma said providing professional work almost for free to security companies that make their business with your research is even more unethical experts say there is limited incentive to regulate a market in which government agencies are some of the biggest participants if you try to limit who you do business with , there s the possibility you will get shut out , mr schmidt said if someone comes to you with a bug that could affect millions of devices and says , you would be the only one to have this if you pay my fee , ' there will always be someone inclined to pay it unfortunately , he said , dancing with the devil in cyberspace has been pretty common
tokyo will begin restarting its idled nuclear plants after new safety guidelines are in place later this year , prime minister said thursday , moving to ensure a stable energy supply despite public safety concerns after the fukushima disaster in a speech to parliament , mr abe pledged to restart nuclear plants that pass the tougher guidelines , which are expected to be adopted by a new independent watchdog agency , the nuclear regulation authority , as early as july he did not specify when any of the reactors might resume operation , and news reports have suggested that it might take months or even years to make the expensive upgrades needed to meet the new safety standards still , by making the promise in front of the diet , mr abe indicated in the strongest way yet that he planned to move ahead with a campaign pledge to reverse his predecessor s hopes that japan would begin weaning itself off  the speech came as the world health organization published a comprehensive , twoyear analysis on the health risks associated with the 2011 disaster suggesting that the chance of getting certain types of cancers had increased slightly among children exposed to the highest doses of radioactivity but the report said that there would most likely be no observable increase in cancer rates in the wider japanese population the study s authors warned , however , that their assessment was based on limited scientific knowledge much of the data on health effects from radiation is based on acute exposures like those that followed the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and not chronic , lowlevel exposure near the fukushima plant , some densely populated areas are expected to remain contaminated with relatively low levels of radioactive materials for decades the government s initial reaction to the report saying it overestimated the risks by failing to fully take into account government evacuations of citizens suggested that officials did not see it as a help for mr abe s plans antinuclear sentiments in japan are now strong , and the results could feed fears of any increased risks the question of when , and whether , to restart the plants has dogged the country for two years , as politicians and ordinary japanese try to balance their fears of a moribund economy when oil and gas costs have already hurt the balance of trade and worries over another environmental crisis , especially if the industry is not well regulated lax regulation and a cozy relationship between the nuclear industry and the government helped make japan vulnerable to the fukushima accident , the world s secondworst nuclear plant disaster all of japan s 50 operable nuclear reactors were shut down following the march 2011 triple meltdown , which spewed radiation across northern japan after a huge earthquake and tsunami knocked out vital cooling systems two were later restarted as an emergency measure to avert power shortages in the heavily populated region that includes the cities of osaka and kyoto leaders from the previous democratic party government had vowed to slowly phase out nuclear power by the 2030s in favor of cleaner alternatives like solar and wind power but mr abe , who took power after his liberal democratic party won national elections in december on a platform of economic revitalization , said the phaseout would keep japan from the cheap electricity it needs to compete economically on thursday , mr abe said that japan had learned the need for tougher safety standards , and he said the new standards would be enforced without compromise mr abe also said japan would continue seeking energy alternatives to reduce its dependence on nuclear power in january , the new nuclear agency released a list of its proposed safety regulations , which include higher walls to protect against tsunamis , additional backup power sources for the cooling systems and construction of specially hardened earthquakeproof command centers the rules surprised many for their toughness , though skeptics worry that industry supporters in the government will manage to get around the regulations according to a report by the newspaper asahi shimbun , none of japan s 16 undamaged commercial nuclear plants would pass the new standards the agency has said the new guidelines will be finalized and put in place by july 18 the who study focused on cancer incidence , not deaths , and some of the cancers listed are serious but have good rates of survival according to the study , girls exposed as infants to radioactivity in the most contaminated regions of fukushima prefecture faced a 70 percent higher risk of developing thyroid cancer than would be expected normally the report pointed out , however , that the normal risk of thyroid cancer was just 075 percent , and that the additional lifetime risk would raise that to 125 percent girls exposed to radioactivity as infants in the most heavily contaminated areas also had a 6 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer , and a 4 percent higher risk of developing cancers that cause tumors meanwhile , boys exposed as infants had a 7 percent higher chance of developing leukemia the study also said that about a third of the emergency workers who remained to try to stabilize the fukushima daiichi plant were estimated to have a slightly increased risk of developing leukemia , thyroid cancer and other types of cancer the analysis was based on data available as of september 2011 , and takes into account airborne contamination as well as contaminated food , water and other sources of contamination , the who said some local government officials in fukushima criticized the report for identifying specific areas and their associated exposure estimates radiation exposure is a sensitive topic in japan , where victims of the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings often experienced discrimination in marriage , for example , because of feared health effects i feel extreme anger over this excessive analysis , which will plunge more residents into fear , mayor norio kanno of iitate village , told nhk iitate was one of the areas identified in the who report as heavily contaminated villagers there are among tens of thousands of evacuees who have not been able to return home
in her firstround doubles match at the on monday , venus williams channeled her inner don drysdale , slamming ball after ball off the bodies of her opponents , silvia solerespinosa and carla su rez navarro while the beanballs fired by baseball pitchers often provoke altercations , williams s relentless body shots yielded little more than a shrug from solerespinosa and su rez navarro it is part of tennis , su rez navarro said after the match solerespinosa added , she was n't trying to hurt me she was trying to win the point but with each shot that ricocheted off solerespinosa s legs , the prowilliams crowd started to turn , with disapproving gasps and even some boos in the third set , solerespinosa turned away twice to avoid being hit , an indication that the shots were taking a toll on her body shots have long been a common practice in tennis everyone from pancho gonzalez to ivan lendl fired frequent fastballs meant to send a message but they seem to have become more controversial or at least more commented upon lately last year , tomas berdych after being hit in the arm by nicol s almagro at the australian open berdych refused to shake hands after the match , prompting boos and a barrage of criticism from the news media the court is pretty big , berdych said in his news conference you always have some space to put the ball in asked if he hit berdych on purpose , almagro said , i was trying to win the point during the gold medal match at the olympics last august , roger federer was criticized by john mcenroe for lobbing over andy murray instead of drilling him federer lost the point and the match the previous month , murray , seemingly under the influence of his new coach , lendl , had nearly taken federer s head off with a shot in the wimbledon final , but federer ducked and the ball flew out this year , almagro hit rafael nadal in mexico in march he waited at the net to apologize , but nadal did not turn around but the most notable recent example of a tennis beanball happened in montreal last month in a match between nadal and novak djokovic nadal hit a drop shot that djokovic raced in to retrieve nadal , on the run , ripped djokovic s short volley ,  it was nadal s turn to stand at the net trying to express remorse , raising his hand in the universal tennis sign for i'm sorry but djokovic turned away , seemingly angry \( murray , who had been hit by jerzy janowicz in their semifinal at wimbledon , published a twitter post that sounded like gleeful approval , saying , things could get tasty now ! \) despite the flareups , taking target practice at close range is not only accepted but expected indeed , while some of venus williams s body blows seemed to be about intimidation monday , solerespinosa s impressive reflexive volleys made hitting back at her body the most effective play as the williamses pursued their 14th doubles grand slam title on their way to the semifinals , where they lost on friday to andrea hlavackova and lucie hradecka , the williamses continued to hit opponents , with ending a quarterfinal victory over topseeded sara errani and roberta vinci on thursday with a body shot the american jack sock said he hit maximo gonz lez on a short ball in their secondround singles match because there was no better option if you do n't want to get hit , do n't play , especially doubles , sock said simona halep , who took one shot off her hip in this tournament , said , that s tennis marcelo melo added sometimes you just have to go to the body you 're not trying to hurt the guy max mirnyi , who won the mixed doubles title at the united states open with andrea hlavackova on friday , did not blame his opponents for hitting him if i get hit , then it s my fault because i was offbalance or out of position , said mirnyi , who has also won six grand slam men s doubles titles in fact , mirnyi reserved his criticism for players who overdo their public remorse i say sorry and i know the player heard it , i do n't need to show everybody i'm apologizing , he said rafa did n't need to stand there after he hit novak and novak turned away rafa won the point why be so sorry \? mirnyi added that using a body shot to intimidate opponents often backfired in those situations the player will often lose the point , he said a shot at the head will often sail out perhaps the only point of disagreement is how to handle mixed doubles , where the men hit much harder than the women melo , who is 6 foot 8 and 192 pounds , said chivalrously that he would not smash the ball into the woman on the other side mirnyi , 65 and 205 pounds , would have none of that , treating the players on the other side of the net equally as he focused on victory i will go for the woman , too , or i will lose the match , he said
helena , mont the trial of jordan johnson , a former starting quarterback at the university of montana accused of raping an acquaintance , begins in missoula , mont , on friday , extending a cloud of scandal that has hung over the campus for two years mr johnson faces one count of sexual intercourse without consent and , if convicted , a sentence of anywhere from 2to4 years to 100 years in prison mr johnson , who has denied the accusation , would also have to register as a sex offender for life a series of accusations of sexual assault and other crimes , many involving members of the university s hugely popular football team , the grizzlies , have overshadowed the college town of missoula , in the mountains of western montana claims that accusations had been ignored , covered up or played down by university and law enforcement officials also contributed emails released last year , for example , showed that one university official , james foley , sought a way under the student conduct code to punish a woman who had publicly claimed that she was sexually assaulted by four members of the football team he also urged that officials stop calling the assault gang rape and refer to it as date rape mr foley has since moved to a different post in mr johnson s case , the woman said that in february 2012 , mr johnson raped her as they watched a movie together at a fellow student s home , according to her affidavit a report was made to the police in march 2012 and , after an investigation of several months , mr johnson was charged in july in the affidavit , reported in the missoulian , the city s daily newspaper , the woman said that she sent a text message to a friend shortly after the encounter omg i think i might have just gotten raped he kept pushing and pushing and i said no but he would n't listen i just wanna cry omg , what do i do ! the next day she went to the university of montana student assault resource center , and then to a medical exam mr johnson s lawyer , david paoli , has said the sex was consensual he did not return a phone call seeking comment the federal justice department is investigating how the university has handled claims of sexual assault the department of education s office for civil rights is also investigating a sexual harassment complaint against members of the football team and the ncaa is investigating the university on undisclosed matters peggy kuhr , a university spokeswoman , said that while neither the ncaa nor the justice department investigations had concluded , the controversy had prompted the university to make changes we 've been working all along , moving forward on campus safety , she said among the changes is a mandatory online tutorial on the subject of sexual assault that students must take and pass the department of justice is also investigating how missoula county prosecutors and the city police handled complaints of sexual assault in december 2010 , a student told the police that she had lost consciousness while drinking and woke to find herself under assault by five men , including four football players none were charged in december 2011 , three players were implicated in two other assaults and were not charged city law enforcement officials have said the allegations often involve alcohol , memories are hazy and it is very difficult to bring charges in april of last year , the contracts of both the football coach , robin pflugrad , and the athletic director , jim o 'day , were abruptly terminated without explanation mr johnson s trial comes on the heels of the sentencing of a former grizzlies running back , beau donaldson , who pleaded guilty to raping a childhood friend in 2010 as she slept in his apartment last month , he was sentenced to 30 years in jail , with 20 suspended he must serve two and half years before he is eligible for parole we 've had sex assaults , vandalism , beatings by football players , said pat williams , a former congressman and a member of the montana board of regents the university has recruited thugs for its football team , and this thuggery has got to stop university officials say they are trying the recently hired athletic director , kent haslam , said one of the most important changes is that coaches are no longer in charge of players who violate a new , clearer student athlete code of conduct instead , a violation is handled by a fourperson committee consisting of athletic officials , including the senior women s administrator questions have been raised about whether mr johnson can get a fair trial amid such controversy court officials have assembled an extralarge pool of 400 for the jury selection that begins friday you have to believe that the presumption of innocence is somehow affected , said milt datsopoulos , who represented mr donaldson and is also on the national advisory board for grizzly athletics , a booster organization he believes that his client s sentence was more severe than it would have been had there not been what he called a toxic atmosphere in missoula they made him a poster child for a supposed major problem , mr datsopoulos said of mr donaldson i do n't think a problem exists
wildfires gripping ventura county , calif , spread on friday night but will most likely come under control during the weekend with the aid of favorable weather , a fire official said saturday the fires , which had forced evacuations and laid waste to thousands of acres of woodland , took hold late last week they had spread to 28 , 000 acres , from 18 , 000 on friday , bill nash , a spokesman for the ventura county fire department , said early saturday but 1 , 895 fire personnel had managed to contain about 30 percent of the flames , and the only injuries to a firefighter and a civilian came in a traffic accident away from the fire , mr nash said though 4 , 000 homes remained under threat , he said , only 15 had been damaged and none destroyed the same totals as on friday right now we 're getting a coastal influence , mr nash said of the weekend s predicted weather , and humidity is rising , which is good for fire fighting , and temperatures are dropping , which is good for firefighting he estimated that the fire might be contained held behind a line at all points by monday , but that it would take firefighters weeks to extinguish every ember , and ensure 28 , 000 acres of cold ash the early arrival of the year s first major wildfires has prompted concerns that this fire season might be especially severe
this first week of testimony in the george zimmerman trial has proved to be nothing short of fascinating on one level , the case is simple if zimmerman had not pursued some say stalked trayvon martin that dark , rainy night , martin would still be alive that s the logical argument the legal one is more complex the case , it seems to me , spins on some crucial questions , some of which we may never completely know the answers to what was it about martin in particular that zimmerman found suspicious in the first place \? so far , there has been no testimony that martin was doing anything other than walking slowly and talking on a phone to a girl , as teenage boys are wont to do did zimmerman consider every person walking thusly in the neighborhood to be suspicious \? if not , what made martin different \? was some sort of bias at play , whether an explicit one or an implicit one \? why did zimmerman leave his car , armed with his gun , and follow martin \? when the dispatcher realized that zimmerman was in pursuit and told him , we do n't need you to do that , did zimmerman stop \? did martin know that he was being followed , as his friend rachel jeantel testified , and did he feel threatened by the stranger following him \? in fact , the threat levels are a larger , more complex issue altogether who felt threatened , the teenager with the candy and the soda or the man pursuing him with a gun and a live round in the chamber \? the answer on the surface would seem obvious , but it s possible that both felt some level of threat it s also possible that threat responses washed back and forth between them like water in a tub , neither of them knowing about the other what we know now that zimmerman was armed and martin was not if martin was running away , as zimmerman has said and jeantel has testified , did he at some point stop fleeing , turn and approach zimmerman \? there has been testimony establishing that there was some sort of verbal interaction between zimmerman and martin before a physical one who struck the first blow and why \? if martin struck the first blow , as the defense contends , could that be considered an act of selfdefense \? regardless of who struck the first blow , some testimony suggests that martin was getting the best of zimmerman in that scenario , could the right to selfdefense switch personage \? florida law seems to suggest it can that the use of force is not justified when a person initially provokes the use of force against himself or herself , unless such force is so great that the person reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that he or she has exhausted every reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use of force which is likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the assailant even assuming that martin was winning a physical fight with zimmerman , did zimmerman reasonably believe that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm \? zimmerman was injured , but how do you evaluate the degree of those injuries \? independent assessments may or may not deem zimmerman s injuries severe , but did zimmerman , in the middle of the fight , believe them to be \? had zimmerman exhausted every reasonable means to escape \? who was yelling for help \? keep in mind that it is possible to be both winning a fight and simultaneously yelling for help during opening arguments , john guy , a prosecutor , stated that investigators found none of zimmerman s blood on martin s hands or on the cuffs of his sweatshirt how will the defense explain that \? the bar may be high for the prosecution , but the logic is basic there has been no suggestion or testimony that trayvon martin was doing anything wrong the night that george zimmerman caught sight of him and grew wary of him , pursued him and came into contact with him zimmerman set that night s events in motion and rendered them still with the ring of a gunshot now , as zimmerman sits in a florida courtroom , martin sleeps in a florida grave we will never hear martin s side of the story , about the level of his fear or the feel of the bullet ripping through his body morally , zimmerman is by no means without guilt legally , it remains to be seen whether he will be found guilty of seconddegree murder
washington at a time when 46 billion in mandatory budget cuts are causing anxiety at the pentagon , administration officials see one potential benefit there may be an opening to argue for deep reductions in programs long in s sights , and long resisted by congress on the list are not only base closings but also an additional reduction in deployed and stockpiles and a restructuring of the military medical insurance program that costs more than america spends on all of its diplomacy and foreign aid around the world also being considered is yet another scaling back in nextgeneration warplanes , starting with the , the most expensive weapons program in united states history none of those programs would go away but inside the pentagon , even some senior officers are saying that the reductions , if done smartly , could easily exceed those mandated by sequestration , as the cuts are called , and leave room for the areas where the administration believes more money will be required these include building drones , developing offensive and defensive cyberweapons and focusing on special operations forces publicly , at least , mr obama has not backed any of those cuts , even though he has deplored the dumb approach of simply cutting every program in the military equally mr obama will visit capitol hill on tuesday in another attempt to persuade lawmakers to reach a longterm deficitreduction deal and replace the indiscriminate cuts with more targeted ones still , pentagon officials are starting to examine targeted ways to cut their budget what we 've learned in the past year is that the politics of dumb cuts is easy , because no one has to think through the implications of slicing everything by 8 percent , said one senior defense official who has been deeply involved in the planning process the politics of cutting individual programs is as hard as it s always been when mr obama took office four years ago , with the iraq and afghanistan wars raging , deep cuts in the defense budget seemed unthinkable he forced the pentagon to cut nearly 50 billion a year , which was regarded by many as huge but today , deficit hawks outnumber defense hawks on capitol hill , and the possibility of 100 billion or more in additional annual cuts does not seem outrageous if only agreement were possible on which programs should shrink fastest last week , a group of five former deputy defense secretaries essentially the pentagon s chief operating officers called for a bottom up review that reassesses the need for each major program and weapons system , saying this was an opportunity to accomplish cuts that have long been delayed , after a decade in which the american national security budget has nearly doubled in their more candid moments almost always when speaking with a guarantee of anonymity the pentagon s top civilian and military leaders acknowledge that the painful sequestration process may ultimately prove beneficial if it forces the defense department and congress to reconsider the cost of coldwarera systems that are still in inventory despite the many changes made to the military in the last 10 years sequester is an ugly experience , but it could grow up to be a budget discipline swan , said gordon adams , a former senior budget official in the clinton administration who is now at the , which studies defense issues it could provide the planning discipline the services and the building have been missing since 2001 the central challenge facing the pentagon and the white house , mr adams and several current senior officials said , is this all the big , immediate budget benefits come from reducing the size of activeduty forces by contrast , cutting new weapons systems and bases and reducing health care costs can save large amounts 5 to 10 years out , but it does little in the short term mr obama took a step in that direction in 2011 , when he rejected a pentagon request for a permanent standing force of 100 , 000 or so troops for future contingency operations like those in iraq and afghanistan that s not the way we are going to go , he told his staff after the request was received the message quickly got back to the pentagon that mr obama had no interest in repeating the kind of lengthy interventions that have consumed more than 3 trillion since the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 but the pentagon s subsequent agreement to cut 500 billion in planned spending over a decade turns out to have been just a start , and military officials are now abandoning the phrase that they will have to do more with less and starting to assess what it would mean to just do less toward that end , officials say that ashton b carter , the deputy defense secretary , plans to convene a panel of experts to conduct a crash review of the current national military strategy with an eye to reshaping it to fit the new budget constraints mr carter , whom the white house asked to remain under the new defense secretary , chuck hagel , has already cut the budget for information technology , to force the pentagon to find cheaper ways to provide it , officials say but the next set of cuts will be much harder , because they involve huge constituencies in congressional districts , inside the military services and among veterans' groups the problem is that the biggest , mostneeded cuts are in programs that also have the broadest set of defenders , said , the director of the defense policy studies group at the center for strategic and international studies in washington and a former top aide to gen ray odierno , now the army s chief of staff the most obvious examples of those problems come in base closings and higher copayments or premiums for the beneficiaries of , the military s sprawling health care program , which costs upward of 51 billion a year to take the politics out of base closings , congress in the past has established a commission to identify underused facilities , creating a list that it could either vote up or down on but could not amend but with many of the targeted bases now fairly obvious to members of congress , they are reluctant even to establish a new commission similarly , congress turned back a modest administration effort to revamp tricare there s not a single district without a lot of beneficiaries of the system , ms leed said cuts in the nuclear arsenal face a different political imperative mr obama has been sitting for months on a proposal , agreed to by the joint chiefs of staff , that could trim the number of active nuclear weapons in america s arsenal by nearly a third and make big cuts in the stockpile of backup weapons but he has not signed off on it rather than act unilaterally , the administration is hoping it can negotiate similar cuts with president vladimir v putin of russia and do it without a treaty that would surely set off another battle with defense hawks in the senate but that prospect is doubtful , senior officials say even if mr obama wins his strategic argument that the arsenal is far too large for america s future defense needs , it is not clear how big the savings would be the easiest weapons to cut those based in silos in the middle of the country are also the cheapest to keep in the field the most expensive nuclear weapons to operate are carried aboard submarines they are also the most invulnerable to attack , and thus pentagon and white house strategists want to preserve them the longest moreover , operating a production base for nuclear weapons , the defense department s insurance policy in case the country ever needed to produce more , is very costly though the administration is looking for ways to cut an 80 billion commitment to remake america s nuclear laboratories the biggest target of all is the f35 joint strike fighter , a new jet for the navy , the air force and the marines , and the largest single line item in the pentagon s budget between 55 billion and 84 billion has already been spent , but the estimates of final production costs run close to 400 billion the marine corps says it has no choice but to go forward with its version of the plane , because its current aircraft are obsolete , and the air force wants to replace aging f16s with the new , stealthy plane but the program was wildly mismanaged during the bush administration the joint strike fighter program has been both a scandal and a tragedy , senator john mccain , republican of arizona , said in december 2011 and now that the number of planes scheduled for production has already been slashed , the perplane cost has risen to about 137 million each the handling of the production by lockheed martin , and the huge changes demanded by each of the services , has made the plane an easy target for critics but lockheed has spread production over nearly every state in the union , in order to keep congressional support high as soon as the discussion veers toward strategic needs , lockheed begins to stress the jobs at risk if the program were cut or canceled

deir el gabrawi , egypt egypt s prosecutors have been flooded with blasphemy complaints since 2011 as islamists exercising their new societal clout have pushed for prosecutions and courts have handed down steep fines and prison terms for insulting religion this month alone , a christian teacher in luxor was fined 14 , 000 for insulting the prophet muhammad in class , a writer was given five years in prison for promoting atheism and a christian lawyer was sentenced to one year for insulting islam in a private conversation blasphemy cases were once rare in egypt , and their frequency has increased sharply since the revolution more than two dozen cases have gone to trial , and nearly all defendants have been found guilty at least 13 have received prison sentences the campaign is driven at the local level , where religious activists have also forced officials to suspend teachers and professors in at least 10 cases , christian families have been expelled from their homes after perceived insults , according to ishaq ibrahim of the egyptian initiative for personal rights blasphemy complaints have been lodged across the society , against poor teachers in villages , a deputy prime minister , egypt s richest man , and some of its most prominent writers and journalists a firebrand muslim preacher who tore up a bible at a protest was sentenced to 11 years in prison his son received eight years on similar charges contempt of religion , any religion , is a crime , not a form of expression , said abdel moneim abdel maqsoud , a lawyer for the muslim brotherhood , which has not been instrumental in filing the cases but does not oppose them is setting fire to the bible freedom of expression \? is insulting religion freedom of expression \? he attributed the rise in cases to abuse of the unprecedented freedom of expression since the revolution the increase in blasphemy lawsuits reflects how profoundly the old order has been upset since president hosni mubarak was ousted under mr mubarak , the security services often dealt with islamists and other dissidents outside of the courts blasphemy prosecutions were rare and usually aimed at prominent intellectuals mr mubarak s overthrow in 2011 removed those constraints and allowed for deeply conservative currents in egyptian society to assert themselves in public life on the local level , islamist groups now face few restrictions from weakened state institutions , and the vagueness of laws banning contempt of religion allows for wide interpretations most blasphemy cases have been directed against egypt s christian minority and filed by ultraconservative muslims known as salafis many lack clear evidence last july , a christian teacher , beshoy kamel from sohag in central egypt , heard that someone had created a facebook page using his name and photograph and was posting messages insulting islam and president mohamed morsi , his family said mr kamel told the police about the page , his family said , and posted a warning that still stands on his personal page that the other account was not his but when a local salafi received a private message from the account insulting him and his religion , he filed a complaint against mr kamel , who was arrested soon afterward local islamists heard about the case and spread copies of the texts from the insulting page , causing protests that twice forced the police to delay hearings the day the trial opened , mr kamel was sentenced to six years in prison three for contempt of religion , two for insulting the president and one for slander , court documents say islamists protested outside the court , and shows them rushing to attack mr kamel as the police led him outside mr kamel s family now worries that any perceived infraction could lead to prosecution there was none of that before the revolution , said mr kamel s father , kameel the salafis started to breathe after the revolution , and some of them are taking advantage of the situation court documents show that prosecutors never tried to prove that mr kamel had administered the insulting page , which has since been removed but whose contents were quoted in case files egypt s interior ministry filed a report saying it could not determine the page s owner that made no difference to salah khanous , a salafi lawyer involved in the case , who said there was a systematic campaign among egypt s christians to insult islam they should have cut his throat for it , mr khanous said other cases , too , did not reach the courts until the islamists mobilized the ordeal of makarim saeed , a school secretary in deir el gabrawi , a poor christian farming village in central egypt , started in february 2012 with a conversation with two muslim teachers and within earshot of the christian principal according to court documents , all four , including mr saeed , testified that he said he had denigrated the prophet muhammad but for two weeks after the conversation , no charges were filed , and mr saeed continued to work alongside his muslim colleagues , his family said then word of the conversation reached another teacher who belonged to the salafi call , an ultraconservative group , whose members went to the police mr saeed was arrested that night six days later , as hundreds of islamists protested outside , he was sentenced to six years in prison chants of god is great ! echoed in the courtroom a local spokesman for the salafi call , mohammed arafat , said islamists could not press such cases before the revolution because of the security apparatus before the revolution , if two guys with beards walked in the street together , that was a terrorist organization , he said he saw the case as a legal matter , saying mr saeed had broken the law and probably would have been killed by local muslims had he not been arrested when the issue touches the prophet , our beliefs , our religion or the koran , a muslim will go out to get justice or die , mr arafat said in a written response to a request for comment , mr morsi s office said it did not comment on judicial rulings it said the freedom to litigate had been one of the revolution s benefits , but hinted at the need for reform mr saeed s family does not know what he said in school that day , but guessed that he had been joking or asking a question his family doubts he meant harm his brother wafdi said that mr saeed had worked alongside muslims for three decades , but that since the revolution , relations between muslims and christians had changed it used to be that if you had a fight with a muslim , you would reconcile with the help of a sheik or a priest , he said but now if there is a conflict , they use the law against us

arlington , va should oneonone advice and counseling be protected as free speech \? it sounds like a nobrainer of course it should be but a recent decision by a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit says otherwise ruling on two first amendment challenges to a california law that prohibits licensed medical providers from using talk therapy to try to change a minor s sexual orientation , the court said that such therapy is conduct , not speech , and therefore deserves no protection let s get this out of the way right up front we have no sympathy for the plaintiffs in these cases we are offended by their speech and we think the world would be a better place if the plaintiffs accepted gay people for who they are , instead of treating them as if they were broken and required what is euphemistically called reparative therapy but none of that has anything to do with the central legal question is oneonone advice and counseling not just about homosexuality , but about anything protected free speech under the first amendment \? the answer to that question has national significance and will extend well beyond the fate of the california law and a similar one in new jersey that is now being challenged in federal court the ninth circuit s ruling that talk therapy does n't count as speech has drastic consequences for thousands of americans who speak on all sorts of harmless , everyday topics those americans include people like steve cooksey mr cooksey is a resident of north carolina who was recently ordered by that state s dietitian licensing board to stop offering dietary advice through his web site the board s reasoning \? dietary advice is not speech , it s the conduct of nutritional assessing and counseling his case is not unique our organization , the institute for justice , which represents mr cooksey in a first amendment lawsuit against the north carolina licensing board , is confronting similar arguments nationwide in cases involving speech about parenting , pet care and even history under the ninth circuit s ruling , governments could regulate this speech however they wanted , as long as they relabeled it conduct lawyers for the state of california made exactly this argument they said the state was not regulating speech , but rather medical treatment that could be restricted just like brain surgery or electroshock therapy but whether or not something is protected by the first amendment does not hinge on whether we decide to call it speech or treatment it hinges on whether or not the government is regulating something that communicates a message brain surgery and electroshock therapy do not , but talk therapy whatever else it does clearly communicates a message accepting california s approach would undermine freespeech protections entirely after all , any kind of speech can be relabeled conduct professors engage in the conduct of instructing , political consultants in the conduct of strategizing , and standup comedians in the conduct of inducing amusement fortunately , the united states supreme court has made clear that governments cannot escape the first amendment by playing this kind of labeling game three years ago , the court held that the first amendment applied even to expert legal advice to terrorist groups the federal government in that case made exactly the same argument that california was making here , that such advice was conduct , not speech the supreme court rejected that argument , though it did find that the government s interest in combating terrorism was strong enough to uphold the law under first amendment scrutiny the same reasoning applies here talk therapy , like other advice , consists of communication , and communication gets first amendment protection even when the government calls it conduct importantly , the plaintiffs in the california case would not have automatically won their case had the ninth circuit held that the first amendment applied instead , the government would then have had the burden of coming forward with actual evidence that the law addressed a real problem and limited speech no more than was necessary that burden is serious , but it is not insurmountable it simply means that courts take free speech very seriously , and government officials must present real evidence that their restrictions are necessary to fight a real danger it is possible , maybe even likely , that california will be able to meet this burden with regard to its reparative therapy law but it was the ninth circuit s responsibility to ensure that the state did so , and the court failed now the ninth circuit has a chance to correct this error the plaintiffs in these cases have asked the court to grant a rare en banc rehearing , before the entire court , to reverse the panel s ruling our organization has filed a brief in support of this request the ninth circuit should grant the review not for the sake of the plaintiffs , but for the sake of the thousands of other people who speak for a living and whose rights also hang in the balance here
newport , ri the newport jazz festival , which ended sunday at fort adams state park here , is 59 now it had early brilliance followed by middleage aesthetic confusion , edging into pop and smooth jazz over the last nine years , it has corrected its course , entering a new period of steadiness and dignity as it seeks a new framing of jazz and of its own audience newport serves its own interests its history , its long relationships with particular musicians and monitors the aesthetic horizon , careful not to make its bookings too obscure or too slick there are more inventive , more specific and daring jazz festivals , and bigger ones but newport , with all the important recordings generated from its past and its careermaking \( or careersaving \) performances , is genuinely tied up with the story of modern jazz in the 1950s and some of the '60s , it was often the case that if you were a hero at newport , you were a hero in jazz generally that could be the case again recently the festival has navigated rough waters well there is more to do careers in jazz are long now , but they can take several decades to develop , if developing means getting to the point where an audience at an outdoor festival will give you a standing ovation before you play a note some of those musicians the major heroes of jazz , who attained peak relevance in the '60s or '70s are entering their true late periods chick corea , herbie hancock , eddie palmieri , wayne shorter and roy haynes , all of whom performed over the weekend , are all somewhere on the line between 72 and 88 and all of them performed at a high level mr shorter brought his regular quartet , sometimes augmented by mr hancock , who played fourhanded piano sitting on the bench next to danilo p rez through the group s intuitive , nebulous cohesion mr palmieri brought his orchestra , heaving out hardcore afrocuban dance music and latin jazz , spangled with dissonant piano chords and mr corea presented a new band , the , which finds a middle way between electric fusion and mainstream acoustic jazz it involves the drummer \( mr haynes s grandson \) , the bassist christian mcbride , the saxophonist tim garland and charles altura , who is perfect for this music , a young guitar hero who can play faster than you can think and was himself he swung aggressively , tapdanced , hit all available surfaces with his drumsticks and teased his audience in none of these cases was there a sense of audiences delivering respect just because respect is deserved , a hazard of jazz festivals newport is also trying to replenish those heroes with middleage ones , the major figures whom we might take for granted because they 're so busy the trumpeter and the saxophonist steve coleman fit that description on saturday and sunday mr blanchard s performance felt a bit more normative his working band , including the pianist fabian almazan , the saxophonist brice winston and the guitarist lionel loueke , played new music that borrowed the patient spaciness and curiosity about sound of miles davis s bitches brew period but mr blanchard has a great understanding of pacing and drama , and in the liquid structure of his piece hallucinations , he played a solo that could get pretty much anyone interested in him slow and ripping , with lots of space and variation , thematic , logically built , full of melody and weird texture there was jazz history and process , but it was also thrilling on a basic level mr coleman s setup was more unusual now 56 , he s less about a new group or a new album \( though he has both of those pretty often \) than a continuing lesson the method of his music was what mattered more than lineups or material he played three shorter sets one a firsttime performance of a new composed piece for the classical talea ensemble , joined by jazz improvisers including himself , the trumpeter jonathan finlayson and the drummer dafnis prieto \( it used his overlapping rhythmic cycles on a more even grid and came out sounding like henry threadgill \) then a duet with the pianist david bryant , and finally a loose and mesmerizing set of fast , polyrhythmic , polytonal music with his band , which included mr bryant , the electric bassist anthony tidd , mr finlayson and mr gilmore once again , right after his set with mr corea mr coleman played at the festival two years ago and seems as if he could become a kind of a regular here it would be great to see who else could come on his stage and join his system the festival is also trying to seed the ground for the next group of heroes it s going after the waves of young jazzliterate musicians banging around new england jazz schools , and it sold 1 , 900 reducedprice tickets to them this year , out of the 17 , 200 total attendance \( there are plans to add a third full day to the festival next year of younger musicians only , which could be an important move but only if it does n't seem like ghettoization \) newport jazz wants to represent its interests not just with the new guitar shredders , like mr altura , but the newer scholars and tradition bridgers , like amir elsaffar , the trumpeter and bandleader who brought his group two rivers , incorporating iraqi music and jazz , with an oud and buzuq short and longnecked cousins of the lute alongside a jazz quartet or mary halvorson , who s connecting a classic jazzguitar sound and sensibility \( like that of jim hall , a quieter jazz elder , who also played at the festival \) with its opposite , basically aggression , noise , hyperactivity the pianist jon batiste and bassist esperanza spalding are only 26 and 28 , but they 're fasttracking toward heroism , aiming to get all listeners on their side immediately an impossible goal , but they 're persuasive ms spalding s set , with her wideranging radio music society , used a bigband horn section , pop and funk grooves , and her serene , flexible singing mr batiste played bebop and new orleans rhythm and early jazz mr batiste seems more teacherly , but they are both complicated machines of american musical history , and they wo n't rest until they 've won you a couple of singers this weekend came from a more '70s or early '80soriented place in the africanamerican jazz tradition , strong and sometimes experimental yet serenely unacademic , and they were mightily good one was , from chicago , who sang standards and semicosmic originals , turning her voice into birdsong or a synthesizer or a tibetan monk chant the other was gregory porter , a powerful baritone who writes his own songs neither of them have gonzo youthful vitality they 're hitting their stride midlife they 're not shredders , sound inventors or bringing an xmeetsy concept they 're not turning themselves out to make their case but they , too , could be among this festival s next heroes
london as they move toward military action in syria , possibly within days and presumably without the backing of a united nations security council resolution , the united states , britain and france find themselves enmeshed in a debate over practical and moral questions regarding the necessity of a solid legal rationale for armed intervention the issue is suffused with memories of the march to war in iraq more than a decade ago and the later discovery that saddam hussein did not possess the banned weapons programs used as justification for that invasion in this case , it largely comes down to a question of whether the western allies can assemble a sufficiently broad coalition of support for their action , given that many experts say that existing treaties , laws and precedents do not offer a simple or clearcut case for a military strike against president bashar alassad of syria and his forces the situation with syria differs in many fundamental ways from iraq american , british and french officials have emphasized that any strike on syria will be punitive , shortterm and not aimed directly , at least , to oust mr assad but as with the prelude to the war in iraq , there is also concern that any operation not look like a purely western affair , and that any coalition of the willing include arab countries , not just muslim turkey concern about domestic and international pressure to show legal authority or international backing or both helps explain why prime minister david cameron of britain insisted on going to the security council on wednesday with a request for a resolution despite the opposition to such a step from russia , and probably china and why he promised parliament a second vote on authorizing military action the rush for allies , said shashank joshi of the royal united services institute , a londonbased research group , is one way the west is compensating for being on shaky legal ground without a security council resolution to cite the banning chemical weapons , as the british and french do , is legally tenuous , since it has no enforcement provisions and has never been employed to justify a strike , he said and syria never signed the 1993 followup  another alternative is the newer doctrine of responsibility to protect , derived from the clinton administration s invocation 14 years ago of humanitarian intervention to justify its bombing campaign to halt serbia s ethnic cleansing in kosovo but employing the responsibility doctrine , mr joshi said , raises the question of why now , and why chemical weapons have triggered it so those seeking to strike syria must balance between a chemical convention that does not entail force and the responsibility to protect doctrine , which does , but takes them away from their stated rationale , he said although president obama has not yet made clear his own intentions , french and british officials suggest that an intensive missile attack on syrian government and military installations and airfields , even of short duration , could not only degrade syria s ability to deploy chemical weapons but also encourage mr assad to join in serious negotiations in geneva to find a political solution to the long conflict they also note that there is likely to be considerable support from sunni countries in the middle east that see the civil war in syria as a proxy for the struggle between iran and themselves , and between themselves and sunni islamic radicalism because so many countries are lined up against the syrian regime , the question is not how many countries will support the operation , but how many will be able to actively contribute to it , mr joshi said it was easier in libya , with uncontested airspace but given the short duration of such an action , none of this makes much difference from the diplomatic point of view fran ois heisbourg , a defense expert at the in paris , said he was not particularly concerned about the complications in strictly legal terms the case for this one wo n't be great , but as in kosovo , the law will have to fit the action , he said but unlike kosovo , this is not going to war versus bashar or regime change it s a oneoff strike , with older legal precedents in humanitarian interventions as important , he said , is upholding the norm against the use of chemical weapons , which even the russians have supported , endorsing mr obama s red line last year as for the coalition , it is likely to symbolic , given that only a few nations in the world are able to participate with cruise missiles you ca n't play if you do n't have the marbles , mr heisbourg said the arab league , which would always be reluctant to openly endorse the use of western arms in the middle east , has done enough , he suggested , by declaring that chemical weapons were used by mr assad still , especially in britain , the shadow of the iraq war and the strong alliance at the time between the british leader , prime minister tony blair , and president george w bush hangs over the debate , pushing mr cameron to seek parliamentary approval of any military action and to propose one more security council resolution , even if moscow vetoes it there s a slight degree of skepticism of what comes out of washington and london , said john baron , a senior conservative party legislator on the foreign affairs select committee we were told saddam hussein had chemical weapons , he said , and the consequences of getting this wrong are profound it s a proxy war on many levels , and there is a real danger that without a proper un resolution this conflict can spread mr baron appears to be in the minority , but the opposition labour party is having its own misgivings and is seeking to be sure all efforts are made with the united nations , the legality is clear and the operation is limited parliament will debate the issue on thursday with a vote scheduled for thursday night even the archbishop of canterbury , the most rev justin welby , cautioned against rushing to judgment in with the daily telegraph lawmakers should bear in mind in what is going to be a very , very difficult debate , the archbishop said , asking two questions are we sure about the facts on the ground \? and is it possible to have a carefully calibrated response including armed force , if you are sure about the facts on the ground , that does not have unforeseeable ramifications across the whole arab and muslim world \? i have had a lot of conversations with people in the region , the archbishop said i think the overwhelming sense is of a really moving and terrible sense of fear about what might come out of , what might be happening in the next few weeks not predicated on people doing one thing or people doing another , just a sense that this a terribly , terribly dangerous time even hawkish former officials like zbigniew brzezinski , the national security adviser to jimmy carter , have urged mr obama to seek a wide coalition and broader international participation in a more comprehensive effort to prevent a regionwide explosion , as in wednesday s financial times there was another concern , expressed by the former united nations weapons inspector in iraq , hans blix a punch in the nose wo n't do anything to stop the war , it s telling the belligerents that you can now go on with your war but do n't use gas camille grand , a scholar of unconventional weapons who directs the foundation for strategic research , said that restoring the taboo against the use of chemical weapons is a serious matter credibility is important , too , he said , as will be the untold story of the effort to restore the balance on the syrian battlefield , which could prompt the parties to move to a settlement of course , he acknowledged , it all could go wrong , with the taboo unrestored , more chaos and violence in lebanon , the russians choosing to deliver more advanced weapons systems to syria and attacks on western targets in lebanon and elsewhere in the middle east but on balance , he said , i think the bad scenario is the less likely one
dubai , united arab emirates i 've never been in a big earthquake , but i know what one feels like now , having spent this past week in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates the americanled interim negotiations in geneva to modestly loosen some sanctions on iran in return for some curbs on its nuclear program in advance of talks for an end to sanctions in return for an end to any iranian bombmaking capability has hit the sunni arab world \( and israel \) like a geopolitical earthquake if and when a deal is struck , it could have a bigger impact on this region than anything since the camp david peace treaty and iran s islamic revolution in the 1970s combined to reorder the middle east why \? when iran had its islamic revolution in 1979 , it was , emotionally speaking , like a big brother who walked out , slamming the door behind him everyone in the family got used to his being gone somebody took his bedroom somebody else took his bicycle and everyone enjoyed the undiluted attention and affection of uncle sam for 34 years now , just the thought of big brother , iran , being reintegrated and having its own direct relationship with the united states has set all of america s sunni arab allies saudi arabia , the gulf states , egypt and jordan on edge , especially at a time when iran is malignly meddling in syria , lebanon , yemen and bahrain the signs of that nervousness range from the attack on the iranian embassy in beirut last week that killed 23 people to a recent essay in alsharq alawsat newspaper by one of the arab gulf s leading journalists , abdul rahman alrashed , who wrote from a theoretical , political and military perspective , saudi arabia will have to protect itself from the iranian regime s nuclear program , either with a nuclear weapon or via agreements that will maintain the regional balance of power and protect saudi arabia and the gulf states yikes there are so many layers to this iran is big 85 million people saudi arabia is small 20 million people saudi arabia has the largest oil and gas reserves in the middle east and iran is right behind if sanctions are fully eased one day , will iran take market share away from gulf arabs \? the arab gulf is primarily sunni iran is shiite the iranians are developing indigenous nuclear technology the sunni arabs have none the geneva talks are exposing the different interests that america and its regional allies have vis vis iran , which the sanctions regime had been masking all the years of sanctions allowed diverse parties with diverse interests the us , israel , saudi arabia , the other gulf arabs , europe , russia and china to pretend to be having the same discussion about iran strategy , while disagreeing about the ultimate goal of negotiations and the role that sanctions could play in getting us there or not , notes daniel brumberg , a georgetown university professor and middle east expert at the united states institute of peace if the united states is to maintain its relationships out here , and ensure that the iran nuclear agreement does n't fuel more instability , the interim and final deals have to be good ones sanctions should only be finally removed if we can impose on iran a rollback of its enriched fuels and enrichment technologies , along with sufficient intrusive inspections , to make an undetectable iranian breakout to a nuclear bomb impossible but even if the iranians agree to such a deal , it will be a hard sell to our allies american officials believe that , ultimately , the only way to defuse an iranian threat to the region is both to defuse its nuclear program and change the character of the regime , and that the two are related unlike our allies here in the gulf , we believe that there is real politics inside iran and differences within the leadership and between the leadership and the people but those differences have been largely choked off and the hardliners given a monopoly on power as a result of iran s isolation from the world if we can get an airtight nuclear deal that also opens the way for iran s reintegration into the global economy , american officials hope that different interest groups including more stakeholders in engagement with the us and the west will be empowered inside iran and start to change the character of the regime it may not work , but it s a worthy bet because the only real security for iran s neighbors can come from an evolutionary change in the character of that regime so , if iran s nuclear capabilities are curbed , we can live with that bet on evolutionary change especially since it would likely facilitate an end to the usiran cold war , which has hampered our cooperating on regional issues our allies , by contrast , do not trust iran at all and therefore do n't believe in evolutionary change there they want iran stripped of all nuclear technology until there is regime change we ca n't close that gap we can only manage it by being very clear about our goals to unleash politics inside iran as much as possible , while leashing its nuclear program as tightly as possible , while continuing to protect our arab and israeli allies that s why , in addition to secretary of state john kerry , we may also need a secretary of state just for the middle east because restoring the usiran relationship and bringing it in from the cold after 34 years is such a wrenching shock to the middle east system , it will require daily consultation and handholding with all our arab and israeli friends
, a week before his scheduled departure from afghanistan after 19 months as the commander of the american and allied forces following are some of general allen s comments brief explanations have been provided in brackets on his relationship with president hamid karzai i wanted him to understand that he was always going to have my loyalty and i was always going to work with him in fact , i said a number of times , i m proud to have served you at the same time i served my own leadership , whether it s a nato leadership or us leadership now , i wanted him to believe it because it happened to be true i think our personalities meshed in that regard now , we ve had some tough times this has been a time of really dramatic change for the campaign when i got here , i measured success in how well we and how often we were fighting today , it s a very different environment the afghans are virtually entirely in the lead across afghanistan this is what i ve learned about the president if you listen to him , he s got some pretty good ideas , and often the controversy that has arisen in the relationships hasn t been because necessarily you disagree with the ideas it s because you haven t listened to them early enough and sometimes it s been strained i don t think he ever believed that actions that i have taken were ever intended to disadvantage him as the president , or not do everything i possibly could for the afghan people i told him , i m prepared to die in this country on behalf of his people i take that very seriously on civilian casualties i ve met with the families of the casualties that we ve inflicted i ve flown to the villages to personally apologize for the casualties , and do what i can to do the right thing for those families i ve taken measures with respect to the employment of certain kinds of fires fires is common military shorthand for a variety of munitions , from bullets to missiles to mortar shells we had a couple of pretty rough incidents where afghans were killed by the delivery of aviation fires i eventually said to president karzai that civilian structures , tents , potential areas where civilians might be either taking refuge or hiding or living , i m not going to deliver any more fires on those structures unless my troops are pinned down , can t move , and the only option they have is to deliver fires on these structures , or i decide , the senior leader out here , i decide to deliver fires on these structures the civilian causalities as a result of air fires plummeted immediately it was probably a decision i could have made long before that and none of our forces were put at risk , or at greater risk because of this on the aftermath of the burning of korans at bagram air base i have to tell you , i thought this could be it for the relationship i immediately got on the phone to a number of afghan media outlets , immediately cut a video apologizing for this as sincerely as i could possibly appear and sound because this was going to be bad , it could be really bad i called the president , i went to see him , apologized to him for this it was completely inadvertent but this culture deserved that apology we were in their home , so to speak we are guests in their home and even though it was an accident , even though it was not intentional , we had made a bad mistake , a real error and the people deserved my apology , the president deserved my apology he accepted it and i think in many respects , the personal nature of our relationship was what tempered the language coming out of the palace , the releases , his own engagement with the media and so on because of both of our actions , both of them supporting each other , we were able to keep this from being the result of a bad mistake from being something that could have really fractured the relationship on the fallout in march after an american soldier killed 16 villagers in the southern afghan district of panjwai , which he first heard about when he was in the united states to testify before congress the first phone call was something of the effect of we ve got mixed reporting from panjwai we think an american soldier maybe shot some people and my response was , all right let s develop the situation quickly tell me what we got in front of us because we ve got to make the afghans in the loop on this then the phone calls started coming in and the numbers started going up and pretty quick and this is as bad a circumstance as you might have imagined i called president karzai from home and we had a long conversation about it i promised him once again that we would take all steps , measures , take all actions necessary to get to the bottom of this and we would do a full and complete investigation and those people necessary would be held accountable this was still unfolding was it one shooter \? was it multiple shooters \? there were wild rumors associated with things that he had done in addition to shooting so the information environment was wide open at this point and both for the purposes of internal stability in afghanistan and for the purposes of preserving our relationship we were working very , very hard to confirm what we knew to be the facts and try very hard to get after the rumors that were just flying once again , when he could have been angry , when it could have been a very negative conversation , i mean , he was tutorial he explained to me why this is bad for the relationship , why this is bad for the campaign , and why this will shake the confidence of the afghan people , his personal gesture of measured conversation with me he wasn t angry on why the united states should stay engaged in afghanistan i put it in the context of this has been worth it this is bigger than anyone of us it s bigger than the president it s bigger than the president of afghanistan , because this isn t about today this is about tomorrow this is about doing all we can to facilitate president karzai with his desire to be successful but it ll be about doing all we can do to set up his successor for success on overcoming the skepticism of officials in washington , who often express frustration with mr karzai for this president , at this moment of its history , afghanistan s history , to be able to hold together these tribes and these ethnic groups with these kinds of challenges has got to be one of the hardest jobs going and so i try to paint the context of the challenges that he faces , the history from which he originates and how , conceivably , he will interpret our actions he may not understand what we are trying to do , or may misinterpret what we re trying to do or say and frankly , one of the great things about our democracy is also one of the hardest things about our democracy that is , we don t always speak with the same voice so he ll hear a voice from one part of the government , it will be different for another part of the government and he ll seek to square the differences it s not a criticism , it just is who we are the farther you are away from kabul , the farther you are away from the palace , the farther you are away from the history of this country in the complexities of society , the easier it is to generalize , frankly on the need for the afghan government to better serve its people and stamp out corruption within its ranks we ve worked very hard , obviously , to build a capacity in those but when your ability to survive the night , or put food on the table was well , for many years are a function of what tribe you were part of , or what group you were part of and those patronage networks undertook economic opportunities which made them some respect , criminal patronage networks they can only survive because institutions of governance are weak and so now , we find ourselves in a death grip here at this very moment when the future of the country relies on the strength of institutions the criminal patronage networks recognize that their future , their survival can only be sustained by keeping these institutions weak that s the moment we find ourselves in , and the presidential directive on any anticorruption and government reform and the mutual accountability framework that came out of tokyo these created very helpful , very useful , both domestic and international expectations for reform so we need to see us moving past the written word and the spoken word and start moving towards action i think the president , if he were sitting here would tell you that they have achieved some good action , good results in his presidential decree the mutual accountability framework is constantly being audited to see that there s progress on reform but again , we re still pretty fresh in the process and we ve got to let this play out some more on the future of the war and afghanistan let me make sure i m clear on this nothing is sure in a postconflict society but i think the indicators , as far as i m concerned , are that we re on the right trajectory what you have to understand , what people have to understand is some of these reforms take a very long time in an environment where human rights were crashed under multiple different invasions or civil wars or the taliban , creating once again the kind of bias for human rights that we would all expect in the western society , just doesn t come easily to this country nothing will happen in this country without security and that security is being purchased every single day by the afghan national security forces and then , on the platform of that security , this president has announced a program or platform that he intends to follow now , he s moving forward in some areas , he s having resistance in others , but we just have to expect this is going to take time that s where huge patience has to come in that s where the decade of transformation comes in on the surge of insider attacks against westerners that took place in 2012 the losses became to this particular means of attack became very troubling , very significant , and tragic and while on the tactical level and on the operational level , we were able to deal with the problem this was becoming a strategic crisis a strategic crisis in capitals , a strategic crisis for the alliance and the taliban saw this they knew this they saw that they saw that the future of the ansf relied on our being close , partnered and advising inside the afghan formations we were very careful in our reaction to insider attacks not to wall ourselves off from the afghans and create distance i used to tell them , you may not be able to do anything about the linear distance that you have to deal with but there s a lot you can do about your proximity and the closer you all feel to each other , the more secure you will be and that s in an environment where we re transitioning to being advisers almost entirely across afghanistan that has to be one of the operative principles for philosophically how we re going to live with the afghans you treat them like brothers you live with them like they re family that reduces the unknowns , it reduces the potential for cultural affront , and it makes you more secure that doesn t mean we re not going to keep a close eye on the environment we still have these people called guardian angels because there are enemies in the ranks and they re waiting to take that shot we took a lot of measures and the numbers are down but i don t in any way want anybody to become complacent about the number being down i don t want anyone to lift up on the security measures that they re taking or reduce the attentiveness that they have to the environment around them so , i want everybody to be attentive and we re going to periodically refresh our training both at the very lowest levels and for the units coming in so , we re not going to give up on this
kabul , afghanistan as afghan political appointees go , they may not seem that unusual taken as a group one is a mullah who sees shariah law as the best source for human rights legislation another was in the central bureau of the country s most powerful fundamentalist party a third is a bureaucrat seen as close to the president , and a fourth is a retired police fourstar general they were among the five new members president hamid karzai appointed two weeks ago to the nineperson afghanistan independent human rights commission , and the news brought in the human rights community here the ripples quickly spread to geneva , where the united nations' human rights commissioner , navi pillay , took the unusual step of publicly condemning the presidential appointments now , the appointments are said to be on the agenda as afghanistan s foreign donors meet to assess whether mr karzai s government is living up to the mutually agreedupon benchmarks on promoting good government and combating corruption , known as theoretically , billions of dollars in international reconstruction aid is at stake a meeting of donors here , which began on monday and ends on wednesday , is likely to conclude that , on the human rights commission , afghanistan failed in its commitments , according to a western diplomat familiar with the deliberations , speaking about the closeddoor talks on the condition of anonymity the human rights commission , or aihrc , is one of the crown jewels of the western effort here , an organization trained and financed by the international community that gains high marks from activists both locally and abroad it has been known for more than a year that mr karzai would be appointing new commissioners among the former members , one was killed in a terrorist attack , another was forced out by the commission , and three more were dismissed by presidential decree the dismissals , in particular , were widely seen as a the former rights commissioner ahmad nader nadery , whose shepherding of a in afghanistan had made him powerful enemies in particular , the report was said to anger marshal muhammad qasim fahim , the first vice president and a leader of the fundamentalist jamiatiislami party , which includes several former warlords the report , though completed two years ago , has yet to be released publicly because it is awaiting mr karzai s approval concerned , donor countries and united nations agencies leaned on the afghan government to assure that new commissioners would be chosen for their political independence , human rights experience , and after widespread consultation with civil society leaders the resulting list of appointees , they say , fell far short serious concerns have been raised whether the new commissioners meet these important eligibility standards , ms pillay said in a from her agency she also said the commission might lose its a accreditation under international human rights standards known as the paris principles that , in turn , would have serious consequences for continued international donor support for both the aihrc and for the government , she said a spokesman for the president , aimal faizi , said that mr karzai s appointments were in full consultation with civil society and he admonished ms pillay , saying that the commission is a purely internal issue of afghanistan , and the un s human rights commissioner had better to also raise its concerns on the issue of civilian casualties in the war on terror the commission , with offices throughout afghanistan and 650 staff members , gets scant financial support from the government most of its 75 million annual european countries , along with canada , australia and the united nations i was very outraged and felt very bad to see that all those demands from civil society and human rights groups were not respected in this process to appoint new commissioners , mr nadery said wazir ahmad khorami , the deputy director of the civil society and human rights network , said that his group had given mr karzai the names of 27 potential candidates for the commission but that none were chosen i think he just wants to destroy the commission because in the last 10 years they were so very active and so effective , and now he is under so much pressure from different warlords who are against it , mr khorami said in interviews on sunday and monday , all five of the new commissioners maintained that their human rights credentials were sound but the policy stances and political affiliations of two , in particular , have concerned many analysts one new commissioner , maulavi abdul rahman hotak , is a mullah , islamic scholar and former taliban government official who , for three years , was detained by the american military at its bagram prison and he is adamant in opposing the elimination of violence against women act , one of the aihrc s signature lobbying achievements first , i'm a muslim , and islam is a good source of human rights standards , maulavi hotak said the people who have written that law do not know afghanistan and afghan society very well perhaps they think kabul is afghanistan another appointee who has stirred questions is qadria yazdanparast , a longtime stalwart in the jamiatiislami party ms yazdanparast maintained she had resigned her post in jamiatiislami a month ago , thus fulfilling the requirement for commissioners to be nonpolitical but she also said that she hoped to run for president in 2014 , and hoped to have mr karzai s support ms yazdanparast bristled at suggestions that she was closely associated , through jamiatiislami , with afghanistan s warlords , many of whom maintain private armies even while holding government posts when we were fighting during jihad against the soviets , every country like the us saw us as champions of human rights , and now we are war criminals and other people are human rights champions \? she said it s very

before congress is finished with the internal revenue service , there s a serious danger some of us are going to wind up feeling sorry for the auditors and , honestly , that is not the way we were planning on spending the spring especially since it appears that there are people making decisions at the irs who have the intelligence of a wet frisbee but , so far , the congressional hearings of outrage have been even less sympathetic perhaps you did n't have time to spend much of your friday watching the house ways and means committee grill steven miller , the newly axed irs head , about the agency s targeting of groups with names like tea party for unwelcome indepth attention let me summarize thank you all for coming here today our topic is abuses in the internal revenue service , an entity that i believe is about the size of china , with long , spiky tentacles that reach out and squash all the hopes and dreams of the american people my first question , mr miller , is whether your agency is so enormous and evil that it will one day destroy the nation as we know it , or whether it already has , and this committee is actually just sitting on the scattered shards and rubble of what once was a great republic thank you for inviting me here today i would like to begin by apologizing for mistakes that have been made now i am prepared to begin answering your questions , and then gradually fade into sullen exhaustion thank you , mr chairman , for organizing this bipartisan outpouring of rage i would like to begin by welcoming inspector general j russell george , and asking him to repeat his conclusion that none of the bad things we 're discussing were the result of partisan pressure possibly he could say that twice then i would like to ask him to confirm that he was appointed by george w bush and then to point out that the guy who was in charge of the irs when all this happened was also appointed by george w bush mr miller , how would you like it if we were to subpoena your emails and phone calls and records of anyone you 've met with over the last four years \? also , have you ever had any contact with the obama reelection campaign \? i would just like to say in my defense that the irs provided horrible customer service what the irs did was inexcusable also , i want to register my strong protests about the way mr miller keeps interrupting me while i am demanding that he answer my questions and then everybody went home for the weekend what are we going to do about the irs \? some of its workers made wildly inappropriate judgments and some of its top brass appears to have the spunk of a pillow congress is demanding that heads roll , but the inspector general says that , so far , there s no evidence of political pressure , just ineptitude there is literally only one person in the entire operation who s not covered by civil service , so i would n't expect a purge miller , in his testimony , said that , so far , one employee has been relocated in punishment for his or her role in the case the american people cry out for blood and they get a transfer but here s where the sympathy comes in the irs employees were stuck with a pile of 70 , 000 applications for the taxexempt status that s awarded to organizations engaged in social welfare issues recently , political groups have been gaming the system , announcing they 're just dogooders with a minor political sideline in order to qualify when they succeed , they get to keep their donors secret the rules for who qualifies are murky , and , according to miller , only about 150 to 200 people were making the decisions about who got further scrutiny also , they were working at the determinations unit of the rulings and agreements office of the exempt organizations division of the internal revenue service spending their lives trying to clarify the 501 \( c \) \( 4 \) status you try that for a while and see how you like it if congress wanted to help , the members could simplify the law so irs minions are n't trying to figure out which groups spend only 49 percent of their resources on politics as opposed to 51 percent or , they could give the irs more money to do the job it s stuck with now the budget has been cut almost 1 billion over the last few years , while its duties have expanded next friday , irs workers will enjoy the first of a series of unpaid furloughs thanks to that sequester or congress could just keep holding committee hearings in hopes that investigators will finally discover that the irs offices in cincinnati are actually controlled by a pack of leftwing operatives who are not only obamaphiles but also vampires vampires who had no respect for the laws regarding 501 \( c \) \( 4 \) status
defense wins championships , so they say it s such a cliche adage that it s not really clear what sport it originally referred to but when a sports commentator \( or 40 \) uses that phrase to refer to the nba , are they being accurate \? somewhat more than half of the teams that won an nba championship in the last 40 seasons have been top five squads defensively , but the team that leads the league in defensive efficiency has lost in the first round as often as it has taken home the title this season , the best defensive team in the league was the indiana pacers by a solid margin looking at the makeup of their team , it s not hard to see why the defense starts on the perimeter , with three players of aboveaverage athleticism and length george hill s a nagging point with unnaturally long arms , lance stephenson s the coney island kid who grew up as a scoring point guard but turned into a defenseoriented shooting guard , and although paul george earned the most improved player award for picking up the offensive slack with danny granger out for most of the season , george , a 68 wing , also earned a reputation for shutting down opposing scorers and got eight firstplace votes for defensive player of the year each is capable of staying in front of their marks and recovering quickly to contest shots , resulting in teams shooting the secondfewest 3pointers against them and hitting just 327 percent of them , the worst percentage in the league inside the arc , things don t get much easier roy hibbert , the pacers 72 center , had his best season as a defender , finishing second in the league with 28 blocks per game throw in some solid role players and a grinding pace that gets teams out of their offensive rhythm , and you have a team that stood out as the best in the league at defense per basketballreferencecom , the pacers allowed just 998 points per 100 possessions , half a point better than the secondbest team , the memphis grizzlies , and six points better than the league average but what does that mean for indiana s future \? they ve taken a 20 lead in their firstround series against a sluggish atlanta hawks team , with george recording a tripledouble in game 1 and adding 27 points tuesday night but despite the trope about rings and defense , you d be hardpressed to find people talking about indiana making a run to a championship we took a look at teams that led the league in defensive efficiency and tracked how they finished in the playoffs we also took a look at how the eventual champions each year finished in defensive efficiency \( defensive efficiency data goes back to the 19734 season \) defensive efficiency leaders since 197374 by eventual finish \( 39 seasons , plus five ties \) champions seven runnersup seven conference finals seven conference semifinals 11 first round 12 nba champions since 197374 by defensive efficiency ranking first seven second four third five fourth five fifth three sixth or seventh seven eighth or ninth four 10th and higher four some tidbits the pacers are a great defense for leading the league , but they aren t historically great defensive leaders on average are 89 points per 100 possessions better than the nextbest team , and 561 points per 100 possessions better than the league average the pacers 5 and 60 are slightly worse and slightly better than those averages truly elite defenses tend to shine only nine teams have ever finished 65 points per 100 possessions ahead of the league average four of those won the championship none lost in the first round of the 10 teams to finish 15 points per 100 possessions better than the secondbest defense in the league , three have won championships , although one lost in the first round teams with the league s best defense have had more success in the more modern nba five of the last 17 winners have led the league in defensive efficiency only one team the 20001 lakers has won the nba championship despite having a belowaverage defense , which finished 21st that s bad news for four teams in this year s playoffs the lakers , rockets , nets , and the knicks how do teams with the best offense in the league fare \? better , but only slightly eight of them have won the championship and it hasn t happened in a while michael jordan s bulls teams led the league in offense for four of their six championships , but no topranked offense has won the title since chicago s 1997 win the pacers should take pride in being the league s best at keeping opponents off the score sheet , and they are halfway to avoiding one of those ugly firstround exits but being the staunchest , stingiest squad on paper does not mean as much as an old saying might make it seem
between 1862 and 1865 , officers of the confederate district court of north carolina , empowered by a new national law , confiscated and sold millions of dollars worth of property from north carolinians accused of being alien enemies the proceeds of confiscated and sold property were to be sent immediately to richmond , but most was never reported many officers of the district court , like david schenck of lincoln county , became wealthy enforcing the act of sequestration while thousands of their fellow tar heels were deprived of their property , charged with disloyalty , and in some cases even executed as enemies of the confederacy the confederate law was inspired by the union s first confiscation act of aug 6 1861 , which laid the legal groundwork for northern forces to confiscate southerners private property being used to aid the rebellion although not directly mentioned in the act itself , it was understood , and later confirmed by executive order , that property included slaves passage of the confiscation law touched a raw nerve with confederates protection of personal property rights , and particularly the right to slave property , underpinned the confederate government s entire political philosophy not surprisingly , within a month , the jefferson davis administration responded with its own version of governmentsanctioned confiscation the confederate act of sequestration was passed on aug 30 , 1861 the southern congress designed the act of sequestration to strike at northern financial interests within the confederate states it mandated that confederate agents would locate all and every lands , tenements , hereditaments , goods , and chattels , rights and credits within these confederate states and every right and interest therein held , owned , possessed or enjoyed by or for any alien enemy such property would be sequestered by the confederate states of america confiscated property of alien enemies would be sold and the proceeds paid into a fund , administered by the treasury department , from which loyal confederates could make indemnity claims the indemnity clause was problematic however , for it stated that confiscated property shall be held for full indemnity of any true and loyal citizen of these confederate states , yet nowhere did the act define or offer any criteria for identifying true and loyal citizens the primary difficulty with enforcing the law would be locating northernowned property the confederate government would rely heavily on information volunteered by ordinary citizens , but if anyone proved reluctant to provide the government the information it sought , sequestration officials were given extraordinary punitive powers to search out and seize confiscable property enforcement of the law fell to two newly created arms of the confederate department of justice , receivers and federal grand juries receivers tracked down and seized property suspected of belonging to a northerner , while federal grand juries aided receivers by interrogating those whose loyalty was suspect , which could be anyone the confederate attorney general was charged with putting the law into effect , but aside from that stipulation the act set no parameters or limitations on the power of receivers and grand juries to acquire the information or property they sought the system s bureaucratic process for facilitating sequestration was complex , and with few exceptions receivers seldom left a record of their involvement with seizing property grand jury identities were secret and the minutes of their interrogations destroyed after each session rather than keeping detailed records of all property confiscated and sold , and the amount each property fetched at auction , receivers reported only on those properties that were sold in this way the system placed a partial veil of secrecy over sequestration the act s silence on nearly all interpretative matters placed the awesome responsibility of defining the terms loyal confederate and alien enemy entirely in the hands of local sequestration officials moreover , unlike other laws , like conscription , impressments and taxinkind , which were administered by state officials , sequestration proceedings were the exclusive jurisdiction of the confederate district courts judges thus wielded unprecedented power for example , asa biggs , the judge of the north carolina confederate district court , personally appointed every officer of the court in north carolina , including the ardent secessionist david schenck , who became a receiver at the outset of the war , schenck was a struggling middleclass lawyer who was put out of work by north carolina s stay act , which drastically reduced the type and number of cases that could be brought before the district court he owned a small farm on the outskirts of lincolnton and owned no slaves he began his duties as receiver in the western piedmont , including cleaveland , catawba , lincoln , gaston , iredell and mecklenburg counties , in september 1862 within days he confided to his diary that he had already sold some 20 , 000 worth of sequestered real estate an amount exceeding the state comptrollers report of the gross value of all nonreal estate taxable property \( gold watches , wagons , carriages \) in cleaveland and catawba counties combined in the adjoining district , receiver cn white sold 354 acres of prime cotton land in union county at auction for 5 an acre on sept 16 , 1862 assuming the land schenck sold fetched the same amount , he would have sold some 4 , 000 acres of land a few weeks later schenck purchased his first slave for 1 , 225 , bought some land to build a new house , and by year s end he estimated his earnings to be 9 , 000 the question that necessarily arises here regards the source of such wealth , especially when , as a confederate bureaucrat , schenk was paid in confederate currency , which was depreciating daily the receivers ledger for the sequestration fund from the confederate treasury offers a clue according to the ledger , which kept track of all funds remitted , schenck s district remitted only 3 , 61024 in 1862 it also shows that he was paid 31958 to cover the cost of expenses incurred while executing the duties of his office there is no evidence that the full 20 , 000 from confiscated property sold at auction in september was ever deposited into the sequestration fund in richmond could it be that members of the district court distributed those and other funds liberally among themselves \? still another important question is , who was buying all this property \? in an economy that quickly fell victim to hyperinflation and rapid devaluation of its currency , who possessed enough ready capital to buy so much land and property \? in wilmington , the receiver dubrutz cutlar seized real estate belonging to jb allen when a neighbor , william gordon , accused allen of being disloyal when cutlar auctioned allen s property it was bought by william gordon in union county , the receiver cn white sold mineral rights on 288 acres of land to robert hall morrison , the fatherinlaw of the generals daniel harvey hill and thomas j stonewall jackson morrison also owned land adjacent to the land he purchased from white notably , schenck emerged from the civil war owning six lots in lincolnton and several pieces of land nearby what became of the officers of the north carolina district court \? asa biggs and dubrutz cutlar practiced law in tarboro and wilmington , respectively david schenck practiced law in lincolnton after the war , and later became a superior court judge for the ninth judicial district he also became the leader of the ku klux klan in western north carolina as for the countless men and women accused of being enemy aliens , none ever received restitution follow disunion at or join us  rodney steward is an assistant professor of history at

right now you are probably asking yourself will the new congress being sworn in this week work any better than the last one \? there s always a chance because , you know , it s also , the bar is low , since some people believe the departing 112th congress was the worst in history , because of its stupendous lack of productivity and a favorability rating that once polled lower than the idea of a communist takeover of america on the very last day the republicanled house of representatives was in session , the republican governor of new jersey , chris christie , announced it was why the american people hate congress this was after speaker john boehner failed to bring up a bill providing aid to the victims of the megastorm sandy disaster relief joined a long list of bills that the 112th congress could not get its act together to approve , along with reforming the farm subsidies and rescuing the postal service those particular pieces of legislation were all written and passed by the senate , a group that s generally less proactive than a mummy ah , the house to be fair , it takes a lot of effort to vote to repeal obamacare 33 times our outgoing lawmakers did retrieve us from that fiscal cliff although they were the ones who pushed us off in the first place and they left the new congress facing a debt chasm , a sequestration void and a governmentstoppage bottomless pit so , yeah , this last one was pretty darned bad the best argument i can make for it is that none of the outgoing members walked onto the floor and brained a colleague with a cane , as did happen in the 34th congress which also was being led by president franklin pierce so i would give the 34th the ribbon but definitely the 112th is a contender the new congress will have a few more democrats in the house and senate , which will not make any difference whatsoever on the plus side , the proportion of political nut jobs may be a little lower representative allen west of florida , who once called president obama a lowlevel socialist agitator , is , many recounts later , a member no more representative joe walsh of illinois was defeated by tammy duckworth , a military veteran who lost both legs in iraq and who walsh claimed was not one of our true heroes walsh was also an excellent reminder of an important rule in american politics refrain from criticizing the other party for fiscal irresponsibility until you can work out a resolution of that child support issue tea party favorite senator jim demint of south carolina has departed , too , even though his term was only half over , to answer the siren call of a sevenfigure job at the helm of the heritage foundation thanks to the blog smart politics , i am able to report that this is normal behavior in south carolina onethird of all us senators from south carolina have resigned over the course of our history \( south carolina is also the state that gave us the guy with the cane back in 1856 \) demint was replaced by representative tim scott , whose seat will be filled in a special election this spring right now one of the possible candidates is mark sanford , the governor who we all remember for flying to argentina for an assignation with his lover while his staff claimed he was hiking on the appalachian trail another muchdiscussed potential contender is jenny sanford , former wife of the above people , while you are praying for a safe , sane and peaceful new year , i want you to make a small exception and pray that jenny and mark sanford run against each other demint s departure was only unusual for its abruptness members of congress regularly glom onto highpaying jobs in the private sector , none of which involve the use of their skills in computer technology the center for responsive politics counts 373 former house and senate members who are currently working as lobbyists that includes the former utah senator bob bennett , who announced that he would be filing his official papers on thursday , the exact moment the legal twoyear revolving door ban expires bennett had complained bitterly about the coolingoff period being a restraint of his constitutional rights , which left him forced to eke out a living as a consultant for the bennettgroup and a member of a highprofile washington law firm when it comes to a sudden departure , though , the new titleholder has to be representative jo ann emerson of missouri , who quit congress to become president and chief executive of the national rural electric cooperative association less than a month after she was reelected to another term she said she had found a new way to serve the center for responsive politics noted that the national rural electric cooperative association was not only a big lobbying group , but also emerson s biggest lifetime campaign contributor still , remember , could be worse no canes
why go back \? after five years in the army , with 27 months spent in iraq and much of the rest in honolulu , why would lance marottek , 25 , return to the northeastern montana town of poplar , population less than 1 , 000 \? on the rough edge of the fort peck indian reservation , with a graduating high school class of just 40 students , it offers the kind of small town life many young men join the military to flee from , never to return but , when mr marottek finished his second deployment to iraq with the 25th infantry division in 2011 , he said he had figured out that i can do whatever i want in montana hunting , fishing , driving no one s going to bother me , no one s going to stop me i could never live in a city honolulu was almost too much the wanderlust that had motivated him to enlist in 2007 arose after a few boring classes at community college , and a realization that he was falling into a simple extension of high school amid the often dreary emptiness around the reservation his grandfather , a korean war veteran , had always suggested military service he and about a half dozen other students in his small high school class made the same choice , he said i couldn t imagine my life being if i did the same things i did in high school , he said how many people get to say they lived in hawaii for a couple years \? or iraq \? i wanted to travel and see some different things like many veterans with multiple deployments , he remembers one more fondly than the others while he deployed both times with alpha company , first battalion , 14th infantry regiment , his 20079 experience was much more rewarding , he said , with the unit aggressively controlling the area around tarmiyah , a rugged little city north of baghdad the men were tightknit , packed into bays filled with bunk beds in a city youth center turned into a joint security station they found an intense camaraderie in the rough conditions and nonstop missions the second deployment , at a joint service station , or american minibase , called mchenry near hawija in 201011 , the soldiers were in twoman trailers , with plenty of private space where they could disappear on their own to watch movies and play video games it wasn t the same they lost that tightknit feel and , with a much less aggressive mission posture , mr marottek felt that they opened themselves up to more attacks his closest call came when a rocketpropelled grenade penetrated his heavily armored vehicle , called a mrap it was like a flaming baseball bat slamming against my head , he said no purple heart from the sprayed shrapnel and no concussion , but i think i m always going to have ringing in my ears that s just going to be normal my girlfriend gets annoyed , asking me a question , and i say huh \? the army taught mr marottek to drive mraps and stryker armored vehicles , so his postmilitary transition to driving backhoes and trucks around the booming north dakota oil fields was not a difficult one many veterans find it easy to fall into familiar ruts upon returning home before the army , mr marottek had briefly taken classes in operating heavy equipment , but he didn t want to simply go back to school and get bored like he did before someone gave him a number to call , and he hooked on with a fourman company working in the north dakota oil fields a yearandahalf later , the company , common denominator , has about 45 men who drive trucks , backhoes and other equipment in the fields of the bakken oil field about two hours away the oil fields provide good work , he says , with 12hour days paying about three times as much as he earned when he was deployed it starts as grunt work , but raises and bonuses kick in for the men who last 60 days with demand for workers so high , he says he s still surprised when some workers collect a bonus for five straight days on the job then disappear i don t understand a lot of poverty , he said the opportunity is there , but only a handful of people want to take it halfsioux from a native american father who was never in his life , mr marottek was raised by his mother s parents after she passed away when he was 5 while his father s extended family lives throughout the reservation , he encounters them only sporadically his grandfather pete owned a farm south of town , where mr marottek grew up helping as a farmhand one regret from iraq , he said , was not seeing his grandfather for about a year before he died in june 2008 he d been smoking , drinking and dipping his entire life just what he did mr marottek made it to the funeral on emergency leave , in just 48 hours , i was in billings , mont , he said but there was no time to adjust i was in a walmart with no weapon , and none of my guys it was rough his grandmother marianne still runs the farm today , he said , and you tell me how many 70yearold women work three jobs mr marottek recruits new guys for his company s work crew , men he can vouch for , and who want to work , and fellow veterans if he can find them we can share some experiences , and it makes it easier but if it wasn t for those guys on the crew , i wouldn t even talk about iraq i hardly think about it that much , he said the army was a chapter , but i m not going to make it run my life ironically , a visible reminder of iraq are the region s sprawling mancamps , like the one near williston , nd , where the oil fields are a common destination of mr marottek s crew the camps help with the region s housing problem there are lots of jobs , but nowhere for workers to live , and no easy way to create an infrastructure mr marrotek said he was fortunate to have access to cheaper , hometown rent in poplar for himself , his girlfriend , carlee , and their two young girls it s often a twohour commute to work sites , but in northeast montana , he said , it s about two hours to everywhere about the camps , with their neat lines of hundreds of trailers , complete with dining facilities , onsite recreation and strict rules forbidding alcohol and visitors , mr marottek said , they damn near look like a forward operating base nathan s webster embedded in iraq several times as a freelance photojournalist his book , can t give this war away three iraqi summers of change and conflict is available as an ebook on follow his blog at and on  an earlier version of this post misidentified the location of the montana town of poplar it is in the northeast , not northwest
no sooner had arkansas adopted the country s most regressive abortion law earlier this month a ban after about 12 weeks of pregnancy than to as early as six weeks both measures are expected to be ruled unconstitutional , but here s my question is north dakota that much more conservative than , say , south dakota , where abortions are permitted up to 24 weeks \? colorado has now decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana is colorado really more libertarian than neighboring wyoming , where possession can still get you a year in prison \? pennsylvania allows samesex couples to adopt children are pennsylvanians so much more enlightened than the citizens of ohio , where gay parents have hardly any rights \? maryland has just decided to repeal the death penalty good for maryland but why not delaware , next door , where the 17 inmates on death row are still biding time until their lethal injections \? and do n't get me started on gun laws south dakota is currently leading the race to the bottom by arming teachers in their classrooms , but just wait the pandering to the gun lobby is ferociously competitive there is nothing especially new about states going their own way we fought a civil war , after all and we have become accustomed to categorizing states as red or blue , based on their electoral choices but it feels as if every news cycle brings another seemingly random example of a state veering off the mainstream , especially on these issues of personal liberty what s up with that \? in recent years our disjointed political system has gotten considerable attention from journalists and academics seeking to explain why our supposedly indivisible nation seems so intractably divided at the level of congress , the diagnosis is pretty well understood gerrymandering of congressional districts makes incumbents safe in general elections but vulnerable in party primaries , where the most passionate voters decide the outcome so the incumbents \( these days , especially the republicans \) avoid any sign of reasonableness that could be used against them in a primary the same thing is happening to some extent at the state level , but none of this fully explains the wild disparities bill bishop s 2008 book the big sort attracted highprofile attention \( bill clinton touted it \) with its hypothesis that likeminded americans were clustering in communities where they reinforced one another s prejudices according to this , americans choose neighborhoods they find compatible pockets of likeminded citizens that have become so ideologically inbred that we do n't know , ca n't understand , and can barely conceive of those people' who live just a few miles away bishop s book was provocative , and was for relying too much on data from presidential elections because they offer voters a stark eitheror choice , presidential elections overstate the partisan divide when you look at voter registration or opinion polling , the fastestgrowing political allegiance is not red or blue but independent and while there are anecdotal accounts of , for example , gay couples choosing homes in communities that respect their rights , there s not much evidence that deliberate ideological selfsegregation is a widespread phenomenon dante chinni and james gimpel , in a 2010 book called our patchwork nation , subdivided america into a dozen categories , with special emphasis on the urbanrural divide , to explain why different places go in such different directions gimpel , who teaches at the university of maryland , told me that rural and smalltown residents feel belittled by what they perceive as the cultural imperialism of big cities they hunker around their fox news , which feeds their resentment he is surely right about rural alienation , but , as gimpel acknowledges , america is increasingly neither urban nor rural it is suburban , or urbanish the patchwork formula does n't fully explain why iowa , one of our least urbanized states , has accepted samesex marriage , or why voters in the most urbanized state , california , voted to reject it i heard a more satisfying if somewhat depressing explanation for the seemingly random eruptions of political idiosyncrasy from samuel abrams , who teaches politics at sarah lawrence and stanford abrams , who has spent the last decade or so researching our political habits , begins with the evidence that most americans are simply not engaged in local politics , except perhaps on pocketbook issues in the absence of public attention , motivated , wellfinanced and sometimes extreme elites have captured the lawmaking process in many state capitals legislatures are vulnerable to \( and often populated by \) the most ardent believers in a cause , the ones who care enough to take the time , raise the money , turn out on election day and lobby relentlessly people who participate in state and local government tend not to be representative of the masses at all , abrams told me they tend to be highly engaged political elites 15 percent of the population who think they 're fighting this culture war they 'll see an opening they 'll see a judge , they 'll see a legislature that looks amenable to something , and they 'll try to push it through and build a groundswell around that this dynamic applies to both liberals and conservatives , by the way , although a variety of studies show republicans have pulled much further to the right than democrats have to the left to this mix of public indifference and activist opportunism , people who study our odd political folkways add several other contributing factors bill bishop of big sort fame pointed out to me that there are fewer divided state legislatures one house republican , one house democratic than at any time in decades state legislatures are increasingly partisan monocultures , given to herdlike behavior mixed company moderates , he said \( except when , as in today s washington , it paralyzes \) morris fiorina of stanford says that state legislatures change hands more often than they used to , so lawmakers believe that they may have one shot to accomplish their policy goals before they lose power they go for it michael dimock of pew research adds that the drastic downsizing of statehouse news coverage means state lawmakers operate with less accountability so in arkansas the amendment outlawing abortion at 12 weeks was not the product of a popular groundswell , but largely the triumph of a single , entrepreneurial tea party , who whisked the measure through a newly republican , mostly inexperienced legislature with virtually no debate as jay barth , a politics professor at hendrix college in arkansas , notes , thanks to strict term limits the legislature in little rock does n't develop strong leadership and discipline it is susceptible to populist charisma from right and left , but these days mostly right of course , it helps if those with an agenda have money behind them in colorado , liberals like billionaire peter lewis sensed an opportunity , 10 to 1 , and got an amendment to legalize marijuana sometimes , as in the growing momentum for gay marriage , states catch a changing national tide sometimes , as in arizona s reactionary antiimmigrant laws , states seem to be gasping the last gasp of a waning trend when we disapprove of the outcome in my case , those extremist antiabortion laws we call it opportunism or specialinterest politics when legislatures bypass public opinion and do something we admire in my case , gov martin o'malley s successful push to abolish the death penalty in maryland , where 60 percent of voters we call it leadership does all of this make for a healthy democracy \? if 80 percent of the electorate is sitting on the sidelines , that s a recipe for demagogy and cynicism but maybe what we 're seeing is states performing a useful role as laboratories of policy these experiments may produce smart ideas that deserve to be replicated at the national level the massachusetts health care law , for example , which inspired obamacare or the state labs may cook up poisons arizona s antiimmigrant statutes , or those new , restrictive abortion laws and you pray that congress or the courts will find an antidote
this wednesday is the fifth annual day of awareness in a national campaign to stop the use of the word retarded and its variants as a medical label for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities , the rword used to be neutral , clinical , incapable of giving offense but words are mere vessels for meaning , and this one has long since been put to other uses retarded and retard today are variations on a slur young people especially like it as a weapon of derision , it does the job it s sharp , with an assaultive potency that words like moron and idiot lost sometime in the days of blackandwhite tv the campaign against it , called spread the word to end the word , is heartfelt and earnest in a way that makes it vulnerable to ridicule i know people who care about language who do not see themselves as heartless and who do not see retardation as anything to get worked up about to them , banishing the rword for another clinicalsounding term is like linguistic febreze masking unpleasantries with cloying euphemisms in this , as in other cases of discrimination , it s probably best to let those affected speak for themselves here is john franklin stephens , a man from virginia with down syndrome who serves as a global messenger for the special olympics he has written oped articles giving lucid voice to thoughts you may never have heard before the hardest thing about having an intellectual disability is the loneliness , he once wrote in the denver post we are aware when all the rest of you stop and just look at us we are aware when you look at us and just say , unh huh , ' and then move on , talking to each other you mean no harm , but you have no idea how alone we feel even when we are with you so , what s wrong with retard' \? , he asked i can only tell you what it means to me and people like me when we hear it it means that the rest of you are excluding us from your group we are something that is not like you and something that none of you would ever want to be we are something outside the in' group we are someone that is not your kind last year , after the rightwing personality ann coulter sent a twitter message about mitt romney and president obama i highly approve of romney s decision to be kind and gentle to the retard mr stephens no one overcomes more than we do and still loves life so much , he said , with such persuasive graciousness as to put other writers to shame as mr stephens makes clear , people can be thoughtless and cruel , or wellmeaning , and never know the damage their words can do the campaign is about inclusion history is full of stories of people from outside who fought their way in to those with intellectual disabilities , it sometimes seems the battle is just at the beginning , when little victories like an end to insults are hugely important
a correspondent whom i respect has \( gently \) challenged me to say plainly what i think cyprus should do leaving aside all questions about political realism and he s right while i think it s ok to spend most of my time on this blog working within the limits of the politically possible , and relying on a combination of reason and ridicule to push out those limits over time , once in a while i should just flatly state what i would do if given a chance so here it is yes , cyprus should leave the euro now the reason is straightforward staying in the euro means an incredibly severe depression , which will last for many years while cyprus tries to build a new export sector leaving the euro , and letting the new currency fall sharply , would greatly accelerate that rebuilding if you look at cyprus s trade profile , you see just how much damage the country is about to sustain this is a highly open economy with just two major exports , banking services and tourism and one of them just disappeared this would lead to a severe slump on its own on top of that , the troika is demanding major new austerity , even though the country supposedly has rough primary \( noninterest \) budget balance i wouldn t be surprised to see a 20 percent fall in real gdp what s the path forward \? cyprus needs to have a tourist boom , plus a rapid growth of other exports my guess would be agriculture as a driver , although i don t know much about it the obvious way to get there is through a large devaluation yes , in the end this probably does come down to cheap deals that attract lots of british package tours getting to the same point by cutting nominal wages would take much longer and inflict much more human and economic damage but is it even possible to leave the euro \? the eichengreen point that even a hint of exit would cause panicked capital flight and bank runs is now moot the banks are closed , and capital is controlled so if i were dictator , i d just extend the bank holiday long enough to prepare for the new currency ok , what about the bank notes \? i m no kind of expert in such matters , but i ve heard suggestions to the effect that it might be possible to rush debit cards into circulation , so that business could resume without having to wait for someone to run the printing presses the government might also be able to issue temporary scrip , ious that don t look like proper bank notes , as a transitional measure yes , it all sounds kind of desperate and improvised but desperation is appropriate ! otherwise , we re talking about greeklevel austerity or worse in an economy whose fundamentals , thanks to the implosion of offshore banking , are much worse than greece s ever were my guess is that none of this will happen , at least not right away , that the country s leadership will fear the leap into the unknown that would come from euro exit despite the obvious horror of trying to stay in but as i said , i think euro exit is now the right thing to do
