in 1988 , when the nation s roman catholic bishops released the first draft of a pastoral letter on women s concerns , the document resounded with the voices of women and called for groundbreaking though limited changes in church practices last week , when the bishops received in the mail a fourth and almost certainly final draft , it was a very different document , one that echoed the voice of the pope and emphasized existing church teaching as the remedy for problems faced by women the shift is a major one , but the new version is no more likely to achieve a consensus than its predecessors when the bishops debate it at their november meeting , they will probably be looking for the least embarrassing way to set aside a project that they have been working on for nine years the fate of the pastoral letter on women s concerns is a prime exhibit of the bishops' difficulty in exercising leadership in an american church that is increasingly polarized between liberals and conservatives and that is scrutinized by a leery vatican 'we 've lost our energy' no one ever doubted the risks in the project an allmale hierarchy writing a letter on topics that often sharply divide women themselves none of the earlier drafts , released in 1988 , 1990 and last june , satisfied critics on either the left or the right but rather than broadening support through compromise , each succeeding version seemed to leave more people dispirited frankly , we 've lost our energy , bishop joseph l imesch of joliet , ill , chairman of the sixbishop drafting committee , said in a telephone interview on thursday the mood was different in 1985 and 1986 , when the committee , helped by female staff members and consultants , heard testimony from two dozen catholic organizations , mostly of women , and received reports from hearings and surveys conducted in 100 of 176 united states dioceses the process involved an estimated 75 , 000 women this dialogue shaped the structure of the original draft each chapter opened with a series of positive and negative observations by women at the hearings , and following these voices of affirmation and voices of alienation were the bishops' responses the papal influence but after the first draft , the crucial dialogue appears to have been conducted not between the drafters and women but between the drafters and the vatican six months after that initial draft came out , pope john paul ii issued his encyclical on women , mulieris dignitatem \( the dignity of women \) , reasserting the view that the equality of the sexes must be closely linked to a recognition of the complementary differences between men and women although the bishops incorporated many of the pope s themes into their second draft , they were still called to a vatican meeting in may 1990 that bishop imesch later described as a tough two days the vatican also sent the drafting committee two written critiques of its work neither has been released , even to the other bishops , and members of the committee have declined to describe their contents many bishops believe that these unseen documents were severely critical and have had a major impact on the final product here are some of the major shifts that have occurred over the course of the drafts sexism while each draft has affirmed the equality of men and women and condemned sexism as a moral and social evil , the latest draft drops the phrase sin of sexism conservatives had objected that the bishops were inventing a sin bishop imesch had replied , we did n't invent anything we just named what was already there all drafts have deplored violence directed at women , high rates of poverty among single mothers and elderly women , abusive or broken family relationships and discrimination in the workplace but the latest one adds that to identify sexism as the principal evil at work in these matters would be to analyze the underlying problem too superficially it then embarks on a critique of other approaches to women s issues , including the demand for absolutely identical treatment of men and womeny , the enlightenment tradition that maximizes individual freedom , the sexual revolution and the denunciation of patriarchy in a fashion that exalts women s traits while belittling men s the church s record the first two drafts called for a profound examination of conscience and acknowledged failures of theologians , priests and church officials to treat women as equals most of this language has been eliminated also dropped after the third draft was a proposal that seminary training emphasize the ability to work cooperatively with women and that an inability to do so count against ordination contraception the first draft strongly registered women s widespread unhappiness with , and noncompliance with , the church ban on contraception later drafts mute this note the first draft briefly stated the church teaching on contraception and then called for more dialogue on the topic , incorporating the experience of women later drafts expanded the statement of the church s prohibition , and in place of the request for more dialogue , they suggested that more female participation in programs on sexual morality would render the current teaching more convincing

washington , april 10 consumer prices posted their biggest increase in 17 months in march , climbing fivetenths of 1 percent , the labor department said today the sharp rise prompted much surprise at first , but little dismay on closer analysis the increase , about twice as much as most analysts had expected and largely attributed to higher energy and food costs , sent an initial tremor through the bond market , pushing rates higher but most of the loss was later recovered as analysts and traders found the rise marked by statistical quirks and temporary factors that in some cases have already been reversed it does n't seem to signal any sort of resurgence of inflation , asserted robert a brusca , chief economist for nikko securities he said that every economic recovery in the last 40 years had shown inflation declining during its first year and that he saw no reason why the pattern should be different this time an official s viewpoint a relatively benign view was also taken by patrick c jackman , a senior labor department economist in charge of studying prices and living conditions we are definitely still on track for an increase of less than 4 percent for the year , he said the hefty increase in retail prices followed by one day a reassuring report on inflation at the producer level that seemed to have encouraged the federal reserve to make another cut in an important shortterm interest rate the labor department said producer prices last month edged up just twotenths of a percent for the first three months of the year , the consumer price index has risen at an annual rate of 35 percent , slightly above the 31 percent rate posted for all of 1991 although some analysts , such as those at the new york investment firm of c j lawrence , cling to inflation projections as low as 2 percent this year , the average annual inflation expectation of the 52 economists responding to the blue chip survey was reported today as 31 percent , unchanged from a month ago for 1993 , they expect inflation to be 36 percent but there are also those who found in today s figures confirmation of their view that inflation pressures are rising , although none saw a return to even half the doubledigit inflation levels of a decade ago this group expects that economic recovery will prompt companies to seek higher prices rather than greater market share among them is kathryn l kobe , economist at joel popkin company , a washington firm headed by a former labor department price specialist while finding that the march increase was exaggerated by some strangeness in the seasonal factors , ms kobe said she still expected the consumer index to advance by at least 4 percent this year the latest report included data for five major metropolitan areas , three of which recorded price increases higher than the fivetenths of 1 percent for the country at large for new york , the rise was seventenths of 1 percent , paced by a 14 percent jump in residential rents and a 17 percent jump in owners' rentequivalency mr jackman said , however , it would be a leap to conclude from this that there has been a firming in the area s real estate market prices in philadelphia surged eighttenths of 1 percent , reflecting a big increase for clothing , while prices in the san francisco area rose sixtenths of 1 percent energy and food rise nationally , the department said , the speeding up of the inflation pace , from the threetenths of 1 percent posted in february , mainly reflected an upturn in the price of energy and a faster rise for food , almost entirely in fresh fruits and vegetables even when the erratic energy and food components were excluded , however , the advance was fivetenths of 1 percent , up from fourtenths of 1 percent in february and threetenths of 1 percent in january viewed yet another way , divided into indexes of goods and of services , the increase in each category was still fivetenths of 1 percent the fact that the overall consumer index includes services and imported goods while the producer index does not , was cited as one reason , besides seasonal and statistical aberrations , for the difference between the two gauges some analysts suggested that today s report , while not ruling out further action by the federal reserve to cut interest rates , made it highly unlikely the fed would make such a move soon as it was , some thought the fed might have embarrassed itself by making an unexpected rate cut on thursday and then seeing today s somewhat jarring data , even though the rate cut seemed to be largely a response to lagging m2 money growth a fed governor who is usually accessible declined to respond today to a request for comment the inflation figures showed food rising fivetenths of 1 percent , led by a 61 percent rise for fresh fruits and vegetables tomatoes soared 228 percent last month and have more than doubled since new year s day cereal and bakery products also rose , but the price of eggs dropped 99 percent housing rose fourtenths of 1 percent , double the earlyyear advances , with fuel oil prices falling less than usual for the month and electricity climbing ninetenths of 1 percent furniture and bedding jumped 19 percent cars , gas and air fares go up in transportation , where prices climbed seventenths of 1 percent after two straight monthly declines , the main factors were higher prices for gasoline , new cars and airline fares prices of used cars were unchanged after falling for three straight months clothing prices , for which the seasonal adjustment factors are particularly suspect in light of shifting industry practices , rose sixtenths of 1 percent but this was less than february s 15 percent jump the cost of medical care , moderating slightly , rose fivetenths of 1 percent to a level 78 percent above that of march 1991 elsewhere , entertainment rose fourtenths of 1 percent while such personal expenses as legal and financial services and funeral expenses advanced fivetenths of 1 percent to bring the firstquarter annual rate to 96 percent the index now stands at 1393 , meaning that a group of goods and services that cost 10 in the 19821984 period now costs 1393 an alternate gauge , the cpiw , covering urban wage earners and clerical workers , also rose fivetenths of 1 percent last month , the labor department reported graph consumer prices shows percent

united nations , aug 17 the united states influence over the workings of the special commission to disarm iraq is immense , diplomats here said today , and could at any time include unilateral military action by american forces in theory , they should go through the security council first , a western diplomat said of the american government , but in practice they probably do n't have to reports over the weekend said the united states and its allies planned to use a united nations inspection team to provoke a confrontation with baghdad that could lead to american military intervention and enhance president bush s image at the republican national convention reports to us officials united nations officials here vehemently denied that the united states had played any role in the selection of installations that the commission s teams would inspect or of the time when any particular inspection would be made the united states is a major supporter of the work of the special commission , a united nations official said we 've always acknowledged that the us supplies us with the most information , the most inspectors , the most equipment and the most money but none of that affects the independence of the inspection process a united nations official said ties between the commission and the united states were so close that inspection teams returning from iraq typically meet with american officials before reporting to the security council intelligence comes from various sources , the official said , adding , but once we have it , we analyze it , and we decide when and where to go gary milhollin , an arms control expert in washington who follows iran , said the us has never been able to control the special commission they have never been puppets the recent reports that the united states had virtually stagemanaged a special commission team had severely affected the commission s credibility , another united nations official said we had been very successful in maintaining our credibility with both sides , he said the suggestion that the us tells us what to do damages our credibility with the members of the security council , with iraq , with everyone ekeus s position rolf ekeus , chairman of the special commission , has threatened to resign on several occasions , a united nations official said , when he felt that security council members were paying insufficient attention to his findings or trying to limit the commission s independence he has insisted that the commission needs to be fully independent , but the official said mr ekeus had been particularly sensitive to the advice from american officials the special commission to find and destroy iraq s nuclear , chemical and biological weapons was created in april 1991 , as part of the ceasefire agreement in the persian gulf war since then , its inspection teams have regularly been threatened and harassed by the iraqi government after each threat , the united states has warned of possible military intervention , and iraq has backed down armed intervention is a nice legal argument , a diplomat said it could be argued that a breach of the ceasefire agreement , such as thwarting the work of the inspectors , automatically reconstitutes the coalition that won the war in which case , the us could probably send in its planes unilaterally others disagree mr milhollin , who works for the wisconsin project on nuclear proliferation , said the united states would almost certainly have to go through the security council to get approval to attack iraq but who is the security council \? he asked britain and france would almost certainly endorse the action immediately asked if american bellicosity had hampered the work of the inspection teams in iraq , a united nations official said just the opposite was true it has been very helpful indeed , he said it s comforting to the inspectors on the ground to know that we have such support and we know that iraq knows what the consequences will be if it continues to thwart our work
washington , april 16 on a day of little congressional good cheer , the most upbeat thought came from the house speaker , thomas s foley , who said the disclosure of 247 current and 56 former members who wrote dubious checks brings to a close this whole matter of the house bank in a formal way , perhaps but not politically indeed , the comment avoided political reality , just as much of mr foley s handling of the highly charged issue the washington democrat has avoided the very real threat to the reelections of those touched by the scandal since the bank s mismanagement was brought to his attention in late 1989 today , for instance , though republicans were about as likely to make the overdraft list as were democrats , their party s campaigners had a new television spot ready to hand out as soon as the list was released its theme was bouncing balls , bouncing checks and bounce the democrats this issue seems to have a resonance that extends far beyond its inherent facts mr foley repeated again and again that no taxpayers' money was involved he said those who wrote overdrafts were following a practice of long standing and he told a news conference that the press had made the situation worse by mistakenly calling the checks bounced or kited when in fact they were usually paid , whether there was money in the account or not missing from 'abusers' list but as a political reality , details like that pale before the 841 overdrafts in 39 months written by representative ronald v dellums of california , or the 697 by representative gerry sikorski of minnesota , or the 551 by representative louis stokes of ohio , the chairman of the house ethics committee , or the 547 by representative dennis m hertel of michigan , or the 515 by representative chalmers p wylie of ohio only mr wylie is a republican none of the five lawmakers were included on a list of the 22 abusers that was made public april 1 so those totals served as reminders that when the house ethics committee compiled the list last month , its standards were , to say the least , arbitrary and that comes right back to the political problem that underlies excitement over the bank , the idea that congress lives in a different world and speaks a different language from everybody else house speaker s hope mr foley s hope is that the democrats , with this issue closed , and a house administrative reform plan passed last week , can now begin concentrating fully on the public agenda when congress returns the week after next , he said , the house will be taking up unemployment compensation , energy , i hope the beginning of some health care legislation , and perhaps job legislation but even if the bank scandal recedes into the background , at least in washington , there are two crucial difficulties facing the democrats the first is themselves democrats can probably agree on unemployment legislation fairly quickly , and are happy to fight the bush administration s insistence that the time is not ripe for fundamental repairs of the system but the energy bill involves conflicting committee jurisdictions jobs legislation involves major budget problems and on health care , while democrats of all stripes consistently report that it deeply troubles their constituents , there is nothing approaching consensus on how to deal with it , and the leadership seems to have done little to press for agreement republicans' strategy so it is not clear that the democrats , on their own , can change the subject and they will not be on their own the second problem they face is the house republicans the republicans are not here to legislate , in the sense of working out differences and making compromises but when the democrats bring a bill to the vote , they will have alternatives , to make a point of contrast indeed , they will soon begin a series of news conferences to lay out the equivalent of a house republican platform for challengers to use when they tire of talking about the bank and then it is expected that the republicans will change the subject to the house post office , whose scandals developed without any republican role at all , and will try to make an issue of excessive congressional staffing by excessive , they mean democrats do not give republicans a sufficient share of committee jobs none of these republican approaches may be as politically damaging as the bank scandal but they will all offer distractions from the legislative agenda on which mr foley would rather be concentrating misperceptions of public in his news conference today , mr foley also seemed to hope that once the public better understood the details of the bank , the problem would lose political steam but a recent new york times cbs news poll suggests that is not a good enough prospect on which to bet , say , an election fortyseven percent of the public said , incorrectly , that taxpayers' money was used to make good the overdrafts only 25 percent knew that other members' deposits were used but those two groups did not differ greatly on approval of congress in general or of their own representative , or on several other questions about congress but there was some hope that education would matter in the long run a third of the group that thought taxpayers' money was used also said that writing overdrafts , by itself , would be enough to make them vote for someone other than their sitting representative that figure was cut in half for those who knew that other members' deposits covered the checks that is one truth most members will want to tell but republicans , even though 88 , or 33 percent of the current members , on the two lists are from their party \( compared with 39 percent of the house as a whole \) , will be pushing other themes along with the national republican congressional committee s bounce ads , they will offer messages like the one representative newt gingrich of georgia , their secondranking leader , offered today while apologizing for 22 overdrafts he made a point of saying he was still proud of pressing for disclosure of all the names of lawmakers , when democratic leaders had preferred a smaller number and he boasted that at least none of his overdrafts had gone for business investments or politics and considering the pain that so many of his constituents had felt only wednesday , perhaps he was just being kind when he neglected to put in his statement the fact that his biggest overdraft , for 9 , 463 , was written at this season in 1990 to the internal revenue service photo jerry l gallegos , right , deputy superintendent of the house press gallery , being surrounded by reporters yesterday as he handed out a list containing the names of 247 current and 56 former members of congress who reportedly overdrew their checking accounts at

the chief executive who gets pushed out may survive that distasteful facet of his dressing down without badly hurt feelings but standing by while the stock rallies on rumors that you 're on the way out \? now you 're talking humiliation general motors shares staged a spirited rally in advance of the oct 26 resignation of the chief executive , robert c stempel the stempel rally , which started when gm shares stood at 29125 on oct 19 , peaked at 3425 five trading days later gm shares settled back to 3075 at friday s close , as investors became increasingly nervous about the company s shaky business and threatened dividend unpopular ceo s have frequently sparked rallies in their companies' stocks when word hit that they had resigned similar are rallies on word that the ceo has died armand hammer , chairman of occidental petroleum , died on dec 10 , 1990 , when occidental shares closed at 2075 investors bid the stock up to close at 22625 the next day , reflecting their distaste for mr hammer s management and the death of william black , the ceo of chock full o' nuts , set off a 225point rally in march 1983 of course , none of the wall street professionals mentioned below would wish for the death of a leastfavorite executive but they were willing to share their thoughts on which ceo s would help their company s stock price by stepping down among them paul e lego of westinghouse is a prime candidate in the view of david dreman , a new york money manager who says mr lego s departure is certainly worth 10 percent to the stock , which closed at 12875 friday the company has had a continual pattern of underestimating difficulties , said mr dreman , who is most sour about results at westinghouse s financial subsidiary i think a change at the top would make people look at that one again no such luck for mr dreman if the westinghouse board is to be believed in a statement issued oct 28 , the board said it had full confidence in mr lego s ability to lead the corporation the itt corporation s shares could shoot up 20 percent if the chief executive , rand v araskog , were to depart , or so said brett berry , director of equity research at the money management firm bailard biehl kaiser inc in san mateo , calif mr berry is critical of mr araskog for his massive salary in 1991 , and disapproves of the diverse businesses under the itt roof an itt spokesman , james gallagher , said that mr araskog is managing the company for the long term , and that critics like mr berry are simply interested in a quick kill eastman kodak shares would pop 5 to 10 percent if the chief executive , kay r whitmore , were to leave , said charles biderman of market trim tabs , a santa rosa , calif , newsletter that specializes in shortselling ideas kodak has been constantly restructuring over the years , and has never gotten it right , mr biderman said less harsh on kodak was steve leuthold , chairman of the leuthold group , a research firm in minneapolis it s true it s not working at kodak , he said but it may be more a matter of being in a fairly mature business than terrible management , he said investors might look favorably on american express shares if the ceo , james d robinson 3d , were to leave , mr dreman said right or wrong , from investors' views , if robinson were n't there , the stock would probably move up , he said part of the problem is the fixing up of the travel related services division , once the crown jewel , mr dreman said perhaps even tougher to deal with is the bad publicity mr robinson has received his departure could mean a 5 to 10 percent rally , mr dreman said ibm was the suggestion of mr berry and mr biderman , both of whom think investors would gain if the chief executive , john f akers , were to leave mr berry was the more negative of the two on the chairman , suggesting the stock could rally 15 to 20 percent on mr akers s departure like general motors , ibm has not gone far enough in cutting the payroll , in mr berry s view if mr akers were to quit as part of a splitting up of the company , it would be real bullish , mr biderman said but if mr akers were to leave without such radical steps being taken , it would be a negative for the stock , he added william lefevre , market strategist at tucker anthony inc , pointed out that investors also vote their favorable impressions of certain managers , as they did last week on brandon tartikoff , who resigned as chairman of paramount pictures the stock lost 125 , to 42125 , between the announcement on thursday and the close friday mr lefevre added with a laugh that he had a chat with paramount s wall street handler in the early 1980 s , when charles bludhorn ran the company investors were unhappy with his reign , and i told the investor relations guy that there were some on wall street who felt the stock would go up three points if mr bludhorn were to step aside , mr lefevre recalled the investor relations man told mr lefevre he was dead wrong he said , 'around here , we think it s worth five , ' mr lefevre said it turns out they were both off shares of what was then called gulf western industries gained nearly 7 , to 24875 , in the week after mr bludhorn died in february 1983 table if the chief stepped down , shows how some stock experts think certain companies would see their stocks rally if they dumped their chief executive

washington , dec 10 with the choices he announced today , presidentelect bill clinton indicated that the main responsibility of the top economic policy officials in his administration would be not so much to develop new policy as to get his campaign promises enacted quickly senator lloyd bentsen and representative leon e panetta have mastered tax and budget policy like few others in public life the high regard with which they are held by their peers in congress should prove invaluable to mr clinton , who says he is determined to break the deadlock between the white house and capitol their intelligence and political skill aside , neither mr bentsen nor mr panetta has concentrated on developing views about preparing for the economy of the 21st century similarly , robert e rubin , the investment banker who is to be the chief economics coordinator in the white house , is said to be a smart and efficient manager , and is not known as someone who offers new ideas about the economy painful measures ahead mr clinton apparently felt he did not need philosophers right away but sought the special talent of two accomplished politicians and a highly successful wall street investor to win approval of the painful measures necessary to lower the budget deficit the presidentelect has already formulated a detailed plan involving higher taxes on the wealthy , a tax cut for the middle class , an investment tax credit for business and new spending on public works projects , and he has vowed to push this package through congress in his first 100 days in office that does not leave much room for further policy development for a while mr clinton almost said as much at his news conference today he said he had chosen mr bentsen to be treasury secretary because of the senator s stature , dignity and respect he said he had picked mr panetta to be budget director to win swift and effective implementation of our economic plan but if he succeeds at the outset , mr clinton presumably will then begin to chart a new course in the world economy , as he promised in his election campaign how , for example , can american industries compete better with those of europe and japan \? how should schools and jobtraining programs be improved \? what steps will be needed in the next decade to prepare for a time early in the next century when the country has a much higher ratio of retired people to workers than it does now \? mr clinton addressed such matters in broad brush during the campaign , but mr bentsen and mr panetta , perhaps because of their legislative responsibilities , have tended to look at economic issues more narrowly mr bentsen s foremost initiative in the last few years has been to advocate a tax break to encourage upperincome taxpayers to save money whatever the merits of the texan s proposal , no one thinks it would result in a fundamental change in the economy mr panetta is one of the few lawmakers who have consistently argued that most americans should pay higher taxes and relinquish government benefits to lower the federal budget deficit but the california congressman has rarely addressed the longer range question of what should be done once the deficit problem is licked in line for labor the economic philosopher among the clinton insiders is robert b reich , the head of the economics transition team mr reich \( it is pronounced reish \) was not included in the first round of announcements today , but clinton aides say he will be named secretary of labor mr reich , by virtue of being a close friend of mr clinton , will probably be an influential force in the new administration as mr clinton selects people for top jobs in other areas where his campaign promises were less explicit and action less urgent than on the economy , he will be looking more for people he considers capable of developing broad approaches to policy questions visionaries , some of his advisers say that will be especially important in foreign affairs , where mr clinton is on less familiar ground than he is with economic issues and where he will have the chance like no other president since harry s truman to establish policies reflecting a completely changed world boldness will also be needed in health care , where mr clinton has promised to revamp the current system so that costs are controlled and everyone can get affordable insurance turning to the familiar but today , the spotlight was not on foreign policy or the medical system but on the economic choices and on the particular views , talents and liabilities of the people mr clinton is putting into the top jobs george bush , whose own background is in business , relied for economic counsel largely on advisers with a business perspective like treasury secretary nicholas f brady , richard g darman , the budget director , and john h sununu , his first chief of staff similarly , mr bentsen , mr panetta and mr rubin are , like mr clinton , lawyers , although none have practiced law for years by picking mr bentsen and mr panetta for the top two economic jobs , and by naming mr rubin , alice m rivlin and roger c altman to other important positions , mr clinton turned to the center of the economic and political spectrum a shrinking center that could be important at a time when economists and politicians on the left and the right are arguing that the budget deficit is of secondary importance and when the number at the center willing to advocate the bitter medicine needed to lower the deficit seems to be shrinking the new lineup of advisers may dispel the notion held in some circles here and on wall street that mr clinton is not completely committed to reducing the deficit , a view that developed because the presidentelect has never said specifically what sacrifices he would ask americans to make but today s announcement will do little to reassure critics who hoped mr clinton would look beyond washington and wall street for his economic advice mr bentsen has such stature as his party s vicepresidential nominee in 1988 and as the chairman of the most important committee in the senate that he is almost certain to restore to the treasury the influence the department had when john b connally was treasury secretary in the nixon administration and when james a baker 3d held the post in ronald reagan s second term mr clinton made it clear at his news conference this afternoon that mr bentsen would be his chief lieutenant on economic matters in the bush administration , mr brady , whose political experience was limited , was generally overshadowed by mr darman and others
the escaped murderer who was captured on saturday told the police that he eluded a widespread search in rockland county , ny , by sleeping in the woods near the center of the police activity , dropping pepper to distract police dogs , using survivalist techniques and eating at fastfood restaurants on busy route 59 in spring valley officials said they were not sure they believed that account from frank vandever , who was captured on saturday but they now believe that mr vandever and ronald rutan , who escaped with mr vandever from a connecticut maximumsecurity prison on dec 31 , robbed four 7eleven convenience stores in bergen county , nj , during the 10 days they were staying at an econo lodge motel in spring valley mr vandever , a former stockbroker who killed a client who had discovered he was stealing money from his account , told the police the two were armed only with a toy gun despite mr vandever s success in frustrating searchers for two days after he vaulted over a fence and slipped away from fbi agents at the econo lodge on thursday , officials yesterday said that the fugitive literally provided a road map that led to his capture in a paramus , nj , shopping mall on saturday 'brilliant' , and suicidal' after a woman reported a car , a dodge omni , stolen from the parking lot of the econo lodge early saturday morning , the police found a map of neighboring bergen county in the parking lot , said paul kunar , a senior investigator for the new york state police a state police laboratory found a fingerprint from mr vandever on the map also in the parking lot , the police found a listing of 7eleven stores torn out of the bergen county telephone book , said kenneth gribetz , the rockland county district attorney next to the stores that had been robbed in recent weeks , the prosecutor said , the word done was written by midafternoon saturday , the police in rockland county had issued alerts to lawenforcement officials in bergen county at 5 30 pm , mr vandever was arrested in the parking lot of the garden state plaza shopping mall in paramus as he returned to the stolen car as brilliant as he was , it was almost suicidal that mr vandever left what amounted to a trail , said mr gribetz mr vandever was taken to the union county jail in the custody of federal marshals and is expected to be transferred back to connecticut the rockland county sheriff , james f kralik , said he was skeptical of mr vandever s assertion that he remained within a mile and a half of the econo lodge in spring valley lawenforcement officials have appeared sensitive to suggestions that mr vandever embarrassed them by the way he seemed to be close at hand and yet beyond their grasp yesterday , officials said that they did not have any evidence that mr vandever received help in staying free but they said they were still investigating and have interviewed acquaintances of mr vandever if you listen to what he s telling us , said investigator kunar of the state police , a lot of it , we ca n't believe we do n't believe that he stayed right around the motel officials said mr vandever said he stuffed his clothing with crinkledup newspaper to provide insulation in the subfreezing temperatures as he had been taught in a survivalist course he once took and in military training he said he melted snow for water mr gribetz said mr vandever said he had emerged from the woods to buy food at fastfood restaurants on route 59 , near the command post senior federal and local authorities had set up at the days inn motel according to mr gribetz , mr vandever told officers he thought he was recognized a few times but simply left the restaurants in the woods , mr vandever told officials , he repeatedly saw search teams and helicopters overhead , but kept out of sight sightings' now doubted lawenforcement officials said their doubts about mr vandever s account exist partly because of the wide public attention to the search at 3 pm friday , a spring valley taxi driver described picking up a man who the police said then they felt 90 percent certain was the fugitive later that day , some lawenforcement officials said they wondered whether a bank robber in nearby nyack was the missing escapee the male bank robber was wearing heavy professional makeup , and mr vandever is a transvestite just before mr vandever was captured in paramus , clerks in the 7eleven store in bergenfield , nj , reported a man fitting the description sheriff kralik said officials now believe none of those incidents , or hundreds of others , involved the real mr vandever even at the end of the trail that began when the two convicted felons cut their way through a set of bars and two electronic fences on dec 31 , mr vandever appeared able to summon a story about 4 30 saturday afternoon , a paramus police officer , kenneth ehrenberg , spotted the stolen car in the vast shopping mall parking lot then , he and two paramus detectives sat in an unmarked car about 10 spaces away and waited when mr vandever returned to the car about 5 30 , the officers said , they approached it with their guns drawn detective jerry may said mr vandever seemed somewhat surprised but quickly , detective joseph ackerman said , he was talking he tried to give us a story that this was his vehicle and that he was being unjustly stopped the officer s response , he said , was , you are under arrest photo frank vandever , who escaped from a connecticut maximumsecurity prison on dec 31 , was captured on saturday in a mall in paramus , nj \( associated press \) map

to the editor in his review of my book marlene dietrich \( oct 4 \) , wilfrid sheed mangles his opening sentence by misquoting a line about tallulah bankhead the correct version , as your letter writers pointed out last week , is a day away from tallulah is like a month in the country turning a wellknown witticism upside down does n't bode well for what follows , and , sure enough , mr sheed cites william goldman a few paragraphs later , making mr goldman s impression of marlene i did n't know people like that existed and when she looked at me , what i saw i swear was 'listen , relax i only got this way for you' sound like something quite different in mr sheed s words dietrich somehow transferred her extraordinary gift for personal friendship to vast herds of people at a time making each of them feel , as the screenwriter and novelist william goldman reports , as if he or she had spent the whole evening alone with her unfortunately , there are more serious errors in the review mr sheed does n't notice that the father he kills off in world war i had already died in 1907 , and that the soldier he talks about was a stepfather this is a fairly important biographical point \( not known in detail until this book \) it seems to me too careless to let pass , especially in view of what mr sheed calls my takenoprisoners research , which results in no more than a lick of revisionism that s a value judgment about the book that does n't inhibit mr sheed from appropriating that research as if it were either common knowledge \( which it is not \) or the product of his own insights the book reveals films and theatrical productions never known before family circumstances , relationships and influences never known before \( which mr sheed expounds upon as if the information were his own \) numerous incidents in weimar and berlin \( complete with quotations from former classmates i located in old people s homes all over western europe \) whether the new biographical material in the book is pleasing or not , entertaining or informative or not , it does n't deserve dismissal or appropriation without at least a hint of credit dietrich s sister s nazi activities \( never known or suspected before collaborationist is quite the wrong word here \) get tossed off as common knowledge marlene s having spent most of world war i not in berlin at all but in provincial dessau is simply ignored likewise her never having graduated from high school and her first employment as an orchestra pit violinist taste is taste and judgment is judgment and if this information seems boring or unimportant , so be it but it seems unfair to the author , as well as to any reader who might hope to learn from mr sheed s review what is new in a book that is generous with previously unknown incidents , relationships and facts mr sheed writes , she wrote to the poet rilke no , she did n't , and i do n't write that she did it s damaging because mr sheed suggests that it shows how i fail to explore incidents properly it s hard to explore things that are misread into the book i write on page 53 marlene stood in for friends like anni mewes while mewes pursued her rollicking social life or possibly wrote thoughtful letters to rilke who wrote back guaranteeing marlene s awe mr sheed treats my reference to alma mahler harshly , though her meeting with marlene has never been reported except in the obscure bauhaus memoir from which i unearthed it the point of the incident is not the author s neardesperation to say something significant it reveals marlene s nearfaultless instinct \( from childhood on \) for people who were in the spotlight , her precocious ability at role playing and her search for a role model more congenial to her than her mother alma mahler is repeatedly referred to in subsequent pages in precisely this context mr sheed writes that the blue angel was her second talkie no , it was n't , and this is an embarrassingly basic error it was the first film in which dietrich s voice was heard , a point i make repeatedly and which mr sheed appropriates as his own with , it seems fair to say that all she was really waiting for was the coming of sound well , yes i thought it fair to say so when i said it i wrote a whole paragraph about it , in fact what i find particularly disturbing is mr sheed s reduction of dietrich s war work to a kind of lastgasp vaudeville she leaped at opportunistically alongside al jolson , george jessel , bob hope and others , none of whom \( as far as i know \) were german with family in germany , surely a vital biographical distinction in this same context , i am also bothered by the trivializing reference to marlene s fighting for paris with hemingway , as if neither actress nor writer had political or human convictions i guess mr sheed is entitled to this kind of judgment , but it argues curiously for any affinity with the subject he s reviewing steven bach munich , germany
when representative steven j solarz announced last month that he would run in new york city s new 12th congressional district , one drawn specifically to maximize hispanic voting strength , hispanic candidates and their supporters groaned in frustration well connected and flush with cash , mr solarz immediately became the man to beat but as the sept 15 primary nears , it is not so much mr solarz s fame and fortune that have helped his cause as the turmoil his candidacy has created among hispanic candidates seeking the democratic nomination this has served to expose both the strengths and weaknesses of the premise that minority communities , especially newly empowered ones , can or should elect one of their own refusing calls to unify ambitious and driven , the four major hispanic candidates are refusing calls to unify to keep from splintering the hispanic vote in the spindly district that snakes through brooklyn , queens and lower manhattan instead they are campaigning at subway stops and centers for the elderly in their communities , searching for endorsements and campaign contributions , each determined to be the contender against mr solarz , who is white and jewish at one appearance , at a hispanic youth group s talent show in the sunset park neighborhood of brooklyn , ruben franco , one of the hispanic candidates , said , i will work very hard to bring federal dollars to this community for programs like this denise gomezosorio , who attended the show , shook her head with concern you always have four or five hispanics who run against each other and then we lose , she said all of the candidates are good , but this community has got to sit down and decide that what is happening is that we are dividing ourselves so much that we get shortchanged luis garden acosta , director of el puente , a hispanic organization in brooklyn , agreed it s almost an impossible situation , he said none of the four candidates are likely to quit , he said , saying , they have put into motion people , organizations , resources on behalf of themselves and their candidacies all are puerto rican besides mr franco , the former president and general counsel of the puerto rican legal defense and education fund , the other major hispanic candidates in the 12th district are elizabeth colon , the former executive director of the association of puerto rican executive directors nydia m velazquez , the former secretary of puerto rico s department of puerto rican community affairs in the united states and a former city council member , and rafael mendez , an assistant professor of psychology and an organizer for the new alliance party all are puerto rican a chinese candidate , alfred s lui , a social worker , is also on the primary ballot about 55 percent of the district s votingage population is hispanic , 21 percent asian , 16 percent white and 8 percent black of the registered democrats , 49 percent are hispanic that the field of hispanic candidates has splintered is not surprising historically , districts in new york and elsewhere that are drawn to maximize minority voting strength often churn through one or more election cycles before members of that group organize well enough to secure a victory the purpose of the new district is to empower hispanics , but if they are empowered by electing a powerful congressman rather than a freshman , then it worked , said norman adler , a brooklynbased democratic political consultant even then , the voters may elect a person of a different race or background city councilwoman susan d alter , who is white and jewish , has won for years in a brooklyn district drawn with minorities in mind last year , she defeated seven blacks this year , she is challenging representative edolphus towns , who is black , in the democratic primary empower , not employ for his part , mr solarz , who saw his current district dismembered by reapportionment , argues that the federal voting rights act was intended to empower hispanic people , not employ them but the frustrated hispanic candidates , as well as mayor david n dinkins , city council president andrew j stein and several hispanic community leaders , have called for mr solarz to step aside so the other candidates can move out of his shadow he has refused to do so financially , there is no question where the advantage lies with more than 2 million in his campaign fund , mr solarz is operating out of five offices and has eight fulltime staff members and hundreds of volunteers on monday radio and television ads featuring mr solarz are expected to appear on spanish and englishlanguage stations , including one in which mr solarz speaks in spanish he does n't sound like cervantes , but he s not that bad , says rudy garcia , mr solarz s campaign spokesman and language coach who is on leave from his job as metropolitan editor for noticias del mundo most of the other campaigns have half the number of staff members mr solarz and one or two offices , if that they have less money the mendez spokeswoman says he has less than 5 , 000 the others give estimates between 20 , 000 and 250 , 000 that has left the hispanic candidates sniping at each other , whipping up conspiracy theories as to why their former colleagues are running and scrambling for endorsements two weeks ago , ms colon , whose base is the lower east side , stood on the steps of city hall to receive the backing of bronx borough president fernando ferrer , the city s top elected hispanic official , and mr stein meanwhile , other hispanic candidates held an ultimately unsuccessful meeting in williamsburg to consider deciding who should run dinkins supports velazquez ms velazquez has the support of mayor dinkins dennis rivera and barry feinstein , union leaders representative towns and representative jose e serrano of the bronx , and the governor of puerto rico , rafael hernandez colon in a recent poll of registered democrats conducted for her campaign , ms velazquez had the highest recognition factor of the hispanic candidates , though mr solarz was still better known the survey of 600 voters was conducted from july 20 to 24 by johnson survey research mr franco has garnered relatively few endorsements , though he has the backing of former united states attorney rudolph w giuliani , a likely republican mayoral candidate next year , and the liberal party i 've been a fighter for justice , and i'm known as the people s lawyer , said mr franco after his sunset park appearance the others , they call a news conference to announce the support of elected officials , none of whom have any major influence in the district also , i am not running a nationalistic campaign , unlike the other candidates , he said mr mendez is considered the underdog mr garden acosta , a community organizer who has been meeting with hispanic clergy and community leaders , says that if the candidates cannot pick among themselves , he may try to rally voters to do it for them i think in their heart of hearts they understand that the chances of latinos representing this district is doomed for the next few years if they do n't coalesce behind one candidate , he said but i think they are finding it difficult to agree on a process photos ruben franco , one of four hispanic candidates who are primary opponents of representative steven j solarz in the newly formed 12th congressional district the district includes parts of brooklyn , queens and manhattan mr franco campaigned at public school 94 in brooklyn \( steve hart for the new york times \)

newark , march 3 with a procession of speakers from a mayor to a cystic fibrosis patient , the appropriations committees of the republicancontrolled legislature today convened the first of several public hearings on gov jim florio s proposed 157 billion budget the committee chairmen senator robert littell and assemblyman rodney p frelinghuysen said they hoped the hearings would help them identify areas where the budget could be cut but during the fivehour session today at the university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey , most of the speakers appealed for more money or for the salvation of programs the governor has proposed dropping we anticipated that a good proportion of the speakers were going to be appealing for more money , mr frelinghuysen said it does n't make the task of finding budget cuts any easier traditionally , the committees have heard first from administration officials and afterward held public hearings but the republicans , who took control of both chambers of the legislature on jan 14 , reversed the process this year , saying that the voice of the people would guide the committees during the budget process mr littell said the republicans decided to listen to the public before everything is cut and dried and opportunity for change is slim or none other hearings planned the hearing today was the first of at least four the republicans have planned they have scheduled one session for march 18 at glassboro state college in the southern part of the state , and mr frelinghuysen said there would be at least two more in trenton since mr florio delivered his budget message on jan 21 , his democratic colleagues have campaigned vigorously to win public support they have used news conferences , speeches and legislative debate to try to hammer home the idea that a republican plan to cut the budget could threaten the homeowners' rebate program and might result in less aid to public schools republicans have said they intend to eliminate waste and inefficiency in state government , for which they blame mr florio and the democrats i do n't think the governor s budget message reflects what the people are saying , mr frelinghuysen said today traditionally , most money goes into supporting large , antiquated state institutions i would support a lot of those dollars following the people into the community immediate goal some republicans have said they hope to cut at least 1 billion from mr florio s budget but mr frelinghuysen said the immediate goal would be to pare the 600 million needed to offset a rollback of the sales tax to 6 percent from 7 percent , a move that would fulfill one of the republicans' major campaign promises despite warnings from the republicans , mr florio based his budget on a 7 percent sales tax the state senate president , donald t difrancesco , and the assembly speaker , garabed \( chuck \) haytaian , have said they will not schedule the governor s budget for debate with the higher sales tax rate new jersey s fiscal year begins on july 1 , and the state constitution requires that the governor sign a balanced budget by that date an unfair burden administration aides sat in the audience today , taking notes as speakers representing veterans' organizations , labor unions , the arts , consumer groups , educators , environmentalists and programs for the disabled filed before the committees to give 10minute pleas my administration is looking at a barebones budget , said mayor sharpe james of newark , one of the first speakers we cannot cut back any more we have downsized municipal government with acrosstheboard layoffs in every area but police and fire outside the hearing room , mr james complained that newark , the state s largest city , has always suffered unfairly when legislators cut budgets they always get the impression that they are helping newark , but they are helping new jersey , said mr james , citing the location of a major airport , seaport and train terminal in his city newark is to new jersey what atlanta is to georgia carl lind , a 33yearold cystic fibrosis patient from beachwood , went before the committees to seek the restoration of funds for the new jersey state organization of cystic fibrosis the twoyearold program provides prescription drugs , medical equipment and food for special diets to 104 people who suffer from the disease , mr lind said
they buried robert walther yesterday , watched his plain gray coffin into the new jersey ground , a handful of mourners saying goodbye to a man hardly any of them even knew mr walther died a most horrific and dehumanizing death , set on fire , like a heap of trash , by a group of teenagers as he slept on a subway train in the bronx he lived apart and died alone , and perhaps it was fitting that he was buried without the company of anyone who knew the kind of man he had been instead , he was surrounded by advocates for the homeless and religious people trying to give dignity to an unknown soldier of the urban wars , who may have died for what he represented i wish i could do justice to robert today , and charm you with stories about the kind of man he was , said mary brosnahan , executive director of the coalition for the homeless but i never met robert i ca n't tell what he liked or did n't like i'm sure , though , that he had many of the same kinds of dream that you and i have , to have a home and a family no suspects in burning his dreams did n't include having to sleep on the subway and i'm sure he never expected to go this way , she said , as she stood at the rosemont cemetery in elizabeth , where he was buried sgt luis medina , a spokesman for the transit police , said that investigators are questioning several people in connection with the burning , but that so far they have no suspects since jan 26 , groups of young men , ranging in ages from midteens to mid20s , have set fire to seven homeless men sleeping in subway cars the incidents have occurred throughout the city , in different lines and different boroughs but only this one ended in a fatality most people visited by this kind of tragedy do n't see their assailants , sergeant medina said they wake up to flames if they can describe anybody at all after the crime , it is the people who came to help them the police have put up posters at many subway stations asking for information in tracking down mr walther s attackers , sergeant medina said the coalition for the homeless is offering a 5 , 000 reward for information leading to an arrest advocates for the homeless say many homeless people prefer to take their chances on the train rather than go to the gigantic and sometimes formidable cityrun shelters mr walther , who was 39 years old , was riding in the third car from the rear of a no 2 train when he was set on fire on march 26 , the police said as the train pulled into the freeman street station , witnesses saw four teenagers running from the car where he was burning a passenger on the train ran to get a fire extinguisher from the token booth area , and put out the flames engulfing mr walthers ms brosnahan said the coalition had picked up the 2 , 000 cost of burying mr walther , because she did not want him to have a pauper s burial transit police say none of mr walther s relatives have come forth yesterday , about 20 people , almost none of whom had known mr walther , attended the funeral service at st crispin s friary in the melrose section of the south bronx the rev stan fortuna , a franciscan priest whose community runs a shelter for homeless men , talked about the fragility of life for those who roam the city s streets the lesson is that we need to respect and revere the sacredness of a human life , he said after filling the air with the sweet odor of incense , father fortuna sat behind a keyboard and sang a song he had written called cry for shelter what if you saw one of your own walking the street without a home \? he said how would you feel \? what would you do \? look at the face that someone is you outside the church , leroy washington , who is himself homeless , and ray adams , who works with part of the solution , another homeless advocacy group , said they knew mr walther , but not very well this sort of thing does n't happen too often , but when it does , it s a tragedy , mr washington said he was a friend i had to come and there were tears shed for him i came here to affirm the fact that his life had just as much value as some who could crowd the church with his family and friends , said ted houghton , who also works with the coalition for the homeless just because he was homeless , sleeping on the subway , does n't mean his life did n't have value we forget that quite easily that s what this city does to you then , some of those who had come to see off mr walthers climbed into their cars , and made a tiny caravan to new jersey , to bury a homeless man photo members of the coalition for the homeless and monks from st crispin s friary were the only mourners yesterday at the funeral in newark of robert walther he was a homeless man who was set on fire and killed by a group of teenagers as he slept on a subway train in the bronx \( edward keating the new york times \)
the bad news for the mets is that the team has just completed another lost homestand even worse news is that the mets are about to embark on another road trip , journeys that have proved even more fruitless for a team well under 500 when it is away from home the good news \? well , there is n't any these days for the rudderless mets as they head off to atlanta , heads bowed in frustration as the losses , and the odds for salvaging 1992 , continue to mount the mets , now 3843 , found themselves being booed , hooted and taunted yesterday in the increasingly unfriendly confines of shea stadium , as they went meekly to a 20 , 10inning defeat at the hands of the houston astros it was a game in which the weakest batting order in the major leagues broke the heart of yet another stranded starting pitcher sorry , schourek wasted was the threehit , eightinning performance of pete schourek wasted was another opportunity to show the hometown that what preceded july was but a bad dream and that the real mets are now awakening the bottom line is that the mets do n't score and therefore can be beaten with one swing it happened yesterday , the only telling blow of the game coming off the bat of eric anthony the astros' right fielder , batting with none out and one on in the 10th , jerked a 20 pitch by jeff innis over the rightfield wall by hitting innis s one badly placed pitch , anthony helped reinforce a new mets truism that the team s pitchers had better be perfect if they expect to at least stay even the muchused innis was n't perfect , did n't stay even and the mets certainly did n't win houston , not surprisingly , was able to make the tworun lead hold up , thanks to a scoreless 10th turned in by doug jones , who earned his 19th save with that done , quietly and quickly in 123 fashion , the bulk of the perpetrators in the mets' loss could do little more than look apologetically at the snakebitten schourek and pathetically for answers that long ago stopped coming the loss , the second in three games against the astros in a weekend series , raised the mets' shutout total to 10 on the season , one more than in all of 1991 the mets have scored three or fewer runs in a little over half of their games 42 of 81 since may 24 , the team has scored three or fewer runs in 23 of 36 games the mets , whose team average of 233 is the worst in the majors , have now scored just one run in their last two games , the sort of pace they have been keeping for much of the season manager jeff torborg was asked if he could remember a team having so many bigname players with reputations and track records but with so little to show never quite like this , he said grimly i do n't remember being in this prolonged a slump on any team i 've been on no one could deny that pete harnisch , the astros' righthander , had a little something to do with prolonging that slump harnisch , pitching seven innings , limited the mets to three hits , and only one after the third inning his handling of the only serious threat he faced seemed to deflate the mets even before the crowd of 25 , 900 had settled into the shea stadium seats what passed for a mets rally came in the second inning dave magadan led off with a single and moved tantalizingly close to home on an eddie murray double to the wall in rightcenter but harnisch induced dave gallagher the centerfield standin for howard johnson to hit a humpback liner to second todd hundley , the stillstruggling catcher , then hit a fly ball not deep enough to left , thus failing to bring magadan home on a sacrifice fly the mets fans , now booing lustily , were indicating by voice vote that they 'd seen this before indeed , they had , as the inning completely fizzled after dick schofield was intentionally walked , harnisch wriggled free by striking out schourek to end the agony nothing of note , other than an oldfashioned pitching duel and the wasting of not one , but two excellent individual efforts , took place for the remainder of the regulation nine innings i spoiled his outing , he spoiled mine , a game schourek said it s frustrating , not only personally , but as a team , he added in a gallant , and generous statement , considering his mates have stranded him with a 13 record in spite of his 211 earned run average inside pitch bobby bonilla left the game after three atbats because of a sprained left wrist bonilla injured the wrist in the first game of a doubleheader saturday when he fell on a catcher s mask after a collision with the astros' catcher , scooter tucker it s throbbing a little bit no big deal , bonilla said he said he hopes to play tonight in atlanta the doctor said everything should be all right , he added willie randolph , out because of fluid on his right knee , said he also hopes to play monday night photo bobby bonilla of the mets throwing his helmet in disgust after he was caught trying to steal second base in the sixth inning against the astros \( vic delucia the new york times \)
franklin park , nj , may 28 cole kleitsch rummaged through his files he was at his desk in the back room of his lightflooded hallmark card shop in a strip shopping mall here he had a file for his bank papers , a file for his taxes and , the one he was hunting for , a file for ross perot the chatty , 30yearold mr kleitsch said he had never been a political agitator i never before saw a political candidate whom i would lift a finger for , he said but two months ago , he volunteered to work as one of the foot soldiers in the new jersey campaign to elect mr perot president now there is no slipping out of the hallmark shop with a birthday or getwell card without also getting an earful about ross perot along the humming highway that runs beside mr kleitsch s shop , he has pasted a poster championing mr perot a perot sticker and two clipboards greet patrons at the checkout counter one clipboard holds petitions to get mr perot on the november ballot in new jersey the other is for people wishing to do campaign work for mr perot there are people , myself included , who feel their needs are not being met by the political parties , mr kleitsch said we 're being offered coke and pepsi again what we want is sevenup he said that it might seem improbable for mr perot to be elected , but added , even a tidal wave looks small when you see it on the horizon before it hits the beach the perot volunteers will have no direct roll in the new jersey primary on tuesday , since their candidate is not on the ballot and their efforts are directed toward november new jersey counts writeins in primary elections , but the perot organizers are discouraging a writein campaign because mr perot has said he wants to avoid disrupting the primary process a drive down the highways and backroads of new jersey shows mr perot s supporters nearly everywhere they live in teaneck and hopewell , in summit and newark , in fort lee and clifton they are a broad crosssection , none entirely sure what their man stands for , but all united in fervently wanting him to lead the country about 9 , 000 perot volunteers are scattered around the state newcomers sign on daily the majority seem to be novices at the tortuous regimen of political campaigning , but disillusionment with the majorparty candidates and the quirky magnetism of mr perot have conspired to kindle an enthusiasm most of the people have never worked as part of any party , except maybe a rescue party , mr kleitsch said volunteers have defected from the camps of the republicans and the democrats many are resolute independents even some of the apolitical have been roused one woman in her mid30 s said she had recently registered to vote for the first time so she could cast her ballot for mr perot tom o'neil , a 54yearold business consultant from lawrence township , is the state s perot coordinator after watching mr perot on television , he said he called dallas , asked what he could do and was told to organize new jersey for the time being , his living room is the state perot headquarters he asked his friend , pat o'neil , an unemployed 43yearold businessman from princeton who is unrelated , to be deputy coordinator pat o'neil said he had agreed after spending a few days reassuring himself that tom o'neil had not lost his mind trying in every district at organizational meetings , the volunteers were split into three regions northeast , central and south each of the state s 21 counties has been assigned a coordinator , as have about threefourths of the 547 municipalities the objective now is to appoint a perot coordinator and team of 3 to 10 members in each of the state s more than 6 , 000 election districts only 800 signatures are needed to put mr perot on the state s november ballot , and supporters filed petitions on may 13 that they said included nearly 3 , 000 names but they are continuing to solicit more signatures to demonstrate the support that exists they think 100 , 000 is a nice number the fact that perot volunteers do not yet know precisely what their candidate stands for does not seem to bother them overly at this point , i do n't care what they bring out about him i'm voting for him , said peg meyers , a 65yearold volunteer in kendall park when i first heard him , he did n't say what he was for but what he said was enough for me her husband , day , also 65 , chimed in , my feeling is the american people do n't know what s going on down in washington i'm not a smart man in fact , i did n't go further than the sixth grade , because i had to go work in the mines but i know things are a mess i think perot s going to win big 'a lot of havoc' rita kusler , a 39yearold unemployed accountant who lives in plainsboro , likes him beause she thinks he will create a lot of havoc she describes herself as a liberal democrat who always voted for the democratic nominee , except in 1976 , when she wrote in morris udall when marie tuskey heard the name early this year , she at first thought people were talking about hercule poirot , the agatha christie sleuth now she is ready to do anything to get ross perot elected the way he was brought up is the way i was brought up , said mrs tuskey , who is 66 and lives in kendall park close family ties always a father and mother i have six children and we 're all close he said his children got the same medical care his workers got , and i liked that she said her children have been enlisted to back perot , too but her 9yearold grandson , jonathan , whom she was babysitting , said he was in the bush camp mrs tuskey did not feel she had to sway him ah , she said , he ca n't vote anyway photo cole kleitsch , a businessman in franklin park , nj , said it might seem improbable for ross perot to be elected , but added , even

moscow , sept 10 after voluntarily pulling out of afghanistan and eastern europe and watching their huge empire crumble , the russians suddenly drew the line at four obscure islands off japan alienating , in the process , a major potential donor that , at least , was the impression on wednesday , when president boris n yeltsin abruptly postponed his trip to japan after a wave of public discontent made it virtually impossible for him to grant tokyo even a tentative pledge of eventual sovereignty over a group of islands in the kurile chain that the soviet union captured in the closing days of world war ii now most commentators agree that in the absence of any potential gain , and with nationalist passions ablaze over the islands both in russia and japan , mr yeltsin was probably right to cut his losses diplomatic psychoanalysis but the broader and more troubling question was why russia and japan two countries with every incentive to mend relations could allow a minor territorial dispute grow to such damaging proportions in both countries , the triumph of nationalist sentiments over rational foreign policy suggested immaturity and insecurity in moscow , the question was what this demonstration of the public mood augured for mr yeltsin as he faced far more consequential and contentious political contests by any objective standard , the kuriles carry nowhere near the strategic or economic significance of afghanistan or east germany , not to mention ukraine or belarus yet none of the other territories roused the sort of public passion that the islands have so fervent was the campaign mounted by the national patriotic right that it carried on even after mr yeltsin canceled the trip a protest march against yielding the islands wound through moscow today , and pravda carried a large photograph of russian soldiers on the kuriles under the headline , we 'll hold the kuriles we will defend russia not crimea or estonia by all criteria , this loss would be almost unnoticeable , wrote otto latsis , a foreignaffairs commentator for izvestia who once lived and worked on the kuriles it would be immeasurable smaller than all that has already been lost but it s more than that things so happened that our capacity to assess the situation soundly and to resolve problems confidently ran dry precisely at this stage thus , the kuriles have become a symbolic focus of public frustration for many months now a public backlash had been building against all the bewildering and rapid changes in the land , both economic and political it was evident in greater resistance to economic changes , in the claims to crimea , in a new resentment of the west , in the consolidation of conservative opposition groups ranging from diehard communists and nationalists to managers of stateowned industries and military men in the end , it was the very obscurity and simplicity of the kurile issue that gave it such force nobody could seriously argue that russia could or should reimpose control over , say , east germany or estonia , and on the domestic front the complexity of the economic disarray precluded simplistic slogans or demands simplicity is a virtue but the kurile issue was easy to understand these were territories russia had won fair and square , and japan was being arrogant in its demands , especially in threatening to withhold aid unless the islands were returned mr yeltsin s retreat before such feelings was hailed by the right wing the decision by the president seems natural and logical and , i think , will raise his authority in the eyes of the public , wrote vladimir kuznechevsky in the conservative rossiiskaya gazeta but the decision also carried ominous overtones the immediate prospects for russianjapanese relations were not the more worrying most experts agree that japanese investments in russia are likely to continue being determined more by prospects of profit than by national honor , and western industrial powers are likely to continue putting pressure on tokyo to increase its aid for the longer term , however , the dispute seems likely to put off for some time a real peace treaty between russia and japan girding for battles to come at home , the postponement of the visit , however expedient , was ultimately a victory for the right , which showed that it could win mr yeltsin over on what has become a major issue \( from all indications , the foreign ministry under andrei v kozyrev had plugged for the visit all along , and had prepared various compromise proposals on the islands \) mr yeltsin postponed his visit in part to avoid a debilitating political clash on the eve of major battles over his cabinet and his economic program , which are expected when parliament convenes next month but in avoiding a bout over japan , some commentators thought he may only have emboldened his opponents for the next round the cancellation of the visit on short notice , a highly unusual move in diplomacy , was also likely to cast a shadow over russia s foreign policy , making it seem amateurish and untrustworthy , and hostage to political blackmail it will be difficult to convince the japanese that this was not premeditated , that russia did not intend to wound them this way , mr latsis wrote but anyone who knows the state of affairs in russia has no doubt that this was not premeditated and that this is a manifestation of weakness , not strength photo a demonstration of up to 500 russians wound through moscow yesterday , protesting the possible repatriation of four islands in the kurile chain that the soviet union had captured from japan at the end of world war ii on wednesday , president boris n yeltsin canceled his planned trip to japan \( associated press \)
to the editor contrary to us shipyards cost too much \( letter , oct 7 \) by a chevron shipping company representative , united states shipbuilders are not pacing the halls of congress seeking protectionist legislation rather , we have been seeking free trade in the construction and repair of ships by getting foreign governments out of the business of subsidizing and dumping commercial ships on the world market subsidized trade is not free trade unfortunately , instead of welcoming the efforts of the united states shipbuilding industry to free the marketplace from government distortion , chevron and others fear the loss of the benefits they get from foreign subsidies , while american industry and american jobs suffer they oppose our efforts because they want foreign governments to continue subsidizing the capital costs of shipping the letter writer refers to an international trade commission report that said if antisubsidy legislation were passed , it would lead to an increase in ship prices and shipping costs this , in turn , would cause imports to decrease , but domestic production and exports to increase the international trade commission expressed this as if it would be an undesirable outcome most americans , i think , would welcome increased domestic production and increased exports to stimulate our country s economy and put americans back to work incidentally , there were many flaws in that report for example , its conclusions about the competitiveness of american shipbuilders were based solely on figures the commission said were bid data for ship construction contracts it was subsequently proved that none of the figures were ship construction bid data chevron and its supporters are protecting their access to foreign subsidies when they seek to deny our industry access to the world market with 80 , 000 workers facing layoffs as defense cuts mount , maybe chevron and its supporters should be encouraging united states shipyards to enter the global marketplace as a way of retaining america s capacity to build ships john j stocker president shipbuilders council of america arlington , va , oct 16 , 1992
the question is , what to call these hard times what has been happening to america since 1989 seems momentous enough to enter history as a major economic event of the 20th century but none of the words and phrases that described hardship in the past seem adequate today and the nation awaits a name , a label that will evoke the nature of these times the name problem comes up often in conversations with economists there is a pause in the conversation while they grope for a phrase , often producing a euphemism that masks the growing national alarm , including their own , over the persistently weak american economy we have this thing that is vaguely reminiscent of the 1930 s , said david jones , chief economist at aubrey g lanston the favorite labels are stagnation or , a degree stronger , persistent stagnation both fail to capture the gloom of millions of americans who are falling , not stagnating , having lost their jobs or portions of their incomes almost as popular among economists , but also not catching the national mood , is the very unrhythmical structural imbalance , also known as structural malaise the jargon refers to the obstacles to prosperity that piled up in the 1980 s , such things as overindebted consumers and corporations , now too busy paying off loans to spend freely , and the surplus of empty , unrented office buildings , discouraging new construction adjusting to the structural imbalances will take a long time , said robert d reischauer , chief economist of the congressional budget office , offering little comfort to the 17 million people who are unemployed , underemployed or too discouraged to look for work this is a sisyphean recovery , he said sisyphus , a figure in greek mythology , was condemned to push a rock up a hill only to have it constantly roll back recession comes easier to many americans as their stopgap description of the national plight , and their own hardship until a better label presents itself recession also has its offspring lingering recession , recessionary period and growth recession the latter is resurrected from the 1960 s , when it meant economic growth too weak to create enough jobs for all the people entering the labor force that is a problem today , but not the only one politicians are more upbeat the bush and clinton camps refer to a temporary period of slow growth \( bush \) and the anemic recovery \( clinton \) and then there is the favorite metaphor of alan greenspan , chairman of the federal reserve the economy , he says , is trying to buck a 50mileanhour headwind , which he hopes is tapering off among the very few who resort to the dword depression s jay levy and his son david levy of the jerome levy economics institute at bard college are trying to popularize the phrase contained depression with bank failures and other setbacks , the levys argue , the nation is experiencing a 1930 s depression that is contained by federal deposit insurance and the numerous federal spending programs that support the economy eliot janeway , an economics consultant , is not so charitable for him , recession becomes depression when hard times spread abroad , as they have to europe and japan what s more , he says , the main criterion of a depression has been fulfilled in this country very sharp contraction in economic activity mr janeway s contraction is certainly not evident in government statistics , though their accuracy and timeliness are often questioned by economists , particularly mr janeway i have never seen a deterioration deepen and spread so insidiously without showing up in the data flow , he said the hard times that are so difficult to label began in the spring of 1989 , when economic growth fell below an annual rate of 2 percent insufficient to keep down unemployment , sustain wages and generally make americans feel prosperous for 11 of the 13 quarters since early 1989 , the gross domestic product stayed below 2 percent growth and in three of the quarters from july 1990 to march 1991 gdp shrank , which means the economy was technically in recession not since before world war ii has the nation had below2percent economic growth for so long technically , the recession is over , but spiritually , it continues technically , the nation is enjoying a recovery , but as the weak growth continues , that word is heard less and less and always the weak growth suggests that the economy could contract again , restarting the recession people came to use the word depression in the 1930 s to mean hard times , and the hard times lasted until world war ii , said alan blinder , a princeton economist this period could also come to be called a depression , in hindsight , but i do n't think it is severe enough we need another name drawing
washington , dec 14 barely six months after ruling that states may not designate particular expressions of bias as crimes , the supreme court today plunged back into the roiling debate over hate crimes the justices agreed to decide whether the constitution permits an approach that more than half the states have taken to the biascrime issue , that of increasing the sentences for ordinary crimes like assault or vandalism if the victim was selected because or race , religion , ancestry or the like the new case is an appeal by the state of wisconsin , whose state supreme court ruled last summer that a 10yearold sentenceenhancement law had the effect of punishing offensive thought and chilling free speech , in violation of the first amendment prison sentence doubled the wisconsin ruling came in an appeal by a black man who had been convicted of leading an assault on a 14yearold white boy there goes a white boy , go get him , the defendant , todd mitchell , told his companions under wisconsin law , the crime for which mr mitchell was convicted , aggravated battery , normally carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison , but he was sentenced to four years after a jury found that he had selected his victim because of race the wisconsin supreme court s ruling , on june 23 , came a day after the united states supreme court ruled in rav v city of st paul that the first amendment prohibited an ordinance that made it a crime to display a symbol like a burning cross or a swastika that was likely to arouse anger or alarm on the basis of race , color , creed , religion or gender constitutional flaw seen in his majority opinion in that case , justice antonin scalia said the constitutional flaw in the st paul ordinance was its selectivity in proscribing expressions of some kinds of bias but not others the first amendment does not permit st paul to impose special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored subject , justice scalia said in the new appeal the justices must decide whether the analysis in the st paul case was broad enough to strike down laws that do not create new bias crimes , but that simply increase the penalties for crimes already on the books the court s answer will have a wide practical effect while the st paul ordinance was unusual , with few jurisdictions having created special bias crimes , wisconsin is one of 30 states that have adopted the sentenceenhancement approach proposed in the early 1980 s by the antidefamation league of b'nai b'rith there has been spirited debate over whether these laws could survive the court s ruling in the st paul case the ohio supreme court has since struck down that state s penaltyenhancement law , while the oregon supreme court upheld the law in that state in october the house of representatives passed a bill giving federal judges the authority to impose longer prison sentences for crimes of bias the bill died in the senate , but its sponsor , representative charles e schumer , a brooklyn democrat , plans to reintroduce it in the new congress since the court s ruling last june , the antidefamation league has tenaciously defended its approach leaders of the group said today that they were pleased that the court had agreed to hear the wisconsin case the action effectively recognizes that its decision last june in rav v st paul cannot be the final word on the constitutionality of hatecrimes statutes , melvin salberg , the organization s chairman , and abraham h foxman , its national director , said in a statement the new case , wisconsin v mitchell , no 92515 , will be one of the most closely watched cases of the court s term it will be argued in the spring , with a decision expected by the end of the term in late june or early july a constitutional shadow it is unusual for the court to return to an issue so quickly after having issued a major decision , rather than permitting a number of lower courts to interpret and apply the ruling in the first instance the court s speed in accepting the wisconsin case may reflect not only the justices' sense that the subject is an important one , but also a concern at least among some that the decision in the st paul case may have introduced more uncertainty than the court intended for example , some constitutional scholars have warned that the rav ruling cast a constitutional shadow over an array of antidiscrimination laws , including the civil rights act of 1964 , which prohibits job discrimination on the basis of race , religion or sex the wisconsin law provides for enhanced sentences for crimes committed against a person or property because of the race , religion , color , disability , sexual orientation , national origin or ancestry of that person or the owner or occupant of that property the appeal filed by james e doyle , the wisconsin attorney general , argues that the law appropriately punishes conduct , not thought but the wisconsin supreme court disagreed without doubt the hate crimes statute punishes bigoted thought , the court said , because application of the law requires a subjective examination inquiry into the defendant s motivation in selecting a particular victim by contrast , the state court said , conviction of the crime of assault or burglary requires only an objective determination that the act was committed by a particular

only in america has the fate of marriage been so linked to the idea of perfect love in the presidential cam paign , an attempt has been made to nail the fate of our political system to the same ideal at the same time , a flurry of books and articles brewed from pop psychology , a kind of women s magazine feminism and vacuous notions of selfhelp still advocate supposedly new styles of sexual behavior as if this and not economic security is the crucial problem for american women one of the latest fadayear books is the dalma heyn report on the extramarital love affairs of married women , the erotic silence of the american wife , which such leading writers on feminist issues as gloria steinem and gail sheehy hail as a revolutionary breakthrough monogamy , yes or no , suddenly has become a hot new issue it is not clear , however , how today s thinking differs from the open marriage touted for both sexes a mere decade ago the champions of the book say autonomy and happiness , which has eluded the american woman as she has shouldered her way through life styles ranging from the perfect marriages of the 50 s to the sexual revolutions of the 60 s and 70 s , is near at hand in the shape of the lover this new fellow on the block possesses none of those troublesome patriarchal male genes that have enslaved women apparently when one is servicing two men , as one of those interviewed put it , the patriarchal factor must cancel out the women sound so marvelously fulfilled what happened to being dressed for career success \? is that last week s happiness news \? i'm an american who was educated in france and worked in spain societies that have no unreal expectations of monogamy i do n't believe that true morality lies in the genital zone but neither does true rebellion books and magazines that use a vocabulary that deludes women into thinking themselves rebels and outlaws , on the cusp of some new freedom , engaged in a worthy achievable quest , misperceive our basic situation a defect in the early thinking of the women s movement was its tendency to liberate women not for life but for life in the counterculture when that life was over , many women found themselves in limbo today s average married woman marries late , has had considerable sexual experience but remains economically an endangered species women and children constitute the poverty class more than twothirds of exhusbands stop paying child support within three years of divorce a serious discussion of the viability of monogamy or the need for its opposite is possible only if you are passionate about the idea of marriage and passionate about the idea of passion it requires some sense of consequence , the social contract and the inherent tragedy and limits of life , as traditional european society does unlike americans , europeans protect marriage by building in all sorts of safety nets but one cannot take a conservative european view of marriage husband plus lover and dish it up as the latest progressive thinking in a mobile , divorcebased society like ours i do not say we can throughout our lives always be faithful to our husbands \( or lovers \) , but we have to be faithful to something women in the heyn book sound faithful to nothing in this nevernever land , the economic condition of women is dismissed in a paragraph hardly any attention is given to the fact that many of the marriages discussed ended in divorce children are not hurt they are perceived as powerful allies in a society teamed up against this new outlaw woman in this shift , children have replaced the male \( now an enabling lover \) as the embodiment of the punitive , patriarchal state , while the mother , the outlaw woman \( who apparently has no educative impact on her children \) , resides outside the social norm even simone de beauvoir , one of the first women intellectuals to use the media to influence society , picked an option in her traditionalist society in the second sex , she described the model for her social contract with jeanpaul sartre it is possible for women to use men as an instrument and perform masculine functions through his agency the favorite mistresses of men of authority have always shared , through their powerful lovers , in the government of the world but we are not french women intellectuals or courtesans nor are we being stoned to death for our sexual freedoms if we wish to gain rights in our society , we should not blur our thinking with the wrongs from other geographies and times forget about anna karenina , whom society ostracized for taking a lover and who threw herself under the train , and forget hester prynne , who was forced to wear the adulteress s red a over her heart we should turn to zola , who chronicled the plight of real women in a real world zola understood that we women are not outside society but a fundamental part of it we are not children at all we are women citizens if we wish to be firmvoiced and progressive about meeting our primary needs , particularly in this presidential year , we should not point our heads in the direction of the wrong revolution vague definitions like sister , rebel and outlaw may be handy for magazines in search of a vast circulation but are of no use to thinking adults sexual liberation without economic security grants women merely the right to stay marginal women must cease being conned into substituting fantasy sexual revolutions for political pressure for real reforms that would give us true equity drawing
san francisco , sept 11 for more than 10 years , opening night of the san francisco symphony was an event to be seen , but not necessarily heard the wide , high spaces and ushaped seating pattern of davies symphony hall provided excellent views across a starched and sequined audience the annual event , coupled with the opening of the opera , led off a musical season that has long been the jewel of the city s cultural crown but the imposing characteristics of the 12yearold hall also worked to dampen the orchestra s sound the horns , reverberating between the dentilled tiers , stumbled over one another the strings , lingering in the arch of the concrete ceiling , rarely descended to human ears listeners complained of dead spots musicians , catching only the echo of their colleagues , accused one another of poor timing and so , as happened to avery fisher hall in new york and a number of other contemporary concert halls , acousticians were invited to prescribe a remedy for san francisco in a twoyear , 102 million renovation project , the interior of davies hall has been opened up with aisles and tightened with new walls and fewer seats the floors have been replaced , the orchestra has been elevated and the ceiling has been reformed into an armor of plexiglass shields a positive reception on wednesday , davies hall reopened to the strains of beethoven s ninth symphony by the time the music ended and the applause died down , the consensus among the audience and musicians was one of tempered approval gone from the orchestra was what larry kirkegaard , an acoustician who has worked on the postrenovations carnegie hall and the remodeling of orchestra hall in chicago , called the brontosaurus effect you kick it in the tail , and two weeks later the head turns around as part of the postconcert hoopla , the audience also heard choirs and college bands , applauded chinese banners that were whipped through the aisles , and cheered the performance of a singer teetering beneath a hat bearing the model of the san francisco cityscape in the ears of local critics , the concert pleased as none in davies had before robert commanday , music critic for the san francisco chronicle , praised an excellent and exciting symphonic sound allan ullrich , music critic for the san francisco examiner , gave a more cautiously positive review , saying that while many of the original problems had been corrected , warmth , weight and sonic mass were in short supply early signs of trouble while the largely successful completion of the project would seem to signal the continued strength of the performing arts in the city at a time of economic recession , the outcome was far from certain even before 1985 , when the symphony s current music director , herbert blomstedt , was appointed , the problems of the hall were more than apparent at that time , mr blomstedt recalled this week , he could sit among the violas and not hear what the first violins were playing 10 feet away an experience he called not very rewarding but mr blomstedt , his musicians and his audience faced some difficulty in convincing the symphony s board that the space would have to be refurbished only five years after the 275 million hall was completed it was not the world s easiest job , said nancy bechtle , the symphony s president , about the second fundraising campaign among some board members , there was a sense of 'why did n't you do it right the first time \? ' ultimately , the board was swayed a crucial element in the escalating complaints about the sound quality was the fact that among the hall s 3 , 063 seats , the best those with the clearest sound were the cheapest , nestled in the nearly invisible reaches of the second tier overall attendance was 15 percent below the hall s daunting capacity built on a scale that rivaled the country s largest halls and exceeded many of the country s best , davies hall better reflected the grandiose aspirations of the 1980 s than the hard economic realities facing the city s 81yearold symphony but while the problems were evident , the solution was not even mr kirkegaard , who was eventually selected to replace the original acousticians , bolt , beranek newman of cambridge , mass , conceded that his profession is a mystical science or a black art in his preliminary surveys , mr kirkegaard toured with the symphony , gathering data from the musicians and measuring their sound in halls throughout europe he also consulted lothar cremer , the late acoustician of the berlin philharmonic , from which davies hall had derived its unusual seating arrangement in two consecutive summers , mr kirkegaard worked with skidmore , owings merrill , one of the two architecture firms involved in the original construction of the hall , to solve the hall s problems in the process the seating capacity was reduced by more than 300 the changes won him the support of the musicians , even that of herb holtman , a second violinist , who described himself as the most cynical guy around i did n't think they could do it , mr holtman said but i think they 've really done an admirable job , given the size of the hall reserving judgment gene morrison , a veteran of more than 1 , 000 davies concerts , zigzagged his way through the entire hall the boxes along the side and back , the two tiers , the orchestra and the thin strip of seats above the sides of the stage he admired the cherry paneling surrounding the stage , the risers for the musicians and the newly raked orchestra floor this used to be a vast wasteland , mr morrison said , waving his arm out over the orchestra now it s certainly worth checking out and while mr morrison said he thought the evening s concert had better balance and everything sounded richer , he and a number of other regulars reserved final judgment for evenings of less spectacle and more music next week we 'll hear mahler s second , he said , and in a year or two i 'll tell you what i really think photo the san francisco symphony playing at the reopening this week of davies symphony hall in san francisco \( terrence mccarthy for the new york times \)
in bosnia and serbia , it all seemed clear that the killing and the terror came out of old , ugly balkan history and hatred except for the human duty to try to save bosnian muslim lives , none of it could possibly have any meaning or connection to america lucky americans , i wrote in a notebook it meant so far from that world , that past , thank god , so safe from that kind of archaic tribal struggle in the notes the same word appears on a halfdozen pages , circled why once the word is written together four times , whywhywhywhy after all , bosnian muslims are simply serbs or croats or slovenes whose forefathers found it wise to convert to islam some 600 years ago when the ottoman empire extended its reach to their lands but i met nobody who thinks it is basically a religious war then why \? why have so many bosnian muslims been killed , imprisoned or driven into exile \? why do so many others pray that they too could be refugees , to escape the serbian bombardment of their cities \? i borrow one reason from historians and psychologists bosnians , serbs , croats , albanians , macedonians , muslim or christian , come out of a world where for centuries loyalties were built on the importance of separateness the separate clan , tribe , family and village gave protection the histories and fantasies of the individual group gave meaning and texture to life the separateness created fear of others , which was intensified when the outsider was too close , a neighbor leaders used the fears to build their own power feudal dukes once , now onetime communist bosses like president slobodan milosevic of serbia , building new power on old separations a familiar balkan story , reeking of the past it is the result of cultural and political separateness within a country , the refusal of tribes to merge hopes and destinies with those of the nation but in the united states we are safe from all that , it has nothing to do with us right \? there was a time when americans said that without any ironic implication wherever our parents came from , whatever language we spoke at home , we reached for a common overriding identity those born abroad , or to immigrants , understood that in part it was an identity given to us by the country we took it with pleasure when we sang land where our fathers died we knew it was not our fathers we were singing of but it sure was our country our teachers knew that everybody knew it we had our family cultures , but i cannot remember a day when i thought of my own as overwhelmed , subordinated or diminished by the american identity i suppose that was my parents' fault they never told me america was swallowing me up i had few black friends but it never occurred to me that black kids could be overwhelmed by american identity the idea would have seemed crazy i figured that since all black parents and grandparents were born in the us and none spoke with foreign accents , black kids were particularly american black kids agreed maybe their parents never told them otherwise new york was as multicultural as anything in the country then or now so why does the whole idea of multiculturalism as used now bother me \? and why did it come to mind , a shadow , when i jotted the note about lucky americans , so godblessed to be far away from european feuds and killings \? i know why because multi in relation to american identity has taken on the meaning of separate , on guard , stand off does it seem farfetched to think that multiculturalism or racial separatism or ethnic pluribus yes unum no could lead to the kind of divisions that blew apart yugoslavia and blew up bosnia \? yes , if you carry it that far but if you consider that after awhile multi in the sense of separate , stand back , can get to be a way of life , that more and more groups say it to each other , and that there are already people in politics , the streets and the universities building careers by heating suspicions and fears between some multi s and other multi s , it is something to think about , intently and frequently lucky americans unless they learn a little about how the past can become the present , nothing guarantees they will be lucky forever

fame seems about to overtake eugene leroy the 82yearold painter , who has lived most of his life in northern france near the belgian border , has pursued his distinctive if somewhat conservative painting style for at least three decades , working for months and sometimes years on canvases whose paint surfaces are so obsessively thick that their images mostly nudes , heads and still lifes are virtually obliterated but it was only in the 1980 s , when contemporary painting was both dominant and pluralist and figuration made its comeback , that mr leroy began to receive attention outside france and belgium since 1983 , he has had several solo shows in germany \( where his work has been admired by neoexpressionists like georg baselitz and markus lupertz \) and , since 1985 , in the united states last year , he was included in the sao paulo bienal in brazil last summer , his paintings were given their own gallery at the ninth documenta in kassel , germany , putting him on a par with artists like ellsworth kelly and francis bacon suitably , mr leroy s fourth oneman show in manhattan is an impressive twogallery affair consisting of 24 new paintings 9 at the michael werner gallery on the upper east side , 15 at the edward thorp gallery in soho they offer the most extensive view so far of this engrossing eccentric mr leroy s extravagantly paintladen canvases are engrossing in the way a glowing , slowburning log might be they are mesmerizing in their flickering details of texture and color , and so impacted with paint that they almost seem to give off their own heat it takes time actually to see them as paintings , and more time still to see them as different from one another they seem at first more like geological formations or expanses of petrified moss or chaotic topographical maps than handmade artworks but after a while , the deliberation with which their seemingly inchoate surfaces are composed begins to assert itself the variety with which paint is brushed , scraped , layered , piled up and dug into fills these works with markedly distinct passages of painthandling , in the oldfashioned sense , even while they seem to push paint to new physical limits and while the artist often favors a prevailing brown tone , a closer look reveals that each painting has an encyclopedic range of color , which tends to infuse the best canvases with an unexpected sense of shimmering light this is the case especially with the largest and most thinly painted canvas at werner , marina in light , and in large figure , summer , at thorp mr leroy often finishes off a painting with bright slashes of color or relatively pure white in flower face , at werner , the final layer consists of several squeezes of green , yellow and red that seem to have come directly from the tube , while april showers , at thorp , culminates in elaborate squeezes of yellow and white in with one thigh , at werner , a wide scrape of white , more hollowed out of the surface than applied to it , suggests a human presence , shrouded by paint the artist , who works frequently from the model and always in natural light , seems to start each canvas with a discernible image that gradually succumbs to the material and the process of painting three charcoal drawings hanging in the office at werner give an idea of the starting point that is covered over in the paintings in each , a few fluid lines intimate a bending nude whose form is partly obscured by a flurry of marks marks , it should be added , that differ significantly from drawing to drawing mr leroy s work is frequently related to a long line of artists in love with the sheer physicality of paint , from rembrandt and van gogh to chaim soutine , lovis corinth , james ensor , jean dubuffet and willem de kooning another predecessor is alberto giacometti , whose obsessive reworkings , both in clay and on canvas , bespeak a somewhat destructive passion not unlike mr leroy s these connections all make sense , yet there s often something a little suspect about such an easy and extended roll call it suggests that mr leroy s work is also a bit obvious it seems more to the point to say that mr leroy takes the traditional ways and means of oil painting to such extremes that his work is almost radical , almost sentimental and almost parodic his achievement is to attract all these adjectives while allowing none of them to stick there s a plaquelike impenetrability to his surfaces that should placate the most literalminded formalists of the 60 s yet mr leroy s best paintings are those that are the least abstract , possessed of a clotted yet discernible sense of light and space that harbors within it a comfortably familiar image , pinpointed by the work s title in some dark summer flowers , at werner , a vertical swath of blue , curved at the last moment , leads the eye to a broad glob of red a sweet , irresistibly heavy bloom a similar still life at thorp , red flower , includes a square of white that suggests an open window finally , the physical excess of mr leroy s canvases evokes with considerable power , and not a little wit , the centuriesold struggle between what painters see and what their talent and sensibilities allow them to wrestle onto canvas as his paintings suggest , it is often a struggle as ridiculous as it is sublime  eugene leroy s recent paintings remain at the michael werner gallery , 21 east 67th street , upper east side , through nov 7 , and at the edward thorp gallery , 103 prince street , soho , through oct 10 photo a detail from eugene leroy s with one thigh
gov bill clinton of arkansas said yesterday that he experimented with marijuana while he was a rhodes scholar at oxford university in the late 1960 s , but that he had never used any other illegal drug i 've never broken a state law , he said but when i was in england i experimented with marijuana a time or two , and i did n't like it i did n't inhale it , and never tried it again in responding to questions at a candidates' forum on wcbstv in new york , mr clinton violated his own rule against answering have you ever \? questions and spoke in more detail than he had before about his encounters with drugs but he said afterward that he had never before been asked the question as directly , and i just told the truth that when i was 22 , i was in england , i did what most everybody else did over there , he said i tried it a couple of times i literally did n't like it and never did it again mr clinton studied at oxford from 1968 to 1970 similar disclosures he said he did not expect the disclosure to hurt his presidential campaign , because other candidates , including senator al gore of tennessee and former gov bruce babbitt of arizona , had made similar admissions in the 1988 campaign i do n't think it hurt senator gore four years ago or governor babbitt , and it certainly did n't keep clarence thomas off the supreme court , he said during justice thomas s confirmation process last year , the white house disclosed that he had used marijuana while in college but said president bush deemed it a minor matter in the past , mr clinton has answered questions about drug use by saying he never broke the laws of his state or of the united states he said yesterday that there should remain some sense of what is private and what is public for public officials when a similar question was posed to mr clinton s rival for the democratic nomination , edmund g brown jr , who appeared on the television program by satellite from green bay , wis , the former california governor said he had never broken state , federal or international laws on drug use and he also discouraged further questioning on the topic i agree with clinton , he said why do n't you lay off this stuff \? he said it was not relevant to the overall presidential campaign mr clinton told reporters afterward that he never even had a drink of whisky until i was 22 and said he was not purposely vague when he has answered drugrelated questions in the past nobody s ever asked me that question pointblank , he said harkin 'friend' or foe \? the two candidates engaged in genteel combat during the televised meeting yesterday , seeking to appeal to the voters in the new york primary on april 7 mr brown , who campaigned before labor groups in wisconsin before heading to vermont , appeared at one campaign event where senator tom harkin of iowa , the former presidential candidate who has endorsed mr clinton , was also appearing mr brown , who asked for but did not receive mr harkin s endorsement , called the senator my friend after mr brown departed , mr harkin said , all of a sudden he s a leader of labor , recalling that the former california governor had criticized mr harkin for accepting union contributions mr harkin also said , jerry brown s tax plan is even worse than ronald reagan s the brown campaign is expected to get a major boost today with an endorsement from local 1199 of the hospital workers' union and its president , dennis rivera officials of the union , which represents nearly 100 , 000 health care workers in new york state , urged mr brown to reconfigure his proposed 13 percent flat income tax so it was not only simple , but fair they said , though , that they were swayed by his antiestablishment message and the possibility that his candidacy would lead to a brokered convention that might nominate an acceptable alternative in new york , mr clinton campaigned at representative floyd h flake s church in queens and at coop city in the bronx at the church , he defended himself against new york tabloid newspaper articles that he said have portrayed him unfairly as a cartoon character of an oldtime southern dealmaker friction between the two campaigns was not reflected in the televised debate , but behind the scenes , the competition continued a clinton campaign official was circulating a document compiled by campaign researchers that compared passages from mr brown s september speech announcing his candidacy to an unpublished manuscript that the clinton campaign says was written by patrick caddell , a brown campaign adviser james carville , the clinton campaign consultant who provided a copy of the document to the new york times , termed the similarities the ultimate manifestation of a pattern of a guy who has no core the purported similarities were called to the attention of the clinton organization by sam popkin , a professor at the university of california at san diego mr popkin , who wrote the book the reasoning voter \( university of chicago , 1969 \) , said he did not now work for the clinton campaign but might in the future mr caddell expressed outrage last night that the clinton campaign was trying to make an issue of his writing
washington , sept 8 when everyone else at harvard was marching against the war in vietnam , william kristol was defending it as a righteous cause when they were rallying for the equal rights amendment , he was testifying against it at a senate hearing while others were lampooning richard m nixon , he was wearing a spiro agnew sweatshirt around campus just to shock people proudly contrarian by nature , mr kristol was openly contemptuous of the cocksure radicals who thought they were the smartest generation ever and that none of the traditions were worth preserving he kept his hair short he says he did not smoke marijuana he had little time for jimi hendrix or the doors he was far too rigorous to compare bob dylan to w b yeats , said r emmett tyrrell , a boyhood friend who went on to become editor of the american spectator when marilyn quayle reminded the republican convention last month that not everyone joined the counterculture not everyone demonstrated , dropped out , took drugs , joined in the sexual revolution or dodged the draft , perhaps it was mr kristol , her husband s chief of staff , she had in mind unlikely combination at first glance the pairing of dan quayle and bill kristol might seem the unlikeliest of combinations mr quayle was a c student and selfconfessed late bloomer from huntington , ind , a town where a night out meant cruising to the a w root beer stand mr kristol grew up in what mr tyrrell called an endless intellectual salon , the upper west side home of his parents , irving kristol , the neoconservative sage , and gertrude himmelfarb , a noted historian of the victorian era he graduated as valedictorian from the exclusive collegiate school in manhattan , sailed through undergraduate school at harvard in three years , then earned a phd and taught political philosophy there but for a man who thrives on being in the minority there are too many republicans now , he grouses there may have been no more fulfilling job in politics than plotting the rehabilitation of mr quayle the relationship has proven mutually beneficial beyond imagination it has given mr quayle the intellectual cachet and strategic discipline he so badly needed and it has given the 39yearold mr kristol a vehicle , a way to move his conservative agenda from the obscure journals of the new right all the way to the white house the smartest guy' around to the extent that mr quayle has become the bush administration s leading voice on issues like family values and civil justice reform , and chipped away at his caricature in the process , mr kristol has received much of the credit some in the vice president s office protest that mr kristol has received too much credit for mr quayle s successes his colleagues have mocked him relentlessly since the wall street journal quoted james pinkerton , a former white house aide , calling him the smartest guy in the white house irving kristol told his son drily that the compliment was faint praise but when mr quayle s press secretary , david c beckwith , is thrown a tough question now , he likes to respond , where s the smartest guy in the white house when you need him \? mr quayle believes that news reports characterizing mr kristol as dan quayle s brain , as the new republic did in 1990 , are just the latest evidence that the press refuses to treat him fairly i do n't particularly care for it , mr quayle said in a recent interview i'm sure bill does n't , either bill offers a lot to me and what i 've done as vice president but i'm the one that sets the agenda i come up with the direction that we want to go i'm the one that s coming up with ideas barbs for 'the new class' and yet , both the strategy and policies of mr quayle s vice presidency bear mr kristol s imprint perhaps most notable is mr quayle s demonization of what he calls the cultural elite , a group that irving kristol , coeditor of the conservative journal the public interest , labeled years ago as the new class many critics have said mr kristol is as much a part of the cultural elite as anybody could be but he said the cultural elite , as identified by mr quayle , is defined by its attitudes , not its class or its intellectualism he s used the term to refer to people who look down on middleclass bourgeois values , mr kristol said it s a shallow sophistication , not generic culture it s bicoastal snobbery , and i think that s worth criticizing mr kristol also has longstanding beliefs , based at least partly on the teachings of the 20thcentury political philosopher leo strauss , about the importance of what has come to be known as family values i came to conservatism from the point of view that ultimately a country is judged by the character and values of its people , mr kristol said that s the great lesson of the social programs of the last 30 years we 've had material progress and technological progress , and we still have terrible problems before he joined the government , mr kristol wrote in a 1985 article for the heritage foundation s policy review that the political executive ought not to be afraid of publicity or controversy , and added , in politics , unlike football , there is no referee who makes sure you have a turn on offense dan in the lion s den
the contenders for the democratic senate nomination from new york clashed sharply over ethics last night , as geraldine a ferraro s main rivals repeatedly questioned her integrity , and she responded by vigorously challenging their own the exchanges in the candidates' first major televised debate came just hours after ms ferraro said that repeated questions about her personal finances by state attorney general robert abrams and city comptroller elizabeth holtzman had cost her some support she released two years of previously undisclosed tax returns in an effort to head off the questions in a freewheeling , hourlong discussion broadcast live from manhattan and made available to stations around the state , the three candidates , and a fourth , the rev al sharpton , differed little on a dozen issues , agreeing on the need for more recycling , calling for the appointment of more minority officials in the criminaljustice system , more investment in housing and more money for aids , and expressing wariness about any tax increases for the middle class excerpts , page b6 their most pronounced differences centered on the death penalty , which ms ferraro alone supports , and health care , with ms ferraro favoring less sweeping changes in the existing insurance system than her opponents the debate , the candidates' first joint appearance since midmay , took place on a pivotal day , as the marist college institute of public opinion in poughkeepsie , ny , said its surveys of voters this week had shown the race tightening markedly , with ms ferraro retaining just a slight edge over mr abrams four days before the primary ms holtzman released what her campaign said would be its final television commercial , in which she starkly painted ms ferraro as too conservative for new york s democrats the ad questions ms ferraro s votes in congress a decade ago in support of voluntary school prayer and tax exemptions for churchrun schools that practiced discrimination ms ferraro released a new rebuttal ad of her own , and in a news conference made pointed appeals to her core supporters , women and italianamericans , to reject the attacks the first twothirds of the debate remained remarkably calm compared to the harsh tones common in the race in recent weeks but when one of the panelists asked ms ferraro whether lingering questions about her finances would make her a weak candidate against the republican incumbent , alfonse m d'amato , the gloves came off powerful counterattack ms ferraro immediately said that most ethical questions about mr d'amato centered on whether he had done favors in office for political contributors she contended that while no one had ever raised such questions about her , both ms holtzman and mr abrams to whom she repeatedly referred as liz and bobby had been criticized for taking campaign contributions from people who had official business with their offices the people of this state own me , she said ms ferraro , a former assistant district attorney , then seemed to fluster mr abrams by pointing out that he had misstated the year in which the federal election commission forced her to pay a fine for taking improper campaign loans from her family what year was that , bob \? she demanded ms holtzman , who turned in her seat to look into ms ferraro s eyes , demanded to know why she had continued to rent warehouse space to a distributor of pornography for nearly three years after promising to evict him ms ferraro leaned right back toward her and demanded at one point , was anyone arrested \? when ms holtzman replied , i do n't know , ms ferraro broke in with an emphatic , no , they were not ! at one point , their exchange grew so heated that the moderator , bill beutel of wabctv , interrupted to steer them on to the next question , calling , ladies ! ladies ! applause for sharpton the only applause of the evening went to mr sharpton , when he criticized the others for spending too much time on such questions , and losing perspective on pressing issues like jobs and affordable housing they forget , he said they 're not running for prosecutor now they 're running for senate the state s top democrat , gov mario m cuomo , said afterward that the negativity was terribly distasteful he said it does not help holtzman or abrams to be perceived as that rancorous it does not create a likable candidate asked who had won , mr cuomo replied , it s clear that sharpton did himself good , because he was positive , because he was mature it s also clear that the other three all got hurt to some extent among the candidates , ms ferraro seemed the most lighthearted of the four at the end her husband , john a zaccaro , who had been in the studio , greeted ms ferraro , saying , you did well ms ferraro told reporters she thought the debate went well for her , adding , a bit grimly , i enjoyed it but ms holtzman gave no quarter when asked if ms ferraro had faced her down absolutely not , she said she did n't face me down she interrupted me and she did n't answer all the questions and mr abrams claimed victory , saying he had shown his differences with ms ferraro on health care and defense cuts difficult opener the debate opened with a politically loaded question whether any of the candidates supported taxing social security benefits for the rich ms holtzman saidthat tampering with the social security system is a big mistake , and called for expanded medicare benefits and none of the other candidates favored the notion this discussion led quickly into the broader question of tax increases in general , particularly for the middle class focus on tax increase ms ferraro said that she favored a surtax on people making over 200 , 000 a year and tax breaks for the middle class ms holtzman said she would take a cautious approach to any increase , given the recession mr abrams sought to distance himself from ms ferraro , who favors cutting 100 billion from the military budget in the next five years , about onethird the amount favored by her opponents , and said he opposed any tax increase unfair treatment \? asked whether they believed black , hispanic and other minority citizens could receive fair treatment in the criminal justice system , all the candidates said they believed racism was a problem and mr abrams , ms holtzman and mr sharpton quickly used the question to attack ms ferraro s support of the death penalty i think gerry wants to get it both ways , said mr abrams he said she was trying to score points on the issue , while sharply limiting when she thought capital punishment was appropriate but ms ferraro said she was strong enough to take an unpopular position when i believe it s right , referring to democratic resistance to the death penalty but support for the death penalty is far more common among the general electorate calling the death penalty wrong under any circumstances , mr sharpton said that it had not proved an effective deterrent and that once a person is dead , we cannot give a person his life back or her life back he also questioned mr abrams and ms holtzman s commitment to placing blacks in senior positions in their offices as attorney general and brooklyn district attorney to which they strenuously objected , saying they had appointed many , and at high levels ms holtzman stressed her view that there were other ways to fight crime , like combatting drugs , banning handguns and giving criminals stiffer sentences photos candidates for the democratic nomination for the united states senate from new york during yesterday s debate from left the rev al sharpton , robert abrams , geraldine a ferraro and elizabeth holtzman \( pool photo by bob strong \)
the driver of a chartered bus that crashed in new jersey on sunday , killing six people from brooklyn , attributed the accident to brake failure yesterday as state and federal officials began an intense investigation into the causes questions arose about the safety of the steep country road where the bus rammed into two cars and burst into flames and also about the qualifications of the driver , 60yearold robert campbell of brooklyn , who officials say never underwent the medical , ontheroad and written tests required of charter bus drivers in new york the bus was one of three belonging to sensational golden sons , a small enterprise operated by mr campbell since 1988 mr campbell , a retired manager of a brooklyn housing project , was driving the bus at the time of the accident and was critically injured 48 others injured in addition to the six killed , 48 others , including three people in two cars , were injured on the narrow , winding road that has been the scene of several fatal crashes in the last decade , the most recent involving a gasoline tanker 12 days ago none of the 51 people on the bus were unscathed most of them lived within blocks of each other in a largely hispanic neighborhood in williamsburg yesterday afternoon , as officials of the town of vernon and sussex county discussed new safety procedures , police officers standing by cruisers with flashing lights turned away about 50 heavy vehicles at the intersection where the 22ton bus entered the treacherous road , county route 515 for the last 15 years , vehicles weighing more than four tons have been banned from the road a small road sign near the point where the bus entered route 515 advises drivers trucks over four tons excluded passengers who survived the crash said the vehicle swayed as it started down an incline , tires and brakes howling as mr campbell wrestled the steering wheel in a desperate attempt to slow the bus , the passengers said , he shifted down through the gears but the bus only gathered speed , they said then it plowed into a car and rolled at least four times before slamming into another car and a guard rail whether the 20yearold bus , described by some passengers as vibrating heavily during the trip , underwent the required safety inspections in new york state was unclear on monday state and federal officials said they were attempting to track the ownership history of the bus , which is registered to sensational golden sons bus service inc in brooklyn a federal investigator said it was manufactured in 1972 by motor coach industries inc , a subsidiary of the greyhound dial corporation state officials said the tragedy highlighted the difficulty of monitoring the thousands of charter buses in the state , particularly those owned by entrepreneurs who may have only two or three vehicles asked how many such companies exist in the state , matthew ryan , director of the state s commercial vehicle safety bureau , said , the saddest part is , i really ca n't tell you these fellows can have a bus in their backyard while mr campbell has a driver s license that permits him to operate a bus , he has never undergone the additional testing required by state law of all commercial charter bus drivers , according to george filieau , a spokesman for the new york department of motor vehicles some of the tests for charter bus drivers must be repeated annually thereafter , and some every other year the system for licensing charter bus drivers is set up to be selfpolicing , and holds the owners of companies responsible for testing and collecting information about their drivers each year , the owners must send the state affidavits saying that they have done all the necessary testing mr campbell never submitted such affidavits to the state about himself , mr filieau said the company has one driver , who is not mr campbell , registered with the state one traffic conviction mr campbell has had one traffic conviction in the past four years , a citation for running a red light while driving a bus last may 24 at kings highway and east 24th street in brooklyn , records show he pleaded guilty and paid a 50 fine his company had 5 million in insurance , according to interstate commerce commission records dan hartman , a spokesman for the united states department of transportation s motor coach and specialized programs division , said a centralized information bank on bus safety inspections and driver registration gave no indication that mr campbell had ever filed for any of the certificates required by the transportation department for himself or his buses interstate charter operators are supposed to file route and driver qualification information , mr hartman said mr campbell s company has owned the bus involved in the accident since last april 3 , records show before that , it was registered to the skyway transportation company of 11552 inwood street in jamaica , queens skyway has no telephone listing however , the rev sarah l johnson , pastor of the srt tabernacle church at that address , said her husband had owned the bus for about a month before selling it to mr campbell she said that she had no other information about the matter and that her husband was unavailable there are between 40 , 000 and 50 , 000 charter buses registered in the state of new york , and each must be inspected twice a year , said mr ryan , who is in charge of the inspection program about 75 percent of those are school buses , and the rest belong to private commuter and charter services between 8 , 000 and 10 , 000 buses fail inspections each year , mr ryan said they must be repaired and must undergo further inspections before operating decals are issued , he said mr ryan said there was no record indicating that mr campbell had ever registered any of his buses with the state department of transportation s inspection program whatever the investigation eventually shows , neighbors and people who worked with mr campbell , the bus driver , described him yesterday as a conscientious and wellliked man they recalled the annual parties featuring gospel singing that he used to give for people at the neighborhood senior citizens' center and the small kindnesses that marked his relationships he s a nice , quiet man and very religious , said joel h schoenberger , the manager of the seslow houses , the public housing project in the brownsville section of brooklyn , where mr campbell worked for 17 years he gave a lot back to the community , mr schoenberger said i never heard a bad word from the man s mouth he was willing to help anyone mr schoenberger said mr campbell had bought the buses as a business proposition , hoping to turn a profit but it was also a public service , he said if a community group was short of funds he would reduce the price to cut costs he would be the driver so they would n't have to pay extra for someone else serviced the poor mr campbell provided transportation , mr schoenberger said , that his customers , mainly poor people , some of them elderly and on fixed incomes , would not have had otherwise he said churches , seniorcitizens centers , schools and other community groups had chartered mr campbell s buses francis bellamy , who worked at the seslow houses and has known mr campbell for more than a decade , said he was a very responsible person i do n't think he would have taken his family on the bus or anyone else if he thought it was unsafe , ms bellamy said he would not have risked that photo the garage of the sensational golden sons bus service ,

to the editor in his effort to buttress the unsupported claim by nayirah alsabah that iraqi soldiers removed babies from kuwait city incubators , thomas e eidson , president of hill and knowlton , in response to my jan 6 oped article , makes a curious choice for a corroborating witness \( letter , jan 17 \) mr eidson cites the assertion at a united nations security council hearing by dr ibraheem behbehani , head of the kuwaiti red crescent , that he supervised the burial of 120 newborn babies after the iraqi invasion , and personally buried 40 newborn babies that had been taken from their incubators by iraqi soldiers surely mr eidson knows that dr behbehani long ago retracted most of his testimony about infant deaths at that nov 27 , 1990 , hearing dr behbehani has told middle east watch he ca n't back up the story about the 120 babies whose burial he allegedly supervised as for the 40 newborns he said he personally buried , dr behbehani admitted to abc news , i ca n't tell you if they were taken from incubators i did n't see it dr behbehani spoke at the security council hearing under a false name dr issah ibrahim and presented himself as a surgeon , even though he is a dentist at least four other witnesses that day used false names none told the security council they were hiding their true identities all were coached on their statements by hill and knowlton , which sent a team to the hearing led by lauri j fitzpegado thomas ross of hill and knowlton assures me that at a news conference after the security council hearing , the president of citizens for a free kuwait , dr hassan alebraheem , made it clear that the witnesses had concealed their true identity for fear of reprisal against their relatives still in kuwait mr ross also says a press release issued at the news conference revealed that five of the witnesses used false names however , despite repeated requests , i have not received a copy of the press release or proof dr alebraheem made such a statement john r macarthur publisher , harper s magazine new york , jan 24 , 1992
pittsburgh , june 28 in a renewed effort to overcome the species barrier in transplantation and to help relieve the dire shortage of human donor organs , surgeons from the university of pittsburgh today took a liver from a baboon and implanted it in a human patient the recipient was a man dying from hepatitis b , a virus that had destroyed his liver and had made him ineligible to receive a donated human organ the 11 1 2hour operation ended at 10 42 pm the patient was listed in critical condition , which is standard after liver transplant procedures because of the patient s desire for confidentiality , his name is not being discolsed on friday , a committee that evaluates the ethics of human experiments at the university , gave permission to a team headed by the liver transplant pioneer , dr thomas e starzl , to perform up to four permanent baboonliver transplants in humans it was the first time a baboon liver had been given to a human other baboon organs have been transplanted to humans in at least 33 operations since 1905 so far , none have been successful the man signed a detailed consent form , approved by the ethics committee , that spelled out everything that doctors felt could go wrong with the experimental operation in keeping with the committee s orders , the surgeons waited another 24 hours in case the patient had second thoughts after agreeing to go ahead , he began taking the first of four drugs developed by the pittsburgh team to prevent rejection of the baboon liver one of the drugs , known as fk506 , is new and may help this operation succeed where all other animaltohuman transplants have failed since the hepatitis b virus reinfects transplanted human livers , hospitals have excluded these patients from the long queue of wouldbe liver recipients , but the baboon liver is thought not to be susceptible to the virus doctors were concerned that the man might bleed uncontrollably because of damage to his blood clotting mechanism from his decaying liver had that happened early in the operation , the surgeons would not have gone ahead with the transplant the intricate operation began at 1124 am in presbyterian hospital at the university of pittsburgh medical center more than 25 doctors , including this reporter , crowded into an amphitheater one floor above the operating room to watch the procedure the patient s abdomen was opened with an inverted yshaped incision that started just above the breast bone and ended above the navel his skin was deeply yellow from the buildup of bile salts that his failing liver could no longer metabolize dr john j fung , one of dr starzl s pupils , began the delicate task of freeing the liver , the body s vital biochemical factory , from the natural web of tissues that cradle it meanwhile , a second team of surgeons headed by dr satoru todo started an operation on the donor baboon in a nearby surgical unit the baboon , a male , had been flown in from the southwest foundation in san antonio , where it had been raised the two teams worked in tandem , sending word back and forth about the progress of the operations nearly three and half hours into the operation , the patient s scarred and shrunken liver was removed soon after , the baboon liver arrived in the operating room and was placed in a metal bowl of crushed ice to preserve it dr todo s team began identifying each blood vessel to make it easier for dr fung s team to attach the baboonliver blood vessels to those of the patient from time to time , dr todo s team , working at a bench at the back of the greentiled operating room , squirted salt water to test the blood vessels for possible leaks a surgeon continually cracked ice to maintain the slush in the bowl around the cooled donor liver until dr fung s team was ready to sew it in place the liver was smooth and healthy looking , less than half the size of the patient s shrunken liver it looks like a liver from a 13yearold boy , observed a surgeon watching the operation eventually , there were 27 people in the operating room , including 10 surgeons , all furiously laboring to avoid any of the many possible slips that could ruin the elaborate procedure during the operation , the patient received injections of the drugs that are being counted on to prevent rejection at 3 48 pm , dr fung began sewing the baboon liver into the patient an hour later , as the patient s blood was allowed to flow into the new liver for the first time , dr david h van thiel , a member of the team watching from the amphitheater , said they 're over the biggest hurdle still , hours of work lay ahead for dr fung s team success in this daring new crossspecies transplantation hinges on the use of an experimental drug , fk506 , in combination with three marketed drugs they are prednisone \( a steroid \) , cyclophosphamide \( anticancer \) and prostaglandin \( antiinflammatory \) dr starzl said his team has used the combination with routine success in transplanting hamster hearts and livers in rats the hope is that after about two weeks , all antirejection drugs except fk506 can be stopped , dr starzl said in an interview a baboon was chosen for the transplant because its liver is anatomically similar to the human organ dr starzl said that dr jay hoofnagle , a liver expert at the national institutes of health , had told him that the baboon liver cannot be infected with the hepatitis b virus if the new combination of drugs allows successful baboon liver transplants , surgeons will try it with other organs so that baboons could be raised for a dependable , ready supply of organs for humans the baboon is not an endangered species and can be bred safely and easily in captivity the baboon sacrificed today was born in the united states and raised at a site approved by the food and drug adminstration success would go a long way toward relieving the shortage of human organs for transplantation and would allow transplants to be done more on a scheduled rather than emergency basis each week , about three patients die here while waiting for a liver transplant , dr starzl said , and about 30 percent of all patients waiting for a human liver die before getting one many are under age 45 the only way out is to give animal organs to humans , dr starzl told the ethics committee , adding that the liver , the organ for which there is the greatest present need , is the one with the greatest chance of success in the last animaltohuman transplant , an infant known as baby fae died 20 days after receiving a baboon s heart at loma linda medical center in california in 1984 baby fae received cyclosporine , a standard antirejection drug that was not given to the man who received the baboon liver dr starzl performed the world s first human liver transplant in 1963 and the first successful liver transplant in 1967 , both at the university of colorado in denver since then , more than 10 , 000 liver transplants have been performed
as detectives hunt for the gunmen behind last week s ferocious firefight outside a bronx grocery , lawenforcement specialists say it represents crime s latest calling card on the streets of new york city sprayshooting that indiscriminately targets bystanders as well as intended victims in many ways , they say , it is more alarming than other surges of criminal violence , a volatile mix of heavy armament , drug rivalries , abject poverty and shadowy ethnic gangs that one criminologist says summons up the specter of overseas war zones the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , said friday that his office had identified more than 60 drug gangs in manhattan north of 96th street alone and that while prosecutors had recently made cases against several of them , critical intelligence was lacking and a far greater effort by lawenforcement agencies was required thomas a reppetto , president of the citizens crime commission , put it more bluntly we have the drug gangs on the run , he said , right toward us small feuding factions police officials do not play down their concern there is no regard for innocent people anymore , said chief of detectives joseph r borrelli , who tracks the trend to the appearance of cheap and easytomake crack cocaine in the early 1980 s with entrepreneurship open to anyone with a few thousand dollars and a gun , the dominance of organizedcrime cartels has given way to the chaos of small feuding factions with little regard for unintended victims shooting innocent people does n't bother them in the slightest , said chief john holmes of the police department s organized crime control bureau , whose narcotics division has linked wednesday s fusillade on longwood avenue in hunts point to a turf battle over a location where undercover officers had made 25 felony arrests for crack and heroin sales since last october is n't it strange that people on the corner had the wherewithal to fire back \? many of the 12 people wounded in the exchange of about 60 shots , including five teenagers , were bystanders , the police said both chief borrelli and chief holmes said in interviews last week that frightened witnesses had provided few leads figures kept by chief borrelli s office through aug 26 not counting the longwood avenue shooting list 3 , 998 people killed and wounded in gunfire this year , up from the figure of 3 , 902 for the same period last year lawrence w sherman , a professor of criminology at the university of maryland who has extensively studied the phenomenon , likens the rash of spray shootings since the late 1980 s to the territorial instinct of animals to mark their turf taking issue with most lawenforcement experts like chief borrelli and mr reppetto , who link the violence inexorably to the drug trade , mr sherman , who conducted one of the few surveys ever of bystander shootings , said it had more to do with the ready availability of semiautomatic weapons and the rivalries of youth it came with crack and the gun culture that accompanied crack , he said by telephone friday , but it can survive crack the crossfire is the most disruptive and debilitating crime that the city can experience , he said if you do n't believe me , ask beirut something wacky going on' chief borrelli said he could recall with unusual specificity just how the problem first presented itself in the early 80 s , he said , before the crack came to the attention of the authorities , a detective squad commander in the 103d precinct in jamaica , queens , told him , as chief borrelli recalled it , something wacky is going on here a lot of people , he reported , were showing up shot in the legs chief borrelli said he started inquiring and found similar accounts from other queens precincts then , he said , he began getting reports about a new drug on the street what it was , he said , was crack , and in the quick strife over sales territories , emergent pushers were shooting onto the sidewalk , striking recalcitrant rivals in the legs in an effort to track the shootings , he said , at the end of 1990 his office began a log to count and classify shooting victims in 1991 , 6 , 001 people were wounded or killed in shootings a total of 2 , 154 people were slain by various means number of shootings up of the 3 , 902 shot from january through aug 26 , 1991 , about 10 percent , or 397 , were listed as bystanders , those not involved in the grievance behind the gunfire 118 were 16 and under and 279 were over 17 in the same period this year , 96 more people were shot 3 , 998 but considerably fewer of them , 233 , were bystanders , the figures showed 54 age 16 and under and 179 age 17 and over , or about 6 percent of the total officials had no ready explanation for the dip but studies have shown intermittent fluctuations within an overall rise since the mid1980 s chief borrelli and a department spokesman , det joseph gallagher , said there was no separate tabulation of bystander fatalities , although the department said in january 1990 that it was keeping such a tally it showed then that at least 24 bystanders were killed in 1989 , out of a total of 1 , 947 homicide victims but they said last week that while shootings , including those involving bystanders , were tallied there was no separate tabulation of bystander fatalities
for years , state and local governments have been battling for the legal right to force cataloguesales companies outside their borders to collect sales tax on orders shipped into their jurisdictions the cataloguesales industry has been fighting just as ferociously for the status quo , under which catalogue companies tax shipments only to states where they have stores , warehouses or some other physical presence a key lawsuit on this issue , the quill corporation v north dakota , is pending before the united states supreme court and was argued in january the justices took a harsh tone with lawyers for the catalogue industry there was blood on the floor , observed one taxlawnewsletter analyst that has prompted many on wall street to predict that a victory for the tax collectors is around the corner and that it will inflict substantial damage on the leading mailorder houses that view is easy to understand , for many catalogue companies are themselves predicting all sorts of plagues and devastation if they lose this battle but a few industry analysts and tax experts are beginning to suspect that , for wellestablished and highly automated merchants like lands' end and the lillian vernon corporation , an industry defeat in the quill case would look a lot like a tie and perhaps a little like a victory it will come as no surprise to anyone who staggers in from the mailbox these days that there are many thousands of catalogue and mailorder houses more than 7 , 200 of them as of 1987 , the most recent figures available from the census bureau new figures are expected from the bureau this year , and the betting among boneweary postal workers is that the number will have risen sharply some of those catalogues are produced by retailers , like talbots or j c penney , that have stores in almost every state and thus are already required to collect sales taxes there but the bulk of the catalogue flood flows from much smaller catalogueonly operations there is no doubt that a victory by the tax collectors would be a giant headache for most of the catalogue crowd , said harry e white , a tax lawyer and partner at milbank , tweed , hadley mccloy in new york sales tax rates and rules vary widely from place to place and change with great regularity california provoked a lot of chuckles last year with a tax that applied to snack foods but not to less frivolous comestibles but the rule provoked only tears of frustration at a gourmetfood catalogue house , mr white noted the licoriceflavored popcorn would probably be covered , but what about the prime filets mignon with seasoned butter \? similarly , new jersey does not tax clothing but levies a 7 percent tax on accessories some states impose the tax on the list price of the item , while others impose it on the total order , including delivery charges the burdens would be enormous , said chris armenante , a spokeswoman for the direct marketing association in new york the problem is even more acute in cases where the customer shops by mail , rather than by phone , and pays by check , rather than by credit card about 42 percent of the business , she said some of these problems can be solved by computer software , ms armenante acknowledged but the programs available today are expensive to purchase and to update , given the pace of change on the tax front in various states and none of the programs , she added , are able to scan an order and detect which items are taxable and which are not but daunting as this sales tax puzzle sounds , a closer look at lands' end and lillian vernon , two widely followed public mailorder houses , suggests that both are fully equal to the task indeed , both have recently upgraded their orderprocessing and administrative infrastructures lands' end has spent nearly 58 million in the last three years to build a new administrative center and buy new warehouse and computer equipment even before these advances , lands' end was viewed as one of the most efficient orderprocessors in the industry lillian vernon s new hightech distribution center in virginia beach , va , likewise is the envy of the mailbox marketplace not only are these two companies likely to survive the salestax headaches , they may actually benefit if the states win most analysts agree that catalogue clutter is a growing problem for the leaders in the industry , forcing them to shout louder to be heard in a crowded market but donald i trott , an analyst with dean witter , has been one of the few who have pointed out that a salestax defeat for the industry would probably reduce the competition the established companies will face and thus could lower their own promotional expenses certainly , that will put a premium on investing in tax knowledge and somehow translating that knowledge into the whole process and finding a way to do it simply and mechanically , said mr white , the tax lawyer and the giant companies are more likely to be able to afford to do that , he said david c hochberg , vice president for public affairs and a son of founder lillian vernon , said the new center is already reducing the company s handling costs and gives it a competitive edge on the sales tax front no one at lands' end would comment on the issue , but a retailing executive familiar with its operations noted that the company had been collecting taxes on shipments to california for more than two years , without experiencing anything that suggests it would lose business if forced to collect taxes elsewhere the two company s stock valuations match their market niches lands' end has seen its stock price rise to what some consider premium levels , although it still trades at roughly 21 times the average estimates for its earnings in the fiscal year that opened yesterday lillian vernon s stock , like most of what it sells , is more of a bargain , trading at just 12 times the earnings anticipated for the fiscal year that will begin at the end of this month table piling it on , shows what a sales tax adds to a mail order from lands' end and lillian vernon \( source lands' end lillian vernon \)
do you ever wonder what might be concealed by a translator s invisibility \? have you ever read a translation suspecting that the translator has left an indelible mark on the foreign text , but you ca n't detect it \? i myself have grown more obsessed recently , after translating a book of italian fiction i discovered , quite by accident , that the author had committed a crime , but invisibly , with none of his readers ever knowing the author is i u tarchetti \( 183969 \) , a shortlived but prolific italian writer whose work had never been translated into english i was especially attracted by his fantastic tales , and among them was one entitled the elixir of immortality it is treated by italian scholars as the first gothic tale written in italian , and i too was under this impression but then i unexpectedly came across a brief summary of it in a book by an english critic the critic gave a different title to the tale , the mortal immortal \( 1833 \) , and attributed it to mary shelley what italian readers thought was written by tarchetti turns out to be his italian translation of her english text , published as his own tale there can be no doubt tarchetti knew what he was doing in 1865 , after settling in milan to work near the burgeoning publishing industry , he began a meteoric career that burned out four years later , when he died at the age of 29 he wrote voluminously and at a furious pace , turning out fiction , poetry , music reviews , political columns , editorials and translations \( that is , acknowledged translations \) when he published his plagiarized translation of mary shelley s story in an italian newspaper in 1865 , he gave it a title that was a close rendering of shelley s , ii mortale immortale \( dall'inglese \) , but the parenthetical phrase really did n't explain what he was doing in 1868 , he became editor of another newspaper and reprinted his translation , although he masked its status as a reprint with a different title in neither paper did he indicate his story was a linebyline translation , or credit mary shelley once the shock of the discovery wore off , i felt driven to explain tarchetti s guilty act , not just in terms of his own life , but also in terms of my work as a translator \( was i his accomplice \? \) my research showed that there was no question of copyright infringement , or any loss of income for mrs shelley s estate \( she died in 1851 \) or for her english publisher at the time , neither english nor italian copyright law gave the author the exclusive right to license translations of her work in legal terms , shelley s text was in the public domain there was still the question of morality , which can also be recognized as an issue of cultural politics not only was tarchetti s plagiarism a lie , but it had the antifeminist effect of suppressing an instance of female authorship yet there is an irony here the mortal immortal satirizes patriarchal images of male power and female weakness by exaggerating them and assigning the tale to a comically inept narrator named winzy , who is the butt of the vain bertha s browbeatings how could an effort to bring shelley s feminism to a wider , foreign audience be branded simply antifeminist \? i figured that since tarchetti knew what he was doing , he had a reason for doing it he would have got more money if he could pass off the tale as his own , and he definitely needed it he was constantly hounded by debts , a result partly of his bohemian life style and partly of his mismanaged attempts to start his own newspapers once when he was down and out in parma , he posed as a famous professor of english and attracted a number of paying students it is the bohemianism , however , that points to the most compelling motive for tarchetti s crime in milan he associated with a group of writers , painters and composers who called themselves the scapigliatura patriots caught up in the democratic movements during the unification of italy , they saw style as a means of revolt , both in deviant behavior designed to shock bourgeois respectability \( scapigliato means disheveled \) and in outre experiments that opposed the italian cultural establishment the reigning monument of italian literature , alessandro manzoni s historical novel the betrothed , struck them as too conservative in its treatment of social problems , advising resignation before the powers that be the scapigliati wanted writing to foment social change , to take up the cause of workers , the poor and the disenfranchised , and they looked abroad for literary models tarchetti s gothic tales were clearly intended to bait the bourgeoisie they rejected good sense and decency to explore dream and insanity , violence and aberrant sexuality most interesting , they exhibit his practice of appropriating foreign texts in the gothic tradition , specific works by e t a hoffmann , edgar allan poe and theophile gautier tarchetti adapted fantastic motifs , reproduced scenes , translated sentences , even , as we now know , plagiarized yet these strategies resulted in strikingly inventive tales that addressed pressing social issues in italy tarchetti made his plagiarism of mary shelley serve this cultural agenda by introducing small but significant changes shelley s couple are evidently bourgeois bertha s parents , like mine , says winzy , were of humble life , yet respectable their love is frustrated when the orphaned bertha is adopted by the old lady of the near castle and becomes somewhat of a coquette in manner , perversely entertaining suitors but accepting none in shelley s tale , as in the feminist critique set forth by her mother , mary wollstonecraft , the aristocracy is considered the class in which women most readily assimilate the patriarchal image of themselves as the passive object of male desire tarchetti left this feminist critique unchanged except for the lovers' social position he deletes respectable and suggests they belong to the working class her parents were , like mine , of very humble rank i came to realize that the very act of plagiarism may have carried social significance for tarchetti it flouted bourgeois property relations and upset the distinctions on which the italian literary establishment was grounded not only did a translation pass for an original work and a translator for an author , but a feminist satire that celebrated occult science passed for the first gothic tale written in the language of manzoni s canonized novel tarchetti s text would n't have had the same impact if it had been identified as a translation he had to smuggle shelley s tale into italy as a text written originally in italian mary shelley , daughter of radical democrats and wife of a revolutionary poet , might have applauded tarchetti s plagiarism is a reminder that every translation exists in an equivocal relationship to the foreign text , never completely faithful , always somewhat free , never a perfect reproduction , always a supplement that loses and adds meanings every translator today is an acknowledged plagiarist , since the work of translation is to pass off a foreign text as one written originally in the translating language
tuneup for the real thing \? picture this a deadlocked convention , a jammed meeting hall , hundreds of delegates and supporters clamoring for tsongas , clinton or kerrey no one knows who the nominee will be and then , a moment of high drama up to the microphone , to deliver the keynote address , strides mario m cuomo this is all scheduled to happen this coming weekend , in fact governor cuomo has agreed to be the keynote speaker on saturday at a mock democratic convention held by students at washington and lee university in lexington , va the convention has been a quadrennial tradition at the school since 1908 it is always held for the party that does not control the white house , and it has an impressive record in forecasting the name of the party s actual nominee since 1952 the students have correctly prestaged the real event for every single convention except 1972 , when delegates selected edward m kennedy rather than the eventual nominee , george mcgovern so one big question is whether mr cuomo might just wow his student audience into giving him the nomination yes , on the second ballot , absolutely it s possible that will happen , said john donaldson , a senior who is majoring in history at the school and who is a coordinator of the event the students' voting is based on their research of likely voting patterns in each of the 50 states but mr donaldson said he believed that the convention could well be deadlocked among the current crop of declared candidates the delegates could then turn to mr cuomo , just like they might do in new york city , where the convention will be held in july , mr donaldson said another question is just why mr cuomo , whose national prominence skyrocketed after he delivered the keynote speech to the democratic convention in san francisco in 1984 , chose to deliver this particular keynote it comes just three days before a string of super tuesday primaries in the south , so could a student stampede to cuomo be a hint to voters that he s angling for a repetition in july \? or is he wistful for the glory days of 1984 \? or is he just doing it for the money \? \( he will receive a fee for his speech , though both his office and the student coordinators declined to reveal the amount \) past speakers at the event have included harry s truman , richard m nixon , jimmy carter and bill clinton , though none ever won the students' nomination in the same year he spoke asked whether mr cuomo was hoping to be the democratic nominee at the mock convention , that is his spokeswoman , anne w crowley , said , no comment meanwhile , it s on to lexington , and students there said the suspense was building colleague and kid brother politics may make strange bedfellows , but nick spano s little brother will just have to sleep on the couch michael j spano , 27 years old , was sworn in as a state assemblyman last week , filling the spot left vacant by the new mayor of yonkers , terence m zaleski he joined with his brother , state senator nicholas a spano , 38 , as the first pair of siblings in several decades to serve together in the legislature the younger mr spano could now be considered a political big shot back home , but a kid brother will always be a kid brother so not only is he camping out on the couch of the albany apartment that nicholas spano shares with assemblyman gregory p young of mount vernon , but he is already complaining that he has been put to work he made me take out the garbage , and i have to do the cooking , said michael spano he keeps throwing more jobs at me still , he quickly added , he is used to it there are no less than 16 spano siblings , 8 boys and 8 girls , of which nicholas is the oldest our father said it kind of had to be like the marines growing up in our house , explained michael , the fourth boy and eighth child in line you always had to answer to the older person a far more ticklish question could arise this fall , since there is a slight chance that michael spano , a republican , could find his district fused with that of mr young , a democrat in this case , it appears that blood is far thicker than a shared apartment lease nicholas spano , also a republican , said that he liked mr young and all but that he would clearly have to support his brother mr young laughingly berated michael spano for acting like a baby when told about his garbage complaint as for the prospect of campaigning against his roommate , mr young paused a moment and said , if it happens , the only fair solution will be for nick and mike to move out and leave me the apartment mrazek on tv on crime representative bob mrazek of long island started out his united states senate campaign as a longshot but he has picked up some steam in recent weeks by winning some strawpoll beauty contests among upstate democratic leaders and by reporting that he had 850 , 000 in cash on hand at the end of the year , more than any other democratic candidate now mr mrazek is about to begin his first television blitz , including a toughoncrime commercial to be shown in new york city that is apparently intended to draw a distinction between him and his four opponents for the nomination , all of whom are considered more liberal than he there is a growing army of violent young men on our streets , a solemn mr mrazek intones in the commercial they ca n't read or write all of them headed in the wrong direction mr mrazek proposes taking young criminals off the streets and giving them a second chance with motivational training and education programs that he would set up on abandoned army bases but while he describes this as a humane approach , he will have to contend with a charge from at least one of his opponents , the rev al sharpton , that the program is an attempt to isolate young blacks and to appeal to racist views mrazek aides dismiss the assertion as absurd we understand that some people will politicize the proposal , but to put this in a racial context is to miss the point completely , said brian lunde , a campaign consultant this is a program to help people , not divide them in another commercial , to be broadcast on long island and in the rochester and buffalo areas , mr mrazek tells viewers that south korea now has one of the strongest economies in the world and ought to pay the united states to have american troops stationed there we need the money here , he says a third commercial , which will play throughout the new york city area and in western new york , is more general and presents mr mrazek as a downtoearth figure who can change your life if voters make a leap of faith and elect him to the senate the mrazek campaign plans to spend about 400 , 000 for the commercials , mainly on cnn , headline news , espn and other nonnetwork stations on cabletelevision systems chart the ad campaign mrazek tough words on street crime script \( bob mrazek speaking \) before you get on the subway , do you put mug money in your pocket , or take your wedding band off \?

london , jan 21 the first batch of millions of secret documents culled from the communist party s archives in moscow are to be released this fall , beginning with the files collected by the party on major leaders of the bolshevik revolution , a british publishing company said today among the reams of material , to be made available on microfilm , are personal correspondence , police reports and biographical details meticulously collected by party archivists on leon trotsky , vyacheslav m molotov , andrei a zhdanov and other key members of lenin s inner circle , said officials of chadwyckhealey of cambridge , england , a publisher of university and research databases in an announcement , the company said it had reached an agreement with the russian government to microfilm the entire archives , which some have estimated include more than 70 million documents in turn , the russians will receive royalties on the sale of the microfilms although lenin s file is not among those being released , the documents include letters to lenin from his friend inessa armand , according to dr jana howlett , a historian at cambridge university who is an advisor to the russian archives and a consultant to chadwyckhealey the information in these files puts flesh on major historical figures about whom we have really known very little until now , said dr howlett she has examined many files but has not yet evaluated their contents , which include more than 300 , 000 documents in the first batch show 'more internal dissent' she said they would also give a much sharper picture of the period when stalin was struggling to control the party they show that there was more internal dissent in party circles than we had until now imagined , she said in winning the contract , chadwyckhealey has gained the publishing rights to the scholarly equivalent of a runaway best seller a documentary record of soviet communism from its beginnings under lenin to its collapse after the unsuccessful hardline coup last august sir charles chadwyckhealey , the company s founder and chief executive , said the first batch of microfilmed documents would cost about 8 , 000 to 10 , 000 scholars have described the archives as one of the great untapped resources on 20thcentury history , and have been eagerly awaiting access to the materials since boris n yeltsin , the russian president , seized them last summer to prevent their destruction during the failed coup last year james h billington , the librarian of congress , described the archives as a gold mine for historians and appealed to russian officials to make the materials available expeditiously and responsibly no timetable for releases officials at chadwyckhealey said they had no timetable for future releases since the documents must first be organized and catalogued by scholars dr howlett said some scholars have already had access to the materials , but until now , virtually none have been published a small portion of the material was pulped before president yeltsin was able to seize control of the archives , dr howlett said and unfortunately a few documents have also been removed for sale on the black market but in general , she described the archives as surprisingly intact it was a wonderful surprise , she said , describing her first encounters with the files all of these items were collected , sealed as secret and left in the files , presumably because the party never imagined anyone would see what is inside some files she has seen include detailed indexes of the personal documents inside but she said the file on trotsky , who was assassinated in 1940 , was so secret that party archivists were never even allowed to index it
despite the presence of ed bradley , street stories , the latest entry from cbs news , shows none of the ambition and little of the punch of 60 minutes it is closer to 48 hours , which inspired it , but the new program does not try for the manysided reporting of 48 hours at its occasional best this judgment , based on the first of four specials , to be shown tonight at 9 on channel 2 , may be premature , but for now that s all there is three of the opening program s four segments were available for review , and all have to do with crime drunken driving in fort lauderdale , fla , gaybashing in houston , and the performance of a tough judge in chattanooga , tenn if you feel you 've been here before , you 've been watching too much television the reporters are bernard goldberg and harold dow , 48 hours regulars , and bob mckeown mr bradley s comeon role of host is as undemanding as dan rather s on 48 hours viewers who do not expect too much or mind seeing more of what they have already seen plenty of may not be disappointed within the tight limits of 12minute segments , the reporting is professional , the production coherent the camera gets close to people and places , and there is no dawdling although the material is far from startling , fresh elements do slip in for example , the reactions of houston police officers assigned to play the parts of homosexuals in a decoy operation they appear to have learned something of how it feels to be part of a vulnerable minority that story , too , offers a chilling comment by one of the young men whose idea of a night out is to beat up on homosexuals they do n't seem like real people they 're like their own race in the chattanooga segment , it is amusing to watch judge walter m williams delivering streetwise sermons from the bench and sentencing young offenders to go out and earn a high school diploma but street stories , which cbs presumably hopes will fill a regular slot , is not a big step forward for television news instead of reaching for something original and chancy , it it is obviously trying to duplicate previous successes given the paucity on the tube of serious investigative reporting and analysis of issues that trouble the nation , another onceoverlightly program that promises to be heavy on crime is not much of an accomplishment judge williams would probably lecture the producers on the difference between journalism and marketing and send them back to school street stories first in a series of four cbs news magazine specials bernard goldberg , victoria corderi , harold dow and bob mckeown , correspondents ed bradley , anchor bob lange , senior producer catherine lasiewicz , executive producer tonight at 9 on cbs

millions will save a few cents every time they buy orange juice , a few dollars on shirts and sweaters and a few hundred dollars on automobiles because of the north american free trade agreement concluded in washington yesterday all told , if congress approves , consumers will save billions but none of the savings will come labeled courtesy of the trade agreement and few consumers will know to be grateful on the other side of the ledger , however , the losers , though few , will be highly visible and vocal some factories in the textile , glass and automobile industries will shut down , throwing workers onto unemployment lines they 'll surely express angry opposition when the agreement arrives in congress for approval it comes as no surprise that senator donald riegle and representative david bonior , both from autodependent michigan , are already leading protectionist opposition the danger is that congress will bend to the will of these few visible losers , in the process trashing the common wealth , the huge cumulative gains for everyone else the better way to proceed the way president bush has promised is to embrace the agreement , embrace the benefits of free trade but also help dislocated workers now it s squarely up to congress to do both protect the many winners and the few losers alike the agreement would link the us , mexico and canada in a 6 trillion trading bloc , the world s largest it would gradually eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers the agreement would open mexico s markets to us exports of banking and investment services , petrochemicals , transportation and telecommunications equipment , insurance and other goods and services now blocked by mexican tariffs or quotas mr bush delivered on his promise to build in safeguards for us environmental and health standards because us tariffs are already low , the agreement would do more to increase us exports to mexico than vice versa by one estimate , the agreement would create about 300 , 000 jobs in us export industries , while eliminating about 100 , 000 in industries displaced by imports but such numbers can be misleading the trade agreement wo n't affect the total number of jobs in the us , only their allocation there will be more in banking and petrochemicals , fewer in textiles and glass that means production will take place where it s cheapest , with the savings passed along to north american consumers dislocated workers , many in lowpaid occupations , will meanwhile need relocation assistance , retraining allowances , tuition assistance and guaranteed medical insurance the next question is who pays , and the best answer would be for congress to do so out of general revenues but if that s politically impossible , richard gephardt , the house majority leader , has come up with a useful alternative a tax on mexicanus trade at first glance , it might seem contradictory to tax trade in order to free trade , especially given mr gephardt s reputation as a protectionist if the crossborder tax is kept small and temporary , however , his idea makes sense asking traders to pay some of the costs of the trade agreement is a tolerable price for congressional approval the trick will be to keep a good idea from being turned into a protectionist weapon the minority of losers deserves protection from harm , but not at the expense of the common wealth
albany , march 12 gov mario m cuomo and legislative leaders reached a tentative agreement today on budget cuts and prisonsentencing changes that would resolve the financial trouble in the state s criminaljustice system , but leave its prisons crowded beyond capacity the prison system is currently at 118 percent of its designed capacity , and corrections officials predicted in january that there would be 6 , 000 more prisoners than beds by the spring of 1993 that left negotiators with two options build more 750inmate prisons at about 65 million apiece , or agree to major changes in the state s mandatory sentencing laws that would send thousands fewer people into the state prison system the agreement they finally reached falls somewhere in the middle it includes no money for new prisons , but calls for a watereddown version of the sentencing revisions that will open space for some , but not all , of the 6 , 000 extra projected inmates officials have varying estimates on how many inmates will have to be assigned to dormitorystyle double bunk beds under the current plan , but it seems clear that doublebunking , which no one likes , will have to continue i'm pleased that there s a commitment to not build prisons , but i think all they 've done is kind of ducked the problem for awhile , said robert gangi , executive director of the correctional association of new york , who favors changes in sentencing until they make some changes , there s going to be extraordinary pressure that builds within the prisons grudging party compromise driven mostly by budget considerations , the plan represents a grudging compromise between upstate republicans , who have traditionally supported building new prisons , and governor cuomo and the assembly democrats , who favored a sweeping overhaul of the state s mandatory sentencing laws for secondfelony offenders neither group seemed unhappy with the middleoftheroad solution , but neither seemed particularly pleased l paul kehoe , a republican from wayne county who is chairman of the senate committee on crime and correction , acknowledged that there was no money for new prisons this year but left open the possibility that the state might have to build some in the future i personally think they have overestimated the ability of these cuts to cut down on the prison population , he said assemblyman daniel l feldman , the brooklyn democrat who is chairman of the assembly correction committee , said he was relieved that an agreement had been reached but sorry about the senate s refusal to go along with the democrats' proposals for change plea for 'logical approach' do i think this is going to solve the system s longterm problems \? no , mr feldman said they 're still refusing to adopt what to my mind is the most logical approach the changes agreed to today include easing eligibility requirements for some drugtreatment programs making more inmates eligible for the state s shockincarceration program , an intensive , militarystyle regimen , and giving judges the discretion to defer prison sentences for nonviolent , firsttime offenders for up to one year in all , officials said , the proposals are expected to open 1 , 700 to 2 , 000 beds in the next year and to close a 90 million to 100 million deficit in the criminaljustice budget governor cuomo and legislative leaders are struggling to close a 48 billion gap in the 30 billion state budget by the start of the fiscal year on april 1 today s tentative agreement on criminal justice , after wednesday s accord on transportation , allowed negotiators to focus on two of the thorniest issues in the budget medicaid and education after meeting with mr cuomo today , the legislators said they were optimistic about enacting the budget on time , something that has not been done in the last seven years electionyear incentive we made great progress in every area , said assembly speaker saul weprin , a queens democrat mr cuomo was less sanguine than either mr weprin or the senate majority leader , ralph j marino , a republican from oyster bay , li but he praised the two leaders for being assiduous in their negotiations and said that electionyear politics should spur a timely budget none of them ever faced a reality like the one they 're facing now a clear dissatisfaction on the part of the voters , an absolutely apparent threat to get any incumbent , especially one who demonstrates an incapacity to function at the most basic level getting a budget done , he said mr cuomo has proposed more than 11 billion in savings in the state s rapidly growing medicaid and welfare programs , but months of talks have failed to produce an agreement on how to produce those savings senate republicans prefer to cut eligibility levels and services assembly democrats want to place a larger burden on hospitals , nursing homes and other healthcare groups in education , the governor has proposed cutting state aid to schools by 168 million , a relatively minor amount when compared to recent schoolaid cuts but the legislative leaders have said that they would like to avoid school aid cuts altogether as their members go home to campaign
to the editor the los angeles riots have roused the consciousness of american taxpayers on crime , guns and selfdefense it has also given washington the moment to break the stalemate between the pro and antigun factions this stalemate contributes to an ineffective system of gun control that allows criminals unlimited access to guns the principle you depict in treat guns like cars \( editorial , may 16 \) universal gun licensing and regulation , requiring fingerprint back ground checks \( with instantaneous checks as an option \) , education and safety training is a sensible solution such a law could satisfy the demands of both the national rifle association and handgun control inc , and win the endorsement of law enforcement agencies to treat guns like cars , we should recognize that in this country people are licensed to drive , while cars must be registered and insured only when driven on public roads those who choose to carry a handgun should be licensed and their guns registered i have advocated a federal license to carry a pistol for years a federal handgun permit would establish national standards and controls , eliminate police abuses of discretion , benefit law enforcement and the public , and generate revenue for the government through licensing fees and firearmseducation and safetytraining programs , and none of this at taxpayer expense stephen d'andrilli new york , may 21 , 1992 the writer heads guardian group international , a security agency drawing
geneva as the nations of the world map a plan of action to preserve earth s environment , their meetings have been bogged down by the old battles between the wealthy , industrial countries of the north and the poor , underdeveloped countries of the south the disputes are mirrored in thick stacks of papers , 20 , 000 pages sent in by 121 governments , that are now being examined in an elegant villa on the outskirts of geneva they are lists of the world s green worries , each country s view of its most pressing environmental concerns the papers form the substance of discussions here and at the united nations headquarters in new york in preparation for the united nations conference on environment and development , scheduled for june in rio de janeiro , exactly 20 years after an environmental conference in stockholm united nations officials sorting through the reports here say that since the stockholm meeting , governments have come a long way in thinking , arguing and absorbing the notion that the planet cannot cope with indefinite abuse 'give us money' but united nations organizers here have expressed anguish because the meetings to prepare for rio have revived the old clashes between rich and poor , this time in an environmental context a united nations official who has attended most planning sessions said much of the debate was confrontational , characterizing the message from developing countries as give us money you are rich we are poor the official , a european , said there was no debate about what developing countries should do at home the language emphasizes more and more the need for a new international economic order , she said at the parisbased organization for economic cooperation and development , an organization of the 24 industrialized nations that are deeply involved in environmental planning , senior officials seem as gloomy people are despairing that the rio meeting will be dominated by a northsouth confrontation , said bill long , director of environment affairs at the organization we hoped we could forget about placing blame and work on problems together negotiating tactics representatives from developing countries make light of such accusations , saying their confrontational postures and language are only negotiating tactics to get much needed funds for the first time in more than a decade , the developing countries have an issue where they have some real leverage , said an official from a caribbean nation they had none during the debt negotiations but they are part of the environment , so they have leverage now and they are using it it s their negotiating strategy poorer nations , he said , see leverage because the north , the main polluter , wants them to cut emissions , stop deforesting and make other changes but to adapt to those changes , they argue , they need funding and technology the reports here are being used to draft an earth charter for the rio summit meeting on making development more compatible with the environment organizers also hope for a binding treaty to cut emissions that can cause climate change and a similar treaty on the preservation of species a rising awareness since most of the reports have been prepared with the help of private organizations , they reflect how concern for the environment has over the last two decades galvanized thousands of citizens' groups and mobilized scientists , lawyers , economists and politicians who are pressing for change confrontation has been part of preparations for the summit meeting since the united nations resolution in 1989 calling for it attributed the planet s environmental problems to unsustainable production patterns of the industrial countries at first , planners wanted to hold the meeting in stockholm , as in 1972 but brazil , stung by intense international criticism over the largescale destruction of its amazon rainforest , lobbied to serve as host for the meeting and won enough backing brazil s purpose , officials said at the time , was to improve its image brazil and other developing nations also said that holding the conference in the third world was symbolically important and would help them put the blame for most environmental destruction and pollution back where it belonged , in the industrial world the strategy has put rich countries on the defensive on a host of issues a planned treaty to protect and manage the world s tropical forests , which are vital regulators of the global climate and which harbor most of the planet s species , has already been shelved brazil and other countries demanded that such a treaty be extended to all forests and had the word tropical removed by extending the debate to all forests , there was not enough time for a binding treaty , a united nations official said the best we can hope for is a declaration to save the rainforests another planned high point of the summit meeting , a treaty to protect the world s animal and plant species , is being fundamentally changed in the past , nature has always been considered part of the common heritage but now developing countries want the convention to state that biological resources are under a country s sovereignty and are no longer to be considered as a common heritage of humankind
washington , feb 15 senator wendell h ford , democrat of kentucky and senate majority whip , said today that he would be willing to serve on a committee of democratic leaders to draft a candidate for president if none of the democrats wins a commanding lead in the new hampshire primary in an interview , mr ford said there was concern that the party s candidates were failing to capture the allegiance of voters in new hampshire mr ford said he would support drafting senator lloyd bentsen of texas , who ran in 1988 as the democratic nominee for vice president , to be the party s 1992 presidential nominee mr ford said that he had not talked to senator bentsen about it but that the texas lawmaker s name was one that always comes up senator bentsen has maintained this year that he has no plans to run for president his press secretary , jack r devore jr , said today that senator bentsen also believed that drafting a candidate was not wise he has said on several occasions that people are n't drafted to run for president , mr devore said they have to want to run for the office
to the editor re the youngest , cruelest justice \( editorial , feb 27 \) i was struck that on the highest court in our country those who are in prison should be seen as scum , not worthy of having their legal rights recognized i recently heard the rev carl kabat , one of the plowshares eight , talk about his prison term for civil disobedience \( his release was covered by german and swiss reporters but none in the united states \) he is convinced prisons should be abolished because the inmates are treated worse than dogs , making the prisons not a human place he recommends spending the money to educate and retrain people convicted of crimes , not just to warehouse them money spent that way would produce rehabilitated citizens rather than reinforced criminals , whose selfimages are ground into dust and swept into more heightened rage against society s methods another point father kabat made is that there is no correctional system at federal prisons even the talents of other inmates are not tapped for classes if someone volunteers to teach , his volunteer students are not scheduled for time to attend i was reminded of what the prisoners in the occupied territories of israel told us \( former prisoners \) prison was their university they occupied their time by grouping around knowledgeable people and learned mathematics , languages , history , politics , military strategy , philosophy and religions they came out with knowledge and selfesteem to become leaders in freedom for their people we need to take their example and drastically revise our illnamed reform system so that it rehabilitates constructively marie molloy des moines , feb 29 , 1992
a group of new york city police officers charged last week in a cocaine ring that reached from brooklyn to long island devised careful strategies to outmaneuver supervisors , investigators and even suspicious fellow officers , suffolk county investigators said yesterday the officers never took a step without first checking schedules of superior officers in their precincts or watching out for particular officers who they feared might be on to them , investigators said and they constantly altered the days and hours of their transactions to elude detection , said the investigators , who spoke on the condition of anonymity indeed , the investigators said wiretapping of phone conversations at the officers' homes over the last few months suggested that besides running a drug operation for the last year , the officers were also running a kind of countersurveillance system , intended to foil the department s elaborate methods for weeding out corrupt officers while not divulging the content of any specific conversation , an investigator said one officer laughed about the inability of a particular supervisor to uncover their operation everything they said showed that these were smart officers , the investigator said smart , i mean , about the street smart about their own department questions on surveillance the arrests last thursday of the officers three from the 94th precinct in greenpoint , two from the 73d precinct in bedfordstuyvesant and one retired officer have raised concerns about the quality of the department s surveillance techniques and whether corrupt officers have learned to beat the system in fact , department officials have acknowledged that they already had concerns about one officer , michael dowd , stemming from previous incidents yesterday , commissioner lee p brown said that the internal affairs division had begun searching , through computers and other methods , for other officers who have raised supervisors' suspicions before and might warrant special monitoring only six days ago , in the wake of the arrests , mr brown had played down the need for any change in normal surveillance procedures let us see if there are any similar characteristics of anybody , he said in an interview yesterday we have the ability to do that , to see if there is anything that might precipitate a concern after the knapp commission was established to combat police corruption in the early 1970 s , checks and balances were established to guard against institutionalized criminal wrongdoing those systems are still in place , mr brown said over a period of years , different commissioners have added to those systems and refined them that s what we 're doing right now taking a look at the problem that surfaced just last week and determining what more can we be doing mr brown said that he had not lost confidence in the current system of safeguards , which places internal investigators full time in the precinct houses , assigns integrity control officers to the precincts and recruits volunteer officers to act as special agents for the internal affairs division but none of those layers trapped the officers in the current case instead , investigators said , they were more or less stumbled across during an investigation of a long islandbased cocaine operation by the suffolk county police department while listening in on a phone conversation about two months ago , an investigator said , detectives heard one participant , kenneth eurell , refer to something involving a police precinct that conversation , said robert f ewald , chief of the narcotics bureau of the suffolk county district attorney s office , eventually led to surveillance of the other officers mr eurell , 31 , a retired officer from the 75th precinct in east new york , brooklyn , was arrested a week ago as he sniffed cocaine in the home of a drug distributor , the police said that same night , 47 civilians were arrested , as well as the five active officers , thomas mascia , 29 years old , and mr dowd , 30 , partners at the 94th precinct and philip carlucci , 30 , kevin hembery , 27 , and daniel eurell , 26 , kenneth s cousin , officers at the 73d precinct four out on bail the five active officers are free on bail kenneth eurell had not made bail last night citing the wiretapped phone conversations , investigators said they believed that mr dowd was the most important figure in keeping the brooklyn part of the operation running smoothly and that kenneth eurell provided a vital connection to distributors on long island mr dowd and the other active officers pinpointed certain supervisors as basically the ones to keep an eye on , one investigator said when the officers went to a bodega to buy drugs , they typically did it about 12 30 am and out of uniform investigators said this was convenient because all the officers worked the 4 pm to midnight shift and because they believed that they could find gaps in surveillance as close to the change in shift as possible varying the routine but sometimes , the investigators said , the suspects made the transactions in uniform and carried the cocaine with them they always varied their routine in transporting the drugs to their connections on long island , sometimes delivering them directly from brooklyn and at other times keeping the drugs at home for a few days investigators said mr dowd , who had been disciplined at times for driving a patrol car out of uniform and keeping inaccurate logs , might have taken those actions to try to avoid detection in any case , investigators said , the phone conversations suggested that the officers , while careful , also became a bit arrogant in their scheming one of them , an investigator said , laughed a bit when someone told him to beware of so and so with the case before a grand jury and indictments expected next week , new york city police officials were trying to determine how the officers managed to avoid the web of supervisors and surveillance , particularly when there were already concerns about mr dowd department officials confirmed part of a report in newsday on wednesday that mr dowd was considered by the department to be on the periphery of a narcotics scandal in the 75th precinct in 1988 , and that before his arrival at the 94th precinct in february 1990 , his supervisors suspected him of having a cocaine problem this agency learns from things that happen , commissioner brown said it s the very culture of the agency to look at why it happened
seville , spain , july 23 for the most part , the arts offerings at expo '92 here are properly big and populist except for the higherflown events in the teatro de la maestranza , an opera house off the expo grounds , most expo arts are designed for a broad public , take place outdoors and compete successfully with the bustling cacophony of the world s fair itself on the surface , one of expo s most unusual arts items filled that bill perfectly entitled prayer for the age of aquarius , it was a twohour ballet with oratorioscaled musical forces a mahlersized orchestra , four vocal soloists and chorus the spectacle enlisted an international , mostly eastern european assemblage , from the composer sofia gubaidulina to the conductor mstislav rostropovich , the kirov ballet , the orchestra of the schleswigholstein music festival in germany , a \( formerly soviet \) georgian choreographer and designer , the latvian chorus of riga and a latvian and russian quintet of solo singers and narrator and its theme the spiritual evolution of humanity , with christopher columbus as one manifestation thereof seemed to suit expo , given the fair s emphasis on human discovery and on the 500th anniversary of columbus s arrival in the new world in practice , however , the expo performance wednesday night was a muddle , despite laudable elements and while some of the failings had to do with the circumstances of the performance , many of them lay in the conception of the enterprise itself the project was organized by valentin proczynski , an argentine of polish descent now based in monaco mr proczynski thought up the idea of , as he put it , a kind of sacred dance on the aquarius theme , and then set about enlisting performers stepped back to watch' miss gubaidulina , born in 1931 , is a tatar composer who spent her maturity in moscow , though she lives much of the time now near hamburg , germany she was unwilling to compose a major new score for mr proczynski s project , but felt that two recently completed pieces of concert music the 35minute orchestral pro et contra , composed in 1989 for the louisville \( ky \) symphony , and the 40minute allelujah for soloists , chorus and orchestra , commissioned by the 1990 berlin festival might be suitable she added a 12minute finale , lauda , and then , she said , stepped back to watch the experiment take place miss gubaidulina s score is religious but not doctrinally explicit it incorporates an orthodox christian hymn and passages of her choosing from the apocalyptic book of revelations from the gospel according to st john mr proczynski and his georgian collaborators proceeded to create a scenario about the emergence and triumph of christianity there is a fleeting reference to columbus , and none to the age of aquarius , at least overtly all this prompted questions as to an underlying christian agenda the kirov ballet is linked with the universal ballet academy in washington , which in turn is supported by the rev sun myung moon s unification church but mr proczynski denied that the church had anything to do with the project 'worldwide musical festival' prayer for the age of aquarius , first seen in genoa , italy , in december , is but one part of a far larger series of arts events mr proczynski has put together , what he calls a first worldwide musical festival under the title old and new indian ways in mr proczynski s elaborate brochure , this is supposed to unite excellence of music , social resonance and spiritual orientation columbus s voyage , mr proczynski s brochure proceeds to explain , heralded new ways of salvation toward the third millennium in the aquarius era the program of the festival being a musical door , the brochure continues , an illustration to this event where the music joins its superlative values through philosophy , art , religion and spirituality mr rostropovich and miss gubaidulina deferred all questions of inner meaning and financial underpinning to mr proczynski they did agree that spiritual values are important , especially for slavic peoples denied education for centuries and denied religious freedom under communism miss gubaidulina clearly aspires to more than mere musical abstraction , having carefully notated a part , ad libitum and not used here , for a color organ , a keyboard device that projects washes of color corresponding to specific musical passages , in the manner of the russian composer and mystic scriabin but though she seems eager to pursue staged projects , she sounded nonplused at what she called the limitations created by the imposition of a single meaning onto concert music she had reason to feel nonplused what mr proczynski and his choreographer , georgi aleksidze , have fashioned looks like socialist realism with the imagery transferred from tractors and five year plans to the bible there were adam and eve , a serpent , an archangel , the savior , mary magdalene , judas , herod , salome , the virgin mary , an angelic boy soprano \( juris vitums \) and adult male singers dressed in blond wigs and flowing robes , carrying scores for ready reference and there was a stream of rather lurid slide projections by teimuraz mourvanidze , projected behind the action
it has been three weeks now since a political fight between new york city and albany halted the buses that carry thousands of disabled children to the city s private preschools , and zachary emmer s carefully structured routine has fallen apart his mother , sharon , has juggled her schedule and a baby daughter trying to take him to his school in queens some days she makes it some days she does not zachary , who is 4 years old and autistic , does n't understand what has gone wrong the city s blaming the state , and the state s blaming the city , his mother , sharon emmer , said and the children and the parents are suffering the children are not getting to school because the city let its contracts with the private bus companies that transport them expire three weeks ago , as a complex bureaucratic dispute erupted between the city and the state over the method of awarding those contracts a political showdown the fight over the issue of statemandated competitive bidding has simmered for years , but while tight budgets have both governments looking for ways to trim costs , it has escalated into a political showdown over 72 million that the city says the state owes it for the cost of busing the children left stranded in the middle are 7 , 500 children who are 3 to 5 years old and have a range of physical , mental and emotional disabilities for many of these preschoolers , particularly those from families with single or working parents , the buses represent their sole link to the education and therapy that build a sense of normality in their young , difficult lives for almost three weeks , no therapy , no nothing , said laverne fox , whose 4yearold son , tavell , attends classes at the united cerebral palsy of new york s manhattan children s center on east 23d street he sleeps all day he s bored he keeps saying , 'the bus broke down , the bus broke down' efforts continue in albany to get the buses running , but enrollment has fallen by as much as 80 percent at virtually all of the 138 private programs for disabled preschoolers in the city , according to margery ames , the executive director of the interagency council , an organization that represents about half of the programs with so few children attending , classes and activities have been disrupted even for those who can make it , and many parents and teachers have become increasingly worried that while the city and state bicker , the children , at critical stages of physical and psychological therapy , could suffer serious setbacks in their development transporting disabled preschoolers to private programs is mandated by the federal government , but the cost about 42 million for each of the last two years is shared by the city and the state in 1986 , the legislature passed a law requiring local governments to award contracts through competitive bids lawmakers believed that competition would insure lower costs and prevent corruption in the awarding of contracts to the bus companies , several of which have been tied to organized crime the city refused , saying that it could set a lower price with the bus companies and that competitive bidding would only increase the cost because of the specialized nature of busing these students for three years , the state ignored the city s noncompliance and paid its half , but since 1989 , the state has withheld payment , saying it will do so until the city seeks competitive bids by declining to renew contracts with the bus companies , which expired on dec 31 and were extended to april 30 , the city has forced the issue it is demanding that the state reimburse the city 42 million for its share the last two years and 30 for the current one before it signs new contracts john t bozzella , the city s director of state legislative affairs , who has taken part in negotiations with state budget officials over the dispute , said the state s bidding law is overly onerous and ridiculous because it does not recognize the city s peculiar circumstances he said that the last time the city put busing contracts out for bids , in 1979 , the bus companies went on strike money already budgeted the city s board of education has included 42 million of the 72 million owed by the state into its new budget and faces cuts in its programs without it there s no line in the sand , mr bozzella said of the city s decision to demand the money from the state this is not the city being greedy this is the city of new york fighting the good fight on behalf of the board of education , the parents , the bus drivers and everybody else if it fails , teachers get cut , classes get cut robert lowry , an assistant secretary to gov mario m cuomo , said the governor s office , the legislature and the city had reached an agreement that would exempt the city from the bidding law in this case , but the money remained an obstacle and negotiations continued we do n't owe the city 72 million , mr lowry said they understood the law and they did n't comply the state senate is expected to vote as soon as today on a bill , introduced by senator guy j velella , a bronx republican , that would not only exempt the city from the bidding requirement , but also repay the city over the next three years while senator velella said the bill would pass , a similar bill in the assembly has gone nowhere parents plead for resolution as the dispute dragged on , parents , teachers and drivers have held rallies at city hall and the state capitol , and badgered lawmakers with pleas for a resolution during governor cuomo s monthly radio show on wcbsam last week , he fielded angry questions about the dispute from two callers the city , the governor responded testily , is trying to use the children to leverage money out

if i am not for myself the liberal betrayal of the jews by ruth r wisse 225 pp new york the free press 2295 we fell victim to our faith in mankind , our belief that humanity had set limits to the degradation and persecution of one s fellow men so wrote alexander donat , a survivor of the warsaw ghetto and treblinka and the author of the holocaust kingdom , a book about the jews of europe at the time when the nazis and their collaborators began herding them into cattle cars mr donat s words capture the thrust of ruth wisse s new book , if i am not for myself the liberal betrayal of the jews it is her contention that liberalism , the very political ideology that would seem to provide shelter and promise for the jews , was their undoing in the 1930 s and 40 s and is in our day as well by liberalism , ms wisse , who teaches english and yiddish literature at mcgill university in montreal , means a belief in progress , rationality , freedom , cultural pluralism and the rule of law liberals trust that all human problems are amenable to negotiated solutions , that all people are united in a spirit of brotherhood , she writes they detest the use of force , not only for the damage it causes but because in admitting the limits of reason it throws humankind back to a more primitive stage of civilization the pure liberal spirit precludes the possibility of intractable hatred or intransigent political will for this reason , she says , liberalism could not protect jews from the nazis by necessity , she continues , liberals had to be unsympathetic to the fate of the jews , not because of any personal antipathy but because the national fate of the jews contradicted their view of the world and called into question their deepest assumptions because of the jews' political vulnerability , they had no allies in europe , not even in such opponents of antisemitism as the marxists in our day , ms wisse writes , the arabs , recognizing the remarkable political durability of repudiating the jewish people and their religion , have joined the campaign the arab success in the world arena actually increased , she contends , when they exchanged the language of the right for the language of the left , presenting israel as the bloodthirsty exploiter of impoverished innocent arab masses since democratic society does not want to perceive itself as heartless or collaborationist , she continues , those who court favor with the arabs have to deny the war against the jewish state or else justify their betrayal of the jews in a language of moral convenience the tilt toward the arabs has the code name of evenhandedness as long as ms wisse sticks to this part of her thesis , her argument is convincing and chilling however , she hopes to indict for even more heinous crimes those jews who , in her opinion , have had the lack of judgment to champion traditional liberal values according to ms wisse , as long as israel brought jews outside israel the dowry of international good will , the relationship was untroubled but when those jews were faced with arab propaganda against israel , they grew nervous , their insecurities blossomed and , as avowed liberals , they turned their backs on the jewish homeland there are large holes in her argument in contending with so relentless an assault as the campaign mounted by the arabs , she writes , many jews grow weary , and the very mention of antisemitism draws a yawn this is an astonishing claim to make the majority of jewish institutions in america successfuly continue to appeal to jews for funds through no other issue than the threat of antisemitism ms wisse also creates something of a straw man to bolster her thesis she speaks of the nervous jew who feels his jewishness to be a burden or knows very little about it , or who in marrying a nonjewish wife and moving into higher business or banking circles gradually left his jewishness behind , like an old skin she characterizes this person as a corporate director , a queasy jewish board member who tries to solve the problem of his ambivalence toward israel by defining himself as a liberal but this socalled board member does not exist anywhere in the real world if such an individual had nothing to do with his judaism , then israel and its wrongdoings would n't cause a blip on his personal radar if this person , as portrayed here , did exist , he would most likely be a committed member of the jewish community and would give of his time , money and expertise to a myriad of jewish causes there are much more dangerous threats to jewish cohesiveness and identity than the very small number of disaffected jewish liberals whom ms wisse criticizes she has clearly overestimated their number and influence to beef up her argument and because she s gunning for them , she misses a far more subtle danger the fact that the very board member who is totally committed to israel actually may harbor an ambivalent attitude toward the jewish state , believing deep in his heart that only losers go to israel in fact , for all the vaunted centrality of israel in the lives of american jews , the actual number who visit the jewish state is pitifully small , perhaps 15 or 20 percent ms wisse s analysis of israel also seems skewed it must be stressed that the split in the israeli population is not between secular and religious jews , she writes , since some of the most idealistic recruits for the defense forces come from the ranks of the modern orthodox yeshivas in fact , the conflict between religious and secular jews in israel has deepened and has reached a poisonous level many secular israelis are angered by the repeated political attempts of the ultraorthodox to avoid military service through religious deferments ms wisse also wants to deny that the left in israel has any legitimacy but the recent israeli election undoes her argument much of the philosophy espoused by such leftliberal novelists as amos oz , a b yehoshua and david grossman all of them targets of ms wisse s venom contributed to labor s victory and it was not only leftist voters who put labor back into power in fact , according to most analysts , the victory was aided by the defection of certain traditional supporters from the likud camp needy sephardic jews and recently arrived russian immigrants who might have been expected to back the more conservative likud party apparently felt that it was no longer prudent for government money to be spent in the west bank rather than on their needs , so they voted for a change of policy none of these lapses in ms wisse s argument , however , should overshadow the nearepigrammatic brilliance of many of her insights to quote only one instance despite the unparalleled success of antisemitism , few university departments of political science , sociology , history or philosophy bother to analyze the single european political ideal of the past century that nearly realized its ends this book should be read not only for its potent indictment of liberalism s failings the work also stands as a warning to all jews of a clear and everpresent danger
horseheads , ny along route 17 here on the way to elmira lies a riddle as big as the sphinx bigger , actually the sprawling 15 millionsquarefoot building covers almost as much ground as the pentagon , which it resembles many residents believe the unused property , which belongs to the great atlantic and pacific tea company , aka a p , is run more secretively than the department of defense why this building , once the largest food processing plant in the world , has remained vacant for 10 years is a mystery it baffles elected officials , real estate analysts and even some prospective buyers , who see the building as a place where a new owner or tenant could create jobs offers and dark suspicions it has obsessed elmira s 34 , 000 residents they view the question so passionately that the chemung county executive , g thomas tranter jr , was elected to office in 1990 on a campaign pledge to travel to a p s headquarters in montvale , nj , and confront its chairman , james wood a little like the film maker michael moore stalking the chairman of general motors , roger smith , in the documentary roger and me \( in montvale , mr tranter got only as far as the chief financial officer , fred corrado \) it has been very frustrating , mr tranter said this has been the biggest puzzle in this community for many years a p insists it desperately wants to sell the property , but so far the company has rejected all offers almost all the town s residents harbor dark suspicions that the company has secret reasons for keeping its fortresslike property empty they view the matter as a contemporary grimm s fairy tale , pitting their community against a vast multinational corporate empire to outsiders , the struggle is a textbook case of how the interests of absentee corporate landlords can clash with those of a community , even one as soberly conservative and probusiness as chemung county there are many theories about why a p has not sold the building , none of them wholly persuasive , but in the elmira area they fall into two main schools of thought venality or indifference it s a tax writeoff for them , dawn genungdunn , a saleswoman at the j c penney store in the arnot mall , said disdainfully maybe it makes sense to a big corporation , she added , but to people who need jobs it s frustrating maybe , corporate myopia variations on the money motive abound marty muggleton , assistant director of southern tier economic growth , a local economic development agency , suggested a coverup if it s on their books for 25 million , and they sell it for 14 , he said conspiratorially , ceo s could lose their jobs senator alfonse m d'amato , who appealed directly to mr wood to lease space in the building to xerox , said he also believed the corporation did not want to show a loss mr corrado , however , said the plant s book value is around 13 million in fiscal year 1992 , moreover , earnings at a p dropped 50 percent from 1991 even though revenues increased slightly that setback did not prevent mr wood from taking home 36 million in salary and bonus , as well as another 7 million from a onetime stock option purchase forbes listed him as the ninth highest paid executive of 1992 outside accountants insist that such a property offers no tax writeoffs a p pays more than 1 million a year in local taxes and in building maintenance depreciation allowances ran out five years ago representative amory houghton jr , a republican from corning , who was chairman of his family s company , corning inc , before entering congress , espoused the alternate explanation corporate myopia i used to be in business myself , he said you manage by exclusion the plant really has n't been ano 1 important to them faint hint of chocolate erected here in 1964 , the stately plant was designed as an industrial xanadu to prepare and distribute a p s own brands of food , everything from french dressing to candy \( inside , some vast storage rooms still smell slightly of chocolate \) at its height , the plant employed 1 , 800 by 1982 , a p was in financial trouble and closed the plant since then , there have been few serious prospective buyers but there have been enough to persuade the locals that a p is a key impediment to a sale last winter , xerox expressed interest in leasing a portion of the space to refurbish office equipment the prospect of a fortune 500 tenant pricked the interest of john summers , a rochester developer , who offered to buy the building if xerox moved in beside themselves with excitement , community leaders pulled out all the stops to sweeten the deal the county offered to lower taxes on the property 33 percent , the governor s office threw in a 1 million grant for improvements , the legislature scraped together another 500 , 000 for training employees the deal fell apart , said robert w bivens , executive director of southern tier economic growth , because a p was slow to respond to xerox s interest and only lowered its rental price from 3 a square foot to 250 after incessant needling and far too late in may , xerox chose a property in monroe , ohio i sincerely believe xerox wanted the building , mr biven said plant called hard to sell
mexico city , march 28 after months of united states criticism of mexico s environmental practices and policies , proposals to build three hazardous waste dumps along the texas border have caused an uproar on both sides of the rio grande mexican state and city governments , environmental groups and political parties have all clamored against the proposal , arguing that the dumps could threaten the groundwater that communities in both countries share last week hundreds of mexicans joined texans in protests at different bordercrossing points increasingly , the mexican government has added its voice to the complaints , warning that it will use all of the diplomatic means available to block any radioactive or toxic waste sites that it considers dangerous but a commission of the mexican congress voted unanimously to ask the administration of president carlos salinas de gortari to increase its efforts to stop the dumps from being built for the time being , the foreign ministry has only made a formal request to the united states for more information about the proposals but mexican diplomats say that unless geologists convince them that leaks from the dumps could not reach the aquifers that run beneath the border area , they will insist that the projects violate a 1983 border environmental treaty 'case that can be stopped' there are lots of environmental incidents along the border , but here we are dealing with something different , said alberto szekely , an environmental law specialist who is advising the foreign ministry in its negotiations with the united states this is a case that can be stopped before something happens the growing controversy reflects how , even as the momentum has slowed in negotiations over a north american free trade agreement , concerns about economic integration have continued to reshape environmental politics along the border according to officials in both countries , mexican and united states border communities that once kept their distance have begun to find themselves frequently allied , or at least in consultation , over their mutual environmental problems environmental groups in mexico and the united states say they now often coordinate their lobbying efforts , and many have found that problems they might once have considered local can be handled more effectively on a broader front we had to make this an international issue , alfredo gutierrez jr , the mayor of del rio , tex , said in a telephone interview explaining his town s strategy to block the large hazardous waste dump that chemical waste management inc wants to build near dryden , tex , a town about 15 miles north of the rio grande and 35 miles west of the pecos river in southwest texas in terms of defeating the dump site , mexico s involvement has a tremendous impact not close to final approval united states and texas officials have emphasized that none of the three dumps was close to receiving final approval and there are mechanisms , the united states ambassador , john d negroponte , assured mexican reporters last week , to take into account any concerns , any point of view not only of the mexican government but of any community that feels that it might be affected the two countries agreed this week to discuss the issue at a highlevel meeting next month in washington but like their counterparts in texas , border communities and environmentalists in mexico have grown more worried since a texas agency voted last month to buy a 16 , 000acre ranch near sierra blanca , a small town about 75 miles southeast of el paso , and spend 415 , 000 more to apply for a license to store the state s lowlevel radioactive waste there texas officials say that unlike the other two proposed dumps a private lowlevel radioactive waste depository near the town of spofford , about 15 miles from the mexican border and 30 miles southeast of del rio , and the chemical waste management one near dryden the state radioactive storage site will have to be built somewhere by 1996 to comply with federal requirements texas tried for five years to get approval to build the dump near fort hancock , a town along the rio grande 26 miles west of sierra blanca but last year the city of el paso , concerned about radioactive leaks into its water supply , won a lawsuit to block the project map of usmexcian border area , indicating del rio , texas
washington , june 28 by most gauges , the economy has performed worse under president bush than under any other president since world war ii economic growth has been slower , more businesses have failed , fewer jobs have been created and the national debt has soared to a record high the poor have been affected most one american in 10 is now on food stamps , the highest proportion ever but the middle class has suffered , too the average salaries of college graduates and of managerial and professional workers once thought to be immune from the recession cycle have been falling since 1989 and for the first time since the great depression , there has been no appreciable increase in the number of whitecollar jobs experts in labor and industry report that the job market for this year s high school and college graduates is the bleakest in memory if mr bush does not win reelection , it is safe to say , his handling of the economy will have been the main cause of his undoing but the president s advisers say none of this is his fault michael j boskin , the chairman of the council of economic advisers , blames structural imbalances over which mr bush had no control treasury secretary nicholas f brady blames congress for blocking bush initiatives and the federal reserve board for keeping interest rates too high for too long alan greenspan , chairman of the federal reserve board , says the price is finally being paid for the overindulgences of the 1980 s , when mr bush was vice president for his part , mr bush said in an interview with the new york times last week that the recession lasted longer than it should have because congress refused to go along with his proposals to selectively stimulate the economy mr bush and his observers also say that some of the economic news is actually quite good inflation seems to be under control , and shortterm interest rates , the province of the federal reserve and not the administration , are now the lowest in 20 years , having been cut time and again to stimulate the economy the trade deficit has been reduced substantially from its peak in the middle 1980 s and in the last few months , at long last , the overall economy has seemed to be turning slowly around i happen to think the economy is better than most of the people in america think , the president said but the political damage has already been done whoever s fault the recession was , mr bush appeared slow to recognize the agony the sour economy was causing many americans and whatever lies ahead , the public has been unwilling to excuse him and believes he has been indecisive and insensitive the latest new york times cbs news poll last week showed that only 34 percent of adults approved of the way mr bush was handling his job , and that only 16 percent liked how he was dealing with the economy a lower rating than even president carter got at his worst moment that may be because for more than a year , with the economy deteriorating , mr bush seemed detached if not without principle , then certainly without program and focused almost entirely on foreign policy he had never prepared the public for bad news he had never mentioned , for example , that a hangover might follow the high living of the reagan years , or that cutting the crippling budget deficit would require more than a few painless nips and tucks as a consequence , when the hard times hit and when taxes were increased despite his pledge , the public was taken by surprise , and many were left with the impression that the president was not in charge or did n't understand intentions a soft landing' with no hands \? ronald reagan led the country through its longest period of peacetime economic expansion , and george bush promised to pick up where his predecessor left off he committed himself to policies that he said would lead to strong growth in the economy and generate 30 million new jobs over the following eight years , twice the number created in the reagan years in one of the most memorable lines from any political convention speech , he declared , read my lips no new taxes but once in office , rather than working for economic expansion , he accepted the view of his main advisers that he should favor a soft landing a period of slow growth that would permit an economy overheated from the reagan years to cool off without crashing into a recession such careful calibration proved impossible , and after months of stagnation , the economy actually began to shrink in the summer of 1990 then that fall , in perhaps the political turning point of his term , the president agreed to a tax increase as the price for striking a deficitreduction agreement with congress through all this , mr bush , an economics major at yale , often seemed disengaged from economic affairs his closest advisers say the appearance was deceptive and actually resulted from a deepseated view that the best role the government can play in economic matters is to keep its hands off john h sununu , the white house chief of staff until last december , described the bush philosophy this way in early 1991 in the depths of the recession the president feels very strongly that the freemarket system operates best when it does not have its hands tied by government , is not shackled by a system that erroneously thinks it can improve it by command and control in the interview , mr bush was asked whether the government should have been more actively helping american industries that are losing out to those abroad i do n't think we ought to have industrial planning , the president replied i do not want to see the government pick winners and losers
it was a honey of a day , so sweet with sunshine and june skies that newark looked scrubbed real nice in such light the three blocks from pennsylvania station to broad street make for an impressive show buildings there are tall , glassy and appropriately angular , the way they are expected to be in any modern city the overhead walkway above raymond boulevard connecting the train station to the legal and communication center even makes newark look , at that angle , futuristic the homebound rush hour was over , but there still was plenty of light left in the day light , but not life , for newark s main streets had already been all but abandoned to the night the only people around were a woman in a white uniform standing impatiently outside the wilfred academy , smoking a cigarette , and a knot of people near military park waiting for some waylate bus a shirtless man sat on a bench asking for change there was one place , however , that hummed with both light and life above the door a telling sign free public library emphasis on free most every community has a library it is one of the elements that transforms a settlement into a community but few places have great libraries usually these are reserved for universities and the odd cities that transcend the confusion of special interests to create institutions rooted in the forceful notion that unless all of us prosper , none of us do the building is a threestory limestone classic with a confident facade and an aura of rocksteadiness it sits essentially unchanged in an unlucky city where so much else has been irreversibly altered approaching it from the sidewalk on washington street , one is struck by the notion that the newark public library is a great institution in a city that once believed it too would be great most new jersey residents have never set foot inside the main branch of the library , but those who have understand it is a special place that , in a sense , belongs not just to the 275 , 000 people who now live in newark but to the 77 million people in the state it is a treasure , albeit something of a hidden one , that is now endangered by a shortage of dollars and the limits of vision newark , like every city , is feeling the economic squeeze of rising costs and inadequate resources something had to be cut and along with lots of other things , the administration of mayor sharpe james decreased the library s budget by 15 percent this year that has meant the library is closed on sundays , and on the three late nights it is open until 8 30 , not 9 o'clock the book purchasing budget was slashed by more than 25 percent , which actually translates into a far worse cut because books and subscriptions are rising in cost so quickly that just staying even requires more money from one year to the next there have been other cuts , too the staff is down to 195 , 65 fewer than a year ago at the same time the number of people using the library is up , as always happens when times get bad or it means that while the library itself is open , some departments will be dark on this night , the sala hispanoamericana , a new spanishlanguage collection , had to be kept locked because there was n't enough staff to man it the library s gentlemannered director , alex boyd , does not complain much he says he understands the predicament newark is in , having to choose between one good purpose and another dressed in a neat gray suit , with a lavender shirt and tie , he is the picture of composure but the strain is there i do n't know how long our fingernails will last , he said during an interview in his thirdfloor office , but we 're hanging in there part of the problem is dr boyd s doing you see , he has pushed the library into a dilemma when he came from the chicago public library four years ago , he was determined to throw open longstuck windows he has kept all one million books on the shelves , and added thousands more , but his focus is setting up all kinds of activities to reach out to the community and bring back the library to what its most influential director , john cotton dana , had conceived of as a people s university dr boyd did everything he could to entice people into the library he spruced it up with paint and carpet and userfriendly computers he had his staff organize all kinds of handson activities for children , hoping that by inviting the little ones to puppet shows or barbecues he can whet their appetites for the wonders of knowledge it has worked , in a sense too well having hooked them , the library has found that the new patrons required more services , just when money has grown scarce dr boyd does n't like to retreat the cuts made so far fall into the category of what he calls selective pruning which , he said , if done right , makes the main stem stronger without any permanent damage we 'll downsize somewhat , but we do n't want to stop anything all together because if you let anything go you may never get it back , he said we do n't want to lose the heart and soul of the library because of what we hope is a temporary financial difficulty
newark , june 12 six newark police officers under investigation in the shooting of a 17yearold suspected car thief were suspended from duty without pay today , and the city s mayor and police director complained that the officers' statements about the shooting were too sketchy there s still a lot of gaps in statements we want to see answered , said william r celester , the police director , as he announced the suspensions at a news conference we 're just not satisfied the whole truth is out there mayor sharpe james has expressed concern about the possibility of street disorders since the youth , howard caesar , was shot early tuesday as he walked away from a stolen car although emotions do not seem high around west side park , the scene of the shooting , mayor james said today that the officers' coverup of their roles in the shooting had placed newark at risk the best way to prevent disorders , he said , was to give the public a complete reconstruction of the shooting and a full explanation of why it occurred there s always a belief in the community that the police cannot police themselves , the mayor said we must dispel that , and that s why we need a speedy resolution of the matter we want to send a message that this department can police itself although they did not contend that the suspended officers had refused to answer detectives' questions , the mayor and mr celester said they were dissatisfied with the accounts the officers had provided since volunteering themselves for questioning shortly before midnight thursday last night was nice a half truth , the mayor said of the officers' willingness to make statements and submit to questioning now we need all the truth it s not enough to come forward and say , 'i erred and made a mistake' it s more than being sorry when you put an entire city at risk the mayor seemed disturbed that only one officer , kenneth holloway , 30 , had admitted firing his gun at the scene he also said the officers had not explained why they went to the park without being dispatched there by the department s communications center and he said the officers had not explained why no empty shell casings were found there lawyers for mr holloway , who joined the department last year , and two other officers said their clients had cooperated fully with investigators , although they declined to provide any details of their accounts of the shooting and its aftermath lawyers for the three other suspended officers did not return telephone calls my client answered all the questions , and it s my understanding the others have been completely candid , said anthony j pope jr , the lawyer for officer holloway these are absolutely unconditional statements they 're giving 'there 'll always be gaps' mr pope suggested that the authorities might not be fully satisfied with the account of the incident they pieced together from the six statements if anybody thinks this is going to read like a script , that s not possible , he said you ca n't possibly put something together like this with complete certainty there 'll always be gaps and discrepancies if you 're looking for that degree of certainty you 'll never find it , and that does n't mean somebody s lying george schneider , who represents officers michael cavallero , 28 , and his partner , john costa , 25 , said each had been questioned for two and a half hours and had answered everything he had been asked mr schneider said his clients had arrived at the park in their patrol car two minutes before the shooting because of radio calls from other officers about stolen cars every night you get 15 to 20 stolen cars in that neighborhood , mr schneider said they were responding to calls going back and forth between cars about a dangerous situation this night the drivers were especially outrageous racial motive is discounted mr caesar , the wounded youth , remained in critical condition on a lifesupport system today at university hospital his overall prognosis is guarded , said a spokesman , rogers ramsey hospital officials have said the slug lacerated his liver , colon and gall bladder mr celester has discounted any notion that the shooting was racially motivated both officer holloway and mr caesar are black two of the other suspended officers are hispanic and the remaining three are white mayor james said today that officer holloway had fired three warning shots as he ran after a youth who had been a passenger in the stolen car with mr caesar and who fled after it crashed into a curb warning shots are prohibited by department regulations , officials said the mayor quoted officer holloway as saying he had fired the shots over the youth s head but not straight up in the air after he had heard loud noises he thought were gunshots or exploding firecrackers none of the three slugs struck the fleeing passenger , mayor james said , and who shot at and wounded mr caesar is undetermined as of today , no other officers have admitted firing their weapon , the mayor said state police ballistics experts are examining the weapons of the six suspended officers and three others who went to the park after the shooting the ballistics report is expected by early next week , he said besides officers holloway , cavallero and costa , the others suspended today were naftalis mendez , 31 , a fiveyear veteran jose montalvo , 23 , who joined the department 18 months ago , and gerard piacenza , 23 , an officer for a year all were charged with neglect of duty and conduct unbecoming an officer in addition , all officers except officers cavallero and costa were accused of submitting false statements about the shooting all six were in uniform and on duty in the park at the time of the shooting , police director celester said two others who were also on duty and in uniform arrived after the shooting no actions have been taken against them and officials have declined to identify them another officer who arrived at the scene after the shooting was dino d'elia , who was off duty the stolen car was registered to his mother and was officially reported stolen by his brother in a phone call to the communications center at 4 42 am , a minute after officials say mr caesar was shot officer d'elia was called to the scene to recover the car , officials say photo the car involved in the shooting of a 17yearold autotheft suspect in newark six police officers under investigation were suspended from duty without pay yesterday their statements were considered too sketchy and placed newark at risk ,

warsaw , dec 16 an economic success story is taking shape in poland , three years after the country became the first in eastern europe to risk the rigors of shock therapy industrial production , which declined a precipitous 39 percent in 1990 and 1991 , is on the rise , and poland is on track this year to become the first among former communist nations to record annual economic growth although inflation is still 40 percent and the unemployment rate is 135 percent , western analysts see encouraging evidence that centrally planned economies , which once tilted toward arms , steel and other heavy industries , can be reshaped without social upheaval the recovery is being fueled both by the expanding private sector and , surprisingly , by stateowned companies that have managed to shift exports quickly from the east bloc to the west poland s exports have soared since 1988 , to 14 billion from 8 billion , with 80 percent of this year s sales heading west the major exporters remain under state ownership , although many are to be privatized in the coming year in recent months russia , which initially sought to duplicate poland s program , has begun to back away the keys to poland s success have been tight control of the money supply , privatization and the quick abolition of subsidies and price controls how nations differ although supporters of such shock therapy had predicted it could work in russia , there are significant differences between the two countries polish policy makers were supported in 1990 by an overwhelming public consensus for radical change , and have been encouraged since then to stay the course by an explosion of pentup entrepreneurial spirit and by a relatively productive agricultural sector that was already largely in private hands none of these conditions are apparent in russia i think they 've made it , said jeffrey sachs , the harvard economist who helped shape poland s economic program and has also advised moscow they have definitely turned the corner the panic is over the reforms are secure while the modest shortterm growth is welcome , economists like mr sachs are most excited by the longterm changes underlying the numbers while coalmining , metals and chemicals are suffering , consumer industries like foodprocessing , construction and furniture are growing , as are service industries like auto repair from guns to butter the magnitude of the change can be grasped in a single statistic from the factories that once supplied weapons to the soviet union and the warsaw pact nations just four years ago , such companies made up 40 percent of poland s industrial output today they account for 18 percent , and are shrinking another indication lies in the government s recently announced plans to restructure the steel and coal industries over the next decade nearly 50 , 000 of the 80 , 000 steel workers will lose their jobs and output will be halved , to 10 million tons in the coal mines , the government plans to eliminate 180 , 000 of 330 , 000 jobs over the next eight years , and nervousness over the future of the industry apparently touched off strikes this week at mines employing a total of 100 , 000 workers a fragile transition to see how much the polish economy has changed , watch teresa maciejowska at work mrs maciejowska works on commission selling custom kitchen cabinets , and on a typical saturday afternoon recently , she was juggling the demands of two and three customers at once with unstinting politeness when the tarlowski family hesitated over whether to invest 600 more than a month s wages in new cabinets and counters for their warsaw apartment , mrs maciejowska switched to the soft sell listen , i understand , she said this is a big purchase it s not something that you buy this year and change the next go home , think it over i 'll be here next week welcome , polish shoppers it is a conversation that could not have occurred a decade ago , when communist central planners frowned on consumer goods like toilet paper , tampons or furniture , preferring to produce tanks or kalashnikov rifles outfitting an apartment meant standing in line all night or paying bribes kazmiera and jan ludwicki well remember those days the couple recently bought a larger apartment in warsaw , and are now part of a homerenovation boom both hold jobs in the lowerpaid state sector and are financing the work from their monthly savings , approximately 40 percent of their combined income of 600 their new apartment needs kitchen cabinets , and mrs maciejowska s willingness to arrange special orders piqued their interest they had already visited two other cabinet stores when they arrived at the ardomex booth , which is tucked into a corner of a cavernous discothequeturnedfurniturestore ten years ago , several times , i stood in line all night to buy a small piece of furniture , said mr ludwicki , a scientist at the national institute of hygiene anyone who says things are worse now has no will , or is stupid signs of the times abound while the streets of major cities are dotted with private electronics stores , clothing shops and restaurants , the blueandwhite stores of pewex , the one business that almost made a profit in the communist days , face bankruptcy a governmentowned chain of stores that sold western goods for dollars , pewex was virtually the only place that sold imported

it s war up there the bloodiest battle for mastery of the skies may be at hand many industry experts say the steep cut in fares that american airlines initiated last month could bury three competitors operating under the protection of the bankruptcy courts trans world airlines , continental and america west and the cuts could mortally wound two others , usair and northwest , that are struggling to stay ahead of their creditors for his part , robert crandall , american airlines' chairman , says that the industry s only real problem is that too many carriers are chasing too few passengers is mr crandall correct \? could the darwinian struggle for the air traveler s dollar ultimately leave just three behemoths american , united and delta to serve the national market \? marketminded economists , who would have scoffed just a few years ago , are scoffing no more they now concede that further consolidation is in the cards but this does not mean that the economics of air travel dictates some small , magic number of survivors indeed , many contend that a blind faith in the advantages of large size has been the undoing of some of the giants of yesteryear but most important , they are cautiously optimistic that the spectacular progess in reducing the average fare and providing far more frequent service improvements that airline deregulation has brought consumers will not be lost in the consolidation and while these experts are not looking forward to testing the proposition , many now believe that three to five national carriers , plus a few lowcost regional airlines , could provide all the competition needed to preserve the fruits of deregulation thus while experts want the overextended airlines to get the best possible shot at survival , few are calling for heroic measures market engineering , said severin borenstein of the university of california at davis , is not the way to go hardly anyone expected that free markets would favor the established giants , with their featherbedding unions and regulationasusual mentality , over lean and hungry upstarts certainly not the establishment itself among the big carriers , only united threw its weight behind deregulation in 1978 but then , hardly anyone at that time understood the economic advantages of large route systems linking cities through hub airports it takes 10 planes to provide nonstop service simultaneously on 10 routes , notes alfred kahn , who , as the airlines' chief federal regulator in the 1970 s , led the fight for deregulation but the same 10 planes in the air , he points out , can serve 70 routes by shuffling all passengers through a central hub most travelers , as well as big airlines , have been winners from the rush to hubandspoke systems before deregulation , for example , there was only enough traffic between oklahoma city and dallas to support a few flights a day now it pays the industry to run 18 flights each way , because both american and delta use the link to provide onestop service from oklahoma city , through dallas , to dozens of cities if economists were surprised by these economies of scope , they were truly flummoxed by the success of marketing strategies , pioneered by american airlines , to take maximum advantage of size first on the list is frequentflier benefits aimed at business travelers what mr borenstein coolly terms kickbacks to the purchasing agents they reward loyalty to an airline that serves thousands of routes because it pays to accumulate mileage in a single program then there are the industrywide computerized reservation systems , installed in travel agencies by the big carriers washington cracked down on the practice of listing the flights of the system s ownerairline ahead of the competition but american and united , with the leading reservation networks , can still get a leg up legally by charging competitors an arm and a leg for booking services size is n't everything advantages achieved through size explain why the airline industry is far more concentrated than , say , the business of growing soybeans but in the view of clifford winston , an economist at the brookings institution , they do not fully explain why so many carriers have bitten the dust in the last few years size alone , mr winston notes , did not save eastern and pan am nor did size spare continental from bankruptcy court the decisive factor in virtually every failure , mr winston argues , has been the inability to aim at a lucrative market or to control costs in a business that operates on razorthin margins mr borenstein agrees size , he says , cannot explain how small fry like america west and midway managed to operate at far lower costs per passenger mile than giants like delta and usair perhaps most disconcerting to those who like simple tales with simple morals , size does not explain why little southwest , which kevin murphy of morgan stanley admiringly calls the snapping turtle of the industry , has the lowest costs and highest rate of profitability in the industry each failure is different
purchase , ny , may 13 earning respect from the chicago bulls is not enough for the knicks besides , they have already done that before the knicks began their fourofsevengame eastern conference semifinal against the heavilyfavored bulls , few people thought the series would reach a game 6 but here were the knicks today , down by 3 games to 2 and preparing for the sixth game thursday night at madison square garden they have tuned out the skeptics and turned in a heartfelt performance that has tested the talent , as well as the character , of the national basketball association s defending champions so despite losing the fifth game , 9688 , on tuesday night in chicago , the knicks returned home believing they would win on thursday , force a seventh game for sunday and then win the series none of the knicks have vacation plans for the weekend we said from the beginning it s going to be a long series , said xavier mcdaniel , who led the knicks with 26 points in game 5 and continued to keep scottie pippen contained i think they came into this series thinking , 'we 're going to kick their butts and get on to the next series' but it ai n't going to be like that we 're trying to take their hearts a lot beyond jordan but the bulls , who need only one victory to end this titanic struggle , have the upper hand they also have michael jordan and a suffocating defense that has bothered new york , particularly patrick ewing , who has averaged just 145 points in the last two games the spectacular midair moves and prolific scoring of jordan often overshadow one of chicago s key strengths defense if the knicks cannot find a way to make ewing an offensive force , they are likely to lose this series coach pat riley of the knicks said today that he was concerned about ewing s lack of offensive production in the last two games we need to get patrick 20 to 25 shots a game , and it has n't happened lately , he added but give chicago credit they 've defensed the heck out of us it s not as easy to get the ball in the low post as it might look but we worked on a couple of things which we hope will help it s a combination of us doing a better job of feeding him , and him working for position the knicks might station ewing on the perimeter more , giving him the option of either taking jumpers or driving to the basket when ewing is on the perimeter , he also seems to have an easier time finding open teammates than when he is down low in heavy traffic ewing departed quickly after today s practice and did not speak with reporters but assessing his performance after tuesday s loss , he said they did a good job denying me , but i was disappointed in my performance i went to the offensive boards , but they did a pretty good job of keeping a body on me a couple of times when i got there to get a rebound , the ball was batted out of my hands they stepped it up to another level if i had had a better game , i think we may have won we have to make sure we 're the aggressors in the next game the knicks refused to believe that today s practice was their final one of the season they were loose and confident , and they were looking forward to playing at home , in front of towelwaving new york fans whose enthusiasm helped inspire them to defeat chicago in game 4 last sunday riley said he had emphasized defense and rebounding during today s workout new york was outrebounded , 3329 , in game 5 , the first time in 10 playoff games the knicks did n't have an edge on the boards pippen \( 10 rebounds \) , horace grant and jordan \( 5 rebounds apiece \) were all noticeably more aggressive and the bulls were rewarded for driving to the basket , shooting 38 free throws compared with 22 for the knicks jordan was 15 of 17 from the line i would n't say they played harder , but they put bodies on us , mcdaniel said the whole series they had been just trying to outjump us because they 've got great leaping ability but they came at us a little more physically i think the game was refereed fine we just did n't play well enough to win now it s the knicks' turn to respond they have no margin for error , but neither team has established dominance in any game of this series we 're going to take care of business thursday , then see them back in chicago , said guard mark jackson after game 5 we 're not going to die we 've earned their respect , but we 're not satisfied with that and ready to stop we want to win this series rebounds new york s loss on tuesday overshadowed a 19point effort from gerald wilkins , who defended michael jordan most of the game and was not pleased that jordan attempted 17 free throws it s tough , but i ca n't complain , wilkins said he s the best player in basketball and they 're going to look at it closely and they looked at it very , very closely i 've still got to find a way to try to stop him
mineola , li , july 12 a proposed police union contract has touched off a debate between political and business leaders over whether nassau county , broke and in the midst of a financial crisis , can afford it the contract is expected to set a standard for other municipal employee unions in the new york metropolitan area in new york city , the police have for decades sought parity with their colleagues on long island and the contract could be used as a guide for negotiations between the dinkins administration and the city s police union the police unions on long island have traditionally been powerful political forces in nassau and suffolk counties , and have effectively raised their salaries to among the highest in the country the proposed fouryear contract in nassau would increase the average police officer s salary by 15 percent , to more than 59 , 000 it also includes several concessions by the police union , which nassau and suffolk may seek from their other unions among the concessions are a freeze on base wages in the first year , the deferral of some overtime and regular pay , and lower wages and more workdays for recruits vote on july 20 after months of delay and political posturing , the pact was quietly placed on the nassau county board of supervisors' agenda late last week for a final vote on july 20 the nassau county executive , thomas s gulotta , who negotiated the contract with gary delaraba , president of the nassau patrolmen s benevolent association , has praised the pact as a way to ease nassau s budget problem he says it would cost the county little during the first two years mr delaraba calls it a fair deal however , the long island association , the island s largest business organization , says the pact is too rich in the midst of a recession it contends that the contract would increase the average salary of nassau s 1 , 800 police officers by about 21 percent during the four years our approach is not to begrudge public safety officers fair compensation , said james l larocca , president of the association our direction really comes from a concern about what we can afford seeking state approval nassau s 18 billion budget is currently running a 153 million deficit to fill the gap , mr gulotta , a republican who is expected to seek reelection next year , is seeking state approval to borrow 70 million and increase the county s mortgage recording tax by 1 percent but the democratic leadership in albany has refused to go along unless nassau agrees to a financial oversight board critics of the proposed police pact argue that it is the type of deal an oversight board might easily reject because nassau s financial crisis has forced the county to lay off 2 , 300 workers , none of them police officers , and sharply cut back services in all departments , including health care at the nassau county medical center we recognize the county is in a financial bind , and we 're giving up a lot in the first two years to help out , mr delaraba said he estimated that the fouryear contact would cost the county 2 million bruce nyman , a democrat and supervisor of the city of long beach , said he had decided to vote against the contract when it came up for a final debate and vote no public employee , whether a politician , policeman or parks department worker , should get a raise until the county s fiscal crisis is resolved , he said another democrat , benjamin zwirn , supervisor of the town of north hempstead , said he planned to support the contract , despite some reservations my determination is that it s worth it to the taxpayers in the long run , mr zwirn said the pba is entitled to a vote on the pact and there is no reason to delay it the motion to put the issue on next monday s agenda was made by mr zwirn and seconded by mr nyman the outcome will be closely watched by the nassau civil service employees association , the largest union in the county , whose contract expires on dec 31 in suffolk county , which is also dealing with a record budget deficit , nine union contracts expired last year , including that of the suffolk pba all are in the midst of negotiations suffolk proposes 10 cut in suffolk , county officials have proposed a 10 percent acrossthe board pay cut for employees , including police officers , to help close its nearly 50 million budget gap as a result , several hundred suffolk police officers with 20 or more years of service , several times the usual number , have filed for retirement , concerned that shrinking wages and benefits may affect their pension income their pension is based on onehalf of their salary during their final year on the job or one half their average income in the final three years , whichever is higher a nassau police officer now earns 49 , 124 after six years on the job he would earn 59 , 522 at the end of the proposed contract that is significantly higher than the 50 , 014 earned by his counterpart in suffolk and 41 , 000 in new york city , where the police contract expired dec 30 , 1991 the city is currently negotiating with most of its major unions , which are working without contracts and have not had raises in more than a year the nassau police have been working without a contract since dec 31 under the new pact , salaries would increase by 475 percent in 1993 and 1994 and by 55 percent in 1995 the contract would also increase the number of years needed to reach top salary from six to eight
washington , april 7 lawyers representing haitian refugees held at the united states navy base at guantanamo , cuba , have told a federal judge that more than 50 haitians who qualified to apply for asylum may have been returned to haiti mistakenly , and that the records of at least 2 , 500 refugees had been lost through computer errors or poor recordkeeping a congressional report , to be made public thursday , is expected to include similar findings immigration officials , acknowledging there may have been errors in recordkeeping , say they are working under under extreme pressure from both refugee organizations , which want more haitians admitted to the united states , and the bush administration , which wants fewer the administration argues that most haitians are economic migrants , not victims of political persecution the federal judge , sterling johnson jr of the united states district court in brooklyn , has twice ruled most recently on monday that the haitians at guantanamo have the right to legal counsel , and that none of those conditionally qualified for asylum may be interviewed further without access to legal assistance the administration , which is expected to appeal the ruling , says that guantanamo is not united states territory and that foreigners held there do not enjoy legal protections available in this country and its territories the navy base is on land leased from cuba lawyers from the lowenstein international human rights clinic at yale and from the center for constitutional rights in new york , who brought a class action suit on behalf of the haitians , discovered the confusion in recordkeeping when they interviewed immigration officials at guantanamo more than 18 , 000 haitians have been picked up at sea by the coast guard since the overthrow of the government of president jeanbertrand aristide on sept 30 virtually all of the 3 , 296 who remain at guantanamo have been judged by the immigration and naturalization service to have credible claims to a full hearing on asylum in the united states nearly 10 , 000 haitians have been sent back to portauprince , the capital of haiti , and another 4 , 149 have been allowed to enter the united states to apply formally for asylum the immigration and naturalization service says the rate at which haitians are being judged to have credible claims to asylum 34 percent is extraordinarily high some delays may have been caused by confusion caused by raw data kept by the ins , the military and other organizations of the 2 , 500 files that were lost at one point , only 1 , 080 could be recreated , and the rest of the haitians had to be interviewed anew , an asylum official told michael ratner , a lawyer for the center for constitutional rights
tokyo , feb 3 just back from a quick visit to the united states , prime minister kiichi miyazawa added his voice today to those of other japanese political leaders who have found fault recently with the way americans perform in the workplace he said that america may lack a work ethic , and that some of the country s economic ills came about because too many american college graduates headed to wall street in the 1980 s rather than producing things of value mr miyazawa s comments , made today during a nationally televised debate in parliament , seemed bound to further inflame the atmosphere between the united states and japan two weeks ago the speaker of the lower house of parliament , yoshio sakurauchi , touched off protests in the united states when he termed american workers lazy and said a third of the work force was illiterate japanese government officials , including mr miyazawa , denounced those characterizations more measured comment in many respects , mr miyazawa s statements , along with criticism of american management by another leading member of the liberal democratic party , kabun muto , seemed more measured than mr sakurauchi s moreover , they echoed comments often heard in the united states but they also reflected a widely held view here that fundamental problems in the american workplace , rather than just a cyclical downturn , have led to shoddy products and ultimately to national economic decline tonight japanese government officials raced to interpret and explain away the prime minister s comments , aware that in a time of deep recession and growing americanjapanese tension epitomized by a new wave of buy america campaigns words that might otherwise be overlooked are creating a backlash in the united states the foreign ministry issued a statement tonight noting that mr miyazawa was also critical of excesses in the japanese economy and said , the prime minister regrets any misunderstanding which may have been caused masamichi hanabusa , the ministry s chief spokesman , added , the prime minister has no intention whatsoever of criticizing american workers but mr miyazawa , led into the discussion of the economic problems facing america by mr muto , appeared to be doing exactly that mr muto reserved his harshest words for american managers japanese auto makers , he said , were able to produce very high quality cars with american workers at the socalled transplants run by toyota , honda and nissan , among others , succeeding where american auto makers could not americans are producing good cars , he said the question is how to use them skillfully mr muto , who until recently was minister of international trade and industry , the country s most crucial trade official , said he had heard americans would not buy a detroitmade car that was produced on a friday or a monday , because on those days workers were either preparing for a weekend of play or recovering from one i think americans should learn how to work properly from monday to friday , mr muto said that s a good idea for everyone wall street jobs faulted mr miyazawa , who had just returned from a summit meeting of the 15 members of the united nations security council on friday , quickly chimed in , ticking off several problems facing america he said that in the 1980 s american college graduates landed highpaying jobs on wall street , and as a result you and i have seen that the number of engineers able to make products has fallen year after year he said that while the united states was once the world s greatest source of industrial goods , its tradition of producing things and creating value has 'loosened' too much in the past 10 years or so mr miyazawa , who is a nearfluent english speaker , used the english word loosened to emphasize his point , one that is often heard from japanese industrialists as if in summary , mr miyazawa paused and said , i have thought for some time that they may lack a work ethic , and obliquely suggested that some americans had forgotten how to live by the sweat of their brow mr miyazawa may well have thought that he was saying nothing unusual because such critiques are commonplace here not only on television , but also at the negotiating table similar arguments have emerged from the awkwardly named structural impediments initiative , in which japan has urged americans to work longer hours and greatly improve worker training , while the united states has urged in return that japanese take more vacations , save less money and buy more on credit to increase consumer spending and therefore the purchase of imports but for most of the last few years such criticisms were scarcely noticed that has changed in the last month , with president bush s illfated visit , new arguments over automobile trade and suggestions from some bush administration officials that the american recession was at least partly made in japan the tone of mr miyazawa s comments today seemed more explanatory than argumentative , and he touched on a number of other practices , from issuing junk bonds to conducting leveraged buyouts , that create heavy debt loads for companies that is not unusual for mr miyazawa , who used mr bush s visit here in early january to cite other problems , from drugs , homelessness , aids and a declining educational system as among the challenges that america must overcome mr miyazawa is widely regarded as an internationalist with a deep understanding of the united states , so the timing of his comments today seemed difficult to explain in recent weeks his government has gone out of its way to compensate for mr sakurauchi s comments by praising america and its workers white house responds washington , feb 3 \( reuters \) the white house said today that disparaging japanese remarks about american workers were not helpful , but that they could benefit the united states in the long run by stirring competitive juices the white house spokesman , marlin fitzwater , responding to prime minister miyazawa s comment that americans may lack a work ethic , told reporters today , i would say that the american work force is second to none , that the american work ethic is legendary and has promoted the greatest prosperity in the world and throughout the world , including other countries , like japan , and that we have been a leader in these areas for many years and any comments to the contrary are wrong without criticizing mr miyazawa directly , mr fitzwater pointed out that protectionist fires were burning very hot in the united states and said such remarks were probably not helpful to relations between the two nations but he said the statement could benefit the united states in the long run these kinds of comments are probably helpful in stirring the rages in all of us who want to compete , and show who the best work force really is photo prime minister kiichi miyazawa in parliament yesterday \( associated press \)
atlanta , oct 23 the atlanta braves spoke about david cone today after their victory over the blue jays in game 5 of the world series thursday night in toronto , but it sounded as if they were discussing wally whitehurst there was no fear in their hopeful eyes and no edge in their inspired voices the braves sounded pleased to be opposing cone on saturday at home in game 6 why \? because cone is a familiar face who spent six seasons with the mets before being traded to the blue jays on aug 27 though his stuff is explosive and often nasty , the braves' hitters are thrilled to have personal scouting reports on cone in their minds they do not have to rely on videotape because they can flash back to game 2 or recall cone s days in the national league i think facing david cone in the sixth game definitely gives us an advantage going into the game , said atlanta first baseman sid bream i think david is an individual we know we 've had pretty good success against him when you know a pitcher , you have better swings against him cone 93 against braves say what \? bream was talking about the pitcher who has a 93 career record against the braves , including 21 with a 240 earned run average this season with those alsorans from queens the pitcher who struck out a major leaguebest 261 with the mets and jays this season the pitcher who could command 5 million a season as a free agent \? bream was also talking about the cone the braves exploited for five hits , five walks and three earned runs in fourandonethird innings last sunday , causing atlanta s david justice to say , he did n't have command of all his pitches and the cone who was bounced from game 5 of the american league championship series after being touched for three earned runs in four innings by oakland i have to find the strike zone , said cone they had success against me the last time i ca n't let that happen again cone has probably lost velocity on his fastball since july , but he needs it to make his other four pitches more effective if the fastball strays from the zone , the braves will wait and hit a fat 21 pitch we have to be patient like the first time , said terry pendleton he s a tough pitcher he s even tougher when you swing at his pitches the braves know that with the mets , cone fashioned one fivehit shutout , a threehitter through seven innings in another start and whiffed 21 batters in 20 innings versus atlanta i 've seen him at his toughest and when he s hittable , justice said you hope you get him when he s hittable after pitching superbly for the jays and compiling a 43 record with a 255 earned run average during the season , cone zoomed into the postseason and made general manager pat gillick look like a genius by tossing eight onerun innings against the a s in a 31 victory in game 2 of the alcs since then , cone has had two erratic outings , and the blue jays wonder what to expect saturday loving the chance any pitcher would love this chance , said cone , who will be working on five days' rest i guarantee you there are a lot of pitchers sitting home who would like to have this opportunity the blue jays signed jack morris to help them win the world series , but he lost games 1 and 5 now cone , who was paid about 1 million for the final seven weeks of the season , has the chance to be the hero the hired gun who saunters across the border to seal the first world series for canada although cone said all the games he has pitched for the jays have been pivotal , none has been more crucial than saturday s start morris pitched a 10inning shutout against the braves in game 7 of the world series for the twins last season , and the gutsy effort catapulted him to a 5 millionayear salary cone is keen enough to realize that a sterling effort in game 6 could escalate his value all things considered , cone said , reflecting on his hectic season , this could be a tremendous topper to it all photo braves hitters are thrilled to have personal scouting reports on former national leaguer david cone \( associated press \)
when he set out to document the emigration of employment from the heartland and shores of the united states , it never occurred to charles kernaghan , executive director of a unionsponsored research group , that there was n't someone out there collecting the information he needed surely , he figured , there were professors or thinktank wonks who decorated their offices with pushpin maps of plant closings and tables of jobs lost the data were n't available , mr kernaghan says , at least not centrally and systematically and what was there could not answer the fundamental question why do american companies go offshore \? so , after spending several months doing more traditional forms of research in archives and libraries , mr kernaghan and his colleagues , barbara briggs and jack mckay , formed a bogus company posing as officers of an environmentally correct manufacturing company , they explored the shadowy networks of doing business as a foreigner in central america and the caribbean and made the improbable discovery that , advertently or inadvertently , government programs run through the united states agency for international development may be encouraging american companies to go offshore they estimate the cost to taxpayers at more than 800 million the project is in the shadows no longer earlier this year it piqued the interest of news show producers , and three sundays ago , the cbs program 60 minutes broadcast a report of its own investigation a few days later , abc s nightline ran its version of the story over two nights even the unflappable ted koppel was unable to modulate exchanges between senator al gore and labor secretary lynn martin that made the vice presidential debate a week later look like a quaker meeting the bush administration vehemently denies its policies encourage companies to move south , arguing that programs stimulate development and increase imports from the united states the project began in mr kernaghan s office at the amalgamated clothing and textile workers union , one of the 21 unions that supports his work , in new york for nearly a decade , mr kernaghan s organization , the national labor committee in support of worker and human rights in central america , had monitored political violence as a delicate peace set in , he turned his attention to the problems of lowpaid workers in the region s maquiladoras foreignowned assembly plants the researchers , none of whom have business experience , decided their company , new age textiles , would make reusable canvas bags that could replace the plastic and paper bags supermarkets use they made up samples , confabulated a company history , established a mailing address and fax and phone lines and had business cards and stationery printed up in december , they headed for a highlevel trade conference in miami to see if the idea would take flight we were nervous , to put it mildly , mr kernaghan said any questions could have blown us out of the water like many people who have a longdistance relationship with business , mr kernaghan and his colleagues assumed that having no experience , no business plan and no information about markets , distribution or other esoterica might create a problem wrong new age textile s ecoshopping bag was the hit of the conference it captivated them , mr kernaghan said the conference mutated quickly from a test of verity into a whirlwind of opportunities , as members of the group carommed from meeting to warehouse tour to live radio callin show one night they dined with the mayor of rotterdam , who wanted them to ship the bags to europe through his port the group spent much of its time visiting booths , pitching its bags to trade organizations from jamaica , honduras and el salvador at each booth , a representative touted his country s notax , lowwage , nonunionized environments and subsidies available for training workers and building factories with more confidence , mr kernaghan took the new age textiles show to another conference in april this time with 60 minutes in tow in july , again accompanied by 60 minutes , he went to central america and the caribbean , where he found evidence of government money being used on projects that could undermine onshore industries mr kernaghan has been using aid s own documents , piles and piles of them , to verify his figures on nightline , secretary martin acknowledged that aid may need a review but she argued that the agency s programs will lead to regional prosperity , which will benefit the united states jack sheinkman , actwu president and one of mr kernaghan s principal sponsors , recognizes that argument from debates on the north american free trade agreement with mexico since 1983 , roughly when the aid programs began , he has watched the number of jobs in his industry drop 42 percent , to 102 million at the same time , the wages of apparel workers in central america has dropped to 30 cents an hour from 44 cents the programs , he argues , are not helping anyone s standard of living and they appear to be impairing the ability of workers to organize mr kernaghan now has the beginnings of the jobloss plantclosing data base he assumed would be easy to find he and his colleagues have already inspired congress to restrict aid s activities and , as he told an aid official who came to call last week , he has any number of ideas for new research research that will almost certainly make somebody at aid uncomfortable again photo ' charles kernaghan , executive director of the national labor committee at his office in new york \( phillip greenberg for the new york times \)
paris there are works of art for which house arrest is the only answer it s not quite prison , because they are let out on special occasions but at other times they live in quiet , seclusion and darkness and what are they \? they are works on paper drawings and watercolors that die just a little every time they are exposed to the light they may be by leonardo and durer , rubens and watteau , ingres and cezanne or they may be by no one in particular either way , the risks are the same the paper darkens or falls apart the ink fades the penciled line fades the color fades for these reasons , these works have a paradoxical status people want to see them , but it is better that they should not be seen what to do with them \? in that respect , the department of drawings in the louvre has set an enticing example over the last 30 years it has racked up more than 70 exhibitions most have drawn wholly or primarily on the louvre s own majestic holdings , but 14 were anthologies lent by museums in new york , chicago , ottawa , london , stockholm , vienna , darmstadt and the french provinces none of the works was on view for too long , and the level of light was tightly controlled the latest in the series \( through may 18 \) is called souvenirs de voyage , and it consists of drawings , sketchbooks , autograph letters and manuscripts by french 19thcentury artists who were away from home and had something to say about it almost all of them are owned by the louvre , and artists represented include eugene delacroix , camille corot , victor hugo , constantin guys , jeanfrancois millet , camille pissarro , claude monet , odilon redon and paul gauguin some of these need no introduction what delacroix noted down in his sketchbooks , whether in london in 1825 or in morocco and spain in 1832 , has rarely been equaled for instantaneity , and for a highspeed but evident truth to the thing seen pissarro was not happy in london , where he sat out the end of the francoprussian war in 1871 , but his paintings of the london suburbs also have an evident rightness these are french paintings of english subjects in which neither country has had to yield to the other the same could be said of a gouache by pissarro in the present show its subject is a side road , much like any other , in the london suburb of sydenham anyone who knows london will recognize how deftly pissarro touched in the imitation halftimbered villa , the overhang of the central tree and the hesitant , unsteady line of the street but this is not a bigname show nor is it only a picture show the louvre owns more than 2 , 000 letters by artists it also owns , with the musee d'orsay , the manuscript of noanoa in which gauguin evoked his first stay in tahiti \( 189193 \) among its less famous holdings is the illustrated manuscript record of a journey made in italy in 185556 by edmond and jules de goncourt , best known today for their copious and unsparing diaries on the brancacci chapel in florence , as on every other subject , edmond de goncourt could write up a storm any day of the week , and his brother reveals himself in this show as a gifted partner in watercolor items like these two do not only thicken the plot they give us notice that the show is as much about motivation as it is an adjunct of the travel bureaus it is , in other words , as much about why the artists went to this place or that as it is about where they went in that context , everyone by now knows more or less why gauguin went to the south seas but arlette serullaz , chief curator of drawings in the louvre , has also been able to include an illustrated letter from papeete by charles giraud \( 181996 \) , who was in the south seas 45 years before gauguin it may be too much to say that if gauguin had read that letter he could have saved himself a trip but giraud left a lively portrait in word and image of papeete as a place in which the light was bearable only at sundown , the trees made him homesick for a french oak , and the plants were all right , but nothing to cross the world for as for the people of papeete , they were a sad disappointment though forever singing , crowned with flowers and outwardly built for lovemaking , they had their minds on nothing but the civil war that was racking tahiti for this and other reasons , giraud saw his visit as a bust but the why of this matter should also be given giraud went as a member of an expedition paid for by king louisphilippe gauguin was driven to the south seas by the search for a decivilized self that he could not find in france motivation was weak in the one case and overwhelming in the other as for the achievement of constantin guys as a roving reporter for the illustrated london news , it was so brilliantly evoked by the poet charles baudelaire that it is possible from time to time to feel let down by what he actually did but his drawing in the present show of a turkish courtesan in the suburbs of constantinople has precisely the sense of actuality that baudelaire praised so highly we feel that this was not a drawing done to order for the magazine , but a private record of something that guys did not want to let slip
warsaw , april 7 they have abolished the ritualistic may day parades and renamed the streets , but three years after the collapse of communism , the former satellites of the soviet empire are still struggling to root out the deeper psychological legacies communism s external characteristics political repression , censorship , big brotherism proved easier to erase than had been widely assumed similarly , after just a few months of reform , the most glaring flaws of the old command economy began to vanish as shops , once empty , stocked up with bananas , tuna fish , olive oil and imported cosmetics but the revolution of the mind is still unfolding , and many in eastern europe say it will continue until the next generation comes of age even determined foes of the previous system acknowledge that its subconscious imprints still touch nearly everybody , from workers to company managers to postcommunist politicians the lingering fears there s a little communist in all of us , said krzysztof kozlowski , a solidarity stalwart and roman catholic journalist whose appointment as interior minister in 1990 formally ended poland s years as a police state for me , it s very banal things the fear of risks , of something new , the fear of competition people think that if someone is successful in business , it must have been done immorally or illegally , said mr kozlowski , now a member of the polish senate sometimes i catch myself thinking about someone 'you 've been doing real well , there must be something wrong with you' while changes in the economic system have meant unparalleled opportunities for hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs , the same transformations have brought anxiety for those used to a constitutionally guaranteed job the inertia of joblessness managers of new private companies say they must dismiss dozens of people to find one not afflicted by the lackadaisical work ethic fostered by the communist system private hotels in warsaw do not even accept applications from former state employees you can see it in unemployment , said dr tamas treuer of the national institute of psychiatry in budapest , who reports a rise in patients it s growing not only because the number of jobs are falling but also because those who end up on the streets are n't ready they do n't have this mentality that says they have to retrain themselves , strike out in a new direction the stress of living without such certainties takes its toll in the last year , suicides rose 10 percent in poland , while suicides in hungary reached a record high in 1990 and declined only slightly in 1991 in warsaw , schools are hiring psychologists to help children cope poland s annual consumption of hard liquor has risen from about 65 liters per capita in the 1980 s to 10 last year over all , life is no longer predictable , and that is painful the state when does 'they' become 'us' \? as a system , communism functioned with the help of vast , intrusive police structures the state was viewed as an enemy , to be cheated whenever possible , and the attitude of most people toward work could be summed up in the old joke they pretend to pay us we pretend to work today each country , from albania to lithuania , has had popular elections , most won by anticommunist dissidents but without the coercion of the riot police and the oneparty state , these fledgling democracies are having a hard time persuading people to take advantage of their new rights and observe their basic civic duties budget deficits are widening because new private companies are paying only small fractions of the taxes they owe smuggling is rampant car theft has risen sharply 'repugnance for power' the impression is particularly reinforced in dealings with the bureaucracy , from the post office to the city hall letters from overseas are still routinely opened in poland underpaid clerks snarl at citizens who lack the correct documents there is little sense that taxpayers have any right to expect better 'repugnance for power' to understand this matter would take 40 years , said lubos dobrovsky , the czechoslovak defense minister and a longtime anticommunist dissident forty years we 've spent in such an environment , 40 years when you were permanently resisting 40 years in which if you had power , you repressed your adversary 40 years in which even if you were n't being repressed , you had a feeling of repugnance for power on a recent radio callin show on the bbc , president lech walesa of poland acknowledged that many eastern europeans had not yet accepted that they have become us perhaps we should use the intellectual capacity , the patriotism , the education system to influence what i would call the national spirit , to make sure that people know these countries are now ours , mr walesa said the people 'homo sovieticus , ' a picture of inertia to a much greater extent than in western europe or america , the end of cold war has heralded noticeable , even dizzying changes in daily life freedom has meant sex shops and peep shows , gun stores , mercedes dealerships , suburbs for the rich it has brought choices in radio stations and newspapers , and homeless people in train stations , and more crime
east rutherford , nj , aug 24 the giants received mixed reviews today about the health of jeff hostetler , their starting quarterback xrays showed no broken bones , but his back spasms continued , and he has been ruled out of practice this week and out of the final preseason game , against the steelers saturday night in pittsburgh hostetler suffered a bruised pelvis and lower back when he was driven to the ground by the jets' dennis byrd on saturday night today , hostetler drove to the hospital for special surgery in manhattan , where he underwent tests and was examined by dr russell warren , the giants' orthopedic surgeon warren reported that xrays on hostetler s back , hip and pelvis were negative he said the back spasms were caused by the hit he ordered twiceaday therapy involving icing and electrical stimulation for the quarterback at giants stadium hostetler will also undergo daily therapy in a pool phil simms , the starting quarterback until hostetler got the job last year , will assume the no 1 role again for at least the steelers game on sunday , coach ray handley sounded confident that hostetler would be ready for the regularseason opener sept 6 against the san francisco 49ers at giants stadium now , handley said , i'm sure it will depend on how he responds to therapy this week last year , handley s first as the head coach , he created a controversy late in training camp by choosing hostetler , a longtime backup , as the starting quarterback over the popular simms now , if simms has a big game , handley would face another controversy when hostetler missed the last four games last year with an unrelated back injury , handley made it clear that hostetler would be the starting quarterback this year at the beginning of training camp last month , handley said hostetler would keep the job unless he had a terrible camp hostetler has not done especially well in preseason games , but his performance has not been disastrous meanwhile , the offensive players offered mixed reviews about their ineffectiveness in preseason everyone agreed there was too much inconsistency and too many mistakes but there was general optimism that more repetitions in practice would solve that winning but not moving in winning two of their three preseason games , the giants have averaged 2783 yards a game , which is only fair saturday night , in a 2014 loss to the jets , they gained only 100 yards in the first 42 minutes while the jets were building a 200 lead hostetler and simms have unusually low statistics in passing efficiency , and the offense has caused problems for itself drive after drive we get to the red area and we ca n't score , said fullback jarrod bunch it s not one person on the offense , it s all of us we have an offside we have a holding penalty we miss an assignment it s always mistakes at the wrong time brian williams , the backup center and guard , offered more it s penalties , missed blocks , not picking up a blitz , not being consistent , he said why \? we 're trying to find out why there s no reason we ca n't change it we 're still positive jim fassel , the offensive coordinator , said he was confident the errors would end i do n't like it , he said you hear all kinds of reasons why things are n't going right , but the bottom line is that they 're all excuses we need to be better , but i do n't think it s as bad as you might think it s like driving a car if your hands are on the wheel , you feel better than if you 're a passenger we will do something about it we will control our destiny on offense 'we 're close' offensive tackle jumbo elliott said the problems would be resolved we 're close , he said errors like this happen every year to every team you look at opponents' defenses and see tons of errors , but we have n't taken advantage because we blew some things , too now the giants will try to eliminate the inconsistencies before the opening game we do have time , simms said we have two long weeks extra points gary reasons , the giants' veteran inside linebacker , underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test on monday on his sprained left knee there was no immediate report , but reasons was optimistic because he was walking without the crutches he needed on sunday the giants reduced the roster to 61 by placing on injured reserve wide receiver millard hamilton \( knee \) and running back charlie young \( neck \) and waiving 13 players , none a surprise jumbo elliott took part in monday s practice despite having bruised ribs photo injured quarterback jeff hostetler will miss the giants' final preseason game saturday night \( associated press \)
tokyo , july 26 when secretary of state james a baker 3d set off on his weeklong swing through the middle east , he declared that now that the israeli government was signaling a willingness to compromise , it was time for the arabs to indicate some new flexibility as well but few such public signals came from the arab side during mr baker s trip , which ended today after a twoday swing through asia there were some grudging arab statements of praise for the new israeli prime minister , yitzhak rabin , but there was nothing from damascus or amman or lebanon or jidda , or from the palestinians , that mr rabin could use to fend off rightwing critics who say that his partial freeze on settlementbuilding in the occupied west bank and gaza strip was a giveaway to the arabs reasons for hesitancy mr rabin has been in office less than two weeks , and arab governments are waiting to see if he lives up to his promises after dealing with an israeli likud government that did everything it could to drag its feet , the arab leaders want to make sure mr rabin is for real before they commit themselves also contributing to the arabs' lack of response is the concern , expressed in every arab capital that mr baker visited , that mr baker s putative plans to leave the state department and lead president bush s reelection campaign will sap virtually all of the american energy from the peace process and that everything will just be put on hold at each stop arab leaders have pulled aside members of mr baker s delegation to ask whether the rumors that he is leaving are true at each stop , they were told the company line there is no decision but the answer did not satisfy the arabs , who say they must consider the wisdom of making gestures toward israel that might hurt them politically at home , only to fall into a black hole abroad it s over , is n't it \? one arab diplomat quietly whispered to members of mr baker s party the rumors around mr baker are lameducking us , a senior state department official complained promises must be met arab leaders are also beginning to understand that if mr rabin comes forward with serious offers for palestinian selfrule in the occupied territories and for better relations with syria and jordan , the arabs are going to be called upon to match him with concrete steps up to now , the only big concession the arab leaders have had to make was a symbolic one they had to sit down at the same table with the israelis but none have made any compromises on the basic notion that they should get all of their land back in return for unspecified peaceful arrangements with israel since the hardline government of yitzhak shamir did not appear interested in offering the arabs anything , or even in testing their willingness to trade land for peace , the arabs could stand on this principle , certain that mr shamir would never really ask them to meet him halfway 'a major leap forward' but those days may be over we are at the historic point now where arabs and israelis are negotiating about the practicalities of coexistence , mutual security guarantees and a new middle eastern order in which israel lives as one of many equal states in the region , rami khouri , a jordanian political commentator , wrote in the jordan times this week symbolic gestures will not be enough to make true progress in the peace talks the moment of truth is at hand real and substantial concessions will have to be made very soon , in return for which we can expect to achieve palestinian and arab rights ultimately , mr khouri concluded , this will require a major leap forward in our ability to see the israelis as permanent and peaceful neighbors that is a serious challenge , but for now it has not been addressed by any arab leader except president hosni mubarak of egypt , who immediately invited mr rabin to cairo , where he visited tuesday king waits to see consider , for example , what king hussein of jordan had to say at his news conference with mr baker last week when asked what the arabs might do to build confidence in response to mr rabin s plans to curtail building in the occupied areas i think this will have to wait until the process begins again and we can see where we are and where we 're headed , said the king , referring to the resumption of arabisraeli peace talks , which could be as early as aug 10 , in washington we are still trying to figure out how we move from here , but there are promising signs and we are very encouraged after a meeting of syrian , jordanian , lebanese and palestinian foreign ministers on saturday , syria s foreign minister , farouk alsharaa , acknowledged mr rabin s change of tone and style , but he said israel had yet to make a sufficient commitment to peace asked on thursday about how to ease relations with the new israeli leader , mr sharaa said do n't forget that the arab side has done all it could to make the peace process a possibility if there were some obstacles to the peace process during the last 10 months , it was due to the fact that the shamir government did not want to make any peace so do n't ask the arab side to make any further gestures it is now the turn of the new israeli government to make a new and radical change in the israeli position in order to match the arab position
it used to be that automotive technology had to do with well , with cars ultimately , if you were a manufacturer , you went with cadillac s electric starter or with ford s inexpensive v8 or with plymouth s hydraulic brakes these days , though , the innards are pretty much alike to be sure , some cars lack air bags and antilock brakes , but those things will come , dictated by the marketplace and so , more and more , the technology has to do not with rods and levers and multiplevalve engines , but with the periphery there are things , for instance , like sound systems with compactdisk changers mounted in the trunk there are pushbutton keychains to let you unlock the doors or open the trunk as you approach the car there are dashboard video screens and radar addons that beep if you get too close to the car in front things now work with infrared rays and sonic senders and microwaves , and none of them have a lot to do with the actual mechanical function of the car but they are where we are and , face it , they are kind of neat the latest of these peripherals combines oldsmobile s builtin video screen with a network of smart roads in orlando , fla , where a yearlong test of travtek began last week the name , short for travel technology , designates a 12 million project that , at long last , could make reality of the future that was forecast at the 1939 world s fair and that kept a lot of us reading popular science magazine through the 40 s , 50 s , 60 s , 70 s and 80 s the idea is a system to help drivers through various technologies including triangulation by satellite to find out where they are and where they would like to be travtek provides instant access to video map displays , gives you audio and visual driving directions , tells you about current traffic conditions , and can even make a reservation at a fourstar restaurant well , maybe partners in the experiment , among others , are the national highway traffic safety administration , avis rent a car system , general motors , navigation technologies corporation , etak incorporated and motorola at the announcement in orlando , secretary of transportation andrew card said the project was much needed and would explore technologies to ease traffic congestion and improve travel conditions in many american cities the test will involve 100 '92 olds toronados whose computers receive information on traffic conditions from orlando s traffic management center the information , in turn , comes from highway video cameras , road sensors , emergency vehicles and construction reports each car s location is pinpointed by the satellite and through compasses and wheel sensors on a computerized dashboard map that operates with a database provided by the american automobile association while driving , the map and the audio information , tell you exactly where you are and where to turn when the car is parked , the dashboard display offers information on hotels , restaurants , attractions and special events in the area by all accounts , it works wonderfully well , although the start of the project was less than auspicious robert frosch , a general motors vice president and one of the first drivers to try it out , got into his toronado , started the engine , checked the information and put the olds into gear he ran over an orange traffic cone and smashed it flat meanwhile , the university of michigan has put out a forecast for the automobile industry through the end of the century , and the study notes that electronic components , currently amounting to 10 percent of a car s value , will climb to nearly 20 percent of the total value in the next eight years the survey , based on responses from more than 200 engineers , scholars and consultants , also notes that government regulations rather than fuel prices will force major changes in the design of automobiles the price of gas , the study said , will increase modestly through the year 2005 , rising to about 175 per gallon in 1990 dollars according to the study , regulations will mandate fuel economy increases from today s level of 275 miles per gallon to 30 mpg for 1995 , 33 for the year 2000 , and 36 mpg for 2005 in order to meet those standards , the university report said , manufacturers will reduce the weight of vehicles through the use of more plastics , aluminum , magnesium and powdered metals recycling will be a big issue in the future , according to david cole , director of the school s office for the study of automotive transportation , and manufacturers eventually may be required to buy used cars back from their customers not surprisingly , cole also said that air bags will be standard for the driver and frontseat passenger on all cars produced in america by the end of the decade but he added that air bags to protect rear occupants and to ward off side impacts will be widely available and , he said , radar controlled brakes and alarms to prevent collisions are on their way seems to me i read something about that i think it was in popular science somewhere around 1948 photos on the road , the vido map pinpoints the vehicle s location and offers options when the car is parked , a videoscreen menu provides access to maps and other information , including location and pricing of restaurants , hotels and local attractions
leavenworth , kan , july 6 one inmate was stabbed to death sunday night during an uprising by 300 prisoners at the maximumsecurity federal prison here the leavenworth penitentiary was in lockdown today , and 19 inmates , none of whom were involved in the disturbance , were moved to another prison , said chuck strickland , a prison spokesman he did not say why the 19 were chosen the dead inmate was identified as winford brown , 23 years old , of mulberry grove , ill he was serving an eightyear sentence for armed robbery
measured by political handicappers' cliche standards , none of the three presidential candidates committed a dreaded gaffe in last night s third debate neither did any of them deliver a decisive knockout punch indeed , the three had little to say they had n't already said in their previous joint appearances even so , this round was probably as valuable as any other part of the campaign so far even if the candidates' tunes do n't change much , the audience does public has been a moving target all year , and now america is paying attention president bush , while maintaining dignity , seemed stronger and more focused than in debates one and two he delivered one vintage bushism , railing at bill clinton s 9090 hindsight but mostly he hewed with discipline to his theme the public had better watch its wallet against the depredations of his taxandspend democratic opponent governor clinton , berating mr bush s readmylips pledge not to raise taxes , came close to making one of his own \( i will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs \) but he also maintained the personable warmth in which he has , increasingly , wrapped his investandgrow prescriptions ross perot offered more goodnatured salesmanship with sentences starting see , and please , folks , and proclaimed that he would spend 60 million on his campaign but he was steelier at other moments , notably in deriding mr bush for mistakes in panama and iraq all told , last night s event offered a fair summary of all the debates , and the campaign even the format , divided between jim lehrer as an admirably skillful single interrogator and a panel of reporters , blended that of the other debates in any case , probably the biggest change at this stage is not what happens on stage but in the audience while political junkies have been paying close attention for a year or more , the public generally has only recently started to do so but it is doing so more intently than usual in 1988 , 66 percent of the public reported watching the first debate this year the figure was 75 percent what proportion of the public is paying attention to the campaign \? at this juncture in 1988 , the answer was 34 percent in 1992 , 54 percent and reflecting this interest , voter registration is up in every region when the candidates first announced so many debates , they provoked fear of overload it s clear that the four debates could have been constructively spaced out but even compressed , they have instructed millions eager for instruction the campaign is far from over among other things , ross perot plans hours more tv but the audience has already been well served
trenton , nov 7 after three straight years of fiscal crisis , beleaguered new jersey budget makers may be about to tangle with the worst budget year yet barring a bold upswing in the economy , which most analysts consider unlikely , the state is looking at yet another year of lean revenues furthermore , in closing last year s budget gap , legislators used nearly a billion dollars in onetime opportunities , like a revaluing of pension plans , that will not be available again in addition to the loss of onetime revenues , said treasurer samuel f crane , health care reform will have to be added , along with new correctional facilities medicaid grows 200 million plus per year i think it s safe to say that growth in revenue will not match growth in expenditures , mr crane said planning process starts the current budget , itself cut sharply in the legislature this year , producing a painful round of job cuts at state agencies , runs through june of next year but the state s 19 department heads are already drafting their requests for the next budget , which gov jim florio is to submit to the legislature in january mr crane expects economic growth to produce at best only a modest increase in revenues the republican assembly speaker , garabed \( chuck \) haytaian , has a rosier forecast he said he was optimistic that the state would pull out of the economic doldrums and see enough growth in the next 18 months , through the next fiscal year , to meet budget demands there has already been some growth in the economy , he said by july 1 of 1994 , we should be out of the doldrums i think the economy will be humming along by then and if not \? if the economy stays flat \? mr haytaian said we would be 12 billion , or 13 billion short of this year anger over taxes that would mean that the state would have only about 134 billion or less to spend compared to the 146 billion budgeted this year , which is itself more than a billion dollars less than the governor asked for but mr haytaian also says a tax increase would be literally impossible , with anger still simmering over the record 28 billion increase in sales and income taxes in 1990 the state over the last two years has significantly cut its work force , through attrition and layoffs , from 71 , 000 to 66 , 000 if revenues do not pick up as he expects , mr haytaian says , we still think there are areas in the present budget we can go into for further reductions , including , he said , the departments of human services , transportation and corrections onetime fiscal devices the bleak fiscal situation did not develop overnight , nor did it have a single cause because of the bad economy , tax collections have been almost flat for three years the salestax rollback reduced revenue by 608 million this year to balance the budget in the face of the severe revenue reductions , the florio administration has resorted to several onetime devices this year , for example , the state managed to raise 12 billion through a change in the method of valuing pension funds last year , it accelerated collection of utilities taxes and raised 150 million paying for past gimmicks but in the coming budget , the state will pay for the gimmicks it has used the pension revaluation benefit , for example , means 773 million less in the new budget , and accelerated collections of utilities taxes will also provide 110 million less next year than this year that means that if all else stays even , the state will have 883 million less in the next budget than it now has and the republican legislature , to keep its promise to continue to hold the line on taxes , has already imposed a series of revenue measures such as fee increases that cannot be stretched much farther hospital admission fees , for example , were raised from 355 to 5 to get 1 million more in revenue the amount the elderly and others chip in as copayments for prescription drugs was raised from 2 to 5 , which raised about 16 million a similar increase in the prescription fee for state employees raised another 3 million all told , the fee increases in the budget produced about 24 million in new revenues there have also been a rash of separate bills that would raise other fees or return money to the treasury from other sources one measure , for example , would raise 47 million by returning certain savings in local pension funds to the state further cuts possible another would increase the fee for filing for divorce from 35 to 160 another would increase beverage license fees to raise another 12 million another would impose a 15 surcharge for certain traffic violations none of these raise large amounts of new revenue , but the grumbling and complaining even over them will make further such increases difficult to make up for the tax cut and other budget problems , the legislature also cut the homestead rebate program by more than half , from 685 million to 300 million , eliminating or sharply reducing rebate checks the florio administration is already trying to turn the rebate reduction to its political favor the democratic state committee is running radio ads pummeling the republican legislature for cutting the rebates , and the governor is sending out letters , at at cost of 250 , 000 to taxpayers , reminding those who got a check of up to 500 last year why they are getting none or less this year
atlanta , feb 29 in theory , the battle for southern voters revolves around the stereotypical white southerner , usually known as bubba , who is partial to country music and conservative politics but as presidential politics move into the states of the confederacy , the biggest question about bubba may not be how he will vote but how to find him because of the importance of black voters , an influx of newcomers to the south , a moderating influence on many whites from growing economic strength and modest electoral participation by workingclass whites , primary voting in the south no longer lives up to the stereotypes the main thing about bubba is that bubba has n't been voting much in the democratic primary or the republican primary , said prof earl black , a political scientist at the university of south carolina to the extent he s been voting , it s mostly been in the general election south takes center stage still , conservative bluecollar whites could be important this year as swing voters who may help decide the course of both the republican and democratic races their votes could be particularly important to patrick j buchanan on the republican side and gov bill clinton of arkansas on the democratic beginning with the primary here in georgia on tuesday and the south carolina primary saturday , the south dominates the political calendar for the next 10 days it culminates with super tuesday on march 10 , when 11 states will vote , including texas , florida , louisiana , mississippi and tennessee in the south , and the border states oklahoma and missouri until the last two decades , only one party primary mattered in the south it was democratic , and largely reflected the conservative tendencies of the region but several factors , including the rising importance of black voters , have changed that professor black s book , the vital south , \( harvard university press , 1992 \) , which he wrote with his brother , merle black , a political science professor at emory university , notes that as late as 1960 there were no black delegates from the south at the democratic national convention in 1968 , blacks made up 10 percent of the southern delegates by 1988 blacks were a third of southern delegates , exceeding their share of the total population and reflecting their importance in the primary electorate stereotype is void polls of voters leaving the polling places after the 1988 presidential primaries in the south indicated how much democratic primary voters now differ from the stereotypical southerner in the states with primaries in the next two weeks , only in tennessee did whites raised in the south account for half of the democratic primary voters in mississippi and alabama , blacks made up almost half the electorate in texas , blacks were 23 percent of the voters and hispanic people accounted for 11 percent only in florida and tennessee did minorities make up less than a third of the electorate , but the dominant group of voters in florida is one of whites raised outside the south , who accounted for 56 percent of the voters the minority vote was inflated somewhat in 1988 , when the rev jesse jackson was in the race , but the basic trends were clear , professor earl black said the democratic vote was dominated by blacks and moderatetoliberal whites widening the electorate on the republican side , party primaries have long been the preserve of the suburban whitecollar conservatives , although professor black says that mr buchanan has the potential to bring out some bluecollar voters the potential is particularly strong in states like georgia , where voters can cast ballots for candidates of either party pat buchanan is the ideal candidate to bring them out , professor black said he s throwing out a lot of red meat louisiana and florida are the only two of the seven southern states holding primaries in the next two weeks that limit voting by party registration but demographic factors , as well as political ones , will determine the electorate in florida , the least typically southern state in the region , blacks are likely to make up about 15 percent to 25 percent of the democratic electorate , with hispanic people probably accounting for another 5 to 10 percent , said george oster , political director of the florida democratic party florida s such as diverse state , he said there is less of a tendency in florida for the automatic vote for the southern candidate than in the rest of the south republicans near parity the growth has made florida , along with south carolina , one of two southern states where the republican party is nearing parity with the democrats in 1988 , 901 , 000 voters turned out for the republican primary in florida and 12 million voted in the democratic one stan smith , spokesman for the florida republican party , said the people moving from other regions are the backbone of the republican primary there are communities that will turn out heavily in this primary that literally did n't exist in the last presidential election , he said presidential primaries have different histories in different states , so it is hard to generalize about turnout
vice president dan quayle says bill clinton is trying to straddle the death penalty issue by declaring that he might appoint someone like gov mario cuomo of new york to the supreme court mr quayle accuses mr clinton of inconsistency for claiming to favor the death penalty while saying that mr cuomo , an opponent of capital punishment , would make a good justice you ca n't have it both ways , says mr quayle the vice president displays ignorance or indifference about the basic distinction in the american legal system between policy and constitutionality politicians are supposed to take policy positions and act on them justices are supposed to decide whether laws are constitutional regardless of whether they favor them former chief justice warren burger , no less , declared that if he were a legislator he 'd oppose capital punishment , yet he voted to uphold its constitutionality mr cuomo has vetoed 10 death penalty bills , none of which give any clue to how he would vote on their constitutionality on the bench not only can you have it both ways under our system , you must separate what s personally preferred from what s constitutional it comes as a jolt to find that mr quayle does n't recognize this after four years in office

inventing times square commerce and culture at the crossroads of the world edited by william r taylor illustrated 467 pp new york russell sage foundation 3995 one evening in 1919 , a short , shy fellow named irving caesar , who was just short of his 25th birthday , sat close to the stage of one of the cavernous theaters on times square and took in a performance of the song swanee , which he had written with george gershwin the song was a great early triumph for gershwin , of course , and became the signature piece for the man who performed it that night , al jolson as jolson sang , mr caesar recalled in a conversation in his broadway office a full seven decades later , the young man felt bombarded by the excitement and spectacle it had something to do with jolson s presence , he thought , and the howl of applause , and the 60 showgirls stretched in a line with light bulbs beaming through their transparent high heels mr caesar is not mentioned in the 23 essays that make up inventing times square , a volume culled from two years of seminars by urban studies scholars meeting at new york university but noted and amply analyzed is just about every major cultural force that could have contributed to putting him in the middle of this place in the first half of the century , when to be there was to be at the center of a world of flash , trash and pop genius unlike anything before the lyricist of tea for two and i want to be happy may be surprised to learn in this book of his debt to late 19thcentury liberal protestant theology , to say nothing of the establishment of tourism as an industry , the transformation of new york city zoning regulations or the predepression accumulation of capital on wall street forces cited here as contributing to making times square the nation s cultural and commercial powerhouse together , the essays present a portrait of preworld war ii america in goodnatured upheaval , shaking off convention and inventing and reinventing an unpredictable commercial culture that thrived in times square until , in recent decades , it was preempted by what the book s editor , william r taylor , a historian at the state university of new york , stony brook , defines as a standardized mass culture as one contributor , william leach , who is now writing a history of american consumer culture , says qualities once seen as subversive and immoral and as existing on the margins of american culture gradually moved to the heart of that culture carnival color and light , wishing , desiring , dreaming , spending and speculation , theatricality , luxury and unmitigated pursuit of personal pleasure and gain these qualities were 'consumerist' and are today thought of by many americans \( and by people wanting to come to this country \) as the most seductive features of american life and as somehow intrinsic to what it means to be an american none of the essays which cover topics as diverse as irving berlin and times square s gay underground are without interest , but those that are most intriguing deal with a breaking down of walls between classes , cultures , neighborhoods , pools of money , egos the result , at its best , was a sort of hyperegalitarianism that still characterizes the city at its most exuberant missing from the book is what others in words , song and spectacle have captured so well the flavor of this world and what it was like to taste it this shortcoming notwithstanding , if there is a latent point to the book , it is just how seemingly ignorant and disrespectful of the area is the huge city and state plan to replace times square with an office park duded up with lights and with some restored theaters that will fail to mask the plan s monolithic blandness this emerges full blast in an elegant and biting afterword by ada louise huxtable , for many years the architecture critic of the new york times from the start , the premises of the development project were wrong , she writes this was a backfromthedead example of the thoroughly discredited bulldozer urban renewal of the 1960 s it was predicated solely on the aims and principles of private development , even though it was a publicly sponsored and assisted project which used substantial amounts of public money in mrs huxtable s eyes , the cleanup promised by these buildings was a convenient cover for conventional development lighting , building setbacks and other zoning features mandated around times square by the city are a kind of splendid wallpaper , or light show for a performance that is n't there if the city chose to , it could try to reinvent times square in a way that , despite the physical realities of the development project , is truer to the ethnic , economic and cultural mix that percolates through these pages many of the new buildings in the times square area stand empty or nearly so , and there s no reason that eventually they should have to be filled entirely with lawyers , accountants and executives from companies looking for skyscraper fire sales with some government inducements , they might be filled with the back offices that large corporations are moving out of the city in droves and that provide whatever 90 s equivalents there are to the entrylevel jobs that new york boasted in times square s heyday the work force would no doubt be more varied in every way , and on payday it would no doubt be looking for some new forms of popular entertainment what better place than times square \?
gov bill clinton has a big new york office overlooking times square when he arrives here on saturday the arkansas governor will probably move right into the regency hotel on park avenue until the state s primary on april 7 paul e tsongas s campaign has its new york headquarters in the dark basement of a soho brownstone when the former massachusetts senator shows up later this week , he will stay upstairs in the same building , in the guest room of his new york chairman , jim armenakis it s so much easier that way , said mr armenakis , whose apartment and law offices are above the campaign headquarters on greene street in manhattan that way paul can take a walk in a nice neighborhood and be right on top of the campaign machinery and paul is definitely not a guy who likes hotels much edmund g brown jr , the former governor of california , has not even decided where he will stay or exactly when he will come to new york , campaign aides said yesterday but , whenever possible , the cashstrapped candidate tries to stay with friends 244 delegates at stake although mr tsongas and mr clinton have been busy dueling in the midwest , officials from both of their campaigns describe success in the new york primary as crucial , for 244 delegates to the democratic national convention will be selected and the national spotlight of media attention always shines harshly here and although mr brown has only his 800 number and a growing band of volunteers to fortify him , he also hopes to do well in new york , where labor leaders who are disenchanted with the other two democratic candidates have begun to embrace him people say it could all be over by new york , said carter eskew , a washington media consultant who works in new york frequently but is not representing a presidential candidate this year but it s never totally over before new york it s too important a state for the democrats the media is so aggressive , and the attention can force candidates to make errors that will hurt them down the road if mr clinton turns in a strong showing today in the labororiented , financially bruised states of illinois and michigan , many political analysts have said the democratic race will have essentially ended mr armenakis disagrees clinton has done nothing outside his region , the tsongas campaign manager said there will be a pitched battle over new york , and new york is a state with so many different kinds of voters it s not a single issue , or single region if you get away from the interpretations put out by our opponents for a moment , it seems clear that this race can go all the way to the convention even if it did , many new yorkers now say mr clinton will have to defeat himself to lose the nomination he has raised at least twice as much money as mr tsongas , and if new york state is any indication , his political power remains far greater ask harold ickes jr , mr clinton s campaign manager in new york , who in the state has endorsed governor clinton and an aide immediately provides computergenerated lists that are updated weekly dozens of city and state officials have endorsed mr clinton , including representatives stephen j solarz of brooklyn and thomas j manton of queens ask mr armenakis for a similar list , and he replies we are not ready yet to distribute a list of endorsements we do not feel that political structure or advertising or pollsters are what the campaign is about we feel it will be about votes true but votes have a way of following dollars and the support of established political leaders the clinton organization has worked harder in new york than any other , as the nearly 60 , 000 signatures they gathered for the state primary ballot would indicate mr brown got fewer than 20 , 000 and mr tsongas barely rounded up the 10 , 000 signatures needed to appear on the ballot mr tsongas also has another problem in new york mr brown has begun to supplant him among certain constituencies in his quest to appear as the lone voice of courage and iconoclasm and in new york , where labor remains strong and democrats like to believe that big government can still be good government , the clinton message that at least some regulation and government assistance remains essential has found a following clinton has worked hard and earned a lot of support here , said the state democratic party chairman , john a marino , who like his boss , gov mario m cuomo , will not make any endorsement in the primary he did well with africanamericans down south now it will be interesting to see how well he can do in places like chicago and detroit that will give us a sense of his support here i think mr marino said governor cuomo would almost certainly be pleased to see all three of the democratic candidates if they should wish to travel to albany and each candidate has said he would be interested in visiting mr cuomo , who has had a testy relationship with mr clinton but who has become more accommodating as mr clinton seems the likely nominee high expectation for brown but none of the candidates would say for certain that they wished to see mr cuomo , fearing that the governor would be busy on the day they wished to see him several state politicians , including mr marino , said they expected mr brown to gather the most support over the next few weeks , particularly if he does well in michigan , where public opinion polls show him steadily gaining support new york is one of the last bastions of organized labor in the nation , and union support can be particularly valuable in primaries because members tend to vote in blocks and in large numbers the truth is neither bill clinton or paul tsongas has descended from heaven , said jan pierce , vice president of the communication workers of america in charge of the eightstate region that includes new york i have personally decided to endorse governor brown , and i will recommend to my members that they do the same of the three remaining candidates he is by far the best for labor asked if he minded supporting a candidate who is given little chance of actually becoming president , mr pierce laughed i do n't believe a real leader should compromise his principles in a primary , he said there will be plenty of time for that in the general election photo the accommodations of the democratic party contenders will vary from a regency hotel suite to the basement of a soho brownstone for the frontrunner , campaign workers of gov bill clinton yesterday were already sending out campaign literature from offices in times square \( james

kiev , ukraine , march 20 animosity between ukraine and russia broke into the open at a summit meeting of the commonwealth of independent states today the ukrainian president , leonid m kravchuk , publicly lambasted russia and the commonwealth , saying they had failed to resolve a single political or military problem as ukrainian demonstrators outside branded the commonwealth as a successor to the evil empire , mr kravchuk asserted that the threemonthold association of former soviet republics had failed to follow up on any of its decisions , and had proved helpless to stop ethnic conflicts in the caucasus and in moldova the meeting itself once again skirted the most divisive issues and concentrated on a series of agreements on the joint commonwealth armed forces but that agenda only underscored the rift , since ukraine which along with azerbaijan and moldova has announced plans for its own army did not participate in a single decision yeltsin is contradicted on the contrary , mr kravchuk angrily denied that he had telephoned the russian president , boris n yeltsin , to say he was reversing his decision to suspend the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from ukraine to russia , as mr yeltsin asserted earlier this week mr kravchuk said icily that he had not telephoned the russian president since feb 16 mr yeltsin made no comment last week , mr kravchuk unexpectedly announced that he was suspending the transfer of battlefield nuclear weapons to russia because he had no guarantee that russia was destroying them several days later , mr yeltsin told legislators that mr kravchuk had telephoned to say the transfer would continue ukraine s angry stance at the oneday summit meeting strengthened the growing impression of the commonwealth as a shaky and ineffective mechanism , and of ukraine as the member with the strongest sense of grievance none of the representatives of 11 other fledgling states publicly shared mr kravchuk s denunciations on the contrary , in a poll of the leaders at the news conference , all but mr kravchuk declared their support mr yeltsin , sitting two seats away from mr kravchuk but studiously avoiding contact with the ukrainian president , offered an upbeat assessment of the meeting that seemed to stand in deliberate contrast to the ukrainian s yeltsin emphasizes positive there was no breakthrough the meeting was a routine one , but it was productive , mr yeltsin said in three previous meetings we could not resolve military questions today all legal problems with the military have been decided this has colossal significance as concerns skepticism about the cis , he continued , alluding to mr kravchuk , i do not share it we are at one time creating the cis and statehood in each new state this is obviously a difficult process , but it is only skeptics who say the cis was needed only to dismantle the old union i never said this i believed and believe in the commonwealth diplomats and officials said mr kravchuk s militancy probably derived as much from a need to play to the home audience as from a sense of being slighted by russia in the months since the creation of the commonwealth , a powerful notion has spread through ukraine that russia is manifesting great power chauvinism and is undermining ukraine s sovereignty at every turn the animosity has been fanned by a strong sense that russia is gobbling up all the assets of the soviet union , and is being assisted in this by the west many officials in moscow and kiev believe that mr kravchuk s decision to suspend withdrawal of the tactical nuclear weapons was intended above all as a forceful demonstration of his irritation with the attitude not only of moscow but also of the west mr kravchuk has generally resisted bashing moscow in public , and in fact he has called for reason in relations with the giant neighbor but officials said that having the commonwealth leaders meet on his turf compelled him to make a good show of militancy characterizing russia they said that he was also probably stung by mr yeltsin s report of the private phone call , which put him in a humiliating position , and that he was becoming genuinely irritated at russia s resistance to sharing the assets of the former union mr kravchuk s strongest assault on russia , which drew some applause from ukrainian reporters , was an invocation of the image of a russia permanently given to imperial ambition when we gathered in minsk , in almaata and in other capitals , i had an unpleasant feeling that i now have finally understood , he said all participants were complaining about russia , that russia was not behaving this way or that way russia behaves as she does and cannot behave otherwise , because russia s behavior is determined by objective criteria ukraine will also behave as she is compelled to by objective circumstances we should not complain we act in the interests of our own people , and will not bend georgia attends as observer all 11 members of the commonwealth attended the summit meeting , though azerbaijan was represented by a junior official because of the government crisis there georgia , which has yet to join , sent an observer the original agenda of the summit meeting included more than 30 items of these , 21 were discussed , and decisions were reached on 17 , officials said issues on which participants failed to reach decisions were the core questions in the dismantling of the former union they included distribution of soviet state property , archives and assets , a common air space and a definition of strategic and conventional forces the last is critical in the disputes between russia and ukraine over the black sea fleet and other forces all commonwealth states have agreed to joint control over strategic arms , but russia and ukraine have squabbled over exactly what that entails agreement on peacekeepers the leaders agreed to a proposal by kazakhstan to form a military peacekeeping force but it was left for the future to decide what sort of force this would be , and ukraine , despite mr kravchuk s complaints about inaction in various ethnic conflicts , left its participation open though not dramatic , the decisions seemed to suggest that members other than ukraine seemed prepared to treat the association as a standing forum for working out differences mr kravchuk , however , set his tone before the summit meeting began everything had deteriorated since the minsk summit meeting in late december , he told reporters , and the cis has not solved a single important military or political problem it was unable to do anything about fighting in nagornokarabakh or in moldova , on ukraine s border , where slavic residents have fought the dominant ethnic romanians economically , we are not even on the edge of an abyss we 're fully in it , mr kravchuk said if this continues , the entire existence of the cis is questionable kazakh backs commonwealth other delegates seemed to distance themselves from the ukrainian stance i understand the skepticism of some colleagues , said nursultan a nazarbayev , the respected president of kazakhstan i am also in some ways displeased , but i am convinced that there is no other path than the cis to form our states , to quell conflicts when a reporter asked each leader to state whether there was indeed a commonwealth , mr kravchuk was first to answer the name was a hope , he said next was mr yeltsin the commonwealth is a dynamic process i'm convinced that this hope will become reality further down the line came the everpragmatic mr nazarbayev to achieve a hope , you have to fight next to him sat the quiet and practical stanislav s shushkevich , president of the belarus parliament the cis has a lot more reason to be called a 'community' than the ussr ever had , he said

detroit , march 13 this should be a time of high influence and major muscle flexing for organized labor , as the race for the democratic nomination moves into the industrial midwest , to places like flint and saginaw and detroit instead , many in the labor movement find themselves frustrated and divided the candidate of choice for much of labor , senator tom harkin of iowa , faltered in the early contests and finally left the race last monday , just a week before the michigan and illinois primaries this left the united automobile workers , among other unions , without a candidate , and with little time to coalesce around a new favorite , even if it could agree on one many people here say that none of the remaining candidates has captured the hearts of the labor movementthere are no walter f mondales , edward m kennedys or hubert h humphreys here , men with a a long and affectionate history with labor gov bill clinton of arkansas has some potent union support , notably the american federation of state , county and municipal employees' affiliates in michigan and illinois but some labor leaders talk openly of their disenchantment with this field at this point , i 'd prefer to see a brokered convention , said william bywater , president of the international union of electrical workers , who complained bitterly of the impact of the new hampshire primary on mr harkin my god , the way it is now does n't make any sense , where you 're letting a very tiny percentage of people in a very tiny state determine the outcome brown as a vehicle emblematic of the restless mood in some parts of organized labor is the boomlet here for former gov edmund g brown jr of california there was a vacuum , and i think jerry brown recognized that , said jon ogar , director of communications for the michigan state aflcio so he s been running around the state in a uaw jacket , blasting the free trade pact with mexico , talking about the themes we 've been talking about some people in the labor movement support mr brown because they believe in his record and his oratory , while others see him as a vehicle to slow down mr clinton and force a brokered convention , said one official with ties to several unions in general , local union members in michigan are scattering among the campaigns though they are keenly aware of what that does to their influence it obviously lessens our impact on the election , said mr ogar had harkin stayed in , we would have put on quite an effort the lack of a consensus labor candidate is hardly unprecedented in 1988 , by the time the race reached michigan , representative richard a gephardt , gov michael s dukakis and the rev jesse jackson all had their share of labor support the anomaly , in retrospect , might have been 1984 , when mr mondale won the endorsement of the aflcio mr mondale went on to take a beating in the general election as the candidate too beholden to constituent groups , but the labor support was crucial in the primaries to holding off the determined challenge of former senator gary hart from the start of the 1992 cycle , it was clear that labor would have a hard time agreeing on a candidate mr harkin had his supporters , but there were also widespread doubts about his electability mr clinton , seen by many party professionals early on as the strongest candidate , picked up some union backing hurdles for clinton but the governor of arkansas had and still has some hurdles to overcome , such as his early support for a freetrade agreement with mexico , and the fact that he comes from a southern state with a righttowork law moreover , some in labor have the same reservations about mr clinton that others in the party have that accusations of infidelity and questions about the draft could prove heavy baggage in a general election on the other hand , former senator paul e tsongas has outraged many union officials by refusing to endorse legislation that outlaws the hiring of permanent replacement workers for striking employees and mr tsongas s message the necessity for democrats to become probusiness liberals is not popular with labor our members are not looking for a good business president , said henry bayer , an official of a public employees union mr brown had a base of labor support , stemming from his days as governor of california , but his outright bid for labor backing the attempt to fill the harkin void has caught hold with some local unions in this state the clinton forces were striking back today , with a news conference by the michigan labor for clinton committee in which mr brown was assailed for his support of a flat income tax questioning brown attacks mr bywater of the electrical workers union says he personally was drawn to mr brown , although he questions some of mr brown s angry attacks on the political system i said to him , jerry , how do you expect to win the convention when the people you need to win it are the same people you 're knocking \? in the end , many union officials said , the ranks of labor will coalesce around the democratic nominee , united by their desire to beat president bush for now , former gov jim blanchard of michigan , a key clinton ally , predicted , the organized labor vote is going in a lot of different directions moreover , mr blanchard said , the potential of labor to deliver a vote is sometimes exaggerated they 're a tremendous ally and wonderfully loyal , he said of the uaw , but you 've got to have more than that to win a democratic primary , even in michigan labor is very important here , but it s as much because of their ideas
three days after endorsing ross perot for president , the rev calvin o butts 3d , pastor of the abyssinian baptist church in harlem , has come under fire from some local black political leaders who have expressed dismay over the minister s choice of candidate , because of mr perot s reference to blacks as you people in a speech last week as head of one the city s largest black churches , which was once headed by representative adam clayton powell jr , mr butts is one of new york s most influential religious and community leaders it remains to be seen what impact mr perot s comments may have on mr butts s standing in the black community those critical of the endorsement said that they were disappointed that mr butts had abandoned the democratic party so early in the campaign to support an independent candidate who has yet to detail his political program they said that mr butts must account for mr perot s comments on saturday before the national association for the advancement of colored people when he referred to blacks as you people and your people 'a white cracker' whatever reverend butts s purpose for supporting ross perot , i have found none of his associates or politicians who understand it , ' said representative charles b rangel of harlem ross perot is merely a white cracker who has no experience dealing with african americans on an equal basis the rev al sharpton , who described himself as a supporter of mr butts , said for a minister to publicly support a candidate before that candidate presents a platform or program is political schizophrenia it s putting the cart before the horse mr sharpton said that mr perot s comments have put mr butts s endorsement and reputation at risk mr butts , who is a cochairman of mr perot s new york state campaign , did not return telephone calls to his church office or home yesterday the minister has publicly criticized the democratic party for failing to address the needs of blacks he has said that he became a supporter of mr perot after speaking to him about race and the economy and that he was particularly impressed by mr perot s support for affirmative action programs a close friend of mr butts , who spoke on the condition that he remain anonymous , said the minister told him that he was endorsing mr perot because he believed that there was little to lose in doing so and that the tide appeared to be shifting overwhelmingly in mr perot s favor my , has that shifted suddenly , the friend said but recent political polls indicate that mr perot s popularity is sinking mr butts , an outspoken , unconventional democrat who has expressed political aspirations , has become known for his aggressive opposition to alcohol and cigarette advertising in black communities the minister was tapped by the perot campaign to enhance mr perot s credibility in the black community the other cochairman of mr perot s new york campaign , alan c greenberg , who is chairman of the bear stearns companies , an investment banking concern , said that mr perot s comments were taken out of context and that the texas billionaire meant no harm by them i think mr perot is a fair , decent person who judges people strictly on their merits , mr greenberg said while not accusing mr perot of being racist , mayor david n dinkins said yesterday that mr perot s remarks clearly reflect that he is removed from the africanamerican community because he did not understand nor appreciate it was offensive an article in new york newsday yesterday quoted mr butts as saying that he was miffed at mr perot s remarks but that he was still dissatisfied with the democratic party deputy mayor bill lynch jr , the mayor s chief political strategist , said that it was too early to determine what impact mr butts s endorsement of mr perot would have on the minister s credibility , especially since he was not an elected official and had a stable following of parishioners who depend on him mainly for spiritual direction i was hoping that reverend butts would stay in the democratic party and work with other black leaders to address our concerns , mr lynch said once you leave the party there is the danger you will never come back , and we need his energy and intelligence photo the rev calvin o butts 3d \( associated press \)
indianapolis , feb 6 when mike tyson s accuser first met the former heavyweight champion at a beauty pageant last july , she was starstruck , flirted with him and was soon talking about his money , four witnesses testified today in his rape trial one of the witnesses , madelyn d whittington , a college senior from ohio , testified that minutes after the 23 contestants in the miss black america pageant were introduced to tyson , the accuser told her of plans to go out with him yes , of course , i'm going , ' whittington quoted the woman as saying 'this is mike tyson he s got a lot of money he s dumb you see what robin givens got out of him' givens , the actress , is tyson s former wife like tyson s accuser , whittington and the three other defense witnesses were contestants in the pageant tyson has been accused of raping the 18yearold woman in the early hours of july 19 the testimony of the four witnesses was meant to bolster one of the main defense contentions that his accuser is a gold digger who from the beginning viewed him as a source of wealth tyson conceded that he had sex with the woman , but he has insisted that she consented a joke about tyson two of the witnesses , cecellia alexander and parquita nassau , recalled with almost the same words , a conversation between tyson s accuser and another contestant , pasha oliver oliver , they said , jokingly referred to tyson as the woman s husband and joked about how inarticulate he was the witnesses said the woman s reply was mike does n't have to know how to speak he 'll make all the money and i 'll do all the talking their testimony came after a oneday delay in the trial caused by a fire early wednesday morning that heavily damaged the hotel in which the jurors were being sequestered two firefighters and a businessman were killed in the blaze , but none of the jurors were injured one juror was apparently too shaken by the fire to continue today the juror , a 36yearold unemployed man , was replaced by one of the alternates , a 44yearold telephone company employee 'was not arson' local officials said today that the fire had probably been triggered by defective wiring in a refrigeration unit on the third floor of the hotel but because the jurors were in the same hotel though on the sixth floor arson investigators have been trying to determine if the fire was more than just a coincidence all the preliminary indications are that this was not arson , jeffrey modisett , the marion county prosecutor , told reporters today in presenting tyson s case , his lead lawyer , vincent j fuller , has contended that the woman fabricated the rape charge after discovering that she would be nothing more than a onenight stand if tyson is convicted of rape , fuller has said , the woman will find it easier to win a civil lawsuit and become , in his words , a very wealthy woman the defense has also asserted that during tyson s 36hour visit to this city , as part of the indiana black expo , a lot of people saw his rude , even lewd , behavior described as friendly his accuser , they have implied , must have been aware of this conduct and , in still agreeing to go out with him , must have been consenting to his sexual advances she has denied seeing or hearing anything that put her on notice about his intentions but christine harris , one of the contestants who testified for the defense today , said she saw nothing offensive in tyson s actions , even describing him as friendly , shy and somewhat reserved the other three all testified to sexually suggestive comments nassau said that when pageant officials introduced tyson to the contestants during the rehearsal , he said that he wanted to have sex with all of them i'm a celebrity and we do that sort of thing , she recalled tyson saying during the opening ceremony later in the afternoon , she said , she ignored tyson s advances if you do n't want to go out with me , i can move on , cause i can have any one of these women , she said tyson had told her then , she said , he grabbed her buttocks she asked why he was disrespecting her and he apologized , she said taken together , the witnesses painted a different portrait of tyson s accuser than that which emerged last week but during crossexamination , the prosecutors did elicit testimony that seemed favorable to them all of them except nassau said that they could not be sure that tyson s accuser had heard his remarks or had seen his behavior and all except nassau said that the hugging and joking between tyson and the woman had appeared to be innocent nassau said tyson s accuser was aware that tyson had asked several of the contestants i saw them cuddling with each other , she said in response to questioning by one of the defense lawyers , f lane heard they looked like they were involved with each other characterized as naive but nassau also provided the prosecution with the strongest support for its characterization of the woman nassau described her as naive and not streetwise in addition to the former contestants , the jury heard from a gynecologist , dr margaret watanabe , who said it was impossible to tell if the two small vaginal abrasions the young woman had were caused by a rape or by consensual sex last week a prosecution witness , dr james akin , said he had performed 20 , 0000 pelvic examinations and that the abrasions that another doctor found on the woman were incredibly unlikely to happen in consensual sex
boston the events in los angeles have had one quite unexpected result they have made millions of americans see their president as a man curiously unconnected to realities of life in the country they share with him mr bush muttered unbelievable , unbelievable as he toured los angeles last week he saw desperate people , black and white and asian people without jobs , without the simplest level of security , without hope and he was evidently shocked by his discovery of that america but there are scenes of desolation and desperation all over this country , and it took no riots or fires to produce them the next time mr bush flies to new york he could drive from la guardia airport across the triborough bridge and straight through the desolate streets of harlem our cities are sick , their people numbed by poverty and crime , their public facilities degraded , their governments unable to keep up with even the need for such necessities as medical care and education open your eyes , and you see neglect race is not the main problem , bad as it is there are crumbling centers of cities and rural towns where there is no element of racial tension the highest concentration of homeless people , per capita , is in new york s affluent westchester county no , the problem is economics the manufacturing that once provided jobs for queens and southcentral los angeles and peoria is vanishing the men and women who did wellpaid work in steel mills and auto plants are lucky to get half as much at a mcdonald s fewer jobs have been created during the bush years than in any administration for decades and it is as if george bush were unaware of those realities he flew around the country to business meetings and 10 , 000atable political dinners , insulated from the struggle for existence he had a oneitem economic program reduce capital gains taxes similarly , mr bush has acted until now as if he had no idea none at all of the ugly realities that black americans face in their lives the boston globe ran a piece last week on how some distinguished black men had been hassled by the police among them a law professor , a television producer and mr bush s own associate attorney general , wayne budd every black person in the country is aware of such experiences but george bush knew nothing of that nor did he see anything wrong with playing the racial card in politics with arousing white fears by talk of willie horton and quotas when the simi valley jury acquitted the los angeles policemen who brutalized rodney king , president bush was unable to come up with a meaningful response first he said , the court system has worked , and what s needed now is calm and respect for the law until the appeals process takes place of course there is no appeal from an acquittal then he talked about law and order , ignoring the hurt felt by blacks and many whites from that verdict next his press secretary tried to blame the riots on 25yearold democratic programs finally , in los angeles , mr bush said , we are embarrassed by interracial violence and prejudice the question is how george bush can be so remote from the realities of his country he is an intelligent man no one can doubt that the criticism of him as a patrician is silly franklin roosevelt , more patrician , connected emotionally to ordinary americans and their problems perhaps mr bush just reflects what has happened to our democracy it is mostly the comfortable who vote and have political influence nowadays perhaps he exists only in that political cocoon or might he , at last , open his mind and heart \? the danger in not hearing , not seeing , is that more and more americans will feel outside the system outside their country james jones , an unemployed black 18yearold in los angeles , said as mr bush toured there i 've got nothing to say to him ai n't nothing going to happen i'm just going to live my little life a koreanamerican woman in los angeles pleaded with mr bush to listen as people were reaching out to you to tell you what we are going through please , please , please , these are lives , these are human beings
dallas , sept 28 when he was a teenager , john bishop was a page for senator barry goldwater , the conservative republican from arizona in his 20 s , he was a selfdescribed hippy hanging out in san francisco s haightashbury district he is now a businessman from sante fe , nm , who says he is willing to stick by his new cause ross perot no matter how much the dallas billionaire may have disappointed him in the past or might again in the future whatever i believe in , i become very committed to , said mr bishop , one of the 52 representatives of mr perot s grassroots organization that have gathered here having heard the pitches from the envoys of the bush and clinton campaigns , these representatives will now travel back to their home states , and improvise their methods of consultation with other perot supporters by using a variety of means , including telephones , faxes and small meetings of county coordinators they are expected to brief other perot backers who have remained involved in the texan s organization to try to learn if they want mr perot to resume his bid for the white house wally howard , an entrepreneur from indianapolis , said he would pass the word to perot supporters in his state by fax and telephone but he could not say if he would be able to contact all of the 144 , 000 people who signed petitions to put mr perot on the ballot in indiana in contrast , ron ellsworth , the state coordinator for colorado , said he would hold a meeting with his county coordinators where the decision would be made it is going to be a very rapid and a very complex process , said orson swindle , executive director of united we stand , america , the grassroots group that mr perot has financed since he said in july that he would not enter the presidential race mr swindle added that his group would use fax to set things in motion in different states that have that capacity he added we 'll be on the phones , we 'll have meetings , you name it where we can draw a crowd to ask people their opinions , we 'll get 'em despite mr perot s assertions that the group represents the average american , the gathering was hardly a demographic cross section of the country most were middleaged white males 15 of the 52 were women the representative from the district of columbia was the only black many seem to be independent businessmen , which is why many can devote the time and effort to the cause without having to ask a boss for the time off in many ways the results seem a foregone conclusion in recent days when mr perot hinted that he would rejoin the fray , the state coordinators polled their members on whether he should run mr swindle said last week that the response was overwhelmingly affirmative in interviews with a dozen state coordinators following today s briefings by the republican and democratic delegations , none said they heard anything that would make them change their mind i have n't heard anything that would turn me off of that particular point of view , jim pope , the delegate from the district of columbia , said of mr perot entering the race committed is the word that seems to best describe the perot backers meeting here they kept the effort going through the bitter weeks after mr perot s stunning withdrawal on july 16 if these volunteers refused to believe their leader had quit , the texan billionaire rewarded their faith by spending millions of his own dollars after he withdrew to place his name on the remaining ballots and now , after mr perot has hinted about resuming his campaign , they have become part of a process that has drawn lawmakers cabinet officials and others from the two major parties to address them they are , for at least the next few days , feeling another heady sensation power we already have had an impact on the political system , tom overrocker , state coordinator for virginia , said in an interview after listening to the democratic delegation make the case for the endorsement of gov bill clinton the words historic occasion seemed to fall from the lips of many state coordinators interviewed as they milled in the hallway outside the meeting room where they heard from the republican and democratic delegations they said that ordinary people like them were seldom the object of the entreaties of such powerful people as senator lloyd bentsen , the texas democrat who was the 1988 vicepresidential nominee , or brent scowcroft , the national security adviser this was a terrific thing to be involved with in terms of the uniqueness of the situation the republicans coming and addressing us , the democrats coming and addressing us to have that recognition , said mr ellsworth , a businessman from colorado who sells beef to restaurants this was a heavyweight group that came to address us as ordinary citizens who say that in the past they have been merely the audience for the political campaigns , the perot state representatives reveled in the role of being addressed by such emissaries and talking back to them it s not just them telling us what we want to hear , said paul boutelle , state coordinator from connecticut who works for a healthcare company in greenwich it s us telling them what they need to know the volunteers seem to be individuals whose loyalties are as much to a cause as mr perot himself i think mr perot is the only person who can carry his message , said debbie andrewskraus , a paralegal from fort smith , ark , and one of two state coordinators sent here from the state but the message is what we really care about and many say they never believed mr perot was serious when he said he would not enter the race on what was to them black thursday , july 16 to these volunteers , mr perot s refusal to run was a strategic retreat a period to move out of the line of partisan fire and media inquiry when he could lick his wounds and plan when to reemerge i viewed his dropping out only as an active candidate , mr bishop said i saw him not wanting to play on the same playing field as bush and clinton right after that , i was saying , 'we 're going to see the most unconventional campaign american politics has ever seen' mr howard , who traveled to dallas and met with mr perot the weekend after he withdrew , said the signals he was getting from mr perot convinced him that his abandonment of the campaign was merely a strategic ploy it was obvious after we had time to assess what was being said that the man was simply withdrawing from the center of controversy at the time , to get out of the limelight , mr howard said photos the state representatives who make up ross perot s organization heard the pitches yesterday in dallas from envoys of the two main campaigners debbie andrewskraus , left , of fort smith , ark , said , i think mr perot is the only person who can carry his message tom overrocker , state coordinator for virginia , said , we already have had an impact on the political system \( photographs by mark

beijing newspaper commentaries this week signal a new drive by deng xiaoping to put china back on the capitalist road , ending a twoandahalfyear detour into socialist stagnation mr deng s new course deserves american encouragement but not blind support the senate s vote tuesday to impose a whole list of impossible conditions on china s trading privileges wo n't help but neither does president bush s repeated refusal to press any conditions on the chinese leadership mr deng s new campaign bodes well for those reformers who survived the horrible repression of tiananmen square they now have a green light to resume policies that brought prosperity and rapid development during the 1980 s but that decade also showed what was wrong with his encouragement of capitalist experiments within socialist structures it brought economic dislocation in 1988 and political disaster in 1989 there s little hope that mr deng , weaker today , will be bold enough to break with old dogmas now transformation awaits the postdeng future the reforms begun in 1979 tapped the power of private initiative and widened personal freedom they opened china to the world and spurred doubledigit rapid growth but as kathleen hartford writes in a world policy journal article , the reform decade ended in crisis largely because of mr deng s unwillingness to junk the whole maoist legacy in the countryside , peasants were only partially liberated beijing relied on compulsory grain quotas to supply cheap food to city dwellers some peasants grew rich but others drifted to more prosperous municipalities there they lived in a legal limbo because of strict socialist residency laws their urban presence dramatically raised the stakes in the 1989 upheavals private businesses had to compete for supplies against staterun giants price reform remained incomplete , distorting economic signals and encouraging corruption wage equality laws and excessive staff requirements discouraged entrepreneurship halfway reforms alienated intellectuals who wanted political freedom and more radical economic changes reform , deng xiaoping style , led to prosperity and the tragedy of tiananmen for two and a half years the leadership has stressed stability and repression mr deng now calls for renewed reforms because there seems no alternative no other path promises enough prosperity to ward off discontent none of the underlying contradictions have been resolved communism s erosion elsewhere has stiffened beijing s resistance to loosening controls the bush administration s nearautomatic support has diluted us influence the best hope is that a new generation of reformers will gain the experience , and power , to do what mr deng still resists let china freely enter the modern world
family demons and the visceral realities of urban street life converge in elizabeth swados s venturesome new musical play , groundhog depending on one s point of view , the title character is either a paranoiac schizophrenic or a primitive wild genius for ms swados , who knows him like a brother , he is both at the same time in this deeply personalized work \( at manhattan theater club s stage ii \) , groundhog is partly based on ms swados s own sibling , who died after years of living as a street person for fictional purposes , he is combined with a character like joyce brown \( also known as billie boggs \) , who became a subject of controversy in new york in the late 1980 s acting as playwright , composer and director , ms swados is unflinching in her response to the madness of groundhog \( david schechter \) , a figure to haunt anyone s nightmare watching the musical , one wonders how the author and her fictional surrogate \( anne bobby \) were able to endure the abuse the narrative deals with a court hearing to determine if groundhog is sane enough to be released from confinement in bellevue and return to his life as a street musician as with billie boggs , he quickly becomes a political issue as the american civil liberties union fights the district attorney s office , and as the mayor and the media compete for public attention naturally , all warring parties ignore groundhog s best interests this ambitious attempt at writing a musical play of brechtian proportions is not entirely successful searching for a resolution in the second act , ms swados momentarily overlooks her musical needs and becomes tendentious there are also steps along the way that should be abbreviated but none of this substantially detracts from the seriousness and the immediacy of the effort in this show , as in her recently published family memoir , the four of us \( farrar , straus giroux \) , ms swados comes to terms with traumatizing events considering the pitfalls , the approach is remarkably free of selfpity and sentimentality the role of groundhog could have been conceived as a clownish eccentric instead , as written by ms swados and as portrayed by mr schechter , he has the hardest of edges , and around him is an aura of incipient malice mr schechter s tightly coiled performance would seem to be an authentic depiction of the extreme irrationality of the character in life the sister s role is that of anxious pawn she keeps trying to do what she thinks is the right thing and is repeatedly blocked by her brother s delusionary behavior ms bobby tellingly conveys her character s mixed allegiances as , trying to embrace her brother , she is swept aside as if she is a fly that has landed on his face ms swados widens her dramatic focus to explore the failings of social programs and of the court system especially in the courtroom , she reveals her flair for satirizing authority figures the judge who hopes the case will become his movie of the week the expert witnesses who have to consult their notes before contradicting one another groundhog stagemanages the trial while also playing the leading role interrupting the summations of the bitterly competitive lawyers , he places his hands over their heads and announces , it s 'college bowl' ! in characteristic fashion , the composer has created a highly eclectic score , with salsafied swados alternating with rap and rock , with dialogue fading into recitative the music is not as melodic as it was in runaways and other swados musicals , but it has a definite new york beat many of the strongest numbers are sung by mr schechter and ms bobby , separately and as duets with several exceptions , notably nora cole as groundhog s lawyer and daniel neiden as a mayor with the vocal inflections of edward i koch , the supporting cast lacks individuality in part , that is due to the fact that the actors double in so many roles , moving from functioning citizens to homeless people huddling in blankets in this austere production , the set designer , g w mercier , has trimmed his own imagination , using interchangeable chairs and tables for courtroom , street and shelter dominating the show is the figure of groundhog , dancing on the edge of lunacy while mocking a closed society that is unable to deal with him and the other dispossessed unlike so many musicals , groundhog has something relevant to say and speaks with a veracity that arises from experience groundhog composed , written and directed by elizabeth swados sets and costumes , g w mercier lighting , natasha katz sound , ed fitzgerald musical direction and arrangement , ann marie milazzo and michael sottile production stage manager , richard hester associate artistic director , michael bush general manager , victoria bailey presented by manhattan theater club , city center stage ii artistic director , lynne meadow managing director , barry grove at manhattan theater club , stage 2 , city center , 131 west 55th street dr r t ebney stephen lee anderson gila anne bobby judge alex t waldman bill buell zoe gilles chiasson georgette bergen nora cole district attorney randall ula hedwig weatherperson ann marie milazzo sandy lauren mufson mayor of new york daniel neiden lauree suzan postel groundhog david schechter fez tony scheitinger danilo chelnik michael sottile musicans paul o'keefe , lewis robinson , mr sottile
saratoga springs , ny it is early in the morning on the day after the first big weekend of upsets , and the barns along the backstretch at old saratoga race course are filled with star horses , star jockeys and even star visitors but on this serene and summery day , no runaway candidates are in sight for championships in any of the divisions of the racing business outside barn 27 , horses are being walked in the ring , potted flowers are hanging from the eaves and two jack russell terriers are commanding the compound between the barn and scotty schulhofer s cottage office schulhofer will be inducted into the racing hall of fame on thursday for his career as a trainer of champions but he reports that a lot of races must still be run and won before they crown anybody on the track this year saratoga , he says the graveyard of champions it s where i started riding , and finished i 've been lucky here but the upsets over the weekend were typical in the main upsets , the heavily favored american royale ran fourth on saturday in the test stakes for 3yearold fillies the next day , in the jim dandy stakes for 3yearold colts , the speed horse dixie brass was outrun by the 24to1 long shot thunder rumble and the prodigy furiously , who had won all three of his starts by a combined total of 31 lengths , ran fourth not only that , but the favored my memoirs , the british star who ran second in the belmont stakes , ran eighth and last this time and now was being treated for a throat infection there s more the weekend began with an upset on friday when the old war horse fourstardave , who had won six straight stakes races in five years at saratoga , ran fifth and last horses are n't machines , schulhofer says , with some passion they get sick they get hurt look how many 2yearold champions do n't do well at 3 the last one who repeated as a champion was spectacular bid , and that was 13 years ago suppose arazi had stayed healthy and won a lot of races in europe this summer \? he 'd still have to come here and beat these horses , schulhofer says , adding with conviction in racing , until you get it done , it s not done julie krone bounces past on her way to work out a horse in the last three weeks , she has ridden and won at tracks in sweden , england and the united states in the last three days , she has traveled more than 800 miles commuting by limousine between saratoga and monmouth park on the jersey shore she rode a full day of races in the mud here on friday , drove to monmouth with schulhofer and tommy valando to ride fly so free in a workout saturday morning , drove back to saratoga to ride a full schedule of races in the afternoon , back to monmouth at night to ride the favorite saint ballado in the haskell invitational on sunday afternoon and back to saratoga to join the dawn patrol at the barns monday morning she s the toast of two continents , but she is n't riding a sure winner in any division , either lenny hale , vice president for racing operations at new york s tracks , rides his horse along the path near barn 27 he rides in horse shows and hunts , and he is one racing official who can speak from the saddle he has fashioned 30 stakes races in 30 days during this saratoga meeting , and three of them were roaring upsets this weekend but no horse raced to the head of his class jimmy \( the greek \) snyder drives up to the compound and parks on the grass , as he does many mornings at saratoga , and considers the state of the art in august the 3yearold colts \? he reflects then he answers his own question the division is wide open one reason it s wide open is that none of the winners of the triple crown races is in action these days lil e tee , who won the kentucky derby , suffered pulmonary bleeding during the preakness two weeks later pine bluff , who won the preakness , tore a tendon and was retired and ap indy , who missed the first two races with a bruised hoof , won the belmont but has been resting since then but clear in the cool saratoga morn , some light glimmers through the confusion two horses who are n't even on the scene probably deserve to be ranked the leaders of the 3yearold class for the fillies , it s turnback the alarm , who won the last two races in the triple tiara series , the mother goose and the coaching club american oaks for the colts , it s ap indy , with dixie brass at his elbow now all they have to do is prove it saratoga is special , scotty schulhofer says it s peaceful , and maybe it s cool it s the time of year when young horses mature but the fillies still have to go a distance in the alabama , and the colts in the travers and in racing , he repeats , with a wisdom worthy of yogi berra , until you get it done , it s not done
most of us try to judge artists by their work , not their personalities but what to do about a conductor who professes the noblest and most mystical ideals yet acts like a tyrant , presents the public image of a snakeoil huckster and seems now to have betrayed a lifelong credo of opposition to recordings \? in other words , how does one respond to the romanian conductor sergiu celibidache \? after a strange and erratic career spent bouncing from secondrate orchestra to secondrate orchestra , mr celibidache \( pronounced chelleebeedahkey \) , who recently turned 80 years old , has finally settled in munich , germany , where he leads yet another secondrate orchestra , the munich philharmonic there , now that herbert von karajan , leonard bernstein and other cult competitors have died , mr celibidache has been elevated to near divinity and what in particular does one make of his latest recording \? for some 40 years , mr celibidache damned the medium and swore he would never deign to subject the pure spontaneity of his musicmaking to such artificial treatment yet the recording in question , a 12inch laser video disk of rehearsals and a performance of prokofiev s classical symphony \( teldec 736676 \) , is intended as the first in a long line of celibidache documents on teldec during the late 1930 s and world war ii , mr celibidache studied music in berlin after the war he was plucked from obscurity by the allies and made chief conductor of the berlin philharmonic while wilhelm furtwangler struggled to denazify himself with furtwangler back at the helm in 1948 , mr celibidache began his odyssey through radio symphony orchestras in cities like stuttgart and stockholm \( he did have a relationship with the london symphony in the 1970 s , and made an emotional return to the berlin philharmonic this spring \) in 1979 , he took over the munich philharmonic , the city s second orchestra , behind the bavarian radio symphony \( or possibly its third , behind the bavarian staats kapelle , which plays mostly opera \) today , celibidache concerts in the philharmonic s shiny new hall , the gasteig , are a cult phenomenon that leaves wizened musical veterans bemused in early june , before the last of four subscription concerts that offered not one but two cult heroes , with arturo benedetti michelangeli as piano soloist , emotions in the lobby approached hysteria people stood everywhere , holding imploring signs or buttonholing passersby in search of spare tickets a shoving mob at the box office muscled for position to be told , periodically , that nothing was available inside , the program of rossini , mozart and ravel provided the typical mix of a merely decent orchestra playing at the top of its form , with revelatory detail , sensuous textures and indulgently slow tempos \( except , curiously , in the mozart haffner symphony \) mr michelangeli , when he had finished the ravel concerto in g , offered as a birthday tribute to the maestro , it was announced 15 ravishing minutes of solo ravel the audience , the orchestra and the maestro himself , sitting contentedly in an armchair near the piano , lapped it up since making a few recordings in the late 40 s , mr celibidache has shunned the medium in this respect he is the opposite of the pianist glenn gould , who abandoned concerts in favor of carefully assembled studio pastiches mr celibidache , who , as a zen buddhist , believes in the divine spontaneity of the moment , has ventured various explanations for his boycott of recordings , most suggesting that to capture one particular musical event , frozen in time and cut off from context , is to distort music cruelly cynics argue that by dispensing with microphones , mr celibidache has merely fanned the flame of his cult and avoided possibly harsh comparisons whether the teldec project successfully circumvents the conductor s objections to audio recordings will be up to each viewer to decide the rationale is that the visual component brings the experience closer to the reality of a concert , and that the inclusion of rehearsals serves a didactic purpose but of course anyone can listen to , and any radio station can broadcast , the audio performance by itself in any case , the prokofiev disk is a fascinating affair the classical symphony might seem an odd choice of repertory , but mr celibidache has long favored lightishclassical scores with a certain verve , which he can refine , or embalm , into masterpiece status indeed , one of his recordings from 1948 , still listed on the erratically distributed italian nuova era label , was of this symphony the teldec disk was made , or at least copyrighted , in 1988 the rehearsal segments were apparently drawn from the first

the road to florida may have been crowded with horses headed for the breeders' cup yesterday , but seven other runners of distinction traveled instead to aqueduct to take a shot at another target , the 500 , 000 nyra mile the most successful traveler of the day was ibero , who won the race by three lengths after flying east from his home base in california with precisely that in mind ibero s agenda does not include the breeders' cup for good reasons , most notably his sevenrace losing streak since february but he came east with his own trainer , ron mcanally , and his own rider , laffit pincay jr , and gave new meaning to the word shipper , a horse who pinpoints one race far from home and ships in to bag it and at aqueduct lately , with many hometown horses already bound for the breeders' cup , the shippers have been winning in forays ibero , a 5yearold from argentina , came close to playing the role of hustler this time he has run in the money 16 times in 24 starts in his career , but he won only once this year in nine races but mcanally did n't send him to new york for the scenery within striking distance pincay kept him within striking distance in third place while nines wild and devil his due flashed the early speed lots of speed , too they went the halfmile in 45 seconds , threequarters in 1 084 5 then they turned into the homestretch , and ibero ran past both leaders in the race for the wire when he got there , he had three lengths on irish swap , who barely edged nines wild for second place and then came john h peace s formidable colt west by west , second choice to devil his due , who finished sixth it was no fluke ibero raced the mile in a flying 1 334 5 , paid 980 for every 2 bet to win and earned first prize of 300 , 000 for his owner , frank e whitham , a banker from kansas mcanally won the 500 , 000 meadowlands cup last week with sea cadet , another successful traveler now booked into the breeders' cup classic the trainer savored his latest coup , and said we had been planning on this race for a while , as much as two months the one thing that stood out in my mind was the mile that s his distance we 'll take him back to california there s really not another race here for him 'he likes this track' but , he added , with some mischief , we could always bring him back he likes this track why would anybody run a mile on dirt for 500 , 000 only one week before the breeders' cup championships with purses between 1 million and 3 million \? because the seven races in the cup series range from six furlongs to a mile and a half , and they include a onemile run on the turf , but none of the races is run at the classic distance of one mile on dirt so , it was no great leap of faith to create one , which is what the new york racing association did five years ago at the request of its president , gerard j mckeon if your horse was n't eligible for the breeders' cup , or if he was n't ready for it , or if he just did his best at one mile on the main track , aqueduct gave him a shot forty niner promptly won the first nyra mile and rubiano won the last one , and a tradition was born finish line seven fancy fillies ran one mile on the turf in the second feature at aqueduct , the 156 , 450 budweiser breeders' cup handicap , and two of them ran to the wire in a nosetonose duel to a photo finish the winner helen k groves s aurora , a 4yearold daughter of danzig and granddaughter of alydar , who has won 7 of 13 starts for scotty schulhofer but who won a stakes race for the first time with craig perret riding , aurora took the lead at the start in her customary manner and held it against an unrelenting chase by olden rijn , another 4yearold filly , owned by richard l duchossois of arlington park they crossed the wire a nose apart , with irish linnet nearly two lengths farther back aurora covered the mile in 1 364 5 , returned 560 for 2 to win and went home with 93 , 870 she rated well for a filly who has so much natural speed , perret reported got her to relax at the end of the mile , she still had it
gypsies , half a million of whom perished in nazi death camps , again face threatening german mobs bonn s answer is not to quell the mobs but to deport the gypsies to romania germany will also pay romania 20 million for transportation and job training bonn s policy is repellent it also defies the spirit of international refugee conventions gypsies face systematic discrimination and sometimes violent persecution in romania , a situation unlikely to change much after today s romanian elections but if bonn has been callous , germany s critics have been unfair to accuse it of recidivist nazi behavior no other european government shelters as many refugees , and none contributes as much to eastern europe s financial needs germans would do better to show more sensitivity to nationalities once targeted for nazi genocide but other countries ought not hold germany to a double standard as the american treatment of haitians shows , germany is hardly alone in its harshness towards refugees gypsy is the west s name for a people who call themselves romany a millennium ago , they migrated from india to europe since then , they have faced discrimination , violence and enslavement many still follow traditional nomadic ways , living in caravans many nongypsies stereotype them as petty thieves , con artists and worse germany still has the remnants of its own gypsy population since the collapse of communism and the upsurge of ethnic violence in eastern europe , german gypsies have been joined by tens of thousands of new arrivals , most from romania and the former yugoslavia newly arrived gypsies have become one of the most visible elements of germany s swollen transient population , a product not only of germany s liberal asylum laws but also the restrictive laws of its neighbors under current german law , those claiming asylum are supported for years at government expense while their claims are investigated during this period they are not allowed to work , and typically are housed in refugee hostels , some in the poorest regions of the former east germany these hostels have become the target of mob violence , fanned by increasingly bold neonazi movements germany has an obligation to address this crisis with more effective law enforcement against its own hooligans and it can fairly ask its neighbors to share the east european refugee burden bonn is also entitled to consider stricter asylum policies , for example by tightening the rules for people from countries not known to persecute minorities but any new rules ought to grant a special dispensation to people like the gypsies in acknowledgment of nazi crimes germany invites justified criticism for deporting gypsies back into possible danger but sanctimonious objections to broader german efforts to tighten asylum sound hollow when coming from countries whose own doors remain shut
of all american writers' , walt whitman s life has been perhaps the most carefully scrutinized it is a century now since whitman died , and several fine biographies have appeared what demands closer attention , however , is the relationship between the poet and the times in which he lived in estimating my volumes , he wrote , the world s current times and deeds , and their spirit , must be first profoundly estimated the poet fails , he wrote , if he does not flood himself with the immediate age as with vast oceanic tides and if he be not himself the age transfigured that age had surprising similarities to our own we tend to think of whitman s expansive optimism as a relic of a far simpler time actually , his was very much a willed optimism , a triumphant poetic statement in the face of calamitous social realities those who think political parties today have lost viability should be reminded that in whitman s day the situation was even worse the early 1850 s , when whitman was discovering his poetic powers , witnessed one of the most momentous phenomena in american political history the collapse of the party system the whig party broke up in 1854 after disputes over slavery , and whitman s democratic party became striferidden as well his acerbic comments still have resonance the old parties are defunct there remains of them empty flesh , putrid mouths , mumbling and squeaking the tones of these conventions , the politicians standing back in shadow , telling lies the party crisis aroused whitman s wrath against governmental authority figures the egregious presidencies of millard fillmore , franklin pierce and james buchanan suddenly eroded his confidence in the executive office he branded the three presidencies before lincoln as our topmost warning and shame in the postwatergate , postmilken era we 've become so accustomed to corruption in high places that we 're apt to long nostalgically for a supposedly purer day but whitman s time was hardly pristine votebuying , wirepulling , patronage and graft tainted all levels of government of franklin pierce s administration he wrote the president eats dirt and excrement for his daily meals , likes it , and tries to force it on the states the cushions of the presidency are nothing but filth and blood the pavements of congress are also bloody politicians in general he described with terms like corpses , skeletons , pimps , lice but the very social forces that drove whitman to despair simultaneously opened up new vistas of selfassertion as authority figures collapsed , suddenly the individual self , sovereign , rich , complex , stood forth amid the ruin of the parties it is no accident that the 1850 s was the time of the great flowering of american anarchism not far from whitman s birthplace on long island there was established in 1851 the utopian community of modern times , led by reformers who practiced the doctrine of individual sovereignty by which every individual was pronounced the absolute despot or sovereign of his or her own life , without reference to outside laws or governments this strong emphasis on the individual , so prevalent in reform circles of the 1850 s , was echoed in thoreau s walden \( 1854 \) and , the next year , in the famous opening lines of whitman s song of myself , where selfempowerment reaches gargantuan proportions i celebrate myself , and what i assume you shall assume , for every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you whitman s growing disgust with america s leaders also sparked his deep faith in common people he had come to view american society as an ocean covered with the scum of politicians below which lay the pure , deep waters of common humanity he was prepared to identify fully with the everyday person , even the social outcast his moving portraits of fugitive slaves won praise from many reformers , including the former slave sojourner truth , who was rapturous in her admiration for his writings whitman s views on race and slavery were remarkably close to those of the american leader he would come to admire most , abraham lincoln both were morally opposed to slavery but neither wanted to sacrifice the union in order to stamp it out to preserve the union , lincoln would greatly strengthen the power of the executive office by leading the north into battle once the south had seceded whitman took a different but analogous tactic to preserve the union he asserted the executive power of the poetic i , which gathered together the disparate voices of american culture in an imaginative whole just as his poetry built positively on a highly problematic political situation , so it presented a purified version of a rapidly urbanizing america in our era of sprawling metropolises , it is easy to forget that whitman s america , though more rural than ours , had forms of pollution that have long since disappeared hogs roamed unrestrained through new york , eating the garbage that was heaped in the streets in a time before systematized waste disposal cows were herded up public avenues to graze in outlying farm areas even whitman s relatively clean home city , brooklyn , provoked his editorial outburst in the brooklyn evening star our city is literally overrun with swine , outraging all decency , and foraging upon every species of eatables within their reach hogs , dogs and cows should be banished from our streets there is not a city in the united states as large as brooklyn , where the cleanliness and decency of its streets is so neglected as here
while the hollywood studios spent much of 1992 churning out the most forgettable home video fodder in recent memory , a funny thing was happening out on the fringes american independent film makers enjoyed an exhilaratingly good year , marked by receptive audiences , critical encouragement and the promise of even better things to come why did we see such a confluence of impressive new talent \? maybe it was just coincidence it may even have signaled the emergence of yet another cinematic new wave to some extent , the arrival of promising new american directors goes in cycles and the studios have a lot to do with setting the conditions in which those cycles can occur a corporate penchant for risk taking , in the years after the unexpected boxoffice success of easy rider in 1969 , helped bring forth or encourage an astonishing array of new names martin scorsese , robert altman , woody allen , francis ford coppola , paul mazursky , steven spielberg and george lucas all established their reputations in the late 60 s and early 70 s , when marginalseeming young film makers captured and revitalized hollywood s mainstream while there is not yet reason to think that the current wave is on a par with that one , it is still very visible and there is ample evidence of its impact several of this year s best american independently made films the waterdance , codirected by neal jimenez and michael steinberg carl franklin s one false move allison anders s gas food lodging must surely have given more conventional film makers pause made uncompromisingly , and on a shoestring , they were as well acted and entertaining as anything the studios had to offer several others gregg araki s living end and tom kalin s swoon , quentin tarantino s superviolent yet droll reservoir dogs , tim robbins s sharply satirical bob roberts , julie dash s poetically evocative daughters of the dust refreshingly dispensed with the somethingforeveryone blandness of bigstudio efforts these films succeeded in frankly singling out specific audiences by race , politics or general outlook and showing those audiences characters they wanted to see even some of the year s more uneven or selfabsorbed independents took chances that would be out of the question in mainstream hollywood commerce has overwhelmed art , which is why hollywood movies are n't as good as they used to be , says jeffrey katzenberg , the chairman of walt disney pictures , by way of explaining the independents' new surge the process has been corrupted it is too much about money and not enough about good entertainment noting the disappearance of many smaller film companies , the ones known as minimajors , mr katzenberg points to a gap between film making as guerrilla warfare , meaning three guys with a camera strapped on their back and megablockbuster hollywood productions disney s 1992 roster included the flatly generic straight talk , the mighty ducks and sister act , but there will be future projects by formidable independent types , among them merchantivory \( howards end \) , bill duke \( a rage in harlem \) and wayne wang \( chan is missing \) this change of direction appears to be part of a broader shift the way has been paved by a group of nowestablished film makers whose work is distinctly independent including spike lee , steven soderbergh , john sayles , jim jarmusch , gus van sant jr and the coen brothers critically or commercially , they have attained the kind of stature that makes the studios take notice and a parallel show of force among documentary film makers with films like roger and me , paris is burning , brother s keeper , hearts of darkness and 35 up has similarly focused attention on the growing commercial viability of independent film makers so has the increasing importance of the sundance film festival each winter , which brings to light many films that subsequently find a measure of boxoffice success it was here that sex , lies and videotape first emerged \( last year , the waterdance and alexandre rockwell s in the soup were highly visible there \) sundance does n't simply bring exposure to preexisting independent efforts it may also help to bring an added professionalism to the films being shown according to harvey weinstein , cochairman of miramax films \( a major force in distributing independent films \) , young film makers are becoming more cognizant of the opportunities this showcase provides it s not like they can just go make a home movie , he says the stakes are a little higher , now that there s a forum for it this really is a world stage something else has helped pave the way for the independents' success in finding an audience foreign films have , in general , experienced a decline in quality that coincides with the new vitality of young american film makers says mr weinstein , who notes that he has heard complaints about subtitles from young viewers american independents may be more appealing to a generation that listens to radio and watches tv , where reading is maybe eighth on the list
washington , april 23 the strategy that the abortionrights side brought to the supreme court on wednesday had every appearance of a highstakes gamble addressing a court on which support for roe v wade has dwindled to the vanishing point , kathryn kolbert , the lawyer for a group of abortion clinics challenging pennsylvania s abortion regulation law , argued fervently for the one result this case is least likely to produce she asked the justices to reaffirm their 1973 landmark ruling and to declare that the constitutional right to abortion is broad enough to invalidate every restriction in the pennsylvania law the bush administration asked the court to overturn roe v wade and to declare that states have a compelling interest in protecting fetuses from the moment of conception this would free states to prohibit abortion , as louisiana , utah and the territory of guam have already done in the expectation that the court would soon repudiate roe v wade carefully developed strategy while two justices , sandra day o'connor and anthony m kennedy , appeared eager to find some middle ground , ms kolbert declined politely but firmly to help she refused to offer a road map to what could be a partial victory for her clients a narrow decision striking down at least a part of the pennsylvania law while saving the ultimate battle over the core right to abortion for another day in risking everything , it seemed , she invited losing everything surprising as it seemed in a court where lawyers typically arrive determined to win their cases on any possible grounds , this strategy was a result of a careful calculation within the abortion rights leadership of where the risks in the fight to preserve the right to abortion really lie only part of this calculation was legal the rest was political , a reflection of the highly flammable mixture of law and politics that the abortion issue has become driving the strategy was a judgment that there is in fact no middle ground worth fighting for in the abortion battle , and consequently that the most serious risk in the pennsylvania case lies in the supreme court s coming to rest there in legal terms , such a resting point would be expressed as a standard of review of abortion regulations under which it would be unconstitutional for a state to make abortion a crime , but permissible to impose the waiting periods and counseling requirements of the pennsylvania law , as well as the hospitalization requirements and other restrictions that some states are now considering abortion would remain a lawful option , thereby blunting an electionyear effort to pass a federal abortion rights bill that is now the top legislative priority of the abortion rights movement if a bill passes congress and is vetoed by president bush as the abortion rights forces expect it might become a potent political issue in the fall election but at the same time , waiting periods and counseling requirements could put abortion out of reach for large numbers of women those who are young or poor would be unable to make multiple trips , perhaps across a state 83 percent of all counties in the united states have no abortion providers middleclass women would still be able to get abortions , as a million or more did every year in the years before roe v wade in a way , that is the worst possible outcome , walter dellinger , a duke university law professor who has written widely on abortion and who filed a brief in the case , said today in an interview the people really at risk are vulnerable women , the young and the poor their rights wo n't be protected politically unless suburban republican women find themselves at risk , too only if it s clear that no one has rights will there be a political groundswell to restore those rights effect of webster ruling not only ms kolbert s courtroom argument , but the entire way the abortionrights side framed the case in a dozen briefs filed in the court , was notable for an allornothing approach to the central constitutional issue , the standard by which judges should evaluate restrictions on abortion in roe v wade itself , the court declared the constitutional right to abortion to be fundamental , meaning that any state restriction on the right had to pass a demanding judicial test known in constitutional terms as strict scrutiny by contrast , government restrictions that do not involve fundamental rights need only be rationally related to a legitimate state interest in the webster decision , which upheld a missouri abortion law three years ago , the court effectively abandoned strict scrutiny , without either overturning roe v wade or settling on a different standard last fall the united states court of appeals for the third circuit , in philadelphia , ruled on the pennsylvania law by applying what it took to be the supreme court s center of gravity as expressed in the webster case this was a test , suggested only by justice o'connor , under which restrictions on access to abortion are constitutional as long as they do not impose an undue burden on the exercise of the abortion right four other justices would have upheld abortion restrictions using the lowest , rational basis standard four others adhered to the strict scrutiny of roe v wade using the undue burden test , the appeals court upheld the law s waiting period and counseling requirements but declared unconstitutional a requirement that married women notify their husbands of plans for abortions clearly , it appeared to the appellate judges that the undue burden standard had some substance if the standard would not permit a husbandnotification requirement , an actual ban on abortion which will soon be before the supreme court in one or more cases would certainly not survive it 'votes are n't there' but none of the abortion rights briefs endorsed the test nor did the bush administration , which urged the court to overturn roe v wade and adopt the rational basis test endorsed by the plurality in the webster case solicitor general kenneth w starr conceded in his argument that this standard would permit states to criminalize abortion ms kolbert , an american civil liberties union lawyer based in philadelphia , said in an interview today that despite the third circuit s analysis , there was little chance the supreme court would adopt the undue burden standard the votes are n't there , she said and even if they were , it would n't help it does n't represent a longterm victory for our clients while lawyers get to frame the arguments before the court , only the court has the last word the abortion rights strategy could well backfire the court could leave an unclear message in the pennsylvania case it could even muddy the waters completely by not deciding the case at all this term , deferring it until next year when the case challenging a law from guam that makes almost all abortions a crime will also be available for decision or the basic calculation could prove to be wrong , with legal defeat leading not to political victory but only to more defeat all these risks are apparent but those who took them at the court this week felt they had little to lose photo kathryn kolbert , left , lawyer for a group of abortion clinics challenging pennsylvania s abortion regulation law , listening on wednesday as her opponent

san antonio with shaved head gleaming in the arena lights during a warmup , lloyd daniels motioned to a friend standing at courtside my legs feel weak , said daniels no energy want some sugar \? said the friend i can get you some sugar daniels nodded cool , he said this would be as close to an admission of nervousness as lloyd daniels would get the former schoolboy basketball legend from new york , who never played in college , was getting a chance to become something beyond a mere 24yearold , 6foot7inch mighthavebeen he was playing with and against professionals in a game that was surely one of the most important of his life he s had a lot of last chances , someone in the stands was saying , but i 'd have to think that this is the very last one 'i'm walkin' millions' daniels , who once said , i'm walkin' millions , even when he was penniless and hustling fake jewelry to buy drugs , might well have been thinking the same so , last tuesday night a paying crowd of 3 , 127 spectators showed up at the blossom athletic center here to watch not just the annual blackandsilver game , which concludes the fiveday rookieandfreeagent camp for the san antonio spurs , but to see lloyd daniels , to see if there was in fact some kind of miracle in the making after all , this was a guy who had been shot on a street in queens three years ago and left for dead over what the police called a smalltime drug dispute , in which daniels , then an addict , had apparently stolen vials of crack from the assailants daniels had been to four high schools in four years in three states , and had graduated from none of them although he was named allamerican in his one full highschool year , at andrew jackson in queens yet he was still longed for by basketball coaches , especially jerry tarkanian , now the spurs' coach no college career as coach at the university of nevadalas vegas , tarkanian actually recruited him but before daniels could even get into a runnin' rebels jersey , he was arrested while buying cocaine in las vegas although his case was later dropped , his unlv career was over before it started but daniels was n't through as a basketball player he went to the contintental basketball league and the global basketball league and the united states basketball league he was thrown off some teams for bad attitude , for heavy drinking , for drug use he has twice been in rehabilitation centers but when he got serious about the game , he could be outstanding then , in the last year or so , things began to change daniels credits john lucas , the former national basketball association player who assists basketball players with substanceabuse problems , for helping him daniels says he has been off drugs for two years now , and has not touched alcohol in a year he had offers from several nba teams the knicks , the lakers and the bucks also among them to come to camp this summer as a free agent he chose the spurs , signing a twoyear contract , because there are several openings on the roster , and because of tarkanian , whom daniels describes as my friend winning over fans in the game tuesday , with his jaws working on a stick of sugared chewing gum , daniels came upcourt he moved with his customary low dribble , like a man seeking to hide from view but a not quite succeeding then he whistled a spectacular pass to a man cutting for the basket soon after that , he sank a 3point shot then he executed a nolook pass for a basket that brought a gasp and an oooohh ! from the crowd this was only in the first quarter of the intrasquad game , but it was at about this time that a particular expression crossed the face of tarkanian it was a sharkjustswallowedthecanary grin at halftime , tarkanian said lloyd never made the wrong play we asked him to be a leader , to be unselfish , and he was he did n't force any shots , and he was playing aggressive defense he made a few mistakes but at this stage , i do n't know how much better he could have played in the second half , daniels played even better he can make it , said sean elliott , a spurs forward he can be a star this is just the beginning , daniels said after leading his black team to victory , with 16 points , 11 assists and 10 rebounds i got a little winded a few times , but i told myself , stay focused , keep pushing' i caught myself having fun out there and it was a great feeling playing clean that s the best of all daniels , in his quick , engaging , streetwise style , talked about himself if you take a kid like lloyd daniels , with a mother who died when he was 3 years old , and a father who was never around and raised yourself and grew up with drugs and alcohol and around gangsters on the streets of brooklyn who did n't care about nothing but where their next hit was coming from and could kill you just like that , then you know that right now what lloyd daniels is doing is not about basketball it s about lloyd daniels living daniels spent most of his young years living with his two grandmothers , but he was generally a boy on his own he grew up fast , and skipped school frequently he never learned to read past a secondgrade level he grew tall , reaching 67 by the time he was 16 , and he discovered that a gift had been bestowed on him you ca n't teach anyone how to handle the ball like lloyd , and be 6foot7 , tarkanian has said it s got to come from somewhere else in new york basketball circles , daniels was compared with kareem abduljabbar and connie hawkins as the best and most exciting that the area had ever produced daniels is now seeking to develop his stamina , and his defense lloyd is 24 years old , but he had the body of a 45yearold , said peter raeford , his conditioning coach his reflexes were shot for the most part , and lloyd will tell you this , he s never had to be in top shape because he had so much ability , he was able to slide by shows great willingness in the last month , though , according to raeford , daniels has shown a great willingness to make himself stronger , and better i'm sore , man , said daniels these twoaday practices are killing me tarkanian said he came in here with almost no defensive technique i mean , he could n't guard me but he s making a big improvement he s a good , kind person , and more intelligent than a lot of people think the spurs coach hopes that daniels can make a contribution to the spurs quickly , probably as a shooting guard but conceivably as a point guard , the spurs' greatest need i envision him getting the ball to big dave , tarkanian said , referring to spurs center david robinson there was never a doubt in my mind that he was going to be a very good player , the only question was , when \? skeptics say that daniels will mess up this chance just as he has messed up others daniels said i woke up one day and i was 24 years old and i said to myself 'that other lloyd daniels was n't me this lloyd daniels is for real' photo a spurs rookie and former new york playground legend , lloyd daniels , with coach jerry tarkanian during san antonio s rookie camp last week \( lisa davis for the new york times \)
father knows best \? macaulay culkin may be home alone more than he expected this spring , now that sam i am , the off broadway show in which he was scheduled to star , has told him no thanks it seems as if macaulay s father , kit culkin , a former child actor himself , has seen gypsy once too often billy hopkins , the show s director , and keith reddin , the playwright , both say mr culkin demanded rewrites of the script in the form of threats he would say , 'either make the rewrites or get yourself someone else to play the child , ' mr reddin says \( this method works better in movies than the theater , where the playwright owns his work and has the final say on changing it \) mr reddin also says mr culkin objected to the ensemble nature of the play , which was written for 5 actors to play 10 parts he said that the audience would be confused to see the same actors play different roles , mr reddin says the other actors in the play are leslie lyles , john christopher jones , marian seldes and boyd gaines mr hopkins says mr culkin decided that he wanted ms lyles and mr jones to play only one role apiece after deciding which role , he changed his mind mr reddin says that mr culkin said , 'either you do it this way or you can find someone else for the boy s role' and i said 'fine' it just got to the point where the play was n't worth doing because so many compromises had to be made and by whom \? kit was n't a producer , did n't have his own money in it , and no one said up front that he would have any say in the creative process it s like glenn close s mother saying to mike nichols , 'i do n't like gene hackman playing that part , so glenn ca n't be in your play' it was mr hopkins who gave macaulay his first acting job , in mr reddin s big squirrel at the ensemble studio theater in 1987 besides working as a director , mr hopkins is also a casting director he cast macaulay in uncle buck , which was directed by john hughes , who later cast the child in home alone after that film became such a hit , much was written about the fact that mr culkin had threatened 20th century fox with taking macaulay out of home alone ii if he could not also star in another fox picture , the good son although joe roth , the president of fox , denied this in print , fox postponed the good son three weeks before it was to begin shooting , at a cost of 3 million it is now scheduled for production in the fall , with macaulay mr hopkins says , sam cohn is macaulay s agent , and he did everything possible to try to make this play happen neither mr cohn nor kit culkin returned calls mr hopkins says , as a casting director for films , what i'm hearing now from people looking for children is 'macaulay is too expensive and his father is too much trouble find another kid' that s too bad , mr hopkins says macaulay is the easiest kid to work with , a thorough professional i 'll work with him when he s 18 and out of his father s control as for sam i am , watch for it at an off broadway theater , probably in the fall 2 on hollywood the beneficiary of the sam i am fallout is the american jewish theater it will present angel of death and big al , two oneact plays about hollywood and its influence , as its final offering of the season billy hopkins is directing angel of death , by the 26yearold playwright charlie schulman , about the resurrection of dr josef mengele as a movie star the cast includes keith reddin \( yes , he s an actor , too \) , leslie lyles , steven goldstein and daniel von bargen big al is about a fan s obsession with none other than al pacino it is written by the 25yearold bryan gobuloff , directed by peter maloney evan handler and gus rogerson costar performances of both shows begin on april 25 a surprise in the pulitzers the new york theater world was shocked on tuesday when robert schenkkan s kentucky cycle won the pulitzer prize for drama why \?

park avenue cafe few restaurants have created as much enthusiasm in the last few years as park avenue cafe , the upbeat creation of alan stillman , a prominent new york city restaurateur , and david burke , the inventively puckish former chef of the river cafe in brooklyn i have waited several months to assess this place , not out of sympathy for a new establishment that needs time to get its sea legs , but because holding back yields a portrait of the restaurant that holds up over time premature reviewing often leads to highly equivocal assessments that have little value in the case of park avenue cafe , the menu has been refined and the amiable service staff has settled down over time otherwise , the production remains more or less the same as for the food , mr burke s winsome style can be fun or fatuous , depending on the dish for example , it s hard to fathom where he got the idea of serving seafood salad on a block of ice in a 70degree room \( you can imagine how it looks if you do n't finish it in two minutes \) and adding sauteed kidneys to a perfectly good veal steak that already has plenty of help \( apples , scallions and salsify \) leads one to suspect the chef is trying to clean out the refrigerator park avenue cafe has a stylish american motif , with mismatched plates with graphic designs , green leather booths , antique toys scattered about and american folk art upon being seated , you receive a bounteous basket of terrific wholegrain breads interspersed with baby tangerines , kumquats and nuts \( the cutesies strike again \) then comes an amusegueule , maybe an eggshell filled with turnip flan , cubed prunes and foie gras , a delicious contrast of tart and sweet is this the kind of thing mr burke thinks about on the subway while other mortals read newspapers \? i was wary of ordering an appetizer that combined sea scallops and oxtail yet they had an ineffable affinity when the delicate scallops were presented over shredded , lean oxtail meat in a rich redwine reduction mildly cured smoked salmon is lustrous atop a corn blini with onion greens and horseradish sauce another juxtaposition that succeeds is smoked shrimp wrapped in a tortilla lined with sharp cheese , all paired with a bowl of black bean soup brightened with coriander a pretty bouquet of arugula tied at the bottom with prosciutto could serve as a novel mother s day offering , but i could n't wait it was invigorating with a sandwich of grilled eggplant and smoky mozzarella one of the best starters is an unlikely combination of penne in a ripe tomato sauce with peas , baby squid and spicy chorizo a welltextured , awesomely rich asparagus risotto should be split by two or more , for it is difficult to eat more than a few forkfuls the wine list carries good chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon from california , and at moderate prices it is also good to see a restaurant offer more than a dozen wines in halfbottles among main courses , chicken pot pie might be renamed wheelbarrow pie , for it comes out looking like something a hungry farm family could share it s good , too , replete with moist chicken , mushrooms , carrots and potatoes , all under a poppyseed crust generous crabmeat ravioli garnish a rather bland steamed snapper , and a scattering of chorizo around the plate really comes out of left field , gastronomically speaking more coherent are the crackling barbecued squab atop a moist corncake with sauteed foie gras , beets and roasted pistachios , and the spitroasted leg of lamb and grilled baby lamb chops with scalloped potatoes and spelt , a middle eastern grain similar to buckwheat a boneless chicken breast is so illogically thick that it is nearly impossible to cook it through without drying out , and that s precisely what happens a noodle cake with bacon and roasted garlic is irresistible , though fennelinfused salmon with lotusroot garnish is delightfully delicate the grilled vegetable platter , while not on the menu , makes a fine familystyle side dish and the chef s swordfish chop , made to resemble a veal chop with a swordfish bone sticking out , is lovely with a lemony sauce and fried lemon rings for dessert , the carrot souffle is extraordinarily light and well balanced a strawberry and rhubarb napoleon , a special , was fun , much superior to a muddled stirfry of fruits with vanilla ice cream the stillbustling park avenue cafe is more than the sum of its adorable , if uneven , parts it reminds me of what a little league coach once said during an interminable batting slump you do n't need nine 300 hitters to have a winning team saigon it is perplexing that new york city s vietnamese restaurants , which have had a significant impact on the western chefs who borrow some of their techniques , have failed to blossom as a major culinary force on their own one reason may be that the superior vietnamese kitchens here and there are precious few tend to be ephemeral and confined to greater chinatown and many suffer from inconsistency as chefs come and go , a tendency exemplified by saigon , a 10yearold restaurant on mulberry street
washington , may 3 deep into a difficult political campaign and facing what some aides now call a domestic persian gulf crisis , president bush will meet with his top domestic advisers monday morning to begin mapping his response to the civic and physical wreckage of the los angeles riots mr bush is being pressed to quickly address the broader social ailments underlying last week s upheaval , some senior administration aides said , adding that the most likely forum for unveiling such a prescription was a longscheduled visit to los angeles on thursday mr bush had planned to speak about free trade , but the address will almost certainly now be devoted to the themes of economic and social justice , said the aides , all of whom insisted on anonymity but they added that there was still no clear idea of what broad proposals the president should or even could offer to bridge the racial and economic divisions that the riots laid bare test of leadership you can look at thursday in california as a test of how bush is going to play this is he engaged , or does he do the conventional speech and try to get out quickly \? one top official said today that s being debated now , and will be over next few days much of the debate on monday and the days ahead is likely to focus on the proposals of housing secretary jack f kemp , who with vice president dan quayle has long been a vocal advocate of a more forceful antipoverty agenda mr kemp has urged reducing federal dominance of social programs and giving the poor more control over their own lives mr bush is under considerable political pressure to prove his leadership on the issue the likely democratic presidential nominee , gov bill clinton of arkansas , arrived in los angeles tonight to offer his own recommendations search for solutions ross perot , the texas businessman who is an undeclared independent presidential candidate , also attacked mr bush during a network television interview on sunday for remaining in washington during the riots one administration adviser acknowledged today that the attack strikes a chord with some voters , and that many of mr bush s aides believe he must offer more than a usual response that political urgency is expected to give fresh momentum in monday s meeting to a search for solutions to poverty and social fragmentation that even mr bush s top aides concede has gotten halfhearted support during his tenure in office the participants are to include mr bush s senior white house aides , including the chief of staff , samuel k skinner , and richard g darman , the budget director labor secretary lynn martin , health and human services secretary louis w sullivan , an aide to education secretary lamar alexander , who is traveling , and mr kemp time for kemp s ideas \? mr kemp s proposals , some of which have become law , include such innovations as allowing poor families to buy apartments in publichousing projects they also seek to give individuals and businesses financial incentives to develop the inner cities and improve their own station in life one white house official , a senior adviser not aligned with mr kemp , said today that that may begin to change in the wake of the los angeles riots mr skinner and his top aides , including his deputy , henson moore , and the domestic policy chief , clayton k yeutter , are more open to considering mr kemp s ideas than was john h sununu , mr skinner s deeply conservative predecessor , he said many of mr kemp s proposals have the added attraction of requiring little or no additional federal money , a requirement in a year when a gaping budget deficit precludes more than a token offering of new federal programs for the poor on the other hand , mr kemp s plans have been consistently opposed by mr darman , a powerful figure in shaping administration policy , and by treasury secretary nicholas f brady , one of mr bush s closest and oldest friends campaign considerations nor is it clear whether mr bush s political strategists , led by his campaign manager , robert m teeter , would favor an electionyear agenda studded with highprofile proposals to assist the disadvantaged administration officials interviewed today were themselves divided over how mr bush s natural constituency , largely middle and upperclass voters , would react to such initiatives mr bush himself has seemed ambivalent about the problem until now the president s last major address on social issues , a speech this spring on the american family , branded the disintegration of urban society an urgent crisis that cried for solutions , but proposed no solution beyond letting states conduct experimental welfare programs similarly , mr bush s white house domestic staff has debated several dramatic reforms in antipoverty programs for more than two years , but has endorsed none some administration officials already have argued that the los angeles riots present mr bush with a unique opportunity both to do good and to gain political advantage by proposing a comprehensive and largely new federal attack on social problems besides projecting himself as a national leader , they said , such a move would present the white house with an opportunity to begin recapturing the support of blacks and other minorities that was lost in the 1950 s and 1960 s , when the democratic party took the lead in civilrights issues however , mr bush s staff made no systematic effort over the weekend to consider its options for thursday s visit to los angeles , a fact that some aides called revealing by itself photo president bush is to meet with his top domestic advisers today to begin mapping his response to the los angeles riots he spoke to reporters yesterday at the white house after returning from camp david \( associated press \)
dushanbe , tajikistan , feb 13 the mineralproducing former soviet republic of tajikistan agreed today to adopt an americandesigned program for restricting the sale of weapons components and promised never to sell any of its uranium to countries that could use it to build atomic bombs president rakhman n nabiyev made those and other promises to secretary of state james a baker 3d , who flew into the snowblanketed capital of tajikistan today from turkmenistan mr baker is touring seven former soviet republics , including five with which washington has not yet established diplomatic relations he has been trying to use the carrot of american economic assistance and diplomatic recognition to entice the leaders of those republics to commit themselves to a list of about a dozen principles including free markets , democratic elections , respect for existing borders , protection of minorities and promises not to develop or sell nuclear weapons technology tajiks say yes judging from his terse remarks to reporters after today s talks , mr nabiyev was much more receptive to mr baker s armscontrol proposals than he was to his democracy and humanrights suggestions how much any of those promises are worth is an open question they are being made by officials like mr nabiyev , the head of the communist party in tajikistan in the mid1980 s , who was recently brought out of retirement by former communists to run against an islamic fundamentalist slate he won 58 percent of the vote but the islamic renaissance party , which has ties with neighboring iran and afghanistan , won 38 percent an american official involved in setting up mr baker s visit said the tajiks could not have been more forthcoming they said yes to every american logistical and scheduling request , the official said , but found it difficult to deliver on many of them an attitude that might apply to their commitment to american principles as well none of the republics want to say no to the united states but their new governments are so inexperienced in international affairs that they had to be advised by the american security teams on how to organize a proper motorcade uranium ore deposits whether tajikistan has a free market economy is largely irrelevant to american interests but its weaponsexport policies are a real concern , and were a focus of mr baker s discussion today with the president none of the central asian states mr baker is visiting on this tour have nuclear weapons those that had shortrange nuclear weapons deployed on their soil by the former soviet union have already had them withdrawn into russia nevertheless , tajikistan and neighboring turkmenistan and uzbekistan are rich in uranium ore both have also been visited before mr baker got here by highranking iranian and libyan delegations the president of turkmenistan pointed out to mr baker during his stop there that the first soviet atomic bomb was made with enriched uranium from his republic after meeting today with president nabiyev , mr baker said , one of the principles which we did discuss , which the president agreed , was the principle that we would work together to implement a mechanism for controlling the export of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction caution on islam what mr baker offered specifically was to send a team of american armscontrol experts to tajikistan to advise it on how to set up a system of laws and mechanisms to control and prevent the unauthorized export of technology related to nuclear weapons president nabiyev said as far as the uranium is concerned , i must say the press is ahead of events tajikistan has never sold and will never sell uranium to other important countries of all the central asian republics , tajikistan has the largest percentage of muslims , about 80 percent of its population of about five million , and it shares a long border with afghanistan therefore , president nabiyev must be very careful in his dealings on the question of islamic fundamentalist influence when asked during his news conference with mr baker about the rising involvement of iran in central asia , he declined to answer race against time privately , he made it clear to the american delegation that neither he personally nor the predominantly russian or russianspeaking elite of his country find any appeal in the islamic fundamentalist message , but out in the hinterlands that might not be the case moreover , he said , given the proximity of iran , his country needs and wants good relations with teheran balancing all of those pressures is the tricky act for all of the central asian leaders mr baker explained to mr nabiyev , according to american officials , that the united states perfectly understood his desire and need to maintain good relations with iran and afghanistan but that emulating an islamic fundamentalist system would be a mistake all of the central asian leaders , say american officials , appear to be in something of a race against time now unless the newly independent heads of state begin to deliver for their populations , radical messages , whether of an islamic or secular variety , are going to begin to have a greater resonance
saying that with the military business shrinking it had no good ways to invest its cash , the general dynamics corporation said yesterday that it would buy back up to 30 percent of its common shares for between 824 million and 975 million the announcement sent general dynamics shares soaring on the new york stock exchange , leaping 5625 each , to 71 the company has begun to pare back its military businesses but has rejected diversification outside the aerospace business it had 12 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of march , and more cash is expected as businesses are sold it has announced plans to sell operations that accounted for more than a third of its revenues last year the buyback will enable members of the crown family , descendants of the company s founder , to take out as much as 3675 million from general dynamics it will also reduce the family s combined ownership stake to 15 percent from about 22 percent general dynamics said it would make the repurchases through a dutch auction tender , in which shareholders offer to sell shares to the company and state the minimum price they will accept the company specified a range of 65375 to 75 a share , and it will accept tenders for 13 million shares , assuming that many are offered , at the lowest price necessary to buy all of the shares for example , if 10 million shares are tendered at the lowest price , 65375 , and another 3 million at prices ranging up to 71 , all 13 million shares will be purchased at the 71 price , even those tendered by holders willing to accept a lower price but a holder who offered to sell at 7125 would find that no shares had been accepted the soaring market price in the shares yesterday indicated hope among traders , including some arbitragers , that general dynamics could be forced to pay a price closer to the upper end of the range dutch auctions have become a relatively popular way for companies to buy back stock , especially in cases where large shareholders want to reduce their stake substantially in a company , as appears the case at general dynamics holders who want to be sure of selling their shares can offer to do so at a relatively low price , confident that the dutch auction will produce a higher price it is likely that the crown family interests will adopt that strategy in the wake of the cold war , and with drastically reduced military budgets likely , general dynamics has been pruning itself it sold its cessna aircraft subsidiary to textron inc in february for 600 million in cash , and it has agreed to sell its missile systems unit to thegeneral motors corporation in a complicated deal that will bring in at least 450 million in cash , and perhaps more , by sept 30 , 1993 the four businesses that william a anders , the chairman and chief executive , said last month would be kept are tactical military aircraft , nuclear submarines , armored vehicles and spacelaunching systems general dynamics had been saying since last fall that it planned to find a way to return a large amount of cash to shareholders but peter aseritis , an analyst at first boston , said the number of shares being bought back was somewhat higher than expected mr anders was criticized last year after it was disclosed that an unusual management compensation plan provided large payouts each time the company s share price rose at least 10 a share and stayed there for 10 trading days the company has since moved to a more conventional system of providing stock options to management , and it appears that the buyback will benefit them only if higher share prices endure after the share repurchase is completed , and they then exercise options or sell shares the repurchase is expected to be completed in midjuly an exact date will not be announced until later in the week no members of management or the board plan to tender shares in the offering , general dynamics said none of the three members of the crown family on the company s board lester crown , james s crown and charles h goodman will sell shares they directly own , but various crown family partnerships and trusts will tender a total of 45 million to 49 million shares a predecessor of the company was founded in 1919 by henry crown , the father of lester crown and grandfather of james mr goodman is married to a cousin of lester crown general dynamics said that neither its management nor any crown family directors believed it would be in the best interests of the company for the family to increase its percentage stake in the company , as would happen if the crown interests did not tender any shares but the company said that for the family to be assured that the payouts it received would be classified not as fully taxable dividends but as capital gains , on which a smaller tax would be owed , it was necessary for the family to reduce its collective stake by at least onefifth hence the decision to reduce the family s stake to 15 percent from the current 22 percent there might have been a way around that tax provision , said robert willens , an accounting analyst at lehman brothers companies in partial liquidation can buy back shares without worrying about dividend treatment but in general dynamics' sale of businesses , it was possible that the exact form of some of the sales might have run afoul of the rules , or that future sales would do so , and the crowns may not have wanted to take the risk in any case , yesterday s announcement accomplished something that few corporate insiders have managed a share price that rose sharply after it was announced that a founding family planned to sell a substantial portion of its stake graphs a shrinking general dynamics shows 1991 revenues and earnings , and tracks the corporation s stock price

alternative means of travel , including new bus and air routes , that meet the letter if not the spirit of the embargo page a6 tuesday , in an act of protest , libya cut itself off from the outside world as it observed a day of mourning for victims of the 1986 united states bombing raid that raid came in retaliation for what washington called libya s involvement in the destruction of a berlin nightclub used by american servicemen among the 37 libyans killed in the raids was the adopted daughter of libya s leader , col muammar elqaddafi all telephone , telegraph and postal communications were cut and travel to and from the country by air , land and sea was halted for 24 hours , so there was no official libyan reaction to the world court ruling or the sanctions but just hours before libya shut itself down , colonel qaddafi s chief lieutenant , abdulsalam jalloud , vowed that it will never give up its sons and urged arabs to ignore the sanctions defiance from libya he told a convention of arab labor leaders , libya cannot be humiliated and its dignity and sovereignty cannot be violated reuters reported from tripoli that when the 24hour selfimposed isolation ended , hundreds of libyan citizens took to the streets , chanting antiwestern slogans including , we are ready for confrontation and we do n't fear the united states under the terms of the security council action , the sanctions cannot be lifted until libya takes concrete actions to show that it has renounced terrorism beyond handing over suspects in two air disasters libya has refused to turn over to britain or the united states two men suspected in the explosion of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie , scotland , in which 270 people were killed , and has refused to send four other libyans to france for questioning in connection with the downing of a french airliner over west africa in 1989 , with the loss of 171 lives in moving against libya , the council balked at banning the sale of oil , on which libya s economy depends , after major european customers including italy , germany and spain said they could not easily change suppliers a lastminute bid by morocco , the only arab country on the security council , to postpone sanctions to allow the arab league to negotiate a compromise with libya was rejected by the council tuesday afternoon , just hours before the deadline of midnight new york time , or 6 am in tripoli britain s representative , sir david hannay , said the council did not agree that a case had been made for delay compliance not expected france s representative , jeanbernard merimee , said libya has practically ignored the council maybe they did not realize the council meant business , but we did he added , there have been many negotiations , and these efforts have not been met by equal good will libya also offered a lastminute compromise , saying it was ready to hand over the two suspects for trial by a court on the mediterranean island of malta , with whose government libya has good relations but the united states and britain rejected the idea it falls short , the state department spokeswoman , margaret d tutwiler , said tuesday in washington it does not meet the requirements of compliance and libya knows very well what it has to do in order to meet compliance arab league attempts since the security council moved against libya in january , the arab league has been trying to negotiate a compromise under which libya would surrender the suspects to the united nations or some other third party diplomats have said that they assume libya does not want the two tried in a western country because the suspects might defend themselves by implicating other more senior government officials in the bombings although the security council voted unanimously to order libya to hand over the two suspects in the pan am bombing and to cooperate with the french investigation , the move to impose sanctions has divided council members , with china , morocco , india , cape verde and zimbabwe abstaining in the vote nevertheless , china was not prepared to put its relations with the united states , britain and france at risk by exercising its veto as a permanent security council member and none of the other opponents of sanctions went so far as to cast a negative vote
chappaqua the reader s digest is not overly modest no company housed in a 1930 s georgian mansion that is only slightly smaller than blenheim could be called that still , it does not batter the public with its image other publications come and go , changing policies and formats , but this 70yearold magazine keeps prospering , like the national geographic , and last year expanded its domain to include russia not the least of the digest s assets is the art collection , which lila acheson wallace and her husband , dewitt , started in the 1940 s for the edification of their employees and which now numbers 7 , 000 works degas , monet , manet , van gogh and bonnard are among the names represented and we are not talking about studio scrapings the monets include a water lilies , and anemones and mirror , circa 1920 , is one of the loveliest still lifes that matisse ever painted the company is not slow to lend its treasures witness the manet to picasso show , which just completed a world tour , and the bloomsbury extravaganza that graced the katonah gallery in 1987 nor does it hesitate to sponsor exhibitions of art from other collections , like the burns holdings of 19thcentury photographs of black americans that were recently bestowed on the bronx museum of the arts and are currently on view at the hudson river museum that was for black history month last year the celebration this year is words and images , a joint production by the magazine and the council for the arts in westchester , which is on view through march 31 at the company s headquarters here it was organized by marian straw , director of the acbaw center for the arts in mount vernon , and catti james , an assemblagist who works under the name catti together they have chosen 23 black contemporaries a cross section of styles would include malcolm mooney s explosive abstractions in mostly yellow , red and black the mournful fairground scenes by ann tanksley , who seems influenced by jacob lawrence , and the black and white photographs of pamela owens that focus on street life in newark there are abstract reliefs modeled in white paper pulp by helen ramsaran , photographic images of boys with pigeons , painted by michael singletary on canvases of different sizes laid one on top of another , and the image of frederick douglass with white hair silkscreened 25 times and sometimes combined with photographic collage , the work of michael bramwell there are also some welded reliefs by david davis , one of which is an african mask excerpted , it seems , from the body of an orange automobile of diversity and promise there is plenty of solid accomplishment , a little less noteworthy in that division , however , are michael cummings , b j hord , sana mususama and todd williams mr cummings gives the impression of having chosen quilting as a medium because he can cover more ground faster with a sewing machine and patterned fabrics than with brush and paint in these three 9by6foot images titled african jazz , the figures are treated like african sculptures even though the piano player in them smokes a cigarette the artist handles his fabrics skillfully , enlivening geometric and floral patterns in black , white , gray and muted colors with stabs of , say , brilliant fuchsia and blue and adding highlights of buttons he also inserts passages that are quite realistic , like the jungle with bird at the top of no 3 these are exact and very clever analogies for new orleansstyle improvisation b j hord s contribution is an aerial view of marbleplaying boys who are modeled in colored papiermache and arranged on a painted ground it is a small and verywellmade scene set in a conventional picture frame sana mususama is a ceramist who , like robert arneson , does not dwell on the joys of craftsmanship but rather uses the medium as a means of expression none of her shapes is identifiable , yet all allude to reality , the best of them to organic growths like fungus and coral surfaces are alternately glazed and rough , and the colors are stunning that leaves the relief constructions of todd williams handsome things made of objects that could either have been shaped for the occasion or else found the best is a plaque shaded from black to crimson on which are 144 wood chips in rows of 12 each chip is covered with paper that is either painted or cut from colored photographs , so that the entire formation coheres into a geometrical abstraction ranging from reds , yellows and browns at the center to cool hues at the edges also handsome is the cluster of malletlike shapes with heads sliced obliquely and handles pointed downward the principal decoration here is glossy red paper imprinted with a dark floral design though erratic , the selection contains enough outstanding work to make it worth a visit there is no information about the artists beyond the fact that only six are westchester residents one wonders if the jurors chose to look for talent outside the county or felt obliged to visitors to the show must call 2415125 beforehand photos mask , above , a work in steel by david davis , and an untitled work in mixed media by

researchers have discovered the likely reason prostate cancer so often spreads into the backbone , an event that is usually a prelude to death from the disease they have found that bone tissue is rich in a protein that sharply stimulates the growth of prostate tumor cells the new work suggests that advanced prostate cancer may be amenable to treatment by blocking the activity of the stimulatory protein , a molecule called transferrin it also casts light on the grim puzzle of metastasis , the mechanism through which a rebel cell wrests free of a primary tumor and sets up lethal outposts elsewhere in the body dr marcella chackal rossi of the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge and dr bruce r zetter of children s hospital in boston report their results today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences this is a very interesting and encouraging finding , said dr william g stetlerstevenson , who studies cancer metastasis at the national cancer institute in bethesda , md the fact that prostate cancers frequently spread to the bone is a significant clinical problem , and it s important to understand the specific factors that facilitate the metastasis transferrin seems to be one of them rapid growth in backbone long dismissed as an old man s tumor and relatively neglected by many researchers , prostate cancer has lately captured wide attention among scientists and the public alike the malignancy afflicts a pecansized gland located at the base of the bladder that generates fluids to help nourish and transport sperm prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths among men this year , about 125 , 000 men will contract the malignancy , and about 32 , 000 who already suffer from the disease will die of it often they will die because the malignancy has spread from the gland to the bones of the spine when confined to the prostate , the malignancy grows slowly , taking decades to reach a diameter smaller than that of a pencil eraser but scientists have found that once it moves to the bone , its growth explodes , and death usually follows within five years in the new work , the researchers set out to determine what it is about bone that hastens the growth of prostate cancer cells they knew that any tumor cells escaping from the prostate could reach the spine through blood vessels traveling into it but they wanted to know why the cells thrived so malevolently in the bone once they infiltrated it it s not enough for the circulation to bring the cells somewhere , said dr zetter the site has to be suitable for the growth of the secondary tumor to find the factors that encourage the renegade cells , the researchers separated components from bone marrow and searched for proteins that hastened the proliferation of prostatic tumor cells growing in laboratory dishes that method yielded the isolation of transferrin , a protein that abounds throughout the body but is particularly concentrated in the bone wheelbarrow and fertilizer in its normal guise , transferrin helps to deliver iron into the body s cells , clasping onto trace bits of the metal floating in the bloodstream and ferrying it into the cell s yolklike interior , where the iron can perform tasks like fostering enzymatic reactions the protein seems necessary in bone marrow to help in blood cell performance red blood cells carry iron and need iron , so it s thought that one reason for the high concentration of transferrin in bone marrow is to allow red blood cell formation , said dr zetter the new results strongly suggest that beyond serving as a molecular wheelbarrow , transferrin can behave as a potent growth factor , kindling cell division there s been some dispute about whether transferrin is just a passive iron transporter , or whether it s also a growth factor in its own right , said dr george j todaro of the fred hutchinson cancer center in seattle it does seem here to be a critical growth factor for prostate cancer but transferrin does not always stimulate tumor growth the scientists tested other types of metastatic cancer cells , including samples from breast , stomach and lung malignancies , to see whether they responded to the ironbearing protein none did the researchers also propose that there may even be differences between prostate tumors some tumor cells may have a heightened avidity for transferrin because they bear extra receptors on their surface that can detect the protein , while other tumors may not be overendowed with receptors and thus be less likely to spread new avenue for therapy we hope that some of these findings will lead to the ability to distinguish between prostatic tumors that are highly metastatic , and those that will stay in the prostate , said dr zetter the work also may also lead to better therapies for prostate cancer currently , tumors that are confined to the gland are surgically removed or destroyed with radiation once the malignancy spreads , it can be held in abeyance with drugs that block male hormones , but the treatment almost inevitably fails researchers hope that they may eventually be able to control advanced prostate cancer by stanching its access to transferrin , perhaps designing antibodies that prevent the cells from responding to the protein but scientists do not yet know whether they can cut off the transferrin pipeline to prostate cancer cells without depriving the rest of the body of the critical delivery protein it s possible that if you were to block transferrin at sufficiently high levels to affect the cancer , said dr todaro , you 'd have some very serious side effects
paris , june 19 music and dance and art have no problems transcending linguistic frontiers movies and television can be subtitled or overdubbed literature can be translated but theater remains stubbornly isolated , the last bastion of national culture short of supertitles that ca n't hope to capture much of a fastmoving spoken text , or annoying insectlike earphone whispers that blot out the words actually being spoken in every country there are actors of enormous talent and popularity who are almost completely unknown outside their native cultures unless , of course , they also happen to work in the quasiinternational language of english or make movies theater directors have it better , since they can branch out to opera or film or even to plays in languages other than their own patrice chereau is known to western operalovers for his bayreuth ring from the late 1970 s , preserved on laser disks his recent berg wozzeck in paris , which is to travel to chicago and berlin , will further spread his reputation for scrupulously detailed , sensitively thoughtout direction of singers and actors , even if the results sometimes look superficially modish because of richard peduzzi s sleek set designs but mr chereau s far more extensive work in theater the bulk of his career remains largely confined to france and frenchspeaking switzerland from paris to brooklyn giorgio strehler could take his italianlanguage shakespeare tempest to the pepsico summerfare north of new york city a few years back because americans presumably know that play the only appearance of the paris director ariane mnouchkine in the united states , at the olympic arts festival in los angeles in 1984 , also consisted of shakespeare the repertory for her new york debut this fall , courtesy of the brooklyn academy of music , will be her version of the oresteia cycle , which again can count on the audience knowing the basic story miss mnouchkine is a painstaking rehearser who cancels performances if a leading actor cannot appear it took her so long to prepare the final play in the cycle , the furies , that it made it onto the stage of her theatre du soleil in the bois de vincennes east of paris for only two performances in late may before a longscheduled tour the paris press was asked not to write about a work still considered in progress , but suffice it to say that her vision of the furies , 15 ferocious creatures that seem to be crossbred baboons , boars , lions and dogs , is enough to inspire the scariest nightmares the beasts solve the communication problem by not speaking any known human language , just growls and roars a different 'die soldaten' berlin , newly renamed the capital of germany , may think it is heading for a new cultural golden age but the people in munich and cologne and frankfurt and dresden do n't seem too worried the cologne theater , for instance , just offered the premiere of die soldaten by j m r lenz , the prescient , protomodernist german playwright of 200 years ago whose text became the libretto for bernd alois zimmermann s 12tone opera of the same name the play was presented in an excoriating , operatically extroverted style by werner schroeter , the director and stage designer mr schroeter also directs films , but here the formula that film equals international fame breaks down his films are far too arty and weird for that the latest , starring isabelle huppert , was called malina and has n't made it to new york but his direction for opera and the theater speaks to a broader audience , and he is steadily building a major career in central europe the best of berlin it is frustrating for someone who regularly attends the theater in central europe to realize that most of the superb productions and performers there will never be seen in englishspeaking countries a berlin schaubuhne staging of amphitryon by heinrich von kleist a napoleonicera prussian playwright central to the german theater and rarely heard elsewhere just closed , for instance , and to the final night people were crowding the lobby for lastminute tickets directed by klaus michael gruber , another acclaimed german veteran , it deliciously mixed slapstick and a more refined comic manner to hear jutta lampe intone the single german word ach at the very end , hinting at selfknowledge , sexuality , humor and grief , was worth a trip to berlin along with many productions in the 1970 s and 80 s by peter stein at the schaubuhne , miss lampe starred in a monologue version of virginia woolf s orlando directed by robert wilson now mr wilson is going to restage the piece in french with miss huppert , who will attract more attention because she has had a film career harvey lichtenstein of the brooklyn academy of music has spoken of trying to produce an englishlanguage version with some famous english or american actress that wo n't help miss lampe attain an international reputation but she hardly lacks honors and acclaim she recently became the first actress awarded a prestigious german prize for her contributions to that country s theater on berlin s busy stages
to the editor in immigration reform holds key to economy \( letter , nov 27 \) prof vernon m briggs jr of cornell university s new york state school of industrial and labor relations uses a nov 10 news analysis , how to lift the poor , as a springboard from which to promote his own antiimmigrant agenda in the process , he confuses the issues and misleads readers by asserting , without offering any evidence , that our immigration policy fosters poverty and urban blight the contrary is true a 1989 department of labor study found that neither united states workers in complementary jobs , nor most minority workers , appear to be adversely affected by immigration this finding is supported by many other studies , including those by the rand corporation , the university of maryland , the united states council of economic advisers and the national research council , all of which indicate that immigrants in the united states , both legal and undocumented , do not have a negative effect on the earnings and employment opportunities of nativeborn americans you concluded on this topic two years ago in so much for assumptions about immigrants and jobs \( the week in review , april 14 , 1990 \) that the conventional economic wisdom pitting american poor against the immigrant poor is crumbling in a recent poll of 38 of the country s top economists , 68 percent favored increased immigration , while none favored less these studies also show that immigrants pay more than 90 billion in taxes annually , that they are not a drain on the economy and they contribute far more than what they receive as the studies show , immigrants create jobs for both citizens and other immigrants and , contrary to mr briggs s assertion , are revitalizing many cities by starting businesses and generating jobs in the communities in which they settle indeed , the policies mr briggs advocates will have the effect of worsening urban problems by creating a class of people especially vulnerable to exploitation , by depressing wages and by causing widespread discrimination and intolerance that will affect all for example , a 1990 study by congress s general accounting office found that the 1986 law penalizing employers who hire undocumented aliens has led to widespread discrimination against citizens and authorized workers urban reform is a difficult and complicated issue that cannot be intelligently addressed by advancing simplistic and xenophobic ideas such as those expounded by mr briggs a sound policy attacks poverty it does not groundlessly make scapegoats of immigrants lucas guttentag director , immigrants' rights project american civil liberties union new york , dec 2 , 1992
following are excerpts from yesterday s state of the city address by mayor david n dinkins we have just ended another very difficult year , as life proved to be a little harder , a little harsher than the year before it has been a year that began with the threat of war abroad and that concluded with tragedy and injustice here at home , as nine promising young people were taken from us so cruelly in a stairwell at city college if the events of last year have taught us anything , it is that none of us can escape the hazards of this very real , very serious national recession i understand the feelings of hopelessness and helplessness that this recession has caused for too many new yorkers in facing these difficult times , we realize there are some things we cannot change by ourselves a turnaround in the national economy will happen only when washington commits itself to better lives for our people indeed , as we work to fill gaps of billions of dollars where there once was federal aid , we sometimes , feel , quite frankly , as if washington has placed a giant boulder in the paths of all state and local officials , directing us to roll it up the steepest of hills yet , we cannot let the callous elimination of federal dollars crush our dreams we must begin as i have always begun by hearing the voices of our people , especially of those whose pain is too great and whose voices are too small for a government that succumbs to silence can accomplish nothing and will wither in the depths of its own isolation the voice of a young mother who wants to work , but who cannot find adequate day care facilities in which to place her children , resounds in my ears her words inspired my efforts to develop programs that help people find jobs while their children are in centers staffed by devoted and loving child care workers i remember the voices i heard one cold december morning during my visit to the bread line at the church of st francis of assisi one man waiting in line told me i do n't want my family and neighbors to see me this way i do n't intend to be here next year i understood just what he meant my resolve to build a shelter system that offers our thousands of homeless residents a dignified place to stay on their journey home was strengthened that day the griefstricken voices of the family of james zappalorti , a developmentally disabled young man from staten island who died merely because of whom he chose to love , cannot be erased from my memory and i pledged to james s family that i will continue to fight for the passage of a biasrelated violence bill legislation that has been held up for too long in albany because of a handful of senate republicans the voice of a disabled person crystallized the cruelties of our own thoughtlessness as he explained to me the difficulty of pressing an elevator emergency button , if you must reach that button from a wheelchair so i have made it my job to further the access of disabled residents throughout this city and today i also hear the voices of all our people saying much more needs to be done right now in order to turn this city around now some have suggested that we simply cut and cut away at the services that affect the lives of the most vulnerable among us but as long as i am mayor , i refuse to do that of course bond ratings are important , but we are judged against a higher standard we have so many who need so much i have not turned my back on them , and i never will i came into government hearing the voices of those in need , and i will never stop listening we all know that local government cannot change the course of a national economy that is headed in the wrong direction nor can we stand by and drift into everdeeper waters of despair we have developed a package of programs to help make a small dent in the burdens of our residents during this time of economic hardship i know that a dozen years of reactionary politics in washington have served to reduce the real incomes of families across america that s why i have proposed to stabilize property taxes over at least the next two years our course is clear we must hold firm to our vision of this city a city that stands for openness and compassion , for fiscal integrity and prudence , and most of all , a city that stands for opportunity the opportunity that generations of immigrants understood when they saw ellis island for the first time it is the opportunity that awaits two brooklyn college graduates , lisette nieves , our newest rhodes scholar , and marshall scholar toba friedman daughters and granddaughters of families who came here seeking all that new york has to offer , two young women who earned the right to make their dreams come true graduates of our public school system , they prove that the energy and ambition that built this city still shine brightly today , and that the promise of new york is within reach of us all photo mayor david n dinkins spoke in his state of the city address of hearing the voices of our people , especially those whose pain is too great and whose voices are too small he offered several plans to help the poor as well as to ease the burdens of residents and businesses hit by the recession \( ruby washington the new york times \)
with new york state s top insurance official threatening to approve a steep rate increase for 14 million customers of empire blue cross and blue shield , gov mario m cuomo and senate republican leaders continued yesterday to accuse one other of sabotaging efforts to solve the company s severe financial problems on saturday , the state insurance superintendent , salvatore r curiale , said that unless the state was willing to provide empire , the state s largest health insurer , with an infusion of cash , he was likely to grant the full rate increase the company has requested for jan 1 and yesterday mr curiale sent a memorandum to the governor s office outlining empire s bleak outlook he said that unless he grants the increase , the company s cash reserves would probably dwindle to zero by the end of january if the legislature refuses to act before the end of the year , i believe that i should grant the full increase , mr curiale said the memorandum was released by mr cuomo s office in an effort to place the blame for the size of the impending rate increase on the republicancontrolled state senate average increase if the superintendent approves the entire request , health insurance premiums would increase by an average of 257 percent for 14 million smallgroup and individual customers in the new york city , midhudson and albany areas some subscribers would see their rates go up by as much as 59 percent empire attributes its troubles to its mandate to accept any applicant , no matter how sick private insurers , on the other hand , are allowed to choose their customers and reject those considered likely to drain their resources that system is scheduled on april 1 when a new law , meant to force commercial insurers to accept all customers , takes effect but long before that , empire says , it will be insolvent unless it receives a rate increase or other revenues the rate increase would be a political embarrassment for both the governor and the legislature , who last summer enacted the insurance legislation to benefit empire , assuming that it would help reduce the company s need for future rate increases a oneshot infusion governor cuomo has proposed helping empire with a oneshot infusion of 85 million from a fund that provides malpractice insurance to doctors empire , which has paid hundreds of millions of dollars into the fund in the last seven years , has sued the state to get its money back , and the money would come from a settlement of the lawsuit but negotiations over the issue have stalled in a complicated series of maneuvers and countermaneuvers that have left the democratic governor accusing the senate of playing politics and the senate officials in turn accusing the governor of trumping up crises to make them look irresponsible yesterday , the senate majority leader , ralph j marino , a republican from oyster bay , li , repeated his suggestion that the insurance superintendent wait until the end of january before ruling on the rate increase , particularly in light of disclosures that a united states senate subcommittee had begun a farreaching investigation of the company s management and finances and he said the governor should settle the lawsuit with empire but leave the legislature to appropriate the 85 million when it returns in january mr cuomo , however , said he did not trust the senate to come through their promises are worthless , he said in an interview for weeks , the governor has been trying to cajole , threaten and shame the republicans into returning to albany to address the empire issue and two other matters a financial package for the metropolitan transportation authority that would eliminate the need to raise bus and subway fares , and a proposal to shift nearly 95 million in leftover 1988 state transportation bond act money from long island and new york city to communities in upstate new york it s a joke , mr cuomo said yesterday of mr marino s explanations for not returning to albany we have asked over and over again for the republicans to explain to us why they ca n't come , but it s been a series of phony arguments but the senate republicans have said there was no need to return to the capital before the regular legislative session begins in january these last several weeks , senator marino said in a statement , governor cuomo has attempted to force the legislature to return to albany three weeks early by insisting there were crises that must be dealt with immediately , when closer examination revealed that none required an immediate solution and no agreements were at hand mr cuomo is so angry at the senate that he has eagerly seized upon news accounts about a nearly 1 million retirement package for a long island school superintendent to announce yesterday that he planned to set up a mechanism to investigate salaries and management in the state s school districts
washington , may 12 despite a season of bitter partisanship , two of congress s most divergent members today proposed a radical change in the way the country collects childsupport payments from absent fathers most experts agree that the current system is deeply flawed and that it contributes to a variety of urban problems , including escalating welfare rolls and children living in poverty but while many proposals have been advanced to change the system , none have been embraced by such an unlikely alliance as the one offered today by representative thomas j downey , a liberal long island democrat , and representative henry j hyde , an illinois republican who is one of congress s staunchest conservatives the proposal met with praise from many liberals today , skepticism from the white house and attacks from some conservatives bipartisan approach i am here to demonstrate that republicans and democrats can work together , said mr downey , who has been working on the proposal for more than a year several months ago he approached mr hyde , who has long had an interest in childsupport issues both of us are appalled by what we see today , the disintegration of the american family and the havoc this has wrought on millions of innocent children , mr hyde said their plan would transfer responsibility for all childsupport collection from states to the internal revenue service and it would also guarantee that the government make a minimum payment of 2 , 000 a year for a mother with one child if it failed to collect from the absent father the maximum per family would be 4 , 000 the proposal would also create 300 , 000 new public service jobs to give unemployed fathers a way to make their payments mr downey estimated that the steppedup enforcement could increase the 11 billion now collected in child support to as much as 35 billion a year he predicted a substantial drop in poverty and dependency as a result mr hyde said the plan echoed traditional conservative themes by holding fathers responsible for their families the lawmakers estimated the cost of the proposal at 5 billion to 10 billion a year they plan to introduce it as legislation early next year gail wilensky , a domestic policy adviser to president bush , said the white house would consider supporting a small pilot project if the funds came from cuts in other social spending but she criticized the notion of a government guarantee , saying it might discourage fathers from paying other conservatives said the plan would discourage single mothers from working or getting married it s the worst single welfare proposal i 've ever seen in my life , bar none , said robert rector of the heritage foundation , a research organization in washington disintegration of family in calling for the plan , mr downey emphasized the sweeping and perhaps irreversible changes in family structure that have occurred over the past generation in 1960 , 91 percent of american children lived in singleparent families by 1990 that figure had grown to 247 percent of the approximately 10 million women raising children by themselves , 42 percent have never been awarded child support from a state court many women are reluctant to identify the father , particularly since childsupport payments can be used to reduce welfare benefits but collection remains a big problem even when state courts get involved some fathers deliberately evade payment , often by moving to another state others have little or no earnings and find themselves unable to pay only 51 percent of the women with courtorders collect the full amount they are owed another 24 percent get less than they are owed , and 25 percent receive no money from the father the downeyhyde plan would leave responsibility for identifying fathers with the states , but provide new money to do so only mothers who cooperated in identifying fathers would be eligible for the guaranteed benefits federal and state roles states would determine the initial amount a father was expected to pay the internal revenue service would be responsible for collecting and distributing the payments , through a payroll deduction system much like the one used to collect taxes in addition , the plan offers new jobtraining services for fathers with low incomes mr downey said the proposal was carefully put together to include work incentives for women on welfare if they stayed on welfare , their grants would be reduced by the amount the government paid or collected , so there would be no net income gain but if they worked , they could keep both their earnings and the childsupport amount it was mr hyde , the conservative , who resorted to the visionary language more often used by liberal child advocates the social costs of the current system ca n't be calculated , he said we 've seen some of it in riots , in lives wasted from the moment they 're conceived

bonn , sept 18 masked gunmen burst into a berlin restaurant late thursday night and killed four men , including a leading kurdish politician from iran among the victims was sadegh sharafkandi , 54 years old , secretary general of the iranian democratic party of kurdistan he took over the leadership of the party after his predecessor was slain in vienna in 1989 kurdish exile leaders blamed the iranian secret service for the attack the police later said they also believed that iranians were involved in a statement late today , the iranian embassy in bonn rejected charges that teheran had sponsored the killers we do not know who these people are or for what purpose they came to berlin , the embassy said the world s 20 million kurds are natives of various countries , none of which grant them full rights about half live in turkey , where some of their villages are now under military attack some 45 million live in iraq , 25 million in iran , and smaller numbers in syria or former soviet republics because most kurdish groups favor either creation of an independent kurdistan or autonomy within existing nations , they are considered hostile by governments that rule over them at least 10 iranian exiles opposed to the teheran government have been killed in europe since 1987 in geneva , london , vienna and paris the killings thursday were the first in germany witnesses said two gunmen entered a greek restaurant in the wilmersdorf quarter about 11 pm , shouted , you sons of whores ! and opened fire on mr sharafkandi and his guests another gunman guarded the door as they sprayed gunfire into the back room where their victims were sitting , the assailants were heard to curse in persian waiting to meet exiles three of the victims , including mr sharafkandi , who was evidently the principal target , died instantly a fourth died later at a berlin hospital a witness said that after the burst of fire , one gunman pumped several shots into the body of mr sharafkandi kurdish exiles identified two of those killed as the party s european representative , fattah abdouli , and its german representative , homayoun ardalan there were conflicting reports over the identity of the fourth man mr sharafkandi , a father of three who held a doctorate in chemistry from the university of paris , was reportedly waiting for iranian exiles to meet him when the killers burst in delegates of the kurdish democratic party of iran were in berlin for a socialist international convention mayor eberhard diepgen denounced the crime as a cowardly and perfidious murder attack the federal police assigned 20 detectives to the case politicians reacted swiftly to the attack bjorn engholm , leader of the opposition social democratic party , called for a worldwide search for the killers the green party urged a cutoff of economic aid to iran if evidence shows that teheran was involved in paris , massoud rajavi , president of the national council of resistance of iran , asserted that iranian agents had formed nests of terror and espionage in germany germany maintains good relations with iran , and german companies sell a variety of products there but many germans are sympathetic to the kurdish cause , partly because they have had contact with the many kurdish exiles living here
while presidential candidates hardly mention abortion , television commercials on the issue are becoming more and more important to house and senate candidates , especially to those advocating abortion rights in colorado , a television screen shows an ambulance and a gurney in silhouette a voice proclaims , working as a young deputy , ben nighthorse campbell s strong prochoice stand comes from seeing a young woman in an ambulance one night , the victim of a backalley abortion another democrat running for the senate , john rauh in new hampshire , put his wife , a former president of the state s planned parenthood agency , on camera to say she was outraged when politicians like judd gregg try to interfere in women s private lives mr gregg , the governor of new hampshire , is her husband s opponent in louisville , a republican candidate for the house , susan stokes , has a new advertisement showing a flag as a voice says , she trusts the women of kentucky , over its politicians , to do the right thing then it says her democrat opponent , representative ron mazzoli , opposes a woman s right to choose even when she s been raped , or is the victim of incest compelling visual features none of the ads have the compelling visual features of the antiabortion commercials being run by about a dozen candidates , starting with those for michael bailey , a republican challenger in indiana , which show fetuses and body parts some ads show fragments held by a forceps a woman is heard describing a fetus as just a blob of tissue another woman says , brain functioning , 10 fingers , 10 toes then the first says , it s a woman s choice those ads have been shown with different voice messages from different candidates for example , an independent running in new jersey s first district , kenneth lowndes , promises , as your congressman i will meet the propaganda of choice with the truth , that abortion is murder of the most helpless among us but while most antiabortion ads are being used by candidates whose chances of victory , like mr lowndes s , are remote , the commercials on the other side are crucial to the strategy of candidates in tight races litmus test issue don foley , political director of the democratic senatorial campaign committee , called these ads our closer , our dennis eckersley , because he felt they were especially valuable at the end of a tight race joe slade white of new york , a democratic consultant who made the campbell ad , said he felt the issue worked almost as a litmus test , with voters saying , if you 're wrong on this issue , i do n't like you many of the ads are very simple , with either a candidate or a voiceover saying one candidate is on the right side of the issue and the other on the wrong side , as often as the point can be made in 30 seconds for example , jane harman , a los angeles democrat running for the house against joan milke flores , says to the camera i'm prochoice my opponent , joan milke flores , says abortions should be illegal she wants to outlaw abortions i believe in a woman s right to choose joan flores thinks government should decide now the choice is yours sometimes the ads do not focus entirely on the abortion issue , but slip it in among others representative barbara boxer , running for the senate in california against bruce herschensohn , uses her rival s statements in his own voice saying various things she disagrees with , including , what i want is the repeal of roe v wade and in new york , attorney general robert abrams , who is running against senator alfonse m d'amato , accuses the incumbent of a variety of wrong stands , including a desire to ban all abortions but more often the ads do concentrate on the abortion issue , often with a spin aimed at the sort of conservatives who are generally antagonistic to government as intrusive the similar message comes through in a basic rancheronthestreet ad sponsored by the national abortion rights action league on behalf of representative pat williams , a montana democrat a man in a cowboy hat , identified as bill mackay , says , i grew up in a republican household , and i 've always considered myself a republican , but in this race i'm going to vote for pat williams because he agrees with me that there are issues that the government has no place in , such as the woman s right to choose prof kathleen hall jamieson , dean of the annenberg school of communications at the university of pennsylvania , a leading student of campaign advertising , said the advantage of an ad on abortion rights was that it could immediately express a principle and a conception in a way that no deficit plan and no health plan is going to do she said viewers saw such stands as taken out of deepseated principle , a rare political commodity the same argument could be made for candidates who use ads opposing abortion but most are doing so less to win than to get the issue on the air , as abortion foes have done since ellen mccormack ran for president as a democrat in 1976 john deardourff , a republican consultant who has made similar ads favoring abortionrights candidates in past campaigns , said survey data showed that taking a prochoice stand serves as a metaphor for a whole range of social issues he said , people make a leap of faith that you care about children in a range of ways few ads advocating abortion rights are run by republicans neil newhouse , a republican consultant , said that was because most prochoice republican candidates are running against prochoice democrats

in a campaign in which education continues to get lost someplace between the economy and character , the real question is not so much how candidates differ on the issues but how much education will matter in their presidencies broad philosophical differences do divide the candidates and shape their education policies but it is striking just how much president bush , gov bill clinton and ross perot agree about what ails american schools and how to fix them all three candidates endorse the idea , untried in american education , of formal national curriculum standards outlining what american students should be expected to know all want some national testing system to check whether students know these things and how well their schools are teaching them they all say they would pay more for preschool programs like head start they all believe that hiring and keeping betterqualified teachers means opening teaching to people without standard teaching degrees and paying more money to better teachers or those being lured from highersalaried fields like science or mathematics all three candidates want to give more power to principals and teachers and less to central bureaucracies president bush and governor clinton have both proposed linking high school and work through an apprenticeship program for students not planning to go to college philosophy how big a role for washington \? yet important differences remain among the candidates clinton is more of a believer in proactive government than bush , who believes in privatism and market forces , said michael d usdan , president of the institute for educational leadership , a washingtonbased group clinton is much more supportive of investing in preventive strategies as befits a republican , president bush minimizes the role that the federal government can play in transforming american schools and turns instead to the free market his education strategy relies not on money or federal programs but primarily on an appeal to local communities , parents and businesses these consumers of education must force changes that insiders like teachers and bureaucrats have stymied , the president s advisers argue this conviction that only competition will improve schools is the reason the president is pushing so hard for vouchers that would allow parents to take the tax money they otherwise would have paid for public schools and spend it on private or parochial school tuition instead there is little evidence so far that such private school choice would improve schools , because only one smallscale experiment is under way , in milwaukee as befits a democrat , governor clinton sees a much larger education role for the federal government , with washington providing more money , programs and leadership his wife , hillary , has worked extensively with children s advocacy organizations , and both clintons place much more emphasis on the links between education and poverty , prenatal care , children s health and preschool programs governor clinton argues that alienating the very education insiders who would implement changes would doom real reform and he dismisses the freemarket model , saying that using vouchers would amount to using public money for private schools he and other critics fear that vouchers would skim off the best students with the savviest parents for private schools , leaving the public schools with handicapped , disruptive or neglected students the eclectic perot mr perot is , as usual , eclectic , guardedly endorsing at least a pilot version of a voucher plan beloved to conservatives but also promising to give even more money to preschools than governor clinton educators have traditionally judged politicians by how much money they give to schools all three candidates say money alone will not solve problems but of the three , governor clinton has pledged to spend the most money on education 63 billion in new money over the next four years , primarily for a new college loan program , full financing of head start and an apprenticeship program that would link high school students to jobs although mr perot has provided sketchy figures , his plan calls for 12 billion in new spending over the next four years most of the money would pay for a vastly expanded head start program mr bush has repeatedly said that more money will not fix schools , and his education strategy does not offer much 690 million last year and 768 million this year but education spending increased by 22 percent after inflation during his term head start received the largest increases in its 25year history , in part because congress in most cases appropriated even more money than the president had asked for proposals loans for college draw attention of all the proposals , the one that has most caught the public imagination has been governor clinton s college loan plan he would offer loans to students regardless of their income and let them repay them either as a percentage of their income or through national service but details have been scarce , and the plan is more restricted than mr clinton s brief descriptions suggest
albany , march 26 describing himself as struck by his 20 percent showing in the connecticut primary , even after his withdrawal from the presidential race , paul e tsongas said tonight that new york voters could send a message by voting for him in the state s democratic primary on april 7 while hardly amounting to a formal reentry into the campaign , mr tsongas s comments clearly indicated that he was reevaluating his withdrawal in light of continued question about the political viabilty of the two remaining candidates , gov bill clinton of and former gov edmund g brown jr and he repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility that a strong showing in new york , where his name will still appear on the ballot despite his withdrawal last week , could induce him to get back into the race his remarks , made in a telephone interview from a manhattan hotel , came as he was asked about a drive mounted by the directors of his campaign in new york to persuade people to vote for him visits to new york the former massachusetts senator will be in new york at least three times between now and april 7 , including an appearance as grand marshal of a greek independence day parade this sunday in manhattan and at a speech before the suffolk county democratic committee next thursday mr tsongas said that the new york events were longscheduled commitments that did not amount to formal campaign events but that he would not dissuade people from voting for him my attitude in new york is that we will neither encourage nor discourage , but treat the efffort with respect , mr tsongas said mr tsongas also offered the unusual argument which he said was made to him by a friend this week that any effort on his part to quash his supporters' effort would put him in league with all the people who dismissed his candiidacy when he first announced it he said , 'paul , you 'd be treating them just like people treated you a year ago , ' mr tsongas said that really hit me between the eyes despite his withdrawal last week , he received 20 percent of the vote in the connecticut primary on tuesday in the absence of outright disavowal of the effort by mr tsongas , and in light of the secondplace finish by mr clinton in connecticut , it would appear that mr tsongas is interested in keeping his options open for a possible return to the race the new york campaign chairman for mr tsongas , jim armenakis , said last week that he felt bound by the former senator s withdrawal not to carry on a shadow campaign , but added that he would reassess that position after the connecticut results were in we are trying to draft him back into the race , mr armenakis said today in an interview we are telling people that he is still a legitimate option in another twist to the primary here , former new york city mayor edward i koch said today that he was also urging new yorkers to vote for mr tsongas , but only as a way to help secure a deadlocked convention that he said he hoped would turn to one of five other democrats senators lloyd bentsen of texas , al gore of tenneessee , bill bradley of new jersey or sam nunn of georgia , or representative richard a gephardt of missouri clinton and brown are both losers , mr koch said it s george bush s dream come true he must wake up every morning with a smile on his face and go to bed at night with a laugh a vote for tsongas , he added , was a good way to vote for none of the above mr armenakis said a new organization , the committee for a democratic victory , was being set up to raise money to help the effort this essentially means that while contributions to the existing tsongas campaign committee are used to retire its debt , donations to the new committee will be used to further the drafttsongas movement
san diego reggie jackson , never at a loss for the flair for the dramatic , stepped to the plate yesteday to face bob gibson with the bases loaded and put the hall of famer s first pitch over the wall no , it was not a dream , or a rotisserie league fantasy it was just one of those memorable moments , in this case in an oldtimers' game , that baseball is still more than capable of manufacturing jackson , of course , not only knew how to provide what the fans in the seats want to see he also knows who they want to see and as he prepared to play in the heroes of baseball game in a soldout jack murphy stadium here yesterday , jackson had a pretty good idea of what the fans might have wanted to see tonight in baseball s 63d allstar game cecil , jackson said cecil fielder people want to see him , not only because he s deserving , but because if this is a show , you want your stars here the problem is , fielder , the major league s runbattedin leader with 75 for the detroit tigers , is not here a victim of too few votes and too few roster spaces , fielder is sitting at home , nursing an ego that started out the season bruised from backtoback failed runs at the american league most valuable player award it is not a decision that sits well with those on the allstar squads you would have thought we could have at least brought him here for the homerun hitting contest , roger clemens , the red sox rocket , said i know it s got to be a little tough to take , said fred mcgriff , the starting first baseman for the national league and a former teammate of fielder s in toronto seventyfive rbi s that s some guys' seasons the national basketball association tends to find room for michael , magic , isiah and larry why ca n't baseball , with more room to maneuver , find a way to accommodate its special players regardless of how they do on the ballot \? to his credit , fielder , the tigers' softspoken first baseman , termed his exclusion from the 28man roster of the american league a petty issue compared with others he has faced in his life in 1990 and 1991 , fielder was named to the american league allstar team this year , he finished behind mark mcgwire in the balloting , a decision that no fan need defend , given the fine season being enjoyed by the oakland first baseman the thing is , fielder still could have been included in the reserves chosen by the american league s manager , tom kelly , and president , dr bobby brown kelly , hemmed in by rules requiring representation from each team and by a potential overabundance of righthanded hitters among his outfielders and first basemen , chose to look to other positions , and players , to fill the need for lefthanded bats thus no fielder we tried to balance the roster , brown said look , it s agonizing to make these decisions and we try to be fair and every year , we know that someone is going to feel left out this year alone , we had fielder , dave winfield , dave fleming , guys you could make a good argument for including no number is ever enough winfield and fleming do have arguments none have as good a case as fielder s , so perhaps his is the case that should be used to force change because fielder is not some flash , some rookie being asked to pay his dues before knocking on fame s door nor is he a veteran who has seen his better years and now seeks rewards for his overall contributions to the game fielder is more , a man who compiled 95 home runs and 265 rbi in his previous two seasons , and continues this season on a pace that seems sure to top his personal best in rbi even in the face of those arguments , some will argue that the system , though tough , is not wrong it may not be perfect , but there is no perfect way of doing this , hall of famer brooks robinson said we all have to remember , though , it s the fans' game they select the people they want to see and if you , as a player , get shortchanged , you get shortchanged because it s show business , anyway , that s all but ryne sandberg , the perennial top votegetter in the national league , sees a different sort of flaw there are so many great players , there s just not enough room for them all , the cubs' second baseman said i do n't know , maybe they could expand the rosters because it s such a special game robinson and sandberg are both right the flaw is not with the fans , but with roster size the standard roster size has been 28 for each league since 1969 it has not , in those 23 years , taken into consideration the expansion that has increased the majors from 24 to 26 teams the american league , which expanded in the 1970 s to 14 teams , feels the burden more that league must satisfy the minimum requirements that every team be represented and must accommodate two more franchises than the national league does that will change for the senior circuit come next year , when the colorado rockies and the florida marlins join up perhaps then , with national leaguers equally squeezed at the ballot box as well as by the limited roster space , baseball will recognize its own growth and bring the allstar game into the 1990 s yes , there will still be some players who feel slighted and it will increase the burden on the managers to get as many allstars into the game as possible but considering the alternative , sitting on the bench is no snub at all compared with sitting at home trying to figure out why 75 rbi did n't make the cut photo cecil fielder , the major league runbattedin leader with 75 , is noticeably absent from the allstar game \( neil leifer \)
between one and two million american women have undergone breast implant surgery some to correct a deformity or replace a breast lost to cancer , the vast majority for purely cosmetic reasons many of them , citing no ill effects , will say they made the right decision sadly , however , none can say it was a truly informed decision as the us food and drug administration has only just discovered , at least one manufacturer withheld safety information and at least one of its employees lied in telling plastic surgeons that safety studies were under way the fda , then , is absolutely right to ask for a voluntary moratorium on silicone breast implants \( saline implants are unaffected \) until safety concerns are answered breast implants have been around for 30 years , but no safety testing was required until 1976 when congress mandated that medical devices be tightly regulated in 1982 the fda warned manufacturers that implants would be among the medical devices for which safety data could be required in 1987 the agency gave specific details about what information would be asked for last july the data were called in and found wanting even so , four months later an fda advisory panel recommended keeping silicone breast implants on the market , at least for awhile the information provided by four manufacturers , the panel said , was insufficient to show that the implants were safe but neither did it prove them to be unsafe the panel therefore recommended further reviews over a 10year period that seemed reasonable but that was before the agency knew about material that has come to light in legal proceedings involving dow corning wright , the largest manufacturer of breast implants this material is sealed by court order the agency also made its decision before it learned about internal memorandums between dow executives the memos , which have not been officially disclosed , suggest that the company has known for years that the devices may leak or rupture nor , finally , was the fda aware of a 1977 memo in which a marketing executive admitted that he misled plastic surgeons by assuring them with crossed fingers that dow had an active safety study in progress new results of studies by rheumatologists linking implants to autoimmune diseases are also surfacing consequently dr david kessler , the fda commissioner , will recall the advisory panel within 45 days to consider the new information it may raise enough concerns to justify banning silicone breast implants or may leave their safety neither proved nor disproved no matter what the findings , however , dow corning wright has a lot to explain
this year s presidential election could well be a watershed event for doctors many physicians think it could determine the future of the nation s troubled healthcare system , perhaps radically changing their profession and so , abandoning their usual stance on the sidelines in presidential races , many doctors are volunteering to assist in the bushquayle or clintongore campaigns the doctors' concerns reflect national sentiments recent public surveys have found healthcare to be second only to the economy as the most important issue president bush s proposals include a system of health insurance networks , which he said would reduce costs for small businesses under this proposal , insurers could not refuse to cover an employer or place limits on people with preexisting medical conditions governor clinton s plan includes national spending limits for hospitals and doctors , uniform community health insurance rates for small businesses , guaranteed basic coverage for everyone , and limits on prescription drug prices doctors have long been seen as conservatives , but campaign officials say the health debate is mobilizing people on both sides the medical profession is aware that this will be an election of change and that there are two very clear choices in reforming the healthcare system , said dr peter b collis , an emergencymedicine specialist in washington who heads the healthcare coalition for bushquayle a lot of people have picked a position and are becoming politically active the american medical association does not endorse presidential candidates , although its political action committee , ampac , distributes about 4 million in election years to an array of house and senate candidates but this year the association has called for a presidential candidates' debate on health care , and it is encouraging members to work in the campaigns , referring them either to the republican dr collis or , on the democratic side , dr stephen gleason , a des moines osteopathic family practitioner both are ama members although it did not endorse a candidate , one of the largest medical specialty groups and a voting member of the ama , the american college of physicians , called yesterday for a national limit on healthcare spending similar to a clinton proposal dr gleason said he had contacted about 4 , 000 doctors who were joining clinton campaign committees , raising money , giving speeches and supporting congressional and local candidates dr collis predicts that most of the nation s 500 , 000 physicians will support president bush for reelection public opinion experts noted that most surveys include too few physicians to justify separate reporting on their views but dr collis cited a writein straw poll in the medical tribune , a biweekly newspaper based in new york , which has a national circulation of 130 , 000 bill ingram , the paper s editor in chief , said that 450 doctors participated after the tribune published the candidates' health proposals , up sharply from fewer than 300 in 1984 and 1988 this year they favored bush , 44 percent , over clinton , 20 percent , with 47 percent for andre marrou , a libertarian candidate , and 15 percent for none of the above many said that they would still vote for h ross perot , who was favored by 24 percent before he left the race physicians have received some kind of wakeup call , said dr irwin redlener , a new york pediatrician who is chairman of the national health leadership council for clinton gore '92 the council s 100 members include medical , public health and nursing deans and professors , hospital executives , state officials , health policy experts and private practitioners we found ourselves surrounded in an ocean of paperwork , bureaucracy and intrusion into how health care is practiced , and in a system that has gone very much out of control , dr redlener said doctors have always objected to any kind of government regulation or paperwork a bush supporter , dr beverly carpenter , a cincinnati internist specializing in rheumatology , agreed that the paperwork and hassle is getting ridiculous i do n't want the government to own me , she added she contends that the clinton proposals would take away some of the patient s choices and give the government too much control over health care i am the artist here , creating what is best , and having to deal with a national bureaucratic system , she said medicine is too specialized to have the government interfering spurring interest among doctors , the new england journal of medicine published summaries last week of the bush and clinton healthcare proposals the bush summary was signed by dr louis w sullivan , the secretary of health and human services , while the clinton plan was signed by the governor commenting in the journal , two healthpolicy experts , alain c enthoven of stanford university and uwe e reinhardt of princeton university said that both proposals left many issues vague notably , how to pay for coverage for 37 million americans without health insurance drawing
bedford , nh , feb 13 in the flush of victory in the persian gulf war , president bush exultantly proclaimed , by god , we 've kicked the vietnam syndrome once and for all but does the fresh controversy over bill clinton s efforts to avoid the draft in 1969 , epitomized by his agonized letter written that fall from oxford university , demonstrate the contrary \? are all the painful ambiguities of that era , the conflicts between duty and conscience , the lack of a clearcut denouement , now to be revisited \? though vietnam veterans , once scorned , are now celebrated , and though the sting of defeat is easing , no national consensus has ever developed as to whether the vietnam war was just or unjust , whether draft dodging was justified , or whether the united states could have won with a more determined effort a kind of curse some see a kind of curse hanging over the generation that was fractured in the long dark night of war , with some of its members shedding blood in southeast asia while others fled to sweden or canada , a few went to jail and still others found one means or another to finagle a deferment three members of that generation are running for the democratic presidential nomination this year governor clinton of arkansas , who opposed the war and avoided military service senator tom harkin of iowa , who served in asia but turned against the war , and senator bob kerrey of iowa , who served in the navy , lost part of a leg and earned the medal of honor representative thomas j downey , a suffolk county democrat who was a student at cornell university in 1969 and was deferred because of a punctured eardrum , said the clinton episode raises the question of whether anyone in my generation will ever be elected president the problem is that the scar has weakened the tissue of american life , he added , and every time it is rubbed it hurts again but the country seems no more unanimous about what mr clinton did than it is or has been about anything else connected with the vietnam war 'he chose the wrong path' take tom harmon , a 44yearold government employee from shawneetown in southern illinois he served as an infantryman in vietnam , having bowed to the inevitable by volunteering for the draft , and said today that if mr clinton knew at the time that he intended to go into politics , as his letter indicates , he chose the wrong path by avoiding military service there seem to be two philosophies , mr harmon added one is that those guys who avoided the thing were smarter than we were then there is the american legion approach people who think those who avoided the war ought to be ostracized who knows what s right \? and who cares \? interviews around the country with men of roughly the same age as mr clinton brought memories of the draft flooding back a few , like rick smith , now 41 and the owner of a barber shop in simpsonville , nc , said they had seen no way out when you 're 18 and i think that s still a child you just think that if your country calls , you go , he said an even smaller number spoke with contempt for draft evaders i saw friends come home with no legs , said john l thomas , many of whose buddies left the blue ridge mountains to fight , though he himself had a lottery number high enough not to be called no one really wanted to go , but we felt it was our duty even today , if i met somebody who avoided the draft i would n't associate with them and would n't vote for them but most talked feelingly of the attempt to escape the net and exonerated mr clinton , either by implication or in so many words tony leone , 41 , of methuen , mass , remembered the lottery , in which numbers were pulled from a bowl it seemed absurd to him , he said , that because of a pingpong ball , your life changed he said he and his friends discussed how much of your life you were willing to ruin for the war jeff mckee , a radio host in richmond , remembers reading a paperback book called 1001 ways to avoid the draft during his freshman year at emerson college in boston he said it was hypocritical to criticize draft avoiders , as did many others a suggestion , perhaps , that in his own generation , at least , mr clinton will find a support group of people who did what he did , or close to it educational deferment was the biggest educational motivator of my generation , the 42yearold broadcaster said i got out of high school with just about a c average in college i was on the dean s list others spoke of joining national guard or reserve units to avoid going to vietnam , of attending graduate school when they might not have done so , and of seeking medical or other justifications for deferment none mentioned any moral or ethical difference in the various courses of action and many saw a kind of heroism in mr clinton s antiwar stance for former representative andrew young , who as an associate of the rev dr martin luther king jr was prominent in the antiwar movement , the clinton letter was the kind of thing that martin luther king would have written a few years earlier , and it represents the kind of struggle that robert kennedy went through as he tried to work out his moral view gov howard dean of vermont , who is now 43 , described mr clinton s letter as a telling reminder of what it was really like mr dean , a democrat from a state that attracted many draft resisters , spoke with distaste of richard nixon and spiro agnew , a convicted crook and a pardoned crook , sending people our age to be killed
once and only once , i knew a national leader who told the truth to his people about the most important things in their lives themselves this man told them that they were superstitious and slovenly he denounced their religion , customs , manners , furies and hatreds he told them that sometimes they were so dense that they drove him mad jawaharlal nehru was not a great allround leader his foreign policy for india was a mess of platitudes and selfdelusion about economics , chakravarti rajagopalachari , the first indian governor general of india , called nehru a woollyheaded socialist idiot looking back that strikes me as a little harsh but certainly in the ball park but how nehru could lay about him when he felt his own people were leading themselves deeper into darkness through bigotry , casteism , violence or calcification of mind ! i wonder whether the united states will ever produce a presidential candidate who will give us the gift of truth about ourselves what we have been getting from our candidates is mostly pure smarm they allow us to blame everybody else and comfortingly lead our little minds away from our own contributions to bigotry , casteism , violence and calcification we get the message that with a little economic higgledypiggledy , never really explained , the country can solve its troubles without pain otherwise known as higher taxes , more schoolwork and no excuses no excuses means none from those who riot and loot , none from the preachers of bigotry and those who prettify them , none from dropouts , none from politicians and none from voters who destroy any politician who is brave enough to tell us the bill will be high , with payments starting now who will face the country straight \? who will look it in the eye \? president bush \? his campaign has become one long dreary attempt to rationalize or deny his failures bill clinton what s happened there anyway \? presented by los angeles with an opportunity for inspiring the country , he is fumbling it he still has time to roll up the political safety net he lugs around and take more chances with candor , but not a lot of time he is losing the country s attention will ross perot have the courage to talk straight , or will we just get a lot more downhome oneliners \? so far , he has presented the country with a blank tablet that worked for a while because millions of americans wrote their own hopes on it and about mr bush and mr clinton , he follows an old safe policy never interrupt your opponents while they are making fools of themselves but he says soon he will show us his mind if so , that will reveal whether he is capable of the hard intellectualism , the discipline , required for telling us the truths about ourselves and our problems if he thinks the country has to work harder , then how will he provide the jobs for those who want nothing but the chance to work \? does he think the jobs can be created and the neglect of the cities rectified without more taxes \? then he has to show us the balance sheet any businessman would demand before investing money or trust in any investment salesman and although during campaigns candidates pretend foreign affairs are no great deal now , if he wins he will be neck deep in them the day after election so let s have a rundown on what he will do about starvation in africa , aid to the former soviet union , the worldwide communist chinese missile trade and saddam hussein , happy , fat and born again president perot it s a massive rebuke to the messrs bush and clinton that so many americans like the idea and so few now dismiss it and it is a compliment that he now should show he deserves the only way is to say what he would demand of himself and the american public many americans , perhaps more as time goes on , will still want something he will find hard to deliver evidence that he could run a government and understand the delicate , essential balances that make it a democracy , not a horse but win , place or show , ross perot if he is brave enough can certainly do one thing he can talk straight to the public and himself that could help the country look itself in the eye , the essential price of starting to recover from los angeles
winter haven , fla , feb 20 standing together just out of reach of the handshake of gov bill clinton , the dionne brothers came to the town park here today looking for answers none of the three young men , ages 18 to 22 , have any health insurance , and two are taking courses at polk community college here in the hope that it will help them find other jobs because of their economic circumstances , all three still live at home getting george bush out of office is a big issue for us , whether it s bill clinton or somebody else , said pete dionne , the eldest brother his brother henry , 21 years old , said , i'm personally not concerned about the accusations and the mudslinging , and added , since george bush has been president , my father has lost his job and i 've lost my job none of the brothers had ever heard of paul e tsongas until the former massachusetts senator won the new hampshire democratic presidential primary two days ago they were more familiar with mr clinton because he is from the south but their presence at the clinton rally was due more to curiosity than commitment it is these voters young , male , alienated that mr clinton must win if he is to regain his footing and win the democratic nomination to do so , his advisers realize , he must learn from the mistakes that nearly derailed his campaign in new hampshire and capitalize on his convincing second place finish in new hampshire 'the comeback kid' it was an artful and successful bit of political spin that allowed mr clinton to annoint himself the comeback kid at his election night rally on tuesday his advisers had started inserting the word comeback into all their conversations in the hours before the polls closed , and by the next day , astute campaign organizers in georgia and florida had lifted the phrase from the morning s headlines and plastered it on cardboard placards for rallies for the first time in weeks , the clinton campaign had finally won the expectations game and with the spotlight shifting away from mr clinton and onto the bushbuchanan contest , mr clinton also had a chance to catch his breath the arkansas governor acknowledged as much today , commenting on a plane ride between campaign stops that he had been in a coma for the past two days , hoarse from his nagging new england head cold and ready for a slower campaign pace but mr clinton denied published reports today that he was scaling back his efforts in maryland , which holds its primary on the same day as georgia , march 3 nonetheless , he told reporters he considered maryland a tsongas state i would expect that a lot of people there would agree with some of the things he has said , because they are more upper middle class than middle class , he said mr clinton s theory ignores the fact that maryland is a state more southern in nature than mr clinton may realize and that its two largest metropolitan areas baltimore and prince george s county near washington have majority black populations that supported jesse jackson in 1984 and 1988 mr clinton has scored well among former jackson supporters in polls in other states , and all his southern campaign stops are wellattended by black elected officials and other community leaders his challenge in the south , he said today , is to attempt to make sure that his messages are heard on the death penalty i do n't think what i did caused me a rocky time in new hampshire , mr clinton told reporters today in albany , ga i think i'm going to go back to the issues i'm going to run the campaign i started with and i think the campaign i started with will do real well down here mr clinton also sought to play down comments made by gov zell miller of georgia that mr tsongas would not be considered electable by southern voters because he opposed the death penalty mr tsongas has said he favored the death penalty only in certain cases , like for drug kingpins mr clinton , who supports the death penalty and returned to arkansas to preside over the execution of a convicted murderer on jan 24 , said he considered mr tsongas s position an attempt to fudge on the issue but he also said that he does not plan to emphasize their disagreement on the capital punishment issue to win votes in the south , where many people favor the death penalty i 've never tried to use the death penalty as a political issue , he said it s just that we have a law that we agree with and i follow it that s my position on it he said new hampshire voters became convinced that mr tsongas was the candidate with the best new ideas because my ideas were blown out of their consciousness for three solid weeks he added , and in the last eight days when we finally got the campaign going again , what got people excited was the idea that i was a fighter , that i could plainly be president , that i could plainly stand up to george bush and fight and argue mr clinton salvaged his new hampshire campaign by engaging in what one of his advisers later described as a highwire act in which he was forced to perform credibly on live televison five times within a single week , including three nationally broadcast programs looking to tv the clinton campaign is now counting on turning its candidate s strength on television to quick advantage prior to the string of primaries that begin next week in south dakota and culminate with the super tuesday grouping of 11 primaries and caucuses on march 10 gone are the rambling questionandanswer sessions mr clinton held with new hampshire voters after each speech and the latenight visits to doughnut shops and halfempty restaurants in search of hands to shake instead , mr clinton has spent the last two days engaging in classic super tuesday strategy , hopping from fundraising events to television markets and back again and now that the grueling pace of the new hampshire primary is behind them , clinton campaign strategists are beginning to hope for a little positive fallout from the events that just days ago had seemed only negative bill and hillary are celebrities now , one of mr clinton s advisers said last week i do n't know if it s a positive or negative i just know it s a fact but something in my gut tells me it s a positive , because americans forgive celebrities photo i think i'm going to go back to the issues i'm going to run the campaign i started with , said gov bill clinton of arkaknsas , left , trying to put his loss in the new hampshire democratic presidential primary behind him his challenge in the south , he said , is to make sure that his political message is heard he chatted yesterday with mike herrington , right , at a cafe in winter haven , fla \( associated press \)
her colleagues rank her with galileo and mendel yet few long islanders know of the living legend in their midst dr barbara mcclintock is the greta garbo of the cold spring harbor laboratory the outside world rarely sees her or hears about her that suits her fine she may share a place in history with marie curie , having won the nobel prize singlehandedly , but you will not hear the story from her this long islander shies away from publicity in a field of corn she changed the science of genetics a few hundred yards from that field she still lives and works quietly , assumedly with nary a word to barbara walters or the national enquirer dr mcclintock is a very private person , nathaniel comfort of the laboratory said but reporters leap from private to her being lonely and not having any friends that s not true she has loads of friends they just do n't happen to be reporters so the public may not be aware that dr mcclintock recently celebrated her 90th birthday and 50th year at cold spring harbor it was a very quiet intimate birthday party , said a friend and nextdoor neighbor at the lab , joan pesek we could have invited 600 people , but barbara would have hated it so there was about 30 people but it was such a special party , because she got the book for her birthday a collection of essays from her friends and colleagues was put together in the dynamic genome the 400page book , a mixture of science and sentiment , is heavy on science , which is how dr mcclintock s life has been but strong sentiments abound when talking to those who know her she declines to do her own talking she sees no reason to give interviews she is honestly a very humble person , mr comfort said there is so much to be proud of , her supporters say she succeeded as a woman when none were supposed to succeed , ms pesek said 40 years of perseverance dr mcclintock made a career in plant genetics when many women were not even allowed to major in it she went about her experiments entirely by herself she had no lab assistant it was just her and her field of maize her findings were so revolutionary that some of her colleagues thought she was a bit daft she persevered for 40 years , ms pesek said she was in her 80 s when she finally got the recognition she deserved in 1983 , dr mcclintock was awarded the nobel prize in the category of physiology or medicine the award was given for the work she had done decades earlier when asked why the recognition took so long , the tellitlikeitis geneticist replied when you know you 're right , you 're right you do n't care you ca n't be hurt you just know that sooner or later it will come out in the wash understanding the impact that dr mcclintock has made on science is a bit like taking a chemistry exam there are words like genome and cytogenetics to learn then there is the lab to visit for the lay person , the bastion of molecularbiology research can be intimidating the junior spokesman has a master s in neurobiology in scientists' offices are the proverbial blackboards with equations and drawings on one was a jumble of notations did that mean that the mind of dr rob martienssen was that complex \? no , it means the erasers do n't work , he said in simple terms dr mcclintock discovered that genes jump before mcclintock , everyone thought genetics worked in a nice precise mathematical way , mr comfort said they thought of it as bits of code strung along like beads on a string , a static picture like a ticker tape mcclintock shattered that whole rigid concept she discovered bits of dna could move around that was before her colleague and the head of the lab , dr james watson , discovered the structure of dna he received the nobel prize in 1962 dr mcclintock s work was like refining the wheel before someone thought of making the cart she was ahead of her time by 30 years , mr comfort said and she did that work with no hightechnology equipment just intellect and ears of corn the credit goes to the corn , she told the press you know she wo n't eat corn , ms pesek said because of all those years working with it \? no , i think it s because she does n't like the taste , ms pesek said dr mcclintock spends many evenings savoring ms pesek s cooking the geneticist , who never married , lives alone at the lab her apartment in a building from the whaling days of the 1850 s , overlooks the harbor next door live ms pesek and her husband , dan marshak , a scientist at the lab my husband s father , alfred , was a good friend of barbara s at cornell , ms pesek said so i think she felt comfortable with us although there is more than a 50year age difference , ms pesek and dr mcclintock have become close friends age is not a factor with barbara , ms pesek said she is ageless she may be physically frail , but you do n't see that you see the fire , the spunk , the feistiness you think she could take on the world she still takes on the younger scientists at the lab she serves as a source of information and ideas to everybody , said dr venkatesan sundaresan dr sundaresan , with a phd from harvard , is one of three scientists continuing dr mcclintock s maizegenetics work until a few months ago she worked seven days a week i would pass by at 9 or 10 at night and see her light on , dr sundaresan said an illness has slowed her , but retirement is not in dr mcclintock s vocabulary i learn from her all the time , dr sundaresan said she was one of the most important reasons i came here imagine being able to work with a legend having shakespeare help with writing or beethoven giving piano lessons
not many college basketball coaches drive limousines to help make ends meet bruce webster does , though , and he guided his university of bridgeport team to the final of the division ii national tournament last april mr webster , who is in his 27th year as the bridgeport coach , was forced to seek outside work after the university cut his salary along with that of many others by onethird at the start of the 199091 school year because of financial problems though his team which posted a 268 record last season is off to another good start , these are hard times for the veteran bridgeport coach because of the university s precarious financial situation , he and his players went through preseason practice sessions during the fall unsure whether there would be enough money to underwrite the basketball team 'a very difficult time' then , once the season began , they were faced with the possibility that the 64yearold private nonsectarian university might close any day , resulting in a cancellation of the remaining games and , indeed , all of their classes the uncertainty has continued into the christmas vacation , which ends tomorrow , as university officials sought to borrow 5 million to insure that the school could reopen for the spring semester it s been a very difficult time , but the kids have responded very well , considering the circumstances , said mr webster , who lives in monroe at the beginning of the season i was feeling sorry for myself and did not do a good job of coaching and the kids did not play up to their abilities but once i told them that we have to look beyond all the uncertainties and focus on basketball , we 've played much better the team certainly has after losing two of their first three games , the purple knights have compiled a record of nine victories and three losses no matter how well the team fares during the rest of the season , mr webster and his players , excluding the five seniors , face an uncertain future should bridgeport merge with nearby sacred heart university in fairfield , which is regarded as a strong possibility , mr webster most likely would be out of a job , since sacred heart has a successful coach in dave bike , whose team won the division ii national championship in 1986 if that happened , the bridgeport players electing to go along with such a merger would prove strong additions to the sacred heart team even if bridgeport remains open next september , several players will have to choose new majors or transfer as a costcutting measure intended to help keep the institution open , university of bridgeport oficials announced in november that they were eliminating 31 degree programs 21 of them on the undergraduate level at the end of the current academic year i 've got to find a new major , said winston jones , a sophomore forward from queens , whose major , advertising , is among the programs being eliminated but both mr jones and another sophomore , chris tate , a 6foot7inch backup center who graduated from bullard haven high school in bridgeport and is also majoring in advertising , said they did not plan to transfer if the university remained open nor did lamont jones , a freshman guard from brooklyn , ny , whose major , communications , is also being cut a statement mr webster made to the team early in the season appeared to have lifted the players' spirits the coach told us that if the school closed , he would take care of us , said lambert shell , the 6foot5inch senior forward who was named to the division ii all america team at the end of last season that meant a lot to us mr webster , who is 54 years old , said in an interview that he had promised all the players that he would help them transfer to another college if the university shut down during the current season or at the end of the school year it s the least we can do for them , said the coach , noting that most of his 15 players are on full scholarship if he has a team to coach next season , mr webster will have to replace five seniors on the squad , four of them starters that could be a difficult task , since he stopped trying to recruit players before this season began i could n't go out and try to convince a kid he should come to bridgeport , when i do n't even know if we 're going to be around , the coach said in the past i 've been able to tell a kid that he 'd get four years of a good education at ub but how can i do that now \? normally , mr webster and one of his three parttime assistant coaches would be on the road often during the basketball season , scouting high school players and trying to recruit outstanding prospects but both the uncertainty of the university s future and a lack of money has precluded any recruiting , which could hurt the team severely next season if there is a school for the team to represent we 've got our eyes on 24 high school players , and we can only hope , he said when players turned out for the first practice on oct 15 , they found they had to use last season s uniforms , sneakers and basketballs money in advance we did n't have any money to buy anything new , mr webster said and it looked like we would have to open the season wearing our old uniforms
paris , march 22 confirming france s current mood of disgruntlement , voters dealt a major political setback to the governing socialist party in regional elections today , with nearly complete results giving it 18 percent of votes , its worst performance at the polls in 23 years a coalition of the two main conservative parties came out on top with 33 percent of the votes , but fared worse than it has in recent elections and as voters turned away from traditional parties , the main beneficiaries were the farrightist national front and two environmentalist parties the elections in france s 22 regions will have no direct effect on the government of president francois mitterrand and his prime minister , edith cresson , but they were nonetheless regarded as a form of plebiscite on the socialists' performance after nearly 11 years in office premier plans to stay on with the results also viewed as a gauge of the electorate s preferences in next year s parliamentary elections , they are certain to bring fresh calls from the socialist party for president mitterrand to replace mrs cresson as prime minister in a television interview tonight , mrs cresson said she had no plans to step down , but she conceded that the results showed that the french want to be heard more they want more direct democracy , she said , less rigid administration culture minister jack lang said , we could have done better and will do better with 90 percent of the vote counted , the socialists' had 18 percent , compared with 236 percent in the last elections , which were for the european parliament , in 1989 in the regional elections of 1986 , however , the socialists won about 30 percent , and they took 364 percent in the 1988 parliamentary elections their worst result today was in paris where , with 145 percent of votes , they ran behind the national front , which won 163 percent the strong performance by the antiimmigration front had been widely predicted , with its leader , jeanmarie le pen , winning about 30 percent of ballots in the alpesmaritimes department in southern france , where he was a candidate the national front received 135 percent of votes nationwide , up from 118 percent in voting for the european parliament in 1989 mr le pen himself won 144 percent in the 1988 presidential elections le pen looks to 1993 while mr le pen , a 63yearold former paratrooper who has built up his party around the slogan france for the french and a demand for the forced return of many of the country s three million immigrants , he has also won support by campaigning against france s political establishment and exploiting corruption scandals involving the socialist party there is only one structured militant party that is addressing the problems of france that are not being resolved by the traditional parties , mr le pen told the television network tf1 the party of hope is the national front and in 1993 , we will do even better since neither mr le pen nor any national front candidate is expected to be chosen as president of any regional council , the party will not assume a decisionmaking role after today s elections but the vote has nonetheless confirmed the national front as the largest extremerightist party in europe , with deep roots in certain regions in the southern region of provencealpescoted'azur , which includes the alpes maritimes department where mr le pen was a candidate and where he has long been popular , the national front is projected to win 233 percent against 297 percent for the conservative coalition and 19 percent for the socialists in the bouchesdurhone department in the same region , the socialistbacked candidacy of the millionaire businessman bernard tapie did well , taking 265 percent of votes against 261 percent for the conservative contender and 226 percent for the national front flagbearer but the conservatives appear best placed to win the regional presidency , a post that brings with it responsibility for many public works in what was seen as another expression of protest against the status quo , the environmentalist vote also rose sharply , from 107 percent three years ago to 145 percent today but it was divided because the two squabbling environmentalist parties ran separate lists of candidates the strongly independent green party won 75 percent , while the ecological generation , which is close to the socialists , won 7 percent the french communist party , often described by its enemies as the last stalinist party in the world , confirmed that it still enjoys support in industrial areas , winning about 8 percent of the vote , more or less the same as in 1989 , before the collapse of communism in the soviet bloc a result that pollsters failed completely to predict was the turnout they had anticipated an abstention rate of close to 50 percent as another sign of disenchantment with politicians , but about 67 percent of 375 million registered voters cast ballots councils to elect leaders after all the votes in the regional elections have been counted , local councils will elect their presidents on friday in a complex second stage the process will involve forming coalitions since only in one region has any group won an absolute majority of seats
kansas city , mo , sept 26 in november 1976 , christopher s bond , then the governor of missouri , gathered family and friends for a party to celebrate what he confidently expected to be his reelection but he lost , unable to overcome the drag of a losing republican presidential candidate , gerald r ford now seeking a second term in the senate , mr bond is haunted by the prospect of a repeat performance president bush is doing badly in missouri , trailing bill clinton by more than 20 percentage points in the st louis postdispatch poll and running behind in private surveys for the two parties as well i told these guys a year ago that they ought to be talking about jobs , jobs , jobs , said senator bond , a moderate republican how about giving some answers to people who ask me , 'will my kid ever get as good a job as i have \? ' but instead they talk jobs for a day , then they drift off again like his colleague , senator john c danforth , also a republican , mr bond thinks his party has suffered grievously in missouri from the strident oratory at the republican national convention , in particular its attacks on homosexuals and , in the view of many , on working women mr danforth called the convention a total disaster that in no way stood for what george bush or this party believes in 'i'm not driving that bus' they 've put a real hammerlock on the far right wing , maybe 10 per cent of the vote , said mr bond in a sarcastic tone of voice , continuing his indictment of the bush campaign that s not worth much in a twoway contest leaves a lot out there for the other guy well , i'm not driving that bus i 'll go my own way on my own little bicycle , and see if i can survive unfortunately for the president , many voters here appear to identify him not with his own houston speech , which was much less abrasive , but with those of patrick j buchanan and the rev pat robertson and marilyn quayle partly as a result , many do not take him seriously when he tries to indict bill clinton as untrustworthy , extreme , not ready for presidential responsibility so mr bond , facing a serious challenge from geri rothmanserot , and some other republican candidates here \( and still others in adjacent states where the situation is similar \) have decided to go their own way former senator thomas f eagleton of missouri , who was briefly the running mate of george s mcgovern on the democratic ticket in 1972 , has seen the phenomenon before , in his own party the republicans down the ticket are running away from bush the way democrats used to run away from mcgovern and later from mondale , he said it s a sure sign the national platform is out of touch with local ideas bush blamed for economy david leuthold , emeritus professor of political science at the university of missouri , said people are upset about the economy they blame it on bush , so he is behind he tries to shift the subject , first to family values , then to trust , then to clinton s record as 'the failed governor of a small state , ' but none of it has really taken hold in this state so far i think there are three reasons for that houston damaged his credibility , his support was never deep enough to stand up to trouble , and he was very late to prosecute his campaign with sufficient vitality obviously concerned , the president has been pounding away lately with repeated campaign visits to the two parts of the state essential to republican victory the southwest , close to the arkansas line , and st louis county , the belt of suburbs to the west of the city that now contains twice as many people as st louis itself right after the convention , in fact , mr bush was in the ozark resort town of branson , displaying the country music and horseshoes side of his personality missouri , which has 11 electoral votes , has always been considered one of the most typical states , with elements of the north and the south , of the east and the west very roughly speaking , it is slightly more than half urban and suburban big concentrations around kansas city in the west and st louis in the east and slightly less than half smalltown and rural and in every presidential election this century except 1956 , when it somewhat inexplicably went for adlai e stevenson , missouri has voted for the national winner seeking a real smoking gun can mr bush pull it out here \? not , answered a kansas city businessman with close ties to the white house , unless we can prove that clinton shot his mother or something but others , including gov john ashcroft , a republican whom many consider the state s most popular politician , say a victory for the president is still possible on the basis of telephone calls to a quarter of a million homes by party election workers , he argued that a lot of people , perhaps as many as 30 percent , have n't really focused on this yet having failed to push through a modest state tax increase for education last fall , the governor says he thinks missourians will eventually turn against mr clinton because he has urged some higher taxes
johannesburg , dec 19 in a virtual admission that members of the south african military had sought to establish a covert third force to thwart racial conciliation , president f w de klerk announced today that he had dismissed or suspended 23 officers , including six generals , suspected of activities including political assassination mr de klerk distanced himself from what he called illegal and or unauthorized activities and malpractices , saying at a news conference in cape town that political officebearers were not fully informed or , very often , were misled the announcement represented a significant retreat from previous disavowals of what his foes call military dirty tricks it also seemed to be a major concession to the african national congress of nelson mandela , at once his principal political adversary and his most important partner in the negotiations for a multiracial south africa a white power center just as important , mr de klerk s admission came as a formal display of readiness to confront one of the most powerful traditional guardians of the whitedominated state he has pledged to dismantle while the acknowledgement could weaken the president s position , it seemed dictated in part by a desire to remove one obstacle that has impeded negotiations mr mandela has long insisted that the secretive military intelligence department has orchestrated covert campaigns to undermine opposition movements by killing black and white campaigners for racial equality , and by working to discredit politicalreform advocates before today , mr de klerk had strenuously defended the military against such allegations his reversal was all the more significant because it seemed finally to break an old compact between south africa s white politicians and military men , one that under mr de klerk s predecessor , president p w botha , gave the armed forces a central role in the strategies of white dominance since those days , government officials said , president de klerk has sought to pare the military s political influence , but has met strong resistance there was no immediate reaction today from the services mr de klerk did not name any of the 23 people dismissed or suspended , but said that some had pursued personal political agendas , possibly in concert with extreme rightwing groups opposed to the introduction of majority rule in south africa there are indications that some of the individuals might have been motivated by a wish to prevent us from succeeding in our goals , he said moreover , he said , the covert campaign was continuing as he spoke because military personnel and collaborators of the south african defense forces have been involved , and in some cases are still involved , in illegal and or unauthorized activities , and malpractices deaths acknowledged mr de klerk was not specific about the offenses of those purged , but said after intense questioning by reporters , i think i can say , yes , that the findings will lead to the conclusion that some of the activities have led to the death of people though he did not elaborate , his comments recalled the killings of antiapartheid campaigners like matthew goniwe in eastern cape province in 1985 , and david webster , a university lecturer , who was killed in 1989 mr de klerk s acknowledgement gave credence to persistent , widespread charges that military intelligence personnel had been secretly involved in fomenting violence between blacks in the townships and also in efforts to promote strife beyond south african borders , particularly in mozambique and angola for decades , south african military intelligence and the security police , perennial rivals , have both sought to finetune division among black political groups and have not shied away from strongarm tactics to eliminate adversaries thus , in the lethal power struggle in the townships between the african national congress and the inkatha movement of chief mangosuthu gatsha buthelezi , black residents have frequently spoken of members of the security forces and of other , unidentified whites siding with the zululed inkatha the congress has accused the security forces of orchestrating assassinations a damaging finding mr de klerk s announcement today came after a series of events that had put increasing pressure on him to address mr mandela s accusations last month , judge richard goldstone , who is investigating the roots of south africa s chronic political violence , announced that military intelligence had hired a convicted murderer , ferdi barnard , to supervise a campaign to undermine the african national congress embarrassed and angered by the disclosure , mr de klerk ordered lieut gen pierre d steyn of the air force , the military chief of staff , to take charge of intelligence functions and to carry out his own investigation at the time , the president s critics accused him of seeking a coverup , but he said today that it was general steyn s preliminary findings that persuaded him to take action against the two full generals , four brigadier generals and 17 others , whose ranks were not given i am shocked , mr de klerk said today i am disappointed but i am also resolute if there is a sore , i want to cut it out in addition , political analysts said , the president was under pressure from the african national congress to purge the military so that stalled political negotiations might move ahead last month , senior figures from the government and the african national congress met in a remote game reserve in the northern transvaal to discuss ways of resuming the talks the question of interference by military intelligence figured high on the agenda , congress officials said only a measure of approval today , the congress said in a statement the steps announced by president de klerk are a step in the right direction , but are not nearly enough there should be full public disclosure of all criminal activities and attempts at destabilization the current revelations are clearly only the tip of the iceberg mr de klerk s disclosure , the statement said , reflected a crisis of major proportions which has a direct bearing on the negotiating process transparency is essential , it continued , and president de klerk may not hide the implications of this crisis from the people of south africa equally , though , the south african leader faced criticism from whites with rightist views who have been brought up to regard the south african military as a pillar of integrity and a guarantor of security the principal opposition conservative party , which reviles the african national congress , called mr de klerk s announcement a witch hunt and said it would close ranks with the accused officers the president indicated that those accused may have gone underground , saying other military personnel were still trying to reach them of the 23 people involved , he said , six generals and 10 others had been dismissed , while seven had been placed on compulsory leave we will make sure that none of these people is in a position to cover his tracks , mr de klerk said
san diego few yachtsmen have better reason than dennis conner s stars stripes team to see the america s cup trial races begin it has been a lonely ocean out there for conner s crew , which has been training without a sailing partner for more than a year i ca n't wait , said john barnitt , the team s 30yearold mastman during a practice sail on tuesday in the ocean off san diego bay we have seven days until we tee off we 're pretty enthusiastic you can practice and practice forever but you really do n't know how things will go until you see someone one on one it was a gray day , with pelting rain and huge ocean swells making the 75foot stars stripes yacht roll and pitch like an amusement park ride in slow motion conner , the team s helmsman and mentor , was out of town for the day but his absence was n't enough to keep his 15man crew from business as usual with the america s cup defense elimination races scheduled to begin tuesday , onthewater training was a priority conner has n't had the money to build more than one boat for the 1992 cup campaign his team has been forced to practice , as was the case tuesday , by setting up imaginary courses between buoys and racing against the clock it has n't been the best of techniques practice sailing alone for the america s cup is like boris becker getting ready for wimbledon by hitting with a ball machine a place for the challangers in the distance off point loma , seven challenge boats sailed in circles as they waited for the first gun of their own informal competition to begin race committee officials were setting course buoys as practice for the challengers' trials , which are to begin jan 25 for the international crews , it was an opportunity to race without being scored neither stars stripes , nor its only defense opponent , william koch s america 3 crew , was invited more to the point , they would have been chased off the course had they tried to join the party challengers had agreed among themselves months ago not to sail with the defenders for fear of giving up a competitive edge several weeks ago , conner s team tried to crash a challengers' training race by pretending to be the swedish contender conner and his crew donned blond wigs , changed their mainsail to reflect a swedish sail number and flew a swedish flag dismissing it as an attempt at having some laughs , the stars stripes crew found that the challengers were n't amused and was told to stay clear of the race course conner has chosen not to tune up against america 3 nor has william koch s team made an overture to conner the america 3 syndicate , which announced wednesday that it is building a fourth boat at a cost of 5 million from its 45 million budget , has n't needed another sparring partner there will be no choice next week , when the two defense yachts meet in their trial races on tuesday , the stars stripes crew shadowed the cup challengers part of the way up the course , then went off on their own several observers on stars stripes were shuttled in a syndicate chase boat from the racing yacht to betsy , the syndicate s powerboat tender betsy , a 62foot yacht , was stationed at the challengers' race course so that some of conner s design team could monitor the competition among those on board betsy were chris todter , conner s design technical director , and frank debord , a design associate what s your bet on who 'll win today \? asked one of the crew on betsy it had become a custom aboard the watch boat to wager a dollar each by the end of the 11mile windwardleeward challenge match , no one on betsy collected none had guessed that the challenge victor would be new zealand , an oldergeneration boat in the new zealand team s lineup of four new cup yachts whoever bet on italy should pay the rest of us , said another observer on betsy the il moro di venezia syndicate finished sixth , next to last it was a surprise since the italians have what conner s team once hoped for five new america s cup yachts photo dennis conner sailing stars stripes with a swedish flag during a challenger s race in december \( reuters \)
albertville , france , feb 14 bonnie blair assured her place in american winter olympic history today by winning her second gold medal in speed skating at the albertville games and the third of her career , giving her the most of any female athlete from the united states only one american , eric heiden , who swept all five men s speedskating events in 1980 , has won more gold medals than blair at the winter games , and only one other woman , pat mccormick , a diver , has won more in the summer olympics , four blair could well pull even or ahead by prolonging her career through the olympics of 1994 in lillehammer , norway but even if she did not , she has at least established herself as the carl lewis of her sport , its dominant sprinter today , she exploded off the start line on the outdoor track , finished the 1 , 000meter race in 1 minute 2190 seconds , and withstood the challenge of ye qiaobo of china by just two onehundredths of a second monica garbrecht became the fifth skater from germany win a medal by finishing third , in 12210 it was the second time in a week blair posted a faster time than ye four days before , she won the 500 meters in 4033 seconds , with ye 18 onehundredths of a second slower racers skate in pairs , but the constant foe is the clock the final standing is based on time blair and ye were not paired in either race factoring in blair s victory in the 500 four years ago on the indoor oval at the calgary olympics , by a 02 margin over christa rothenburger luding , she has stepped into history by less than a quarter of a second it s a nice honor to have , and i'm proud of that , said blair , a 27yearold skater from champaign , ill i'm just glad to be able to bring more gold back to the united states not since 1952 , when andrea mead lawrence won the slalom and giant slalom , has an american woman won two golds in the same winter olympics as they were on monday for the 500 and on wednesday for the 1 , 500 , blair s weakest event , in which she finished 21st , her band of supporters filled a section of the stands they urged her on and celebrated when the last of the legitimate challengers , luding , failed to beat her time then , the usual hugs , kisses , cheers and tears the other night when she won , someone told her she had a place in history , said eleanor blair , bonnie s 73yearold mother to that point , i did n't know if she had realized it or not she said , 'oh , boy' but that s just the way she is she does n't get hysterical over anything even after blair skated , and her time was flashed , she showed no real emotion she circled another lap , then sat alone on a bench to rest there was no real way of knowing her time would withstand those who followed , but it was reasonably safe to assume none would skate faster once ye and garbrecht , the third pair to skate after blair and angela hauck of germany , competed , peter mueller , the united states coach , came over and wrapped his arm around blair s neck that seemed to make it official , even though 12 pairs remained as one uncomfortable with the trappings of history , blair could offer no real insight into what her three gold medals might mean she is an athlete who projects a shining simplicity , a rare beast who competes only for the love of it , nothing more which is a good thing in speed skating , there is nothing more heiden proved that i'm nothing like michael jordan or carl lewis , she said on the subject of anonymity beyond the oval we always race with hoods on that s fine with her , or so it seems she has all she wants or needs in family support , and no other american athlete has drawn as many followers to the games in addition to her mother , a brother and three sisters are here and more than 40 family friends they have been seen all over albertville wearing lavender jackets and gold caps , and they almost cry on cue when the subject of blair and her family arises we all feel it because we 're here , said snookie demarce of portland , ore , consoling another friend , bessa mae jeffers of anchorage i do n't think i have ever seen a family support someone like her family supports her it has certainly been evident this week , even though blair insisted she cannot hear them once the race begins in the 1 , 000 , she built an important advantage over the first 200 meters , in which she had the fastest time , 1821 seconds , of all 36 skaters by 600 , her time of 4829 was just enough to provide a slight cushion for the final 400 , which is the weakest phase of her race by then , the legs are aching with lactic acid buildup legs wo n't obey in a sense , all you want to do is think about sitting low and getting a good bend in your knees , she said , remembering the last 200 i was trying to think to stay lower , but my legs were n't letting me ye was the stronger finisher , covering the final 400 in 3334 seconds , 27 hundredths of a second faster than blair another two meters and the result might have been different , which is why blair insisted it had not been her best 1 , 000 of the season , even though she has not been beaten at that distance or the 500 since last year and so , her thoughts turned quickly away from today toward her next competition of the season , an event in calgary , alberta , next month blair wants to break the 500meter world record she set at the last olympics and maybe luding s world record that would be something notable and important , too it takes concentration , planning and more training so who has time for history lessons \? photo bonnie blair winning the 1 ,

on the night that mayor david n dinkins was exhorting the democrats to fulfill the promise of america and former representative barbara jordan was insisting that it does make a difference who is president , the voices from bertha wade s block in the south bronx were sending a vastly different message to be honest about it , no , i do n't think it matters , mrs wade said , because they all just promise everything and wind up doing the same thing once they get in three months ago , the election district in which mrs wade lives , in melrose , rendered a unanimous judgment on all of the democratic presidential candidates not a single enrolled democrat voted in the primary the prognosis for november is that if apathy does not win again , it will not lose by much , either at last count , before the lines were redrawn by the legislature to reflect population changes , ms wade was one of 20 enrolled democrats in the 28th election district of the 73d assembly district among the city s 5 , 400 election districts , the 28th was one of 12 in which nobody voted in the april 7 democratic primary mrs wade said she would have but did not get home in time from her job as an election inspector on the upper west side still , she added , i do n't know who i would have voted for , but if i thought it would have made a difference i would have made up my mind in other words , artfully captured in a campaign button this season if god had intended us to vote he would have made candidates another enrolled democrat , edward fleming , a corrections officer , said he did not have time to vote in the primary either , but intended to vote in november when his first choice would have been ross perot i really have n't paid too much attention to the convention , mr fleming said not surprisingly , since a republican is in charge , calls for change in the white house kept reverberating through madison square garden \( with no injunction , though , to change congress , which the democrats control \) gov mario m cuomo suggested that mr perot s entire platform had consisted of that single word a word so appealing that mr cuomo invoked it or its derivatives himself a halfdozen times in his speech nominating gov bill clinton mr cuomo s speech was a metaphor for his presidential fling last fall an overture about his own vision that abruptly ended , then a shift to another act , extolling mr clinton s virtues mr cuomo departed from his advance text to observe of mr clinton , and perhaps of himself , that in a world of fragile and thinskinned politicians , he was an aberration mr clinton , mr cuomo and the rev jesse jackson electrified a convention that could not otherwise be described as wired , except for the banks of television cameras at every angle \( as the cameras tried to capture candid portraits , television viewers were exposed to pictures of people watching pictures of themselves on large screens behind the podium \) but jan d pierce , regional vice president of the communications workers of america and a supporter of edmund g brown jr , cautioned against premature euphoria or selfcongratulation we come away with real high expectations every four years and get blown away four months later , mr pierce recalled but he predicted that liberals , labor and minority groups would have no place to go except to mr clinton the question is , though , to what degree \? he said if the oratory touched on the urban crisis , none of the euphoria from madison square garden seeped onto the mean streets of melrose streets where , as mr cuomo said , children are growing up familiar with the sound of gunfire before they 've ever heard an orchestra the 28th election district consists of a square block bordered by courtlandt and melrose avenues and by 155th and 156th streets the block is flanked by two public housing projects and , incongruously , by a row of pastel citysubsidized town houses mrs wade s building is one of the few structures that punctuate a square block of vacant lots and mounds of dirt on 156th street , a 19thcentury church abuts the foundation for a new housing authority police station house around the corner , irene bell , a home health worker , said she had voted once , for ronald reagan in 1984 , but was no longer registered it was when i was 18 , and i was just voting because that s what my friends were doing , miss bell said i have n't voted since then because these people are terrible you do n't really know where they 're coming from , and it s going to be the same way no matter who gets elected the block is not far from the busy intersection and bustling storefronts of the hub at 149th street but crack has made life as desolate as the terrain just as bleak are the prospects that any of the presidential candidates will rid the neighborhood of illegal drugs , although at least mr clinton mentioned the problem asked whether he knew the names of the candidates , 13yearold christopher santiago paused for a moment on 156th street the other day , then replied tentatively bill clinton and what s his name , that old man , ross perot and dan quayle it did not really matter , he said , because his parents are not registered to vote
to the editor enough already about bill clinton and the vietnam draft ! the bush reelection campaign continues to variously assert that a person must have experience in the united states military to be a respected and competent commander in chief in other words , since bill clinton did not serve in the vietnam war he is unqualified to be president and unsuited to make the momentous decision of sending american troops into combat this tired refrain reflects a serious ignorance of american presidential and military history , unworthy of any incumbent president the us has declared war on five occasions during its 203year history the war of 1812 the mexicanamerican war the spanishamerican war , world war i and world war ii of the presidents who made the difficult decision to place american troops in harm s way , only william mckinley had any experience in the military none of the others , not james madison \( father of the constitution \) , james k polk , woodrow wilson or franklin d roosevelt ever served in the military neither did thomas jefferson , author of the declaration of independence indeed , abraham lincoln s only military experience , prior to serving as commander in chief during the civil war , was three months of service in the illinois militia lincoln did not volunteer to serve in the mexicanamerican war instead his inaugural speech to the house of representatives in 1847 was a condemnation of polk s war if we were to apply the bush campaign s standard for service as president , none of these great americans would ever have become president even lincoln , founder of the republican party , might have been excluded if the founders intended all future presidents to have served in the military , they would have specified such in article ii , section 1 of the constitution they did not and for good reason military service is neither a necessary condition for becoming president nor is it a good predictor of how well an individual will serve as president mark p petracca assoc prof of political science university of california irvine , calif , sept 15 , 1992
swindon , england , jan 8 in the 1980 s this aging , bluecollar town emerged as one of britain s fastest growing cities , a booming outpost of hightech industry , modern british enterprise and nascent conservative political sympathies the sudden rush of whitecollar workers to the county of wiltshire , west of london , not only stretched the population to more than 175 , 000 , but also helped give a new shape to a political landscape long dominated by the labor party in 1983 voters sent a conservative to parliament for only the second time since world war ii four years later they returned him to office , with a slightly larger margin but in the last 18 months , that tenuous conservative majority like the town s soaring economy has been badly shaken by britain s persistent recession in that time the number of unemployed has more than doubled , business failures have increased sharply and hundreds of new homeowners have fallen deeply into debt , as interest rates climbed and housing values fell the economic issue voters in britain will go to the polls sometime before july , when prime minister john major must call a general election but among his calculations and concerns about the coming campaign , none loom as large as the tattered state of much of the british economy , particularly among disticts like swindon , where the tories and mrs thatcher built their political mandate in the 1980 s on the back of a surging economy i voted tory in 1987 , but i wo n't do it again , said diane seickell , a 28yearold mother of two who lost her house in swindon last year , when she and her husband could no longer to keep up the mortage payments margaret thatcher kept saying , 'buy your own house , buy your own house' but she never saw what the consequences would be , if the economy turned bad the conservative cushion in swindon is thin simon coombs , the conservative member of parliament , won in 1987 with a 4 , 800vote margin among 86 , 000 ballots cast his tally represented 438 percent of the vote , compared with 369 for labor and 196 for the liberal democrats we definitely are a marginal seat , and it wo n't be easier this time , because a lot of people have been caught by the economy , mr coombs acknowledged in an interview labor and the liberal democrats say the rising toll of debt , economic distress and bankruptcies across britain is the direct legacy of the thatcher era , maintaining that the conservatives followed unsound economic policies that artificially inflated the economy and forced too many businesses and homeowners to pile up too much debt mr major , who succeeded mrs thatcher in late 1990 , insists that britain is a casualty of a global economic malaise recovery , he argues , is on the way , and his advisers are banking on some strong signals before they have to go the polls if the conservatives are going to continue to govern , they have to hang on to seats like swindon , said david kent , who is the chief executive and town clerk for the borough of thamesdown , which includes swindon on the other hand , if labor ca n't win a seat like swindon , then they ca n't form a national government either swindon grew in the late 19th century as one of britain s major railroad towns , and as recently as world war ii , the rail yards were the only major employer postwar growth in southern england made swindon a target for development , because of its position in the heart of southern england , 75 miles from london and along the main eastwest motorway rush of new companies the local governing authority pursued an aggressive growth strategy , and by the late 1980 s unemployment in the town had dropped to barely 3 percent , amid a rush of financial services , telecommunications centers and light manufacturers the population has jumped by 11 percent since 1981 five times the national growth rate and schools , roads and public services are stretched to the breaking point even now , the unemployment rate in swindon is just over 6 percent , nearly 2 full points below the national average , and mr kent says the town is continuing to grow at the rate of 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 new people a year but the problem for conservatives here , and the rest of britain , is that some of the people who have been hurt the most by the current recession are middleclass , white collar homeowners the very people who were at the heart of the thatcher revolution , and on whom the conservatives must continue to rely , if they are going to hang on to power although the town has been represented by a conservative in the house of commons since 1983 , the local government remains strongly dominated by the labor party down at the village inn , a red brick pub in a suburban shopping strip , peter jones , the manager , said business was n't what it used to be no question that people have cut back , mr jones said the man who used to buy three or four pints at a visit now stops at two but he was n't sure if voters would take it out on conservatives , come the election rather , he said he thought they might decide to stay home and not vote at all they 'd just as soon see a hung parliament , where nobody wins , he said maybe that will force these politicians to start working together , instead of against each other photo among prime minister john major s concerns about the coming election campaign , none loom as large as the tattered state of much of the british economy , particularly in districts like swindon , above , where the tories built their political mandate in the 1980 s on the back of a surging

the four little dragons the spread of industrialization in east asia by ezra f vogel 138 pp cambridge , mass harvard university press 1695 this has been a tough year for freemarketeers in washington , who find themselves trying to explain why the united states is practically the only major industrial power without a cohesive industrial policy the recession that has hit the united states so dramatically is felt much less in asia , home of the world s most booming economies without question , japan , south korea , taiwan and other industrial powerhouses in the region have their share of economic woes many of them an echo of problems in the united states but many of them also seem to share a skill that has all too often eluded american society the ability to put government and industry to work at focusing national economies on highgrowth , strategically vital industries in his latest and slimmest book on asia , ezra f vogel , the henry ford 2d professor of social sciences at harvard university , who has written extensively about japan and china , tries to explain how government and industry have interacted in south korea , taiwan , singapore and hong kong , turning charitycase nations into business school case studies the four little dragons may be the quickest dose of reality yet for anyone left with a romantic vision of asia and while at times it suffers from superficiality and a strangely benevolent view of authoritarian regimes , it has a lot to say about how nations keep their eyes on the ball what makes the socalled four dragons such important topics of study these days is that , in the years leading up to the war in vietnam , they were the dominoes supposedly waiting to fall but while none of them became communist , none of them chose capitalism either at least not in the american sense instead , they turned to various forms of the japanese model what one singapore official terms capitalism with socialist characteristics though american economists tend to lump the four dragons together as very similar economies , and by implication similar societies , mr vogel is at his best when he describes what different economic animals they really are he draws a picture of south korea , for example , as a nation virtually obsessed by its competition with its onetime colonial ruler , japan almost half a century after the end of world war ii , he writes , the korean relationship with the japanese is not 'love and hate' but 'respect and hate' yet korea , more than any other country in the region , has mimicked the japanese system it has set up replicas of each of the bureaucratic entities japan has used to target industries the korean chaebol huge business conglomerates are closely patterned on the zaibatsu that mitsubishi , sumitomo and others established before the war \( and that live on today , though with far less central control , through japan s famous keiretsu system of interlocking ownership \) indeed , in work habits and dedication , the koreans are so much like the japanese that they scare tokyo to death or at least they did until steps toward democratization in south korea brought far higher wages and far less docile workers , and now far less competitive exports taiwan , in contrast , is a land of entrepreneurs who are allowed a much freer hand than their korean counterparts there the secret is guanxi carefully nurtured connections and family businesses overarching these is the taiwan regime it has built an enormous infrastructure , including governmentrun manufacturing parks that breed computer companies , chip makers and in the last few months an aerospace firm that bought 40 percent of mcdonnell douglas s commercial aircraft business but the relationship between the entrepreneurs and the government planners seems less direct , more elusive , in taiwan than elsewhere , and mr vogel s explanations of how it works are unsatisfying at one point , raising the question of why taiwan has been better able to penetrate the american market than most other third world countries , he concludes simply that the people in resourcepoor taiwan were in general more eager than their counterparts in other parts of the world to respond to these opportunities the shortest treatment is given to the two most fascinating of the dragons singapore and hong kong , the tiny citystates that , emerging from british colonization and wartime ruin , have learned to live by their wits as the finance and manufacturing centers of the west in asia few countries plan every facet of life the way singapore does , and few could thrive under the imminent threat of economic extinction the way hong kong has been doing in the years before its reversion to china in 1997 what mr vogel leaves out is much talk of the future does singapore have the critical mass of talent to develop its own technology and industry , rather than relying on the united states and japan \? does hong kong s economic vitality have longterm prospects under beijing s thumb \?
the bush campaign s newest advertisement , which was first broadcast on monday , tries to avoid the criticism leveled at some previous commercials that they unfairly attacked bill clinton on the screen opens with a whiteonblack phrase , breakfast , st louis after the debate the buzz of conversation and the clinking of plates and silverware are audible in the background the screen cuts to quick clips of eight people seated in booths at a restaurant each voices a concise opinion of bill clinton or mr bush as a handheld camera zooms in and out and rocks unsteadily closes with a small disclaimer , paid for by bushquayle '92 general committee inc producer the november company the script first man i saw the debate last night , and i just got one conclusion , it s all george bush first woman i have , i still have a lot of confidence in my president second woman i feel we need bush to keep us from a bigspending congress second man i do n't trust clinton third man the man says one thing and does another third woman first he denies it and then he says , well , maybe it happened you ca n't trust him fourth woman clinton gets in , what we 're going to see are more taxes fourth man one thing that s got me definitely for bush is , i remember what happened the last time we did things the way bill clinton wants to do them accuracy the bush campaign says the commercial was filmed at an international house of pancakes restaurant in st louis on monday morning , the day after the first presidential debate campaign officials say none of the eight speakers are actors or paid bush workers , but that some of the people are known bush supporters scorecard the commercial seeks to promote mr bush as the debate winner , and mr clinton as an untrustworthy rival , while avoiding serious problems that dogged past political attacks example polls show many voters do n't believe charges made by the bush organization so this commercial lets average people make them instead example voters are primed to be suspicious of negative political advertisements so the jerky camera and the absence of an announcer in this one try to convey unsophisticated believability , not political slickness example mr bush s personal attacks on mr clinton seem to generate a backlash , so mr bush is absent from this commercial
the winter in lisbon is the alvin ailey american dance company s heartfelt tribute to dizzy gillespie , a riot of color and rhythm that celebrates the jazz trumpeter and composer as what he has always been , a great entertainer the new work , choreographed by billy wilson mostly to music from a gillespie album that has the same title as the ballet , was apparently done on assignment opening the annual ailey gala benefit on thursday night , judith jamison , the troupe s artistic director , said that the gillespie people approached me about doing a ballet to his music and i said , i have the perfect choreographer she was right mr wilson delivers the piece is light , erupting with surprises when none seem promised , steering away from heavy concepts to zero in fluently on the music s pulse the winter in lisbon , with stunning costumes by barbara forbes , is a party piece miss jamison rightly told the audience at the city center \( 131 west 55th street \) that the party will be onstage , not only at the postperformance supper for the company s supporters although taking place on the season s second program , the benefit , entitled tribute to dizzy gillespie , officially opened the engagement the evening was in the festive ailey gala tradition among the guests in the house introduced by ms jamison were joyce dinkins \( first lady of new york \) , the manhattan borough president , ruth messinger , and dr mae c jemison \( the first woman africanamerican astronaut \) , who had taken a company poster aboard her space flight a progress report on the ailey organization s activities came from its chairman , harold levine , and executive director , michael m kaiser , with thanks to donors , particularly to the philip morris companies for the group s sponsorship of the ailey gala and tours then bill cosby and his wife , camille , introduced the gillespie theme with style and wit mrs cosby drew a parallel between mr gillespie , whom she called by his real name , john birk gillespie , and ailey , who died in 1989 , as leaders in two distinctly american art forms jazz and modern dance mr cosby was off in suggesting that the two artists went unrecognized for years , especially in the 1940 s \( ailey was 10 years old in 1941 \) but he was on the mark in his tribute \( their art knows no boundaries \) as for mr wilson , best known for his emmy awards and tony nominations for musicals , including bubbling brown sugar , he has brought the eclecticism of his ballet and moderndance training into a natural blend with showbusiness style in the premiere the taped score ends with mr gillespie s manteca of 1947 and includes three of the 10 compositions that are on a 1990 milan america recording of a sound track the composer wrote for the winter in lisbon , a film that was never released \( mr gillespie was in it \) mr wilson has heard the music in his own way , conjuring up a dream scape that chenault spense s lighting introduces in a gorgeous turquoise blue mist in the ensemble s opening theme the women , in high heels , exude glamour in matching jeweled dresses , slinking into embraces with their men the mood , with all the kicks and turns , is up san sebastian has nothing to do with spain mr wilson hears the fabulous gillespie trumpet , in relief against the orchestra sound , as a springboard to a challenge dance among three street hoofers michael thomas , in pink spats with suspenders to match , and leonard meek , dancing against the bass , are as angular as the imaginary zoot suits they are not wearing desmond richardson , tying himself spectacularly into knots , is more today deborah manning and elizabeth roxas charge in to rustle their orange and pink petticoats like so many chita riveras groovy the lisbon section is the heart of the work what seems like an ordinary blues love duet , superbly danced by mr meek and a sultry lindadenise evans , all glamour in her split skirt and long extensions , suddenly turns poignant as a wind machine blows at ms evans s skirt , she fades into an icy mist , a vision lost to mr meek , a persuasive ordinary joe every dance suite needs a rousing finale , however , and mr gillespie s latin beat in manteca inspires mr wilson into a segment that could be called west side story redux although the pelvisrotating and squealing seem endless , the eight couples onstage might make you want to dance as well the punch lines work a woman shoots up from the crowd like a firecracker a portrait of mr gillespie shoots down from above the evening s first work was donald byrd s dance at the gym \( 1991 \) , a darker view of high school proms as symbols of malefemale relationships the harddriving energy in the dancing , especially by karine plantadit , has the brutal edge of mio morales s unsubtle score ailey s revelations , danced much better than the night before , ended the program photo members of the alvin ailey american dance theater performing in the winter in lisbon , a tribute

one night last summer , not too long after the raucous parade in the city for the soldiers who had served in the persian gulf , gen colin powell ate dinner at the american hotel in sag harbor , li , and i happened to be there , standing on the porch having a drink , as he left an experienced spotter of celebrities , i count this among the finest sightings in my portfolio , on a par with boy george , in a bookstore on second avenue in manhattan johnny bench , when he was still playing and the reds were at shea , in the back of a countrywestern bar in greenwich village , and katarina witt , who sat next to me in coach ! on a flight into kennedy from , of all places , salt lake city ok , ok , it s a shallow thing , nosing out the famous so what \? that does n't mean you ca n't be good at it celebrity spotting is a pastime , of course , everywhere there are celebrities \( not too many places , actually \) but it s a sport , i think , among new yorkers , who are combative by nature anyway and who live in a place where the known not only coexist with the unknown in tantalizing percentage , but are unlike , say , in los angeles occasionally outdoors and on foot like exotic birds who have wandered out of their habitat , they 're there for the spotting think of new york city as an aviary for the urbanbound indeed , one of the reasons people visit new york is to see celebrities and in certain manhattan places , at certain times , this is n't so hard breakfast hour at the regency hotel lunch at four seasons or le cirque dinner at elio s after theater at orso late night at elaine s these are pretty sure shots so are those fleetingly notorious downtown places before their reputations evanesce \( one thinks immediately of 150 wooster street , briefly as glittering a pit stop as you could name , where dolly parton was eating dinner at the table next to mine the one night i was there and odeon , in the days of bright lights , big city it s actually a much saner , more enjoyable place now , and i saw marv albert there the other night , casting a different shadow than jay mcinerney used to \) but in the celebrityspotting derby , i 've always thought of these venues as petting zoos of a sort , overstocked ponds and catching a glimpse of , say , lauren hutton , passing through the lobby of the conde nast building which is to say , exactly where you 'd expect to see her if you waited around long enough is only the slimmest cut above spotting patrick ewing at a knicks game the point is , the value of a celebrity sighting depends not only on the celebrity , but also on the circumstances the more unexpected the better in which he or she is spotted if , for example , you were to come across either ms hutton or mr ewing at the bizarre revolving bar in the times square marriott marquis hotel \( it s on the eighth floor and does n't give you a good view of anything except the hotel lobby \) , that would be impressive i would say close to 90 points at least for mr ewing , who though more easily noticed than ms hutton , is more rarely seen out and about on the internationally recognized scale of 1 to 100 i say internationally recognized because i employed it once in edinburgh , where i mistakenly thought i saw robert duvall surreptitiously filching a flower in the botanical gardens i 'd awarded myself 78 points before i realized it was n't him unlikeliness counts the more gigantic the celebrity , the greater the number of points the more unlikely the situation , the more points as control figures consider these michael jackson shopping for a faucet in a hardware store would be 100 points so would princess di sunbathing in central park and getting up to buy a knish from a vendor \( if she were getting the knish at zabar s , it would dip to 97 see how it works \? \) on the other hand , your high school class president encountered in line to see miss saigon is a 1 he might get a boost into double figures if you saw him being arrested in general , outdoor sightings are worth more than indoor ones , the idea being that once a celebrity goes indoors , he or she is trapped , and if you happen to go into the same place , it s like shooting fish in a barrel of course the value of indoor spaces is relative stores where mundane transactions occur a place you would purchase towels , say yield high scores so do public restrooms \( the proximity factor counts for something \) , especially if the restroom is in a wild nightclub and the celeb is a politician a few other special guidelines no one you see on a movie set counts that said , any sighting in a borough other than manhattan gets extra points , particularly staten island no one who shows up at a party you 've been invited to counts , unless you are a blood relation of the host or the party is in the suburbs anyone with a noticeable entourage gets points taken away i mean , if eddie murphy shows up someplace with 15 burly guys in leather pants , how hard is he to spot \? a celebrity spotted in the same circumstance twice does n't count the second time for example , if both you and judd hirsch have the same dentist and you 're both having root canal on the same day \( 65 points , more if the dentist is part of an hmo \) , forget the return visit there are tougher situations to call , however if you were to run into cher at bergdorf s and bloomingdale s , they both count , i think , somewhere in the high 50 s but if it were two different departments in bergdorf s , even on different days , you could only count her once in any case , the score would be higher if it happened in a more populist store , shooting up into the 70 s for woolworth s
on his way to the inspection , joe kennelly said there was a good chance he would find some fishy doings in this sort of activity , just about everyone breaks the law , often brazenly they do it right in front of him yeah , there s likely to be something going on , he said , as he thundered uptown on the no 2 train i checked the records and this outfit got hit last year with a violation joe kennelly was going to a bingo game a happyfaced horde he never plays himself he prefers the horses but his job at the new york city department of consumer affairs calls for him to randomly inspect bingo games to insure that they comply with the thicket of state regulations now , as he strode into the secondfloor hall on broadway between 91st and 92d streets , the building with the neon bingo sign , he glanced to his left and mused , oh , windows , that s a rarity bingo halls can be pretty dank , ratty places , but this one at least had natural light it was an immense square of a room with orderly rows of scratched brown tables a bustling snack bar was crammed into the corner that was all happyfaced players were settling into their lucky seats and arranging their good luck totems a tiny metal buddha , donald duck , minnie mouse mr kennelly did n't have to identify himself to the sponsor of this afternoon s event , the sacred heart society of the church of the holy name it was obvious he was a bingo inspector almost all the players were regulars who perfectly fit the image of the bingo addict older women as a 36yearold male , dressed pinneat in jacket and tie , mr kennelly was no less conspicuous than cardinal o'connor and a lot less welcome many times , he said , i 'll walk in and the rabbi or the priest will take me by the hand and boom out , 'hello , inspector , ' and then everyone will put away the things they 're not supposed to be doing visits are random , too bingo operators nonprofit groups like churches , synagogues and american legion posts do n't relish the random visits of the bingo inspector , for regulators maintain that most operators break the rules under state law , prize money is limited to 1 , 000 , but operators find that too paltry to lure enough players , especially since the limit has not changed since bingo was legalized in new york in 1957 so they pay out more , usually by offering illegal variations , and hope they are not caught chances are they wo n't be each year in new york city , there are some 28 , 000 bingo events , known as occasions , and at the moment , mr kennelly is the only bingo inspector and though he is the supervisor of bingo for the consumer affairs department , a job he got at the end of 1990 , mr kennelly has other duties for instance , he makes sure newsstands conform to city codes he worries about horse cabs , fruit and vegetable stands and secondhand car dealers he is lucky if he makes it to even one bingo game a week this may not be overly alarming , since the pastime is much in retreat in the city while an estimated 75 , 000 faithful still try their luck every week , more than three times as many played bingo a decade ago in the early 80 s , about 1 , 000 organizations staged licensed games now 568 do sweetening the pot the tug of the casinos in atlantic city and the state lottery have weakened bingo to hear bingo operators tell it , so has the cap on prize money new jersey has the same limit the bigger games in connecticut sometimes pay out more than 5 , 000 a bill has been drafted in new york to sweeten the limit to 2 , 500 , but there is no telling if it will pass with the contraction of the game , the number of bingo inspectors has shriveled as recently as eight years ago , there were six last year , there were two now there is mr kennelly the new york state racing and wagering board , which oversees bingo in the state , had six inspectors covering the state as recently as 1986 then came budget ills last year , it had two this year it has none the first thing i do is check the equipment , mr kennelly said he looked over the two machines that shoot out the pingpong balls bearing the game numbers a picker intones the numbers and they light up on electronic boards mr kennelly had a maintenance man flick on the boards no 52 was out a violation the man said he would replace the bulb right away a bell clanged the games were on with more than 120 people on hand , shorter games were a blur in four minutes , a whitehaired woman with puffed cheeks got bingo few people played a single board one cuddlesome woman eyed 48 boards another , with pouched eyes , worked 60 the best players knew the boards so well they did n't bother to slap markers down as numbers were called the woman playing the 48 boards did it all in her head slouched in the corner , mr kennelly mentioned that there were a host of illegal games favored by bingo operators one popular illegal game is playing the line players buy any of 15 lines of five numbers , and if their line comes up during a game , the holder earns extra mr kennelly said his sense is that virtually all the operators offer illegal games and routinely pay out at least twice the 1 , 000 limit on prizes , if not more

one employee , laurie restivo of oceanside , asked what else would you do at a company party , just eat and talk \? to promote camaraderie the emi corps gladly banged bodies in basketball , spiked one another in volleyball , smashed one another in tennis , pulled one another in the tugofwar and sang to one another in a triviasong contest the office olympics was supposed to be on the koppelmans' estate , but after a few hours rain forced it indoors mr koppelman asked for the y , and the y said yes mr koppelman is a good friend of the y , an official , rona trachtenberg , said if people contribute and help us out , we like to help them out so preschoolers shared the y with recording artists and technicians wearing team tshirts that read r b s hillbillies rockers rappers technos , a new style of dance , and head bangers , those who like heavy metal tricia ferguson of long beach was on the techno team actually i work in business affairs , she said ms snow was on the r b team that s appropriate , she said what activities had the recording artist participated in \? i did lunch , she said i was told i was very good at it among those seriously competing was mr koppelman in basketball he was guarded , oh so gently , by michael best of the rock group riff i also played tennis , mr koppelman said i won that , too the barrio boys from spanish harlem were suitably attired in spandex for their day of competition we sing better than we play basketball , freddy cornea said that s why we got a contract from emi and not the nba after the competition the employees had an awards dinner it s great , said rob stone , who grew up in lawrence we got to meet each other , and now we can give each other high fives in the hallway art for the jet set rather than an artist in residence , joseph impara jr of garden city has become an artist in terminal mr impara s photographic art is on display in the british airways terminal at kennedy international airport before that it was on display in the transworld airlines terminal i suppose after this i could move on to la guardia , he said then newark perhaps even grander galleries like o'hare in chicago or orly in paris a terminal as a gallery seems a natural for mr impara , because he works in customs at kennedy through his job he visits most of the terminals when he is off duty he visits his exhibition his 21 photos hang on the gray walls leading to the firstclass lounge at british airways the pictures were supposed to hang on the gray walls leading to the concorde lounge , but remodeling delays made mr impara go first class it seems a wise gallery choice the concorde lounge is smaller than the firstclass lounge but then the concorde is smaller than most transatlantic planes maybe they 're conditioning people , mr impara said they give them a small lounge so they wo n't feel bad getting on a smaller plane although spacious , the firstclass lounge is not easy to find it is off in a corner on the third floor most people never see it those who do may have a hard time getting in that s one of the disadvantages of displaying your art in first class , mr impara said an advantage is the caliber of people who do see the photos i got a lovely note from peter jennings the other day , mr impara said you reach people you would n't reach otherwise you 're getting exposure with international travelers the customs inspectorphotographer has been taking photos since he was 10 years old those on display are an impressive mix of landscapes and people there is even a dog from garden city it s beautiful art work , said richard liebhaber of washington the art was pointed out to mr liebhaber , who was on his way to london and had not looked at the walls when he left the lounge i feel really dumb not noticing it , he said i 'll look to my left and right in the future tom christie of southampton england , that is did not notice the exhibition , either i'm taking the concorde in a couple of hours , he said in two days i 've been from london to seattle and back i do n't know if i'm awake or asleep many travelers are preoccupied , said the firstclass customerservice agent , janice rose of elmont but she has plenty of time to view the exhibition and especially likes southwest in autumn i like the yellow trees , she said if a traveler likes a photo , the traveler could arrange to purchase it but the problem is what are they going to do with it \? mr impara said they 're about to get on a plane there is always airmail summer fossil season there may be a few fossils in manhasset , but none of scientific note so the science museum of long island , which is in manhasset , sponsored a fossilfinding trip to the south dakota badlands and the not so bad , but equally fossilfull lands of nebraska this week 22 long islanders are leaving on the paleontology trip we 're going 2 , 000 miles and 40 million years away , said the leader of the expedition , dr steve gittelman of huntington dr gittelman , a trustee of the museum , has been taking long island high school students and teachers on fossil searches for several years last summer we found a 35millionyearold turtle , he said , and the skull of an oreodont that s kind of like an extinct pig they also found rhinolike bones galore a slab of the bone bed , as dr gittelman calls it , is on display in the sands point preserve other finds can be viewed at the science museum we camp out on federal lands , 12 miles from the nearest structure , dr gittelman said it s the most quiet thing , searching for bones i just sit under my umbrella , take out a dental pick , and the hours fly by photo charles koppelman , at center wearing hat , head of the emi record group , at his party for employees \( michael shavel for the new york times \)
the emerson electric company will buy fisher controls international inc , a leading valve and industrial process control maker , from the monsanto company for nearly 128 billion , the two st louisbased companies announced yesterday fisher s products measure and control the flow , temperature and pressure of liquids for the chemical , oil and gas , paper and food processing industries the deal is the latest in a string of deals broadening emerson s base as provider of a wide variety of industrial and commercial equipment and narrowing monsanto s focus emerson is already a market leader in several niches in which fisher is weak in the 18 billion worldwide market for process control together the two companies will be the largest producers of measuring equipment for industrial processes and control valves , and will be second behind honeywell inc in computer control systems for industrial processes , according to george p fraise , an analyst who follows the companies for smith barney , harris upham they paid a full price , but ultimately it s a very smart move , mr fraise said james orso , a spokesman in st louis for emerson , said that fisher would be run as a separate company wall street analysts expressed surprise when told of that statement emerson s process control business , built around the rosemount subsidiary , has been among the company s most successful , with operating earnings around 220 million on sales of 13 billion last year that 17 percent operating margin is well above the 9 percent fisher achieved last year wall street expects significant costcutting from combining operations to raise fisher s profitability and help pay for the deal spokesmen for both companies said that senior executives , including larry w solley , fisher control s chief executive , would be unavailable for interviews charles f knight , emerson s chairman and chief executive , said in a meeting with analysts that his aim was to make sure that emerson could participate fully in the industry trend toward making control devices on the factory floor more intelligent credit rating agencies said that the deal might make emerson lose its status as one of a handful of large industrial companies rated highest for the safety of its bonds but they said they needed more details on how emerson would pay for fisher , and none foresaw a major downrating emerson , which earned 495 million on sales of 571 billion in the nine months ended june 30 , is closing in on its 35th consecutive year of higher earnings for monsanto , the deal represents an end to a diversification attempt that began when fisher was acquired in 1969 monsanto invested heavily to bring fisher to the point where the valves and other devices for which it was known were part of integrated , computercontrolled systems but fisher looked increasingly out of place as the company , searching for higher margins and less cyclical earnings , concentrated on specialty and agricultural chemicals , plastics , food additives like nutrasweet and pharmaceuticals fisher achieved record earnings in 1990 its performance had been lackluster during much of the time monsanto owned it , and earnings tailed off to 84 million again last year , as sales stagnated at 928 million it never accounted for more than 11 percent of monsanto s sales emerson s shares declined 1125 , to 50 , in trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday monsanto s rose 325 , to 5675 graphs fisher s figures shows revenues and operating income for fisher controls international inc from '87'91 \( source company reports \)

the constitution and the bill of rights are full of lofty assurances of justice but contrary to the prevailing mythology , neither says anything about a jury of one s peers just what is a representative jury \? in recent weeks , three widely publicized criminal cases have raised the same perplexing question as is so often true in the tortured saga of american law , all three revolve around race earlier this month , jury selection began in the trial of four white los angeles policemen accused of the videotaped beating of a black man because of pretrial publicity , the proceedings were moved from los angeles , where nonhispanic blacks make up 13 percent of the population , to suburban simi valley , where the same group constitutes 2 percent on feb 11 , a jury in teaneck , nj , acquitted gary spath , a white police officer who was charged in the killing of a 16yearold black , phillip pannell blacks constitute nearly 5 percent of the population in bergen county , but only 26 percent , or 7 of the 261 of the pool from which the jury was drawn , and none of those who actually heard the case on feb 9 , a jury in indianapolis convicted the boxer mike tyson of raping a contestant in a black beauty pageant lawyers for the boxer had complained that blacks were underrepresented on the jury although in fact they constitute 226 percent of population of indianapolis and 25 percent of the jury notion of lore , not law in each case , there have been protestations of unfairness but in none of them , it seems , was anything done illegally for although the notion of a jury of one s peers dates to the magna carta , it looms far larger in american lore than law the constitution speaks only of impartial jurors drawn from the vicinity of the crime the pool , or venire , has broadened since the days when peer effectively meant white , male property owners , but since it is customarily based on lists of people registered to vote or drive , it retains a certain middleclass bent but as long as such a pool is representative , the jury picked from it need not be thus , like a televised lottery drawing , as long as all the numbers are in the bin , one cannot complain about the particular balls that pop up there is nothing unconstitutional about an allwhite jury sitting in judgment of a black person , as long as blacks were represented in the larger group justice antonin scalia wrote for the supreme court in 1990 , the sixth amendment requirement of a fair crosssection on the venire is a means of assuring not a representative jury \( which the constitution does not demand \) , but an impartial one \( which it does \) limit on prosecutors albert w alschuler , a professor at the university of chicago law school , put it more colloquially , if the luck of the draw gives you five successive juries of wealthy republican womengolfers , there s no constitutional problem a second dimension to the problem arises in the selection of individual jurors six years ago , in the landmark case of batson v kentucky , the supreme court barred prosecutors from using their peremptory dismissals those for which no explanations need be given solely to exclude blacks there is no evidence that prosecutors in indianapolis , teaneck or simi valley did any such thing if anything , since each case involved a black victim , they may even have deemed black jurors to be preferable but batson does not apply to defense lawyers , and the lawyer for officer spath did reject two potential black jurors legal scholars say that while a jury of one s peers sounds laudable , it is completely unworkable in practice how , for instance , could one ever come up with a jury of peers of the serial killer jeffrey l dahmer \? to accommodate all possible factors , not just race , but sex , class , religion and others , could be laborious indeed , like selecting a supreme court justice it could also be unconstitutional the people who try the typical unemployed street criminal are not his peers , but neither were the people who tried william kennedy smith , said gerald e lynch of columbia law school nor , he said , should they necessarily be there s some importance to the view that 12 people randomly drawn from the community are going to be fair , he said perhaps no one , then , is a peer at the same time , as toni m massaro of the university of arizona college of law in tucson has written , american tradition has it that everyone is justice john marshall harlan stated in his dissent in plessy v ferguson , the infamous 1896 case upholding legalized segregation our constitution is colorblind , and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens the humblest is the peer of the most powerful still , the judicial system is not only supposed to render justice but give the appearance of doing so for that reason , despite considerable constitutional and practical obstacles , some jurisdictions are attempting to reduce the odds of having monochromatic panels preside over racially charged cases georgia , for instance , requires that the pools from which jurors are drawn in death penalty cases must approximate the racial and sexual composition of the counties from which they are drawn more ambitiously , a group of lawyers and public officials organized by the minnesota supreme court recently recommended that at least 2 of the 23 members of every grand jury hearing homicide cases in minneapolis be minority members seventyfive percent of the victims and suspects in homicides are people of color , said louis smith of the hennepin county district attorney s office , who fashioned the proposal when you have an allwhite grand jury , you 're taking an unnecessary risk of cultural bias and miscommunication but some scholars consulted by the task force , like mr alschuler and fred l morrison of the university of minnesota law school , said they foresaw constitutional problems the united states supreme court , they noted , has been increasingly reluctant to approve any laws based on explicitly racial quotas , particularly where past discrimination cannot be proven moreover , they see a host of interpretive problems in a polyglot culture would a grand jury including a native american and a vietnamese satisfy the standard \? how about chineseamericans , filipinos , or people with one black grandparent \? and what if others , like homosexuals , women , italoamericans or the handicapped , demand similar representation \? civil liberties lawyers nonetheless predict that the principle established in the batson case will soon be extended not only to defense lawyers , but also to challenges based on sex , national origin and religion there s very little law today , but that s going to change , because nonrepresentative juries breed cynicism , said george kendall of the naacp legal defense and educational fund in new york there s no reason in 1992 why we ca n't insure that juries truly represent communities in important cases
rome , nov 11 gaetano giordano had got as far as his front door on the way home from his perfume store on tuesday night when the killers struck of the nine bullets fired at close range , five hit their target , two struck and wounded his 22yearold son and two went wild , the police said today for the second time in four days an italian businessman who had refused to pay protection money to the mob lay dead the killing focused italy s attention on gela , a sicilian town of 79 , 000 that has become an emblem of the many small towns across southern italy under the mafia s sway the picture that emerges from police accounts is one of mobsters' running the streets and the local council , of gangland feuds and of corrupt dealings worth millions mr giordano , 55 years old , had achieved a kind of celebrity in gela because , two years ago , he publicly refused to pay extortion money and identified those who had demanded what the italians call pizzo his testimony led to the arrest of a smalltime mobster , ivan \( the gun \) rapisarda , who was also wanted for his part in the socalled videoarcade massacre , a 1990 gun battle between rival mafia families that left eight dead and seven wounded according to police accounts , those killings were a small part of a wider war between two leading clans , the madonia and the ianni'cavallo , that claimed 110 lives between 1987 and 1991 before what seemed to be a truce was struck the ceasefire allowed the clans to carve up the protection rackets , which involved monthly payments ranging from 180 to 8 , 000 , depending on the wealth of the victim in may , investigators questioning a teenage hoodlum discovered he had a master book listing businesses targeted for extortion and the names of those who would profit from it of the businessmen named in the book , 20 agreed to collaborate with the authorities and 30 , fearing retribution , refused extortion is only a part of gela s woes in july , the government dissolved the 40member town council , accusing members of felonies , including conspiracy to assassinate the municipal engineer the five accused have since been charged with attempted murder and extortion another accusation was that mafia clans had corruptly obtained contracts for public works , including a sewerage system whose cost had doubled , to 26 million seven more councilmen have been charged with abusing their official powers in connection with the contracts in the last year , about 40 such councils have been dissolved across southern italy on the same suspicions but in gela , nothing seemed to intimidate the gangsters when the authorities in rome sent three interim commissioners to run the municipality , one , angelo campanile , promptly received a death threat accompanied by three bullets one for each commissioner if blood has to flow , i invite these wretches to take it out on me , mr campanile said at a news conference last month a raid , to not much avail perhaps he was emboldened by a big police raid in gela on oct 7 when 250 officers backed up by helicopters and attack dogs rounded up 45 suspected mobsters none of that helped mr giordano the police said his perfumery had been firebombed in august 1991 in the same month sicily s most prominent antiracket campaigner , libero grassi , a businessmen , was gunned down on the streets of palermo , the island s capital two weeks ago , another gela businessman who had refused to pay extortion money , francesco assaro , was wounded in a gun attack and three days before mr giordano died , giovanni panunzio , who had also tried to refuse the mob s offer , was gunned down in foggia , on the mainland who will be next , today or tomorrow \? said a statement today from the business association in capo d'orlando , the only town in sicily to have successfully confronted the extortionists must we wait until they kill us all \?
carlstadt , nj , march 29 a windswept fire roared through hundreds of acres of open marshland near the meadowlands sports complex today , backing up traffic 15 miles on the northern stretches of the new jersey turnpike billowing black smoke and flaming 8foot marsh reeds on both sides of the turnpike caused the authorities to close the turnpike s 10mile western spur for about five hours as a safety precaution the shutdown , which began at 12 50 pm , forced thousands of vehicles onto the turnpike s eastern spur between exit 15w in newark and the highway s northern end in ridgefield , creating long delays at both points by midafternoon , turnpike officials said there were backups of 5 miles at the southern diversion and 2 miles at the northern one the fire was extinguished about 5 30 pm joe bartlinski , a bus driver , said he spent 45 minutes traveling between 15w and the turnpike s lincoln tunnel exit , a trip that normally takes about 5 minutes , he said reopens after 4 hours i have a commuter run every day and i do n't get this kind of traffic , mr bartlinski said the northbound lanes of the western spur were reopened at 4 38 pm and the southbound lanes at 5 57 pm , said paul migut , a turnpike trafficoperations supervisor the marsh fire began about 11 30 am on vacant inaccessible land near washington avenue and barell avenue fanned by 30mileanhour gusts from the northwest , the blaze quickly hopscotched about the marsh within an hour , five alarms were sounded , bringing trucks and 200 firefighters from 17 towns we really have no idea how the blaze started , said dennis monks , assistant chief of the carlstadt fire department with the winds we have , it will be tough to determine exactly where it started 300 acres burned by late afternoon , chief monks said , about 300 acres of reeds had burned there were no reported injuries or serious damage to the scores of onestory brick office buildings and warehouses on the developed fringes of the marsh such fires are something of an early spring ritual in the marshes of the meadowlands , especially during days of high wind , though they are usually smaller and less dramatic once started , they roar through the brittledry brown reeds of march and april , creating spectacular rolling flames and tall columns of coalblack smoke but generally little damage firefighters post themselves on the flanks of the flames or at the edges of developed properties , trying to keep the flames away from buildings the fire today swept past a dozen offices and warehouses along barell avenue within minutes firefighters sprayed streams of water on many of the buildings none caught fire windows cracked from the intense heat at two offices and they suffered minor smoke damage , chief monks said most of the fire was about a halfmile northeast of the meadowlands arena , home of the new jersey nets and new jersey devils the stiff winds blew the flames east and away from the arena near naturalgas tanks at one point , separate fires burned on both sides of the turnpike s western spur in late afternoon , the flames switched direction and spread northwest into the wind at times , flames came within several hundreds yards of two liquefied natural gas storage tanks owned by the transcontinental gas pipe line corp the liquefied gas is highly explosive , but chief monks said the tanks have sufficient insulation to withstand heat radiating from the burning reeds nonetheless , three fire trucks were posted near the tanks ash from the burning marshland wafted across the hudson to the upper west side of manhattan ron stuart and his girlfriend , beverly pall , who had left open the bedroom window in their apartment at riverside drive and 86th street , found the ash covering their white bedspread i thought that someone s incinerator had gone crazy , mr stuart said map showing the site of the brush fires
the stampede in new york at a city university gymnasium that left nine people dead and 29 others injured points up a growing problem for the nation s 10 , 000 security firms and the people who rely on their protection events that draw big crowds may desperately require the knowhow of professional security firms , but many companies shun the work because of the risk of getting sued over a disturbance the nation s largest security company , pinkerton s inc , and thirdranked wackenhut corporation routinely cede crowdcontrol work to what analysts rank as the no 2 rival , the burns international security services , a unit of the borgwarner corporation , or to smaller rivals like command security corporation in legrangeville , ny we do n't want that kind of liability , albert j berger , pinkerton s president , said we do n't do boxing matches , football games , concerts or taco bells we do n't do crowd control yet it was pinkerton s guards at the gymnasium the night of the stampede , raising questions about the potential liability the company faces although pinkerton s has assiduously avoided this type of assignment since 1988 , when the current owners bought it from american brands inc , mr berger said it agreed to send extra guards to the city college campus on saturday night because it has patrolled the campus for the last four years he said the company s contract with the university expires tomorrow so determined has pinkerton s been to avoid difficult assignments that its management even let annual revenues slide 10 percent between 1988 and 1990 gutsy for a public company rather than renew certain contracts that might expose it to lawsuits , like one it had with the new york racing authority , where it had to indemnify the client against general liability claims today , more than 80 percent of the company s 637 million in estimated 1991 revenues come from the more desirable line of industrial work , mr berger said in some ways , the transformation has been so drastic that even by last monday analysts and investors who follow pinkerton s stock found it hard to believe that pinkerton s guards had been on the scene that s news to me , said richard rieger , an analyst at ladenburg , thalmann and company i'm surprised , because normally the pinkerton people try to choose as low a profile site as they can as a result , pinkerton s stock actually rose 48 percent on monday and tuesday , largely on the strength of favorable mention it received in monday s wall street journal , and only drifted down 23 percent to 3250 by friday s close as word spread about its role in the disaster because none of its publicly traded competitors discuss lawsuits resulting from crowdcontrol work in their public filings , it is hard for investors to assess the relative risks of one competitor over another pinkerton s and command trade over the counter , while wackenhut is on the big board borgwarner has publicly traded bonds but officials of all four companies freely admit that suits come with the security business it s a pretty litigious atmosphere out there , said rodger komstock , president of burns international whenever you work in places with 100 , 000 people , you have 100 , 000 opportunities for litigation , and that s why training and planning are so important his company seeks to reduce the risk by writing extensive training manuals for its employees part of the secret to our success is putting ourselves in a position of knowing the facilities we work at and not just showing up an hour before and thinking you 're going to control a crowd of 2 , 000 or 20 , 000 , he said wackenhut copes , according to its spokesman patrick cannan , by being extremely choosy about the sort of events it accepts the hoosier dome in indianapolis is acceptable rock concerts are a nono and by bidding more than others on crowdcontrol jobs , on the theory that it only makes sense if the company can justify paying the guards it would hire above minimumwage salaries we normally would n't be the lowest bidder , because we want to bring in people specially trained to do that work , he said mr berger of pinkerton s acknowledges that the company may now be sued along with other potential deep pockets on the scene of the city university tragedy but he does not believe his company bears any responsibility for the disaster because his guards were only supplemental and were not managing the event s security should there be any attempt to get at us , we are adequately insured but there should n't be any grounds to come after us , said mr berger we feel badly about what happened but we did what we were supposed to do we followed the orders we were given richard daynard , a law professor at northeastern university in boston who specializes in liability issues , is less sure if the facts bear two possible interpretations , as facts often do , they 'll give you the description that reduces their potential liability while professor daynard does not believe that the company s exposure will be huge , based on what is known so far , he sees at least two situations that could increase the company s liability if any of the investigations find that pinkerton s guards acted negligently or if pinkerton s did , in fact , assume more responsibility for the event s security than it now admits the other wild card is if the question of allocating blame ever reaches a jury family members will be very sympathetic , professor daynard said either way , the industry will be closely watching the outcome , said william c vassell , president of command security the case is precedentsetting in my industry , he said it brings out to the forefront what can happen , and a lot of firms will determine now if they want to go forward with this business a lot will turn down assignments that they might have taken in the past graph rentaguard , tracks wackenhut and command security stock prices , jan 2 , 1991jan 3 , 1992 \(

new observations of a phenomenon known as a gravitational lens , nature s way of magnifying remote astronomical objects , have encouraged scientists to think they now possess a promising tool to dig into the mystery of dark matter , the invisible material that presumably accounts for at least 90 percent of the mass of the universe astronomers studying photographs from the hubble space telescope announced yesterday that they had detected a striking example of a gravitational lens bending , concentrating and focusing light from a distant galaxy into images that are bigger and brighter than would otherwise be the case this lensing effect offers an indirect way of determining the amount and distribution of dark matter in galactic clusters answering the many questions about dark matter might lead to predictions of whether the universe will expand indefinitely or collapse of its own gravity it seems to depend on how much more mass there is out there than can be detected by the conventional instruments of astronomy in sixhour exposures by the orbiting telescope s widefield camera , a pair of faint clumps of light was seen close to the center of a cluster of galaxies four billion lightyears away these were mirror images of the light coming from an even more distant galaxy the gravity of the intervening galaxy cluster , called ac114 , was acting as a natural lens or magnifying glass on the light passing through from the distant galaxy 'images of the same source' dr richard ellis , an astronomer from durham university in england , said , the high degree of symmetry and nearidentical colors of the objects are a strong indication that they are images of the same source , supporting the hypothesis that we have discovered a very massive lens as a result , astronomers said they could not only get a sharper view of the distant galaxy but could also investigate the nature of the galaxy cluster acting as the lens in particular , since the lensing action is a function of the cluster s gravitational force and that is related to mass , scientists were able to deduce the distribution of material through the cluster , including the unseen dark matter at a news conference in washington , dr ellis said , a lot of astronomers are going to be using gravitational lenses with hubble to track down the mystery of dark matter one preliminary finding , dr ellis said , was that the dark matter in the observed galaxy cluster appeared to be more concentrated toward the center than are the individual galaxies in the cluster this uneven distribution could be damaging to one theory of what constitutes dark matter if most of this invisible matter is exotic subatomic particles , slow , weakly interacting particles known as cold dark matter , theorists had assumed that it would be more loosely concentrated and widely distributed so the theorists may have to look for alternative explanations for dark matter predicted by einstein the gravitionallens phenomenon was predicted by einstein in his theory of relativity and has been observed a few times by groundbased telescopes in those views , the mirror images are blurry , with none of the sharp detail seen in the hubble observations if the hubble s flawed mirror can be corrected , as planned by shuttle astronauts in two years , these observations should be even more revealing , astronomers said in a report on findings by another astronomy satellite , the space agency announced the first observations by the extreme ultraviolet explorer spacecraft that was launched on june 7 the spacecraft is now 11 weeks into a survey of the entire sky for sources of extreme ultraviolet radiation , the relatively littleexplored region of the electromagnetic spectrum at the transition between ordinary ultraviolet light and xrays stuart bowyer , an astronomer at the university of california at berkeley , said scientists on the project were surprised that the telescope could detect clear evidence of extreme ultraviolet rays coming from a powerful object more than two billion lightyears beyond the milky way , the galaxy that includes the solar system the observations suggest that the telescope may be able to make important discoveries about the nature of black holes , those theorized regions where matter is so densely packed and the gravity so strong that nothing , not even light , can escape the scientists said the distant object appeared to be a galaxy that radiates as much energy as a trillion suns it may be one of the class of galaxies , called bl lac objects , that are thought to contain at their center superdense black holes , each with a mass of 100 million suns the steady brilliance of the newly observed object might indicate that dust , gas and stars are steadily being sucked into a giant black hole thought to be at the center of such objects diagram mapping the 'missing mass' of space the observable matter in the universe does not have enough gravitational force to have created galaxies and other huge structures scientists theorize that most of this force comes from invisible or dark matter , which they believe makes up 90 percent of the universe the hubble space telescope has observed what are thought to be mirror images of a very distant galaxyscientists think an intervening galaxy cluster , containing massive amounts of invisible dark matter , is acting as a gravitational lens , deflecting photons of light form the distant galaxy researchers hope they can determine the distribution of the invisible matter in the galaxy cluster by studying the effect of its gravity on the light passing through it \( sources nasa scientific american \)
phnom penh , cambodia throughout this shattered and still heavily landmined nation , many cambodians agree that only the swiftest arrival of united nations peacekeepers can reverse a slide into anarchy , and some even wonder whether the force of 22 , 000 will prove large enough for the task in authorizing the deployment , the united nations has approved one of the largest and most expensive peacekeeping operations in its history , with the assembly , transport and maintenance of soldiers and civilian monitors expected to cost more than 2 billion but four months after cambodia s warring factions signed a peace treaty and paved the way for united nations involvement , the problems are so vast and so varied that they are certain to severely challenge the bluecapped international force 'i am forced to worry' racked by feuds and corruption , the government in phnom penh has stopped providing the countryside with even basic services like medical care , education and sanitation moreover , tens of thousands of government workers have not been paid since last fall , and some soldiers have turned to banditry to support themselves and their families this is supposed to be a time of peace and rebuilding , but i am forced instead to worry about how i will support my family and keep them safe , said a 28yearold government clerk in the western city of sisophon , who last received his salary , equivalent to 12 a month , in november apprehensive about refugees such problems , widespread as they are , are likely to be compounded as the 370 , 000 cambodian refugees begin returning from border camps in thailand where many have lived for a dozen years or more for some , the trek home will run perilously close to undiscovered mines planted on paths and rice paddies diplomats and international relief workers say that this sense of disorder , which intensifies exponentially the farther one travels from the capital , could provide opportunities for the khmer rouge , the fanatical chinesebacked guerrillas who were responsible for the deaths of more than one million cambodians in the 1970 s despite its ugly past , the khmer rouge signed the peace treaty and are part of the transitional coalition , the supreme national council , which is supposed to work with the incumbent phnom penh government to run cambodia until elections are held but the khmer rouge , its adversaries say , are waiting patiently for a second chance for power perhaps through the ballot box , perhaps on the battlefield the capital peace has brought a modest boom in phnom penh , neighborhoods that were little more than rubble a year ago are being reborn as cambodians and foreign investors gamble that peace will take root and with it will come the kind of profits that have been accumulated elsewhere in southeast asia the boom has trickled down to people like pung sikhoeur , a father of three who drives a bicycle rickshaw and sometimes works as a cook he has rented his threeroom home to a group of thai investors while moving his family into a shack on the outskirts of the city the rent he gets for his home , the equivalent of about 300 a month , is a fortune in a nation where per capita income is less than 200 a year i am lucky , said mr pung si khoeur it is craziness for foreigners to pay so much money but i am happy to take their money if the united nations comes and takes over , maybe the peace will last , and i can become truly rich wounds of war , and more war cambodia has not known real peace since the 1960 s in 1969 , at the height of the vietnam war , the united states began secret bombing of suspected north vietnamese army bases in eastern cambodia the bombing lasted four years in 1975 , the khmer rouge overran the americansupported phnom penh government and began its reign of genocidal terror four years later the vietnamese army ousted the khmer rouge regime , forcing its leaders back into the jungle , where they regrouped as rebels the civil war that followed lasted nearly 13 years phnom penh , which the khmer rouge turned into a ghost town by forcing its residents out at gunpoint in 1975 , is now suffused with a dreamlike atmosphere where the hopes and prospects for instant wealth intermingle with looming portents of more tragedy and disaster the city today has at least 800 , 000 residents , up from about 50 , 000 when the khmer rouge were overthrown in 1979 , but still less than half its 1975 population of 2 million uneasiness over inequalities in the capital , mercedesbenz sedans regularly cruise along the potholed streets it is seldom clear who is behind the heavily tinted windows but many of the pedestrians and bicycle riders assume they are newly affluent government officials in december riots erupted when it became known that corrupt officials had sold off government buildings and businesses and pocketed the proceeds as many as a dozen people were killed before the rioting was put down by the security forces the city s only luxury hotel is filled with asian business executives , many of whom admit that they are driven more by the impulse of gambling than by the calculation of investment
with the opening of the former soviet bloc to the west , perhaps the greatest financial opportunity is in the oil sector russia has huge oil reserves that modern technology could develop , and across the former soviet union and eastern europe , a whole new world of consumers is developing but how does an individual investor participate \? with caution , say experts but one company , elf aquitaine , is putting itself forward as an investment vehicle we are at home in russia , said the chairman , loik le flochprigent , on a visit to new york earlier this year paris is closer to moscow than new york is to los angeles , he pointed out analysts give the company a clear lead in the race to develop oil production in the republics of russia and kazakhstan , and they point out that it has a strong position in refining in the former east germany , with a leg up on entering other former east bloc countries even if production or the market fizzles in the former east bloc , analysts say elf s prospects look good the company , which last year recorded daily oil and gas production equivalent to 760 , 000 barrels of oil , is projecting production of one million barrels a day by 1995 , including some production under a contract signed in moscow in february , to explore 20 , 000 square kilometers , or 7 , 720 square miles elf says the russian contract , covering an area east of the volga river between saratov and volgograd , could increase its reserves by 20 percent in an industry in which most companies expect to increase their oil equivalent production by only 5 to 10 percent over the next five years , elf aquitaine is among a handful of companies that stand out , said a report recently by george friesen , an analyst at the deutsche bank capital corporation in a telephone interview , mr friesen cautioned that the russian part was hard to count on i would never make a bet on an equity on the basis of what s happening in former soviet union , he said at nomura research service , in london , alan d marshall went a step further they look to have acreage in the right places , and the kind of agreements they 've signed are better than those being negotiated by a lot of other companies , mr marshall said so far most of the other deals done by other companies in what was the soviet union have various complicating factors , he said , including leaving provisions to be resolved later the elf deal , he said , is recognized as being the first definitive exploration and production agreement he added , none of us have much knowledge of the geography or geology of that particular part of the world , describing the data available as primitive but , he said on the acreage in kazakhstan , the local people dug a well in order to try to secure a fresh water supply , and they found crude oil , which is still happily bubbling up it seems to be that sort of territory illustrating the risks of that part of the world , kurt h wulff of mcdep associates , an oil analysis company , said a barrel of oil in the ground in the united states would add about 350 to a company s value , but in the former soviet union , the value would be 50 cents to 1 if elf succeeds in producing 200 , 000 barrels a day from the former soviet union in five or six years , as it intends , that would mean , he said , reserves of about 750 million barrels at 1 a barrel , he said , that would add 750 million to a company with assets that he values at 37 billion elf has a second contract in kazakhstan , also covering 20 , 000 square kilometers , southwest of aktyubinsk , near temir , called the first of its kind between the republic and a western partner mr wulff said the eastern european overtures were significant but even if they all panned out , not large enough to determine the company s future still , he said , elf is undervalued relative to other companies of its size , including norsk hydro , broken hill proprietary , occidental and du pont he put du pont in the same category as elf because both have oil production \( du pont through its conoco subsidiary \) and large chemical operations besides the oil production agreements , last year elf was part of a consortium that purchased minolleuna , the gasoline distribution monopoly of the former east germany the company is building a refinery in eastern germany , on the doorstep of a cluster of companies that may develop strong gasoline markets the french government holds a majority stake in societe nationale elf aquitaine , and apparently holds a bias toward large reserves in the ground , as a matter of national policy american depository rights , each equal to half a share , began trading on the new york stock exchange last year they closed yesterday at 34875 , up 625 cents the company s reserves , at an estimated 35 billion barrels of oil equivalent in 1991 , are up 54 percent since 1988
paris , april 16 an italian court today convicted one of italy s most powerful businessmen , carlo de benedetti , and 32 codefendants on charges of fraud stemming from the sensational 1982 collapse of banco ambrosiano , once italy s largest private bank in a decision that stunned italy , the court in milan sentenced mr de benedetti , chairman of olivetti , the turinbased computer giant , to six years and four months in jail lawyers said he would go to prison only if both an appeals court and the supreme court confirmed the verdict the appeals process could last several years the verdicts and particularly mr de benedetti s conviction surprised many italians , not only because no italian court has ever ruled against so influential a group of business figures , but also because investigation of the murky ambrosiano scandal was already in its 10th year although it was mr de benedetti s conviction that grabbed the headlines today , the entire banco ambrosiano case has long fascinated italians because the bank s collapse exposed an extraordinary underworld of shady deals involving powerful political figures , mafia bosses and even the vatican announcing plans to appeal today s ruling , mr de benedetti s lawyers said , this sentence is as unexpected as it is disconcerting for anyone who knows the facts and still believes in justice they said not a single piece of evidence had been presented suggesting mr de benedetti s coresponsibility for banco ambrosiano s collapse mr de benedetti himself made no statement today , but in the past he has insisted that his role at the bank was both innocent and peripheral he became its deputy chairman in november 1981 and resigned , selling his 2 percent stake , in january 1982 , seven months before the bank went bankrupt , leaving debts of more than 1 billion when the first indictments in the case were made in april 1989 , the turinborn businessman was cleared by magistrates of any wrongdoing , but the state prosecutor appealed this decision in march 1991 , an appeals court rejected the prosecution s charge that mr de benedetti had profited illicitly from the sale of his shares , but it unexpectedly added his name to those indicted on fraud charges related to the banco ambrosiano s bankruptcy the current charges never attributed a specific role to him in the bank s collapse if mr de benedetti s conviction is upheld , it will inevitably result in a big shakeup at ing c olivetti company spa , which he has served as chief executive since 1978 and as chairman since 1983 the 57yearold executive is also active in other industrial , financial and publishing operations in italy and abroad mr de benedetti controls his empire through his family s 425 percent stake in compagnia finanziaria de benedetti , or cofide cofide , in turn , owns 433 percent of compagnia industriali ruinite , or cir , itself the holding company for olivetti and numerous other companies cir owns 443 percent of olivetti in the wake of the verdict , olivetti shares on the milan bourse fell sharply and then recovered slightly , closing 28 percent down at 2 , 605 lire shares in mr de benedetti s holding company , compagnia industriali riunite , closed 44 percent lower at 1 , 465 lire cofide s shares fell by 15 percent to 2 , 010 lire last year , the olivetti group , which has 47 , 000 employees , recorded losses of around 242 million on consolidated revenues of 72 billion like other leading computer companies , including ibm , olivetti has suffered from the world economic slowdown in february , mr de benedetti said he hoped the company would break even this year in a statement issued in march 1991 , mr de benedetti said he had been forced off the bank s board because he was alone in openly and strongly contesting the management methods of its then chairman , roberto calvi mr calvi s body was found hanging under blackfriars bridge in london on june 18 , 1982 , officially a suicide , although the belief that he was murdered is still widely held in italy other famous names convicted today as accessories to fraudulent bankruptcy included licio gelli , a leader of the outlawed masonic lodge known as p2 , who was sentenced to 18 1 2 years in prison and giuseppe ciarrapico , a rome financier and close friend of prime minister giulio andreotti , who was sentenced to 6 years and 4 months the unraveling of the bank began in 1981 when the discovery of the p2 masonic lodge , with many prominent names among its nearly 1 , 000 members , brought down the italian government not only was p2 , for propaganda due , suspected of responsibility for some rightist bomb attacks , but mr gelli was later found to have used banco ambrosiano for money laundering under mr calvi , who took over the bank s presidency in 1975 and was also a member of p2 , the bank expanded rapidly abroad , notably in south america and in offshore financial centers evidence that it laundered some mafia money and provided credit for some mafia operations later formed part of the prosecution s case the roman catholic church s embarrassing involvement came through the friendship between mr calvi and an american prelate , archbishop paul c marcinkus of cicero , ill , who was head of the institute for religious works at the vatican 'god s banker' known as the vatican bank , the institute owned 15 percent of the banco ambrosiano as well as 10 shell companies in panama and luxembourg to which the bank lent 13 billion mr calvi s wellknown ties to the vatican earned him the nickname of god s banker , but it was when the vatican s shell companies could not repay their loans that the bank finally went under after the banco ambrosiano s collapse in august 1982 , the vatican contended that it played no role in the bank s management in 1984 , insisting that it was a gesture of good will rather than an admission of guilt , the vatican nonetheless paid 250 million to the bank s creditors in 1988 , arguing that it was a sovereign state , it also persuaded the italian supreme court that archbishop marcinkus was protected from prosecution by diplomatic immunity the archbishop stepped down as head of the vatican bank in 1989 and retired the following year none of the convicted will be jailed until the appeals process is completed photo carlo de benedetti , who was convicted yesterday in milan on charges of bank fraud

the economy clinton s team looks a lot like cuomo s aside from senator lloyd bentsen of texas , whom presidentelect clinton tapped for treasury secretary , and representative leon e panetta of california , his choice for budget director , mr clinton s dream team of economic advisers all have the same pedigree they were part of the economic brain trust of gov mario cuomo of new york mr clinton s team of pinstripes and mortarboards robert b reich , labor secretary robert e rubin , senior economic adviser laura d'andrea tyson , head of the council of economic advisers , and roger c altman , deputy treasury secretary all advised the cuomo commission on economic competitiveness , said vincent tese , director of economic development for new york what kind of policies will the dream team promote \? they 'll be working on a growth strategy with investment tax credits as the cornerstone , mr tese said the idea is for gdp to grow at 3 percent a year or better taking the deficit pledge the economy , stupid may have been what brought presidentelect clinton to washington , but now that the economy s breath is once again fogging the mirror , what will mr clinton do \? last week at a meeting in washington , mr clinton said he would make good on his pledge to leave the country with a substantially smaller budget deficit at the end of his term , but he refrained from promising how small the deficit would be the deficit is expected to reach 340 billion in 1993 and while recent statistics may be showing that the economy has left its comatose state , mr clinton cautioned the country not to confuse signs of life with economic health the evidence is more mixed , he said , adding that longterm problems , like the nation s slow productivity growth , must still be addressed cable s next rival for decades , cable tv systems have had no competition that is beginning to change first the federal communications commission said it would let local phone companies carry video dial tones and now it has approved a new microwave technology that uses superhighfrequency radio waves to transmit 49 channels of television the new system sends signals over the airwaves and is far less expensive to install than cable the fcc proposed offering licenses to two companies in each market and gave cellular visions of freehold , nj , which developed the technology , the choice of a license in either new york or los angeles it s another form of competition that we 're prepared to face , said carole shandler , a spokeswoman for cablevision systems , based in woodbury , li finally , a rosier forecast the nation s purchasing managers are to the economy what the groundhog is to spring the national association of purchasing managers surveys its 300 members' corporate buying activities and forecasts future economic activity last week the association s members overwhelmingly said they expected business activity to pick up next year but with a caveat though business will be better , it will not boom the group forecast a 52 percent increase in revenues for the companies , after inflation but while the upturn wo n't be robust , at least it will be widespread there was n't a single industry that predicted a decrease in revenues in 1993 over 1992 , said robert bretz , chairman of the group s business survey committee keeping inflation in check outside of detroit , few businesses are bold enough to raise prices when the economy turns sluggish as a result , according to the labor department , prices at the producer level fell 02 percent in november , after inching up by a barely perceptible 01 percent in october inflation is well contained , said donald kohn , director of monetary affairs at the federal reserve those incredibly shrinking prices at the producer level have had a salubrious effect on consumer prices according to the labor department , the consumer price index increased by 02 percent in november , after increasing by 04 percent in october inflation for the year is running at 31 percent out of the woodwork it may be a green christmas after all retail sales grew by 04 percent in november , the fifth monthly gain in a row this raises the possibility that real gdp in the fourth quarter could be as high as 3 percent , said norman robertson , chief economist at the mellon bank in pittsburgh international why yeltsin is stymied when president boris n yeltsin of russia failed to get his congress to approve his economic plan along with his choice for prime minister , yegor gaidar , he accused the legislative body of seeking to return the country to the dark days of communism then mr yeltsin proposed holding a national referendum next month to determine who is the country s boss the president or the congress but not everyone agrees that congress is against reform some say it s just mr yeltsin s current plans who gave yeltsin special powers to conduct his economic reform \? congress , said vladimir kvint , a professor of international business at fordham university what annoys congress now is that mr yeltsin s reforms have been badly executed , mr kvint said when gaidar started the reform process , inflation was 150 percent now it s 1 , 850 percent a year stopping soviet brain drain while mr yeltsin and the congress wrangle , russia s scientific establishment continues to crumble to keep former soviet scientists working , george soros , the american investor and philanthropist , said he would give 100 million over the next two years to support the researchers to lose them because of economic difficulties would be really a loss for mankind , mr soros said a japanese chip coup cramming ever more memory capacity onto a wafer of silicon is a highstakes business taking the lead in that race were four japanese companies fujitsu , hitachi , nec and toshiba which disclosed they had independently developed chips that store 256megabits of information , 64 times more capacity than current chips but that does not mean they will have the market to themselves you can assume that other makers have comparable levels of technology , said hiroyuki mizuno , an executive at rival matsushita electric industrial corporation companies
it is diificult to believe , but the jets have reached the crossroads of their 1992 season , despite the fact that they have n't played eight games that is what happens when you lose the first four games of the season things will get even worse if the jets lose to the colts at the indianapolis hoosier dome this afternoon about the only good thing to come out of the jets' four losses was that none were to american football conference east division opponents last week , the jets \( 14 \) beat the patriots for their first victory of the season and , more important , their first victory in the division after the game against the colts \( 22 \) , another division opponent , the jets will be off with a bye they will return in a monday night game , against the buffalo bills , on oct 26 at giants stadium then , the jets play the broncos at denver and the miami dolphins at giants stadium at this point in the national football league season , buffalo , denver and miami have a combined record of 122 , and all appear headed for the playoffs buffalo \( 41 \) and miami \( 40 \) are division rivals of the jets the jets players have tried not to look ahead most of them believe that looking ahead is what got them into trouble at the start of the season , after they came off a 50 exhibition performance so , they do n't want to make too much of what might happen beyond the game in indianapolis when you 're 14 , every game is important , said jets linebacker kyle clifton the fact that we have n't played well in the first five games , it s especially important that we play well going into the off week although the colts were abysmal in their three previous seasons , they have had great success against the jets , going 51 against them in that span the colts are 31 against jets teams coached by bruce coslet indianapolis had a 115 record last season , and the lone victory came against the jets going into that game , the colts had n't scored a touchdown in 21 quarters , but they scored four against the jets and won the game by 2827 at giants stadium no driving force what kind of motivation will memory of that game give the jets today \? none , coslet said that s last year just like we kind of dominated in the first game they 're not going to use that either that s last year that s history they 're a different team and so are we things have changed that did n't happen this year the colts' primary weapon against the jets has been quarterback jeff george consider that three of his seven career victories as the indianapolis starter have come against the jets in george s four starts against the jets , he has completed 61 of 97 passes \( 628 percent \) for 807 yards , 6 touchdowns and 3 interceptions three of his best 10 passingyardage totals have come against the jets george has been sacked in 29 of his 30 starts as a colt guess which team did n't get to him \? bingo ! george has no real explanation for his or the colts' recent success against the jets i do n't feel comfortable playing against any particular team , george said i just try to prepare and create things some things just went our way last year i remember a lot of times that i was scrambling and trying to create a lot of stuff that s when i'm at my best , when i'm on the run and trying to make something happen i was fortunate enough to do that a couple of times last year and come up with some big plays some days it goes that way and some days it does n't trouble zone jets defenders know that george has a dangerous arm they have also identified how he has been able to scramble and beat them last season , george did a lot of scrambling because his offensive line was a jumbled mess he was literally running for his life this season , his offensive line is healthy that means a lot , he said last year , in certain situations , i 'd drop back and i was n't worried about what the defensive secondary was doing i was more worried about the line rushing and seeing which way i was scrambling as a quarterback , you ca n't be doing that you have to have confidence in the line and be able to look down field and do what you do best and make things happen not only do the jets have to be concerned about george , but now they have to worry about the colt defense , which has improved with the acquisition of two firstround picks , tackle steve emtman and linebacker quentin coryatt and linebacker chip banks has six sacks , third in the american conference who s down and out \? colts coach ted marchibroda , who was buffalo s offensive coordinator last season , does n't look at the jets as a team that s down and out we know the jets are an excellent football team , marchibroda said they 're a playoff team they 're the type of football team to make a great comeback at this point , they 're not doing as well as what they had hoped but the season is n't over as far as they 're concerned if they ca n't beat the colts today , it might as well be
berlin , dec 5 at a cramped social worker s office in the gritty marzahn neighborhood of eastern berlin , a young vietnamese man heard the bad news your permit to live here expires at the end of this month , an interpreter told him after examining his passport one recent afternoon unless something changes , you 're going to have to go back home scenes like that are familiar in marzahn , which is home to several thousand vietnamese who came to east germany as contract laborers they fear they will soon become the first ethnic group to be systematically deported from united germany it is the greatest fear of our people , said van son vu , organizer of an advocacy group for vietnamese we have lived through great changes here , and we do n't fit in vietnam any more the poverty and unemployment there is terrible we have made a place for ourselves here , we are happy here , and we want to stay victims of german mobs germany is enduring a wave of violence against foreigners , and many of the perpetrators argue that too many foreigners have been allowed to enter the country politicians have endorsed their call for tighter immigration laws and for the expulsion of some foreigners who already live here the vietnamese want to stay in germany despite attacks that some of them have suffered several have been harassed on streets , and earlier this year one was attacked by a gang of skinheads in marzahn and stabbed to death vietnamese were also among the victims of a major disturbance in the baltic port of rostock in august they lived in hostels that were surrounded for two days by rockthrowing youths and jeering citizens downstairs apartments were set afire , but there were no serious injuries some critics of the planned deportation say it will mark a seeming victory for those who have committed or supported acts of violence against foreigners ease of expelling foreigners many of these kids are going to say , 'now the government is doing with police what i was trying to do with rocks , ' barbara john , berlin s official advocate for foreigners , said , adding that the deportation would result in human tragedies germany has already announced plans to deport members of one other ethnic group , romanian gypsies but as was widely said when the announcement was made in september , few if any have actually been deported those afraid they would be apprehended have moved to other parts of germany or traveled to other countries but expelling vietnamese from germany is likely to be easier than expelling gypsies gypsies live close to germany and can come and go almost at will across porous borders vietnamese are easier to identify physically , and once sent home they are unlikely to return nearly all the vietnamese now in germany came here during the late 1980 s under labor contracts between the east german and vietnamese governments the first and largest group came in 1987 , carrying visas valid until the end of 1992 most were assigned to work in heavy industries , often in jobs not attractive to germans peculiar visa status when east germany ceased to exist two years ago , about 60 , 000 vietnamese citizens were living here most lost their jobs soon after unification , when the factories where they worked shut down many vietnamese are now surviving on unemployment payments others are engaged in textile trading , which is legal , and cigarette smuggling , which is illegal but tolerated vietnamese vendors cluster around many train and subway stations in eastern berlin , offering clothes and cutrate cigarettes as a result of their peculiar visa status , the vietnamese are not permitted to receive bank credit , rent commercial property or start businesses even those who have applied to run fastfood stands have been turned down last year , the government offered a free plane ticket and a cash payment of 2 , 000 to any vietnamese who would leave voluntarily nearly 50 , 000 accepted the offer before it expired the estimated 12 , 000 who turned it down are determined to remain here as long as possible state government vote there are millions of foreigners living legally in germany because the west german government gave them special status as guest workers , said nguyen ha , a translator who lives in marzahn we have been here for five years , paying taxes and contributing to the economy under west german law , we would have been entitled to stay we 're only asking to be treated like guest workers in the west responding to the pleas of vietnamese and their supporters , the governments of two eastern states have appealed to the upper house of germany s parliament to prevent the deportations the upper house represents state governments , and interior minister rudolf seiters has said he will stop the deportations if all five eastern states , together with a majority of those in the west , ask him to do so a vote is scheduled for dec 18 the eastern state of mecklenburgwestern pomerania is determined that the deportations proceed mecklenburgwestern pomerania is the state in which rostock is situated , and about 900 vietnamese still live there in hostels that were attacked in august in a position paper , the state government asserted that many people have already lost their tolerance for current policies toward foreigners and asylumseekers adapted to german style the economic and social difficulties in vietnam are not a legally relevant argument , the paper says lothar kupfer , the interior minister in mecklenburgwestern pomerania , has become the leading advocate of deportation for vietnamese citizens we have to decide as a society whether we want an unlimited number of foreigners in germany or if we want to reduce the number , mr kupfer said in an interview if that s what we want , then in specific cases we have to carry through with the deportation of asylumseekers or contract workers unlike some other groups of foreigners in germany , the vietnamese have proven able to adapt to the german style of life specialists here describe them as quiet , hardworking , respectful and anxious to assimilate they 're always polite and friendly , said the manager of a small bakery in marzahn most people here do n't have anything against them if they want to stay in germany , it s fine with me fear of return to hanoi chancellor helmut kohl s chief adviser on matters relating to foreigners , cornelia schmalzjacobsen , supports the vietnamese in their campaign to remain in germany but the chancellor often acts against her advice mrs schmalzjacobsen said we are talking about quite a small number of people who could be given the right to stay without much problem i'm afraid their chances are not good not enough voices are being raised on their behalf vietnamese in germany say their years here have changed them , and that they no longer want to live in their impoverished , repressive homeland they fear they will be ostracized from society , victimized by robbers and perhaps harassed or arrested by government agents the german and vietnamese governments have negotiated an accord under which germany will pay a sum to vietnam to support resettlement of returning laborers in return , vietnam pledges not to persecute them but vietnam has not ratified the agreement , and diplomats say the sum of money germany wants to donate has shrunk to less that half of the 20 million that was being discussed in the foreign ministry a few months ago the government has begun sending letters to as many as 8 , 000 vietnamese telling them that as of dec 31 , they are ausreisepflichtig that is , required to leave the country those who do not leave , the letters warn , will be subject to deportation none of these people will leave volutarily , said

there s a stiff tax on parking in new york city garages and parking lots in manhattan , daily parkers pay 18 1 4 percent the tax yields roughly 100 million a year , but could yield at least 30 million more if unscrupulous operators were n't skimming the tax into their own pockets the state senate and assembly have passed bills to snare evaders the senate approved a strong bill unanimously by the time the assembly acted last month , hostile garage owners had weakened it but either bill would be better than none the big problem with collecting the tax on daily parking is that it s all cash , easily concealed from nosy auditors state inspectors already make spot checks by appointment , to see if the garages and lots are actually handling as few cars as some report forewarned , the cheaters can arrange to be only half full when the state inspector comes both bills would authorize inspection without notice both would also require consecutively numbered receipts for cars as they came in , as another check on volume the weaker assembly bill , however , restricts the state s broader authority to collect whatever taxes may be owed for example , it prohibits the tax department from using parking tax information to check on a garage or lot operator s income tax payments the initiative for these bills came from the head of a parking chain , who figured his garages have 6 percent of new york s parking spaces but pay 9 percent of the tax , which made it clear that some others were pocketing taxes they took from customers that s inexcusable and illegal
in moscow a writer of renown , visiting from the united states , asked some questions , of himself and about 50 russians , other europeans and americans listening to him it was a full month later before i understood that they were among the most important questions human could ask of human i understood it in new york , when i read that four young white men had squirted white paint on two black children i asked myself what made these men so ugly of soul as to do this thing \? i believed that what was in these men in the bronx was in serbs and croats killing each other in yugoslavia , sikhs slaughtering hindus on a train in the punjab , africans murdering africans by bullet and starvation , youngsters killing an australian in brooklyn because he was a jew hatred but where does this kind of hatred come from \? most humans neither kill nor befoul others yet we live in a world where millions do these things to one another whatever is in them that they act so shapes the world and our lives , sometimes our deaths then i remembered what elie wiesel asked in moscow , in questions like these what is hatred and how is one to define its parameters \? where does it begin and how does one know it before the knife is raised what are its symptoms \? are they envy , or ambition or thirst for power , lust for domination or religious blindness \? was king solomon right to declare in ecclesiastes that there is a time for love and a time to hate \? when \? and why is hate so powerful \? how can it mobilize more energies than love \? why is there a common language among haters , and none among those who must know they will be the victims \? is hate inevitable and must one hate evil to remain good \? at the conference on hatred in moscow called by mr wiesel , few people aside from dr john silber , the chewyminded president of boston university , even attempted to answer the questions mostly they talked about the results of hatred in europe at the moment ethnic massacres , antisemitism , national boundary and blood feuds my own head is capable of only a few clear thoughts about a human condition that drives those in whom it resides to kill a neighbor or attack a child for color of skin there is justifiable hatred as there is justifiable war for the respect of god and for the sake of human sanity there is difference , a chasm , between the emotion instilled by intolerable oppression the slave for the owner in earlier centuries , the victim of religious , racial or political pogrom in our own and the hatred taught for the purpose of creating victims or achieving power perhaps it would help if we used different words to distinguish between them using detestation for the former and saving hatred for the latter because they hate , we detest them because they hate and because they teach hatred no child was born with a desire to kill another , or make his body bleed , or his young heart hatred is taught in many ways openly , as do saddam hussein , the kkk and louis farrakhan through paranoia , as do whites who talk of blacks getting too much or those ugly mouths at city college who said the stampede that killed nine people was a racist plot or through massive insult blacks are inherently crimeprone , poles are stupid , irish dirty , asians sneaky , only jews beat the drums for the gulf war why is hate so powerful , more so than goodness \? maybe it is n't , always i tell you this after they are arrested i will never remember the names of the men who sprayed those children but i will always remember the name of the children s mother , because she fended off political hustlers who wanted to exploit their pain nellie wilson and the world will remember the names of some of the survivors of the gulag after it forgets who came after leonid brezhnev the names of the torturers at auschwitz have been erased from man s memory but some of the prisoners who stared out at them and mankind in disbelief that it could be happening are not only remembered but honored by the entire world one of them asked those questions in moscow still disbelieving but still searching i never expected to end this even on a mildly hopeful note but that is where the answers to the questions take me assuming we keep detesting the haters

for general motors , yesterday wound up the sales pitch of a lifetime its short video presentation , which it displayed around the country , was a smooth one freshfaced adolescents and barebottomed babies grinned from the seats of gm cars happy customers breezed by in their cadillacs and chevrolets but this time the world s largest auto maker was not selling cars and trucks , it was selling itself , in the form of the largest stock offering by an american company later this week , gm plans to sell up to 575 million new shares of its common stock to raise 229 billion the money will dress up gm s battered balance sheet and pay for everything from newcar development to new tools and equipment in terms of size , the nextranked such deal by an american institution was done by conrail , the freight railroad , which raised 146 billion by selling stock in 1987 there has n't been anything this important in a long time , said robert h stovall , chairman of stovall twentyfirst advisers , a money management firm , and a longtime gm watcher this could set all kinds of records in terms of numbers of individual investors buying it s a major event in the distribution of stock it is also the monster that dominates wall street almost every brokerage house in the country is trying to sell part of the offering , partly because the market is ripe for a stock sale of an icon of corporate america but more significant is the fees compared with the megafees booked from mergers in the 1980 s , the gm underwriting fees may look modest but if the sale is a complete success nearly everyone predicts it will be wall street s estimated cut will be anywhere from 69 million to 115 million offerings like this have fatter profit margins for brokers , providing a big incentive to sell the new shares and best of all for investors , gm effectively pays the sales commission not the customer since it announced its stock offering late last month , three teams of executives have hopscotched around the world to 17 cities , meeting with investment managers to pitch the stock and gm s plan to nurse itself back to health after a record 45 billion loss last year in fact , two of gm s private airplanes have been in constant use to help transport the wellrehearsed management team of 10 , and their morgan stanley company investment bankers , from london to hong kong to minneapolis to new york translators have rattled off the minutiae of earnings per share and carplatform renovations in english , japanese and french more than 500 institutional salespeople at morgan stanley , which is leading the stocksale effort , have called up investors around the world to pull a crowd to the roadshow sessions , which ended yesterday with stops in baltimore and philadelphia in the end , though , the welllaid plans could be undone by the market s unpredictable cruelty it would screw them up if the market tanked from here , said michael murphy , editor of the overpriced stock service , an investment newsletter they could still get the deal done , but odds are they would n't want to so far , the stock market has been awaiting gm with open arms the more cynical of analysts say they wish the auto maker could run its businesses as brilliantly as it has timed its stock offering , which stands to capitalize on the current market euphoria indeed , the dow jones industrial average , of which gm is a component , has set a string of records in 1992 gm shares , which closed yesterday at 39375 on the new york stock exchange , up 125 cents each , have risen 36 percent this year the rising market gave gm a comparatively less expensive means of raising money , rather than borrowing it from banks or selling bonds gm may be savvy to exploit a market of willing investors , but it did not expect them to clamor for its shares without instituting radical changes analysts have little doubt that much of the corporate dressingup of recent months plans to eliminate 74 , 000 jobs , close a score of plants and realign top management was in preparation for the offering the status quo was just not enough , said tom galvin , an auto analyst at c j lawrence the preparations actually began three months ago when a team of gm and morgan stanley executives visited analysts at the powerful agencies that rate corporate debt the ratings agencies' displeasure with gm has been no secret only a month before the stock offering was announced , the standard poor s corporation downgraded gm s senior debt to a , from a companies perceived as high risks by ratings agenies pay higher interest rates for shortterm borrowings a number of securities analysts believe the ratings agencies played the largest role of all in determining just how much stock gm needed to sell to bolster its capital base and its spnding plans neither the analysts , gm nor morgan stanley would publicly discuss that or other matters surrounding the offering because securities and exchange commission rules restrict companies from promoting their stock before the price of the shares is set , which could happen as early as tonight
in what officials say is the correction department s largest disciplinary crackdown , 21 new york city jail supervisors and guards have been or will be charged with falsifying records to conceal violations in providing housing and medical care for new inmates but union representatives for the accused officers said they were being made scapegoats for carrying out the orders of higher officials , who are escaping punishment officials in the department , the agency that runs the city s jail system , disclosed yesterday that administrative charges had been filed in the last two weeks against 10 supervisors and officers and that 11 others would be accused soon the charges , the officials said , stem from findings released last month by city investigators that departmental employees , apparently in an effort to circumvent a court order , had falsified or made errors in the records of about 650 inmates the order required that each new inmate be assigned a bed and given a medical examination within 24 hours of being taken into the department s custody or be paid a 150 fine because the department violated the order , officials said the city would pay fines totaling 8 , 400 to 56 inmates who were not given beds quickly enough last year , the department paid the 150 fine to 36 inmates who were without beds for more than 24 hours , a total of 5 , 400 robert daly , the department s general counsel , said that those being accused include two assistant deputy wardens , the department s highestranking position filled through civilservice merit tests six captains , the second highest civilservice rank , and 13 correction officers will also face disciplinary hearings , mr daly said this was a coverup , mr daly said you ca n't knowingly disobey a court order acting on complaints that some prisoners were kept for days in holding pens without beds or toilets , judge morris e lasker of federal district court in manhattan ordered the 24hour limit in 1989 and set the fine for noncompliance in 1990 dismissals possible mr daly declined to identify the supervisors and officers who have been or who will be charged , saying that he was prohibited by city regulations from doing so until the completion of the departmental hearings if the charges are upheld , the accused officers and supervisors would be subject to penalties ranging from reprimands to dismissal officials of the unions representing correction captains and officers said their members were being victimized for obeying orders and policies initiated by top officials in the department peter meringolo , the president of the correction officers captains association , and stan israel , a vice president of the correction officers benevolent association , said that they would not identify the higherranking officials until hearings are conducted mr israel said some officers had rejected the departmental equivalent of plea bargains he said the officers were unaware that they had done anything improper because they were unfamiliar with the specifics of judge lasker s order the officers rely on their bosses to give them lawful orders through the chain of command , mr israel said thomas m antenen , a correction department spokesman , said that the only appointed official who had been penalized and demoted as a consequence of the falsification inquiry was hector l eugui , who as deputy chief for facility operations oversaw the placement of new inmates mr eugui was suspended without pay for two weeks last month and transferred to the post of warden of the brooklyn house of detention for men 'investigation is still open' mr antenen said mr eugui s transfer was considered a demotion in rank , although he would retain his salary of 88 , 940 a year asked if any other highranking officials would be disciplined , mr antenen said , the investigation is still open allyn r sielaff , who resigned as correction commissioner last december , was the head of the department when the violations occurred , between jan 1 , 1991 , and march 17 , 1991 catherine m abate , who became the head of the agency on april 20 , said yesterday that she had warned all staff members to comply fully with regulatory mandates the department will not tolerate falsification of records , she said in a report on april 2 , the investigation department said that all of the falsifications involved new inmates at the manhattan detention complex , which is known as the tombs , and in adjacent manhattan supreme and criminal court parts in lower manhattan new inmates in manhattan who are held without bail or who are unable to raise bail are kept in the manhattan while their paperwork is processed and they undergo medical examinations then they are transferred to city jails alterations and errors the investigation department said that the records of 85 of 2 , 686 inmates were altered and that there were significant errors in the records of 571 other inmates based on its findings , the investigation department recommended that disciplinary charges be brought against mr eugui assistant deputy warden richard bartha five captains frank fernandez , billy bowden , james watkins , salvatore rizzo and gustavo argueta , and an unspecified number of officers none of the supervisors cited in the report returned telephone calls yesterday but captain meringolo of the captains association said the captains cited in the report were believed to be the ones who would be charged
pristina , yugoslavia , june 19 this is where it all started and i guess this is where it will have to end , said veton surroi , one of many politicians here who are seeking to wrest this overwhelmingly albanianpopulated region called kosovo from serbian domination and control how it ends is a matter of anxious doubt whether in peaceful negotiations and international conferences as the local albanians are hoping , or with the kind of violent ethnic warfare that has dismembered yugoslavia and engulfs much of its territory if the latter , a conflict over kosovo might run a greater risk of becoming internationalized than the fighting in nearby bosnia and herzegovina , since whatever happens here will have repercussions in albania , bulgaria , turkey and greece it was here 11 years ago that the wave of serbian nationalism now asserting itself in the balkans first surged , as belgrade sought to crush the movement of albanians seeking selfdetermination in an area that serbs revere as the cradle of their nationhood but the yearnings of kosovo s two million ethnic albanians have only grown louder and more insistent , despite the imposition two years ago of a state of emergency and direct rule by belgrade patient waiting advised so far , the struggle between the serbs and kosovo s albanians has not involved armed conflict instead , it has been characterized by deliberate repression and nonviolent resistance through their policies , the serbian authorities have denied the albanians livelihoods , education , medical attention , news organs and political rights in response , the albanians have waited , relying on community organizing , international diplomacy and the highest birth rate in europe they have built up their own institutions , from schools to clinics to an unofficial parliament chosen last month in balloting conducted in private homes we know that if we wait patiently , we will win , said ibrahim rugova , the man elected as kosovo s president in the may 24 vote he is a gaunt and asceticlooking man of 47 who studied literary criticism at the sorbonne now he spends his days in the small house of the albanian writers' union , behind the soccer stadium we have no army , of course , or post office , and we exist on the charity of our people , he said but there is no doubt that we have moral and political power de facto , we are in power , and we must be invited as the legitimate representatives of kosovo to any international conference on yugoslavia mr rugova said that what the albanians wanted was independence , adding that they might decide to join with neighboring albania but that this could only be done through democratic means like a referendum albania too poor to help there have been occasional attacks on serbs reported here in the last few years , but the albanian leaders all contend that anything beyond passive resistance would be madness and they constantly warn against any deed that could serve as a pretext for greater serbian repression we are unarmed and the serbs have planes and bombs , said shkelzen maliqi , the leader of a social democratic faction he said that early in the movement some people had hopes that they might gain the armed backing of the albanian government in tirana , but added that this was before people in kosovo had been able to visit albania now , he said , everybody knows that they are so poor and weak and that they cannot help us , that someday probably we will have to help them mr rugova made it clear that he believed that the belgrade government could unleash new attacks on kosovo s albanians , regardless of the pressure of the united nations sanctions now imposed on the rump yugoslavia including kosovo over the serbian leadership s role in the fighting in bosnia and herzegovina what has happened in bosnia has had a positive effect , he said , since it has made the international community aware of the kind of authorities that exist in belgrade but the tragedy is that the conflict could spread here and we have no means of defending ourselves from its beginnings in 1981 , the confrontation here has pitted albanian demographics against the weight of serbian history and serbian nationalism the albanians , mostly muslims , represent 90 percent of the population in kosovo and the rate of their natural increase can be seen in the swarms of youngsters playing in every courtyard and alley of this labyrinthine city of 250 , 000 every albanian here believes that sooner or later albanians will have to become masters of their own house the serbs , a small minority here but at 10 million the largest group within old yugoslavia , consider kosovo to be eternally serbian for them it is revered , bloodsoaked soil where serbia s nationhood was forged in 1389 , when turkish armies defeated serbian forces on the kosovo plain , ushering in five centuries of muslim ottoman domination and christian orthodox serbian resistance unlike the breaking away of croats , slovenes , bosnians and macedonians from yugoslavia , the separatism of the albanians involves land within serbia , and it is not hard to find people in belgrade , even critics of government policy , who say they would fight for kosovo today , or send their children to fight for it
new haven it has been just over a year since a large white van began lumbering into some of the poorest sections of this city , offering free medical care to pregnant women who seldom see a doctor except on television and who see far more of their babies die than other american women with a death rate of 202 per 1 , 000 births , new haven has the highest infant mortality rate of any city in the nation , according to the most recent calculations by the children s defense fund , based on 1987 statistics new haven s rate is twice that of the nation as a whole the philosophy behind the van , operated by st raphael s hospital here , is that infant mortality can be reduced by making prenatal care more convenient a report by the american medical association last month reached a similar conclusion , arguing that infant mortality appears to be related to difficulty in obtaining prenatal and infant care so far , the van seems to be making a difference a year free of deaths of the 33 children born to women who received prenatal care from the van in the last year , none have died and not one had to be admitted to the intensive care unit , according to hospital records about a third of the mothers were drug or alcohol abusers , and most made six to eight visits for checkups during their pregnancies far more than is usual for the areas where they live , far from new haven s cluster of public and private hospitals in the southwest corner of the city it s probably the best stopgap measure , said joseph liu , a senior associate for health policy with the children s defense fund in washington but what the communities really need is enough doctors and nurses to serve everybody and insurance and social services for everyone mobile medical clinics have been effective elsewhere one of the best known is sponsored by the singer paul simon and visits new york city s welfare hotels to provide care to homeless children vans for prenatal care are more recent st raphael s believes its van is the first with such a focus new haven , with a population of 130 , 000 and perhaps best known as the home of yale university , is one of the poorest cities in the nation , based on the number of people with incomes below the poverty level and the van regularly visits eight of the city s poorest neighborhoods all are like dixwell , a place dominated by publichousing complexes and drug peddlers in dixwell , according to statistics provided by st rapahel s , the infant mortality rate is one of the highest in new haven about 23 of every 1 , 000 babies born here die in their first year of life tests for a teenager melissa rumley grew up in dixwell her mother brought the stickthin 16yearold to the van earlier this month on a hunch that the girl might be pregnant after a round of tests , interviews and examinations , melissa learned that she could expect to have a baby sometime around the middle of july i did n't really want one yet , but this one came , said melissa , who said she and her boyfriend used condoms regularly but had an accident with one it popped , she explained when he told me it popped , i just laughed at him the next thing i knew i was getting sick all the time lisa collison , the physician s assistant who examined melissa , referred her to a clinic for teenagers that st raphael s runs she also suggested that melissa transfer to a high school in new haven that caters to pregnant students ms collison tried to help melissa hear the fetus s heartbeat through a stethoscope there is no obstetrician on the van , but doctors can be summoned if necessary no abortions are arranged on the van , and forms of birth control like condoms and the pill are not discussed because st raphael s is a roman catholic hospital , employees are required to abide by the teachings of the church , which opposes abortion and all forms of birth control apart from natural family planning , a system that calls for abstaining from sex during ovulation women who want abortions go elsewhere , said sister cornelia coughlin , a counselor on the van who helps people sign up for benefits they are entitled to but often have no idea how to obtain if they ask , we say we 're a catholic hospital , she said we do not counsel for abortions 10 get no care melissa sought medical help much earlier in her pregnancy than most people in dixwell generally they receive no care no weighing , no tests for glucose tolerance , possible birth defects or the virus that causes aids , no nutrition advice until the second trimester , and about 10 percent get none before being taken to the hospital in labor they are impeded by complicated bus routes between their neighborhood and the downtown hospitals , said dr wilfred reguero , the chief of obstetrics and gynecology at st raphael s , who dreamed up the van , christened project mothercare if they wo n't come to you , and you want to change the death rate , dr reguero said , you got to go find them staff members knock on doors , chat with neighbors and track down patients who do not return for checkups in the beginning , he said , some people avoided the van , thinking it was a bloodmobile others came asking for food , which the van does not carry though the van is dedicated to helping pregnant women , the staff treats people with a variety of major and minor health problems the staff treated about 1 , 500 people over the last year , and for every pregnant woman , about 14 other people were treated one man had an infected thumb another woman had been suffering with a ruptured gall bladder for two days about 200 people have been treated with acupuncture , dr reguero said , to curb their cravings for drugs or alcohol the hospital spent about 500 , 000 to buy and equip the van , a 48foot tractortrailer with two examining rooms and three offices where tests are taken and counselors advise on nutrition and social programs the van costs 500 , 000 a year to run , paid for by the hospital dr reguero said he could use a second van to cope with demand for other kinds of services , such as screening for cancer everyone working on the van is an experienced professional , he added i have purposely kept the residents and students out , he said , because the people do n't want to feel like they 're guinea pigs this year , the van will add a pediatrician and a perinatologist , who specializes in highrisk pregnancies is it the future of health care \? i hope not , dr reguero said but he added , it s what we have to do now photos robin illing , a nutritionist with project mothercare , which operates out of a van to provide free medical care to pregnant women in some of the poorest sections of new haven , conn , offering counsel to shawyn witherspoon , who visited the van with her children melissa

where does the movie begin and reality end \? while she was in huntington hospital on a suicide watch , amy fisher was meeting with a screenwriter that was acceptable , a film executive said , because the screenwriter has a background in mental health alternately confessing one s deepest thoughts to a psychiatrist and a movie maker could make for interesting drama , but it is not a scene you will see in the amy fisher television movie at least not the nbctv movie being made with klm , a long island production company that bought miss fisher s story rights for 80 , 000 worth of bail money but two other fisher movies are in production , as well for the first time that television executives can remember , nbc , abctv and cbstv are all making movies on the same subject , simultaneously there have been plenty of twos , said deborah service , vice president of the tv movies and minis division at tristar but this is the first three that i know of cbs and tristar will tell the story of mary jo and joseph buttafuoco miss fisher says she shot mrs buttafuoco after an affair with her husband and after he had introduced the teenager to the world of prostitution ms service said the buttafuocos were paid in the ballpark of 200 , 000 to 300 , 000 for their story rights in keeping with the soapoperalike story , a former soapopera actress will portray mrs buttafuoco for cbs the actress , phyllis lyons , who appeared in all my children journeyed to massapequa last week to spend some time with her character mrs buttafuoco willingly became a movie character because of soaring medical bills , her lawyer , michael rindenow of east meadow , said the motives of other story sellers remain less clear paul makely was miss fisher s confidant , at least until he secretly videotaped her and sold the tape to television miss fisher subsequently attempted suicide mr makely wound up selling his story rights to nbctv so did stephen sleeman , who said miss fisher had tried to recruit him as an accomplice , and maria eftimiades , a writer for people magazine running out of rights to buy , abctv bought the consulting expertise of amy pagnozzi , a columnist for the new york post , who wrote about what her newspaper and others called the long island lolita ms pagnozzi will also be portrayed in the movie it s hard to find anyone not being portrayed in a movie last week , as long island bid goodbye to the amy fisher story , hollywood said hello in a courthouse in mineola , the young woman from merrick was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison for shooting mrs buttafuoco in the first christian church in santa monica , calif , the courthouse was being reproduced , and an actress , alyssa milano , as amy , was charged with the crime in canada , amy no 2 , drew barrymore , and amy no 3 , noelle parker , were also busy filming the race is on to bring the fisher story to television amy s story is very commercial , said dr phillip i levitan of smithtown , the l in klm productions it s what the networks want unfortunately this is the type of material the public wants to see dr levitan , a surgeon turned successful producer , bought amy s story , he said , not because we believed her or anything like that , but because this story has gotten the most publicity of any event next to the persian gulf war it s a wonderful story , ms service said it s the story of your nextdoor neighbor and , 'there but for the grace of god go i' tristar bought the buttafuocos' version , ms service said , because that s our interest we wanted it from the victim s standpoint , she added mary jo is a victim regardless of what joey might have done , he certainly did n't want mary jo to die and he denies he had a relationship with amy so what are they going to call their movie \? dr levitan asked i had pizza with amy fisher \? cbstristar is calling its film casualty of love , mrs buttafuoco being the casualty abc s is beyond control the amy fisher story , and the working title for the nbcklm movie is treachery in the suburbs with 18 to 21 days of shooting needed , the three networks are looking at broadcast dates next month it s mind boggling , is n't it \?

to the editor your article on the new york winners of the westinghouse science competition fails to mention its dark side the intensive pressure , sometimes cruelly unhealthy , on the contestants and especially on the 40 finalists \( education page , jan 29 \) as a highschool senior working on a project for the contest two years ago , i experienced a lot of pressure from teachers , fellow science students and not least myself part of it was due to the fact that i was applying to prestigious colleges and saw the contest as a boost to my chances of getting into any one of them while i enjoyed my project and became a semifinalist , sometimes i got so distressed i wanted to tear up my paper and quit science forever since then i have heard that my experience was one of the better ones needless to say , those who work hard but end up winning nothing are very disappointed but even some in the winners' circle have trouble dealing with their success and the high expectations of parents and others for example , one of the winners two years ago reportedly had a nervous breakdown and attempted suicide a friend of mine who was a finalist told me of another finalist who got pregnant in college and is now in jail many other finalists , he said , also showed signs of stress i was also told that one of the judges at the final interviews is a psychiatrist , who presumably makes sure that none of the winners have any psychological problems scientists work best when given the freedom to conduct research in their own way and the chance to use their imagination too much external pressure will only force them to quit science or resort to unethical means to achieve success yes , five westinghouse winners have become nobel laureates , but who s ever bothered to find out how many fumbled on their way to fame \? haibin jiu cambridge , mass , feb 1 , 1992
east rutherford , nj , april 23 the shot was an afterthought claude vilgrain , the devils left wing , wound up along the right boards early in the second period , firing an unscreened slap shot in the general direction of the ranger net no real threat intended back in november or december , before a torn thigh muscle and a mended labor rift interrupted his season , such a sling would not have caused a single bead of sweat on the masked brow of ranger goaltender mike richter now , however , events and angles had conspired against him richter , rusty from disuse and already shaken by two firstperiod goals , kicked out his leg vilgrain s shot bounced backward off richter s stick , over the line the rangers were down by two goals , too far down they were on their way to a 31 loss to the devils in the third game of a patrick division semifinal series that finds them two defeats from an epic playoff embarrassment even by their historic standards 'it was a terrible goal' i lost sight of that shot , it was a terrible goal , richter said i look at that as very significant it was not much of a game to redeem yourself you ca n't let that happen to you in a playoff game vilgrain s goal was only one in a series of earlygame problems tonight for richter , who was beaten by three of the devils' first seven shots and heard little but sarcastic cheers after that richter faced only 18 shots all night and appeared to settle down along the way but none of his chances would be as defining as vilgrain s lonely shot from the right side i had a couple good chances early , and i did n't answer them , richter said richter had been given this opportunity at winning back his starting playoff job from john vanbiesbrouck , and it had not happened he had hurt the ranger cause early chris terreri , in sharp contrast , turned aside one dangerous chance after another for the devils with silky efficiency terreri , with 34 saves , was the difference he was stealing the series the only place they really beat us , richter said , was in goal few shots but two goals richter looked shaky at the start , struggling with relatively easy puckhandling assignments and allowing two goals on just six shots on net by the devils in the first period stephane richer beat him low , between the pads , with a tough wrist shot at 8 minutes 50 seconds then richter failed to control a rebound on a shot by peter stastny that was knocked from midair into the goal by scott stevens the goal by stevens was reviewed for five minutes for possible interference or a high stick the replay only substantiated the score , showing richter tumbling backward into his own net chasing after stevens s deflection the decision to start richter tonight was expected , but a substantial gamble by coach roger neilson richter had played in just one game since the start of the national hockey league strike , and had lost his last three starts since march 24 unpleasant time in playoffs he also had limited , unpleasant experiences in the stanley cup playoffs after tonight s defeat , richter had played in six playoff games , five of them losses now , neilson figures to come back with vanbiesbrouck on saturday night vanbiesbrouck lost in game 2 tuesday night , 73 , but has a 911 mark in his last 11 the rangers clearly need a major breakthrough against terreri , or they will face another long summer we have to do everything better , mark messier said everything obviously , this is going to be a huge game for us photo devils' bill guerin checking rangers' mark hardy into the net last night during their patrick division semifinal series \( barton silverman the new york times \)
atlanta , oct 15 begin at the beginning the mind , though , rebels there is too much wonder , too great an appreciation of hurt , too many tangled themes of strategy and coincidence and heartbreak it was an inning for the ages the braves , trailing by 20 , scored three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning wednesday night to defeat the pirates in game 7 of the national league championship series so much for the facts how could jose lind have misplayed that grounder \? how could bobby cox not have sent in a man to pinchrun for sid bream \? what was the plate umpire , randy marsh , watching on that 31 stan belinda pitch to damon berryhill \? and who the heck is francisco cabrera \? doug drabek , eight innings into what seemed destined to be an immortalizing pitching performance , faced terry pendleton to start the ninth drabek had escaped a basesloaded , noneout predicament in the sixth , he had struck out deion sanders to start the eighth and jeff blauser to end it there appeared an aura about the righthander and a preordained aspect to his night pendleton starts rally pendleton was n't any more flushed with optimism the third baseman and candidate to repeat as the national league s most valuable player brought a 231 playoff average into the game and was 0 for 3 but pendleton hooked a screaming shot toward the corner in right , where cecil espy , inserted for lloyd mcclendon , allowed indecision to rule and a double to tumble barely inside the foul line drabek , pitching for the second straight outing on three days' rest , had thrown more than 120 pitches if manager jim leyland had a quality closer in his bullpen , drabek in all likelihood would not have thrown another pitch leyland never moved drabek never hesitated and then everyone made the same mental calculation the moment david justice beat a drabek pitch into the ground and toward second base routine out , man on third , two to go lind , the second baseman , regarded by his peers as an unparalleled fielder at his position , came up empty and the inning was instantly overloaded with promise and dread drabek was done , his final pitches to bream driven more by fear than purpose bream walked to fill the bases he was trying so hard , leyland said of drabek but he had lost it enter belinda the 51 , 975 fans at atlantafulton county stadium were now losing it , the upper decks certifiably shaking the police horses were moved into place outside the outfield wall leyland took the baseball from drabek , and all of pittsburgh took a breath as he was forced to make a choice out of his suspect bullpen in came stan belinda , the righthander who had blown six of his 24 save chances in 1992 and who , as the unofficial closer for an undistinguished corps , had yielded eight lateinning home runs ron gant , the first man belinda faced , missed increasing the reliever s total to nine by perhaps 24 inches , his shot to left expiring short of the fence and in barry bonds s glove the out , though , produced a run belinda next faced berryhill , the catcher who had hit 167 in the series the count went to 31 john mcsherry , who began the game behind the plate , had become ill and was in the hospital randy marsh , his replacement , had replaced mcsherry and reoutlined the strike zone belinda s 31 slider appeared to get the inside of the plate but marsh s right hand never budged from his side ball four and the bases were loaded brian hunter was asked by atlanta manager bobby cox to be a hero , but belinda extinguished him on a popup to lind , the braves were frozen on the bases and the pirates were one out from redemption cox then gave the nod to cabrera to bat for the braves' fifth pitcher of the night , jeff reardon a thousand subplots remained cox , in a baffling move , chose not to send pitcher tom glavine in to run for the slowfooted bream at second unanswered , too , was who would play where in the field for braves if they scored the tying run cox s bench was empty , his middle infielders history setting the fates in motion cabrera , a thirdstring catcherfirst baseman with a lucidity and patience that seemed unreal , dug in for his second atbat of the series and only his 12th in the major leagues in 1992 the count went to 20 , but cox did not order cabrera to take cabrera crushed the next belinda pitch on a line foul he swung hard again , and singled to left , setting the fates in motion , and in slow motion at that justice scored the tying run , and bream , his knee braces undergoing the most extreme product safety test imaginable , chugged for the plate justice exhorted bream to hit the ground marsh , at first base at the night s start , slid up the thirdbase line slightly to position himself for the play catcher mike lavalliere tossed aside his mask and braced himself for bream and against the possibility that his season was done bonds s throw began its flight as bream turned third everyone was now an amateur physicist , tracking speeds and arcs then there was chalk and dirt , said lavalliere , and legs and arms and a safe call the braves won bream never got up , stapled to the ground by exhaustion and joy , and then by a human mountain of teammates i do n't know how long i was under the pile , said bream how long can you hold your breath \?

if cute is supplanting conspicuous in 1990 s restaurant design , then the oversize doll house called fishin eddie is a thriving paradigm since this upper west side fish house opened last fall , the crush of customers makes those caribbean fish that travel in big schools look like insouciant individualists fishin eddie has more than a beguiling setting going for it the restaurant is owned by vincent orgera and ed schoenfeld , who also tapped a rich vein several years ago with the american restaurant vince and eddie s on west 68th street this piscatorial facsimile looks like the kind of place you would happen upon while driving to a vacation in maine it has a little bar up front with shaker pegs for coats , a partly exposed kitchen in the middle , and a neighborly back room with a skylight , a big iron chandelier , yellowgreen faux antique chairs , winsomely painted furniture and blackboards on the wall for daily specials like so many establishments that strike it big on their first day out of port , fishin eddie has been overwhelmed by success the wait for a table has usually been 10 or 15 minutes , which is not unreasonable yet one evening we encountered a fiasco we arrived promptly for a 7 30 reservation an abashed hostess told us there would be a little wait at 8 pm she started using the line that the table was being set at 8 15 she became apologetic , finally seating us at 8 30 pm \( our drinks were on the house \) it was hard to blame the goodnatured young waiters and waitresses for the vexsome kitchen delays between courses \( 30 minutes for appetizers 40 minutes for main courses \) they were simply overtaxed as for the food , it is generally good but not worth that kind of aggravation cod chowder with leeks and a light cream base was nicely seasoned , and grilled shrimp atop garlicky white beans were terrific fish island oysters are assertively briny and served well iced and a carpaccio of smoked tuna was delicate and sparkling fresh , if too thick brandade de morue , that provencal blend of shredded salt cod , potatoes , milk and garlic , had a bracing garlic essence but was too dry on one sampling a second time it was better with all the varied appetizers spread out on our table , we kept going back to the superb deepfried squid the batter was light and puffed , and the squid rings wonderfully tender clean frying also benefits the whalesize portion of frito misto that includes scallops , calamari , shrimp and monkfish the small , eclectic wine selection is intelligently chosen both for food pairings and price among whites , the 1990 trefethen riesling is a fine choice at 17 three fresh italian wines are under 20 , while a reliable 1990 sauvignon blanc from silverado is 18 reds are well priced , too , and many of these dishes would go well with the 1988 merlot from livio felluga at 22 , or the 1989 dolcetto d'alba rossana ceretto for 26 the extensive menu is supplemented by half a dozen daily specials one that can be recommended is the perfectly roasted halibut served over slivers of fennel and scallions with a ripe swath of tomato over the top swordfish with shellfish did not fare as well , for while it was well cooked , the pulpy and crude tomato sauce with mussels and clams was nondescript black bass , another special , arrived moist and flaky , set over sauteed leeks , sugar snap peas and shiitakes another recommendation is crisply sauteed salmon with a lemon butter sauce and mixed greens if you want to wrestle with a nearly twopound lobster , the one here is a touch chewy but flavorful not so the feckless linguine with seafood , which is towed out of the kitchen in a vessel that requires an extra wide berth at the table except for offtasting mussels , the ingredients were fresh , but the tomato sauce had not absorbed any of the seafood flavor , leaving the dish jarring lasagnette with lamb ragout also came in an astonishing portion it was hard to assess the lamb sauce because it was overpowered by grated cheese a better option is the cioppino , a melange of lobster , mussels , razor clams and assorted fish in a briny , dark red broth if you can think about dessert after this oceanic orgy , consider the pungent and thincrusted lemon tart or the equally good apple tart chocolate velvet cake is rich and moderately intense , while ice creams are sublimely smooth and pure fishin eddie is a handsome , welldesigned boat that , out of avarice or poor planning , takes on too many passengers for its cruises if they would just clear the deck a little , it could be much more

houston , nov 3 at a gloomy and sometimes angry postelection gathering tonight , it was left to president bush to sound a note of grace in defeat the people have spoken , and we respect the majesty of the democratic system , he said and i want the country to know that our entire administration will work closely with his team to insure a smooth transition of power mr bush said he had called presidentelect bill clinton to congratulate him and to pledge full cooperation in the transition a defiant gathering before the president made his concession speech , the mood had been ugly in the cozy ballroom festooned with balloons and bushquayle banners the younger party loyalists wore defiant buttons smile if you 've had an affair with bill clinton and i annoyed the media when the pack of photographers that precedes mr bush to his public appearances trooped into the room , the crowd erupted in the chant , no more press ! no more press ! but mr bush , who has bashed more than his share of journalists in recent days and said more than a few nasty things about mr clinton as well , would have none of it tonight the president paid tribute to two of his partners for the last four years , james a baker 3d , the white house chief of staff , and brent scowcroft , the national security adviser and for the first time in some weeks , he saluted his vice president , dan quayle , who mr bush said stood for what he believes in having acknowledged defeat , mr bush did not linger on it a quick tribute to his wife , barbara , a plea to young people not to abandon the electoral process , and he was gone watching the returns in indianapolis , mr quayle was equally accepting of defeat we must all pull together now , he said he is going to be president of the united states for the next four years if he runs the country as well as he ran his campaign , we 'll be all right before the president made it official , about 10 pm houston time , it was hard for many in the room to accept that mr bush had not just lost but had been thrashed in a game that the republicans had once ruled like the new york yankees at the posh suburban hotel where the president had hoped to hold a victory party , a certain amount of denial was not merely expected , but de rigueur the older members of the crowd , those who remembered the years before ronald reagan built what had once looked like a political dynasty , were more philosophical i do n't know if he really , truly wanted it another four years , mary gaston , a houston volunteer , said of mr bush at the same time , mr clinton is a sexy , charming man , she said the way he showed up on stage after his victory speech at the convention , well , he was so flamboyant , jumping around , singing but i think as far as turning the country around , he ca n't do it at 9 30 pm , when television networks had already projected that mr clinton had won about 250 of the 270 electoral votes he needed and that his victory was a certainty , robert a mosbacher , the bush campaign s onetime director , said , it s a tragedy if this country does not reelect this president and when cnn , visible on two huge television screens in the ballroom s far corners , declared mr clinton the winner about 9 50 pm , barely a person in the room looked up from his 4 drink to take note it was left to the president to inject a note of reality , and he started early leaving a private reception in his honor in late afternoon when the results of exit polls began seeping out to white house aides , mr bush was asked how he felt the man who on monday had so forcefully predicted a historic upset was blunt i 've been better , but we 'll see , he said it does n't look good i 've been happier tonight , before coming to the westin oaks hotel to concede , mr bush huddled at his hotel suite a few miles away with his family and some close aides , including mr baker , his best friend mr bush had relaxed all day he jogged two miles , voted at a local seminary gymnasium and then headed out to a nearby stripshopping center to buy a fishing reel , a 6 hunting license and some countrywestern and easylistening tapes at a chain store in line to vote this morning , the world s most powerful man , commander of invasions of panama and iraqiheld kuwait , chief executive of the world s largest economy , seemed goodnaturedly sheepish about his fate throwing up his hands , he told a woman standing in line with him , i do n't have anything else to do all day later , dressed in a blue blazer , slacks and a yellow polo shirt , mr bush came out of the oshman s sportinggoods store , unloaded his new bassfishing reel from its box , and made a casting motion with his arm earlier , a reporter asked him what he would do after tonight s celebration , when the votes were all counted and his final campaign speech was history go back home and figure it out , mr bush said photo president bush greeted james a baker 3d last night after conceding in front of supporters in houston with him was his wife , barbara \( reuters \)
bethlehem , pa , july 11 littleknown larry laoretti , seemingly immune to the chaos all around him , shot an impeccable 67 on his 53d birthday today to take the lead going into the final round of the united states senior open a host of wellknown players , led by the secondround leader , dave stockton , were seemingly playing a futile imitation of hockey on short putts on the saucon valley country club s everquickening greens but laoretti , sucking on a cigar as if it were a pacifier , cruised through the pressure to pass 12 players , none of whom were able to break par of 71 when everyone else s frustrating day was mercifully over , laoretti , a former club pro who never played on the pga tour and is without a victory in three seasons on the senior tour , was on top with a 54hole total of sixunderpar 207 , one shot ahead of al geiberger gibby gilbert , the winner of the last two senior tour events , was next at 209 after a 73 in which he made the same number of bogeys five that he had made in his previous 146 holes of competition at 210 is gary player , doggedly grinding for his third senior open title jim colbert and stockton , who lost his threeshot lead and his grip on the championship with a sixoverpar 77 i hated to let everyone back in the ball game , but tomorrow is going to be a better day , said stockton , who missed five putts under 4 feet and made nothing longer than a 3footer it s got to be it could n't have been worse stockton might have been speaking for several of the leading contenders , as it seemed that ineptitude was contagious today for example , the defending champion , jack nicklaus , who seemed to be positioned perfectly coming into the day , shot a sloppy 75 that featured poor iron play and uncertain short putting and left him six shots back at evenpar 213 lee trevino , who seemed to have been given new life by a cortisone shot in his left thumb , had a desultory 76 that put him nine shots behind the leader the high scoring could be attributed in good part to a more difficult course setup in which united states golf association officials moved the tees back a cumulative 75 yards and tucked several pins near precipitous slopes swirling winds also played havoc with approaches and made the severely undulating greens more difficult to hold and , especially , to putt today the course today started to play the way the usga wanted it to play , said geiberger , who finished one shot out of a playoff last year at oakland hills when he bogeyed the 72d hole consistency is what is going to pay off even though there is little in his background to suggest he is ready to win , laoretti has been consistent at saucon valley he has been in double digits in fairways and greens hit each day , and has only one threeputt in 54 holes he has also averaged four cigars , which he does n't inhale , a round the whole key is patience , not getting upset by mistakes , said laoretti , who has never led a senior event going into the last round that s kind of my nature anyway laoretti was born and reared in mahopac , ny , and after a stint in the navy in which he picked up his taste for golf and cigars , became an assistant professional on long island in 1960 after several club jobs in the northeast , florida and las vegas that had left him less than a rich man , laoretti qualified for the senior tour in 1989 with three secondplace finishes , laoretti has made a particularly good living in the last two years he won 371 , 097 to place 15th on the senior tour money list in 1991 , and has won 154 , 867 this year to rank 19th
bridgeport , conn , april 16 six months ago , the trustees of the university of bridgeport rejected an offer of aid from an affiliate of the unification church , saying they feared damage to the university s reputation and holding out hope that other aid might materialize , perhaps from the state when the trustees reversed themselves on wednesday and decided to pursue an affiliation with the unification church group , the professors world peace academy , one factor had changed there was no longer any hope of another rescuer several colleges and universities in connecticut were willing to take over bridgeport s programs and pay the university rent for use of its campus but none was willing to take on bridgeport s 22 million debt the trustees offered to give the university to the state , as long as the debt was guaranteed but the state , which was cutting the budgets of its public campuses , could not afford even the appearance of a bailout of a private university facing the alternatives of shutting down or reconsidering the world peace academy s offer , trustees were advised by their lawyers that they had an obligation , under the university s charter , to enter into serious negotiations 'a tragedy' it s a tragedy , the trustees' chairman , colin gunn , said today as he reviewed the series of dead ends that his board met as it sought a way both to save the university s programs and to satisfy creditors i 'll never understand this thing in the next few weeks trustees and the world peace academy hope to complete an agreement under which the academy will invest as much as 85 million , including up to 20 million the first year , and recruit as many as 1 , 000 students a year the immediate goal , both sides say , is to bring the university back to health , after two tumultuous years in which it courted and then broke a faculty strike , suffered national ridicule for discussing the unification church offer , announced the elimination of all liberalarts programs , acceded to the secession of its law school , and finally , this winter , voted to stop offering classes after aug 15 our desire is to affiliate with an existing university and help improve it , said gordon l anderson , the secretary general of the world peace academy maybe expand it , if we can , but the first thing is to get it back operating on solid ground the university must still regain accreditation by the new england association of schools and colleges , renew accreditation with the state board of governors for higher education and pass review by the state attorney general s office while the accrediting agencies will closely examine the remade board of trustees , officials of those agencies said that the unification church s involvement will not matter much more than that the congregational church founded harvard and yale the professors world peace academy , an organization that sponsors international conferences on peace issues and is 90 percent financed by the rev sun myung moon and the unification church , has offered the university written assurances that there will be no doctrinaire influence given those assurances , said paul windels , a partner in the manhattan law firm of windels , marks , davies ives , which advised the trustees , the compelling force here is a mandate to conduct an institution of higher learning in fairfield county it s our opinion that the trustees had an obligation to pursue that as far as they could mr gunn remains concerned that the image of the unification church , accused of being a religious cult that particularly preys on collegeage people , will hurt the university but he said many good works have been done by those seeking legitimacy the biggest thing we have going here is that they want to make this the finest university in the world , he said they know that the name of the unification church , or moonies , is a bad thing they want to get over that hurdle bridgeport s trustees have been accused of selling out , of settling for a financial solution , no matter the cost to academics some trustees were also concerned that if the campus simply shut down , unsecured creditors might sue them for 35 million they are owed the irony is that , of all the plans considered , only the world peace academy s had the goal of preserving the university of bridgeport other plans might have reduced it to a landlord , renting out its campus now , the city , which lost a succession of banks , hotels , stores and industries in the last couple of years , will not lose its educational namesake as many as 500 people will not lose their jobs the trustees , faculty and students must still make their peace with the unification church and those who were unable to help the university on its terms now will have to live with the deal the university was able to make for itself photo colin gunn , chairman of the trustees of the university of bridgeport , speaking to reporters on wednesday night after the trustees decided to pursue an affiliation with the professors world peace academy , which is connected with the unification church \( joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
the microsoft corporation has grown to be a billiondollar company without any significant success in the database market that could change suddenly now that this largest and most fearsome of software companies has proposed to acquire fox software inc , maker of the highly regarded foxpro data base manager for dos , macintosh and unix computers foxpro is a fast and flashy clone of dbase , the most popular data base management program among business users businesses use data base programs to store and retrieve information from employee records to sales reports to customer lists more important , they use dbase and foxpro as a programming language to develop custom business applications american companies have invested literally billions of dollars in developing dbase applications for their data since dbase appeared in 1981 in taking over fox , a privately owned company in perrysburg , ohio , microsoft is buying its way into the mainstream of this wellestablished data base developer community and finding another area in which it can go headtohead with borland international inc last year , borland entered the data base for programmers market by acquiring the ashtontate corporation , the original maker of dbase so suddenly , after a decade of relative calm , the pc data base world is going to be intensely active two of the world s biggest software companies are crossing swords , not only over dbase but over the next generation of data base programs and programming languages none of this has anything to do with technology , said adam green , editor of the bostonbased green letter , a publication for dbase , foxpro and other socalled xbase developers this deal is all about people and politics it s about users what they are going to do is fight over the dbase customer base it s also about money , of course borland and microsoft are developing new data base programs that are expected to reach the market this year borland will have paradox for windows , a data base for people who are not programmers , and dbase for windows , for people who know the dbase language microsoft will counter paradox with a windows product codenamed cirrus , and , for programmers , a windows version of foxpro at stake are the hearts and dollars of the programmers who will be developing business applications in the 1990 s data base programmers tend to make longterm commitments to a product , so each company wants these developers to make a commitment to its programs assuming the 173 million fox acquisition goes through this summer as planned , microsoft , of redmond , wash , will plug the last major gap in its business application software family it already has strong positions in spreadsheets , word processing , languages and , of course , the dos and windows operating systems microsoft has been developing its windows program for several years , but cirrus is not dbase compatible other than a simple data base manager built into the microsoft works program , microsoft has not been a factor in business data bases long the david to microsoft s goliath , borland has a strong position in computer languages , spreadsheets and data bases indeed , in the latter it has become the goliath , with an estimated 70 percent share of the market the fox deal is a bigger negative for borland than it is a big positive for microsoft , said betty j lyder , vice president of montgomery securities of san francisco in relative terms , data base products account for 50 percent of borland s sales and are critical for revenue growth foxpro is important for microsoft because it completes their product suite , but in terms of revenue , well , they can do 37 billion in fiscal '93 , and data bases will be maybe 150 million of that once foxpro for windows starts shipping , ms lyter said , microsoft s share of the market goes from 10 to 30 to whatever , while borland s goes from 70 to maybe 55 percent wall street analysts translated their fears for borland s vulnerability into lower earnings projections , and borland s stock fell sharply after the deal was announced trading at 7025 on march 24 , borland stock fell to 63 the day after microsoft s announcement , and it has since slipped into the 50 s microsoft stock slipped 1 the day after the announcement , to 12750 , and has now fallen below 120 a share \( both stocks are traded over the counter \) but wayne kernochan , senior analyst for the yankee group in boston , had a different view it is like crossed swords at microsoft and borland , and the only point at which the swords touch is the desktop data base , he said it s not a strong negative for borland , just one area where they have competiton the bottom line is a potential bonus for the end user there s more competition , and that ca n't be bad borland executives were upbeat this is great news , we think , said philippe kahn , chief executive of borland the data base market is now greatly simplified with only two players borland and microsoft we believe that all this activity will really stimulate the data base arena , and that is good news for borland and microsoft , and especially for users and developers charles stevens , general manager of microsoft s data base products group , also played up the positive customers will benefit from more competition and innovation in the pc data base market , he said all this good cheer and talk of customers aside , both companies acknowledge that there has been bad blood between them borland loves a fight , said heidi sinclair , a borland vice president the company is psyched and focused we know how to compete aginst microsoft and love that microsoft is the enemy borland prevailed in programming languages , she said , and now we 're going to do it again in data bases but microsoft has a formidable weapon in foxpro 20 , the dos data base manager it is acquiring fox has won many awards for its data base program its problem was a lack of marketing and distribution clout in foxpro 20 \( 795 suggested list price \) , microsoft has a dos data base product that has already captured the imaginations of many programmers with its speed and graphical development tools it is much faster than borland s latest dbase iv version 15 \( also 795 \) microsoft is also the largest maker of business software for the apple macintosh it has a macintosh customer list of millions of

kiki vandeweghe has reached the point in his career where he takes nothing for granted he is 33 years old and in his 12th professional season his career has been threatened by a chronic back condition on several occasions and this season , after he struggled during the first two months , vandeweghe was buried on the knicks' bench by coach pat riley for several weeks , which did not exactly boost vandeweghe s confidence that s the tough part , vandeweghe said , when asked how he avoided becoming depressed when he did not play you 've got to keep yourself up mentally when you 're not playing , you 've got to do a little bit extra work hard in practice , keep yourself in shape as a player , you 've got to think you can contribute heading into tonight s road game against the washington bullets , the knicks \( 2715 \) are on a fourgame winning streak and vandeweghe is on a streak of his own given a chance by riley seven games ago to play himself back into the rotation , vandeweghe grabbed the opportunity the way someone in quicksand grabs a rope vandeweghe has averaged 94 points in the last seven games , including a 14point effort in wednesday night s 10189 victory against the bullets at madison square garden 'lucky to be playing' how cognizant was vandeweghe that his career had reached a crisis stage \? after wednesday s game , vandeweghe pointed out that only three of the firstround picks in the 1980 national basketball association draft remained in the league kevin mchale , mike gminski and vandeweghe if vandeweghe has his way , he will be the last to go i look at it that i'm lucky to be playing , vandeweghe said his outside shooting gives new york a muchneeded dimension , especially since xavier mcdaniel , the starting power forward , has been in a slump recently vandeweghe still has problems defensively , but he is working hard , and the knicks can always substitute for him when he is overmatched by the opposing small forward many players , if benched for 9 of 10 games as vandeweghe was , would have reacted differently some would have sulked some would have let themselves get out of shape some would have blasted the coach some would have asked to be traded focusing on the team vandeweghe did none of the above asked if he had handled the situation better this time than he would have five seasons ago , vandeweghe said no question i would hope that i would 've handled it well back then , but now i have a better attitude being part of a team that s winning a lot really helps it picks you up it is no coincidence that new york s offensive rejuvenation coincided with vandeweghe s return to action i 've been around a long time and have watched veteran players go through this , riley said i went through this with jamaal wilkes , bob mcadoo and a number of other guys when there was a changing of the guard kiki has handled it as professionally as anybody i 've ever been around it s a testimony to a player that he goes through some frustration and then comes in and plays like he did he s a big plus for us right now rebounds anthony mason , the knicks' backup power forward , has averaged 95 points in the last eight games not bad for a player who is not known for his scoring anthony mason is becoming more of an offensive threat , pat riley said he s gaining more confidence i think the players are gaining more confidence in him , too they do not bypass him any longer in the low post one , for fear of getting benched , and two , for fear of having anthony mason grab them around the neck
more than 200 people representing small businesses , the sick and the elderly crowded into an auditorium in manhattan yesterday to assail rate increases requested by empire blue cross and blue shield , new york state s largest health insurer , saying that if the increases were granted tens of thousands of people might be forced to drop coverage altogether the ailing company has asked the state to approve rate increases as of jan 1 , ranging from 20 percent to 53 percent for its 15 million individual and smallgroup subscribers those customers who are selfinsured or who work in companies that have from 3 to 50 employees empire says it is losing money so rapidly that its cash reserve will dwindle to just 30 million by the end of the month but some of empire s customers , who have absorbed steep increases every year for the last five years , said the newest proposal could finally drive them over the edge among these are lisa kristal burgman of manhattan , whose family of four now pays about 9 , 000 a year to empire and whose rates would increase under the proposal by about 3 , 000 a year , she said affects the sickest my daughter already pays more for health insurance than she does for rent , said ms kristal burgman s mother , karen kristal , who spoke on her behalf at the hearing her husband makes 550 a week after taxes how are they supposed to pay for an increase \? the company is asking for an average increase of 255 percent for all its smallgroup and individual subscribers , with different increases for different policies for a family with empire s wraparound plus plan that now pays 7 , 22880 a year , for instance , the company is requesting an increase of 1 , 63140 , making the proposed cost 8 , 86020 a year yesterday s was the second of three public hearings on the rate request the state insurance superintendent , salvatore r curiale , is to rule on the application before the new year , and he has the choice of granting all , some or none of it he has not yet said what he plans to do , although gov mario m cuomo said earlier this week that we do n't expect the rate increase that they 're asking for to occur the increase would affect some of empire s sickest subscribers in the new york , midhudson valley and albany areas , many of whom buy insurance from empire because other insurance companies refuse to insure highrisk applicants many of these subscribers have extremely high medical bills and have contributed to the current fiscal problems of empire , a nonprofit company that has traditionally insured people whom no one else would accept subscribers lost in 1992 , said empire s chairman , albert a cardone , the company has lost 2688 million in its individual and smallgroup plans , mostly because the state s commercial insurance companies empire s competitors woo away younger , healthier subscribers with promises of lower rates , leaving the older , sicker ones for empire legislation passed by the state legislature last summer and signed by the governor this fall would help remedy that situation by requiring commercial insurance companies to accept everyone who applies , regardless of medical condition , and forbidding them to set rates based on factors like age , sex and prior health condition but the legislation does not take effect until april 1 , 1993 , and mr cardone said that empire s condition is deteriorating rapidly although no one doubts that empire is in trouble , the company is receiving little sympathy from either its subscribers or state legislators , many of whom were persuaded to support last spring s legislation only because of empire s tacit promise that if the bill passed , the company would no longer need enormous rate increases this company s duplicitous actions will not help the tens of thousands of empire subscribers facing increases , said peter newell , an aide to assemblyman alexander b grannis , a manhattan democrat who is chairman of the assembly insurance committee robert fasano of the national transplant support network , which represents people with organ transplants , said the increase would be devastating for members of his group we ca n't bear the burden you would impose on us by approving this rate increase , he said at the hearing photo representatives of small businesses , the sick and the elderly protested yesterday against rate increases by empire blue cross and blue shield they were outside a hearing at new york university medical center \( john sotomayor the new york times \)
commissioning new music based on the career of a jazz giant seems like an ideal way of escaping the stale routines that plague most of the tribute concerts on the jazz circuit that , at least , is the theory miles davis , the subject of thursday night s tribute at carnegie hall , made some of the 20th century s more influential music he also made some terrifyingly bad music that shook the idea of genius garnett brown , who composed a long suite covering mr davis s tortured career , decided to put it all in he made a mistake certainly mr davis s music , over nearly 30 years of a fertile career , can sustain intellectual scrutiny not only did he completely change the way the blues is played , with a series of seminal recordings in the 1950 s in which he refused to perform a single blues cliche , but with his delicate playing he discovered an intimacy that had never been heard changing its stereotypes of masculine power , mr davis brought american music to a new , painfully revealing place unfortunately , none of that surfaced on thursday night , though there was plenty of fine playing mr brown is clearly a skillful writer and arranger , but his piece for big band sounded more like a soundtrack for a mid1970 s madefortelevision movie than like the rigorous intellectual work needed to reveal something new about mr davis s canon mr brown leaned heavily on cliched notions of prettiness flutes , soprano saxophones which probably would have pained mr davis , who found beauty in the perfect , unsentimental note oddly enough , the lukewarm accompaniment did n't dampen the improvisations from the beginning of the show , the alto saxophonist jackie mclean and the trumpeter roy hargrove , acting like a team , provided heroic and intelligent solos , occasionally taking on and swiftly dispatching challengers in cutting contests starting with a section called the bebop period , the two coursed through the riffs and arrangements , with mr mclean showing off a staggering amount of harmonic knowledge in his solos , and mr hargrove cruising like a shark in a good mood , casual and assured the second section , called birth of the cool , brought out the saxophonists gerry mulligan and lee konitz , and it was fascinating how mr mulligan has retained his rhythmic mastery and tone over the years , while mr konitz s playing has become fuzzy and sometimes plodding during a duet , the two seemed to drift apart , as if they were n't playing the same tune until they joined up , thrusting and parrying things heated up on eightyone , from mr davis s great mid1960 s band , with an impromptu set of battles between bobby watson and mr mclean on saxophones and between jon faddis and mr hargrove on trumpets the trumpeters squared off , with mr hargrove spreading out a royally funky blues idea for a whole chorus , and mr faddis worrying notes only to have mr hargrove come down on him with his own variations it ended up being the hardest , most intense moment of the night , great and mythic , but something mr davis would never have taken part in then catastrophe set in with the introduction of the electric keyboardist joe zawinul , the guitarist mike stern and the bassist tom barney , representing mr davis s long and mostly unproductive fusion period playing tepid fusion , they paved the way for the saxophonists bob berg and bill evans , who had played with mr davis during the latter part of his career \( which at times seemed dedicated mostly to supporting his beachfront house in malibu \) in between the bombast came a momentary eddy of quietude the singer and pianist shirley horn came out and captured more of mr davis than anybody else quiet , intimate and free in her use of space with long drawnout syllables and a gentleness that verged on regret , she found miles davis photo jackie mclean , left , and roy hargrove playing at the carnegie hall tribute to miles davis on thursday \( jack vartoogian \)
slanting intelligence to satisfy superiors is as common at the cia as gambling is in the movie casablanca so said critics during robert gates s confirmation hearings now there s support for that view more than half the 250 analysts who responded to a recent inhouse survey believe that slanting occurs mr gates , now the agency s director , told an audience of cia analysts that he found the results disturbing slanting , he said , occurs often enough to be of concern he ordered remedial action but his own deeds in recent weeks suggest the same tendency to twist intelligence for political purposes for example , mr gates surprised the house last month by warning that north korea could have a nuclear weapon within a few months that contradicted the assessment of his own analysts and the rest of the intelligence community , which contended that even after north korea accumulates enough plutonium , making a device would require several additional steps that could require months or even years mr gates s testimony gave support to a rash highpressure pentagon policy while undercutting a sound state department strategy of deliberate diplomacy aimed at weaning pyongyang from its nuclear ambitions at the same house hearing , he tried to allay congressional concern that china is marketing missile technology to the middle east congress was then considering whether to suspend mostfavorednation trade status mr gates s boss , president bush , opposed suspension mr gates lent timely support to mr bush by saying , we have no indication that i'm aware of that they are selling technologies now that would be a violation of the agreements they 've signed up to on the very same day , however , senator joseph biden told a rare secret session of the senate that china was doing just that the source of mr biden s information was none other than mr gates s own chief national intelligence officer on arms proliferation mr gates is entitled to put the best spin he can on intelligence assessments to prop up administration policy but withholding information or distorting it is not legitimate advocacy
to the editor anthony lewis incorrectly states an important point of international law in his alarm in cairo \( column , feb 9 \) , regarding the two libyan agents suspected of planting the bomb that destroyed pan am flight 103 over lockerbie , scotland , in 1988 he refers to unnamed international lawyers who assert that there is no basis in international law for the demand that libya turn over citizens suspected of crimes to another country but iternational terrorism especially involving unlawful acts against the safety of civil aviation is now a recognized crime under international customary law it follows that libya cannot lawfully shield terrorists against international criminal prosecution libya has several choices under the norms set forth in numerous conventions that have attained the status of customary law libya can prosecute the agents under its own law and must accept assistance from other states \( evidence , witnesses \) in the prosecution or libya can turn over the suspects to an outside tribunal under stipulations protecting the full procedural rights of the accused none of this has anything to do with extradition mr lewis writes that the authority for turning over the agents must rest on an extradition treaty , and libya has none with the united states or britain but even if there were such an extradition treaty , it would not likely provide for extraditing one s own nationals to the other party nor would such a treaty if it existed protect the libyan agents under the political offense exception relevant international conventions such as the european convention on the suppression of terrorism of 1976 make it clear that air piracy and aircraft bombing are exceptions to the political offense exception this last consideration strips away any possible claim that libya might make that harboring such terrorists constitutes a justifiable act of political asylum anthony d'amato professor of law , northwestern u chicago , feb 14 , 1992
the mechanics on the mound were straightforward and sound , the strategy a mix of sophistication and strength , the slider as precise as the fastball was powerful the demeanor was one of professional pride with tom seaver there was always something both elemental and authoritative about his talent , and so it seemed only appropriate that his election to the baseball hall of fame last night was pure and definitive he received an unprecedented 988 percent of the ballots cast by members of the baseball writers association of america seaver , the franchise pitcher for the mets who won 311 games and three cy young awards in his 20 years in the major leagues , was named on 425 of 430 ballots submitted , a percentage that exceeded ty cobb s previous record of 982 percent achieved 56 years ago henry aaron s 978 is the thirdhighest mark fingers gets 811 percent seaver , the starter who gave legitimacy to an organization , will be joined in the hall of fame by rollie fingers , the reliever who gave stature and significance to a role fingers , the righthanded closer whose 341 career saves remain the game s standard , became the first pure relief pitcher to be named to cooperstown , his 811 percent of the vote easily meeting the required 75 percent threshold the 45yearold fingers , whose distinctions were his cool , his control and his handlebar mustache , pitched in parts of 16 seasons , winning the american league cy young and most valuable player awards in 1981 with the milwaukee brewers he was a fixture on the oakland athletics of the early 1970 s , a team that was part dynasty , part circus he earned a pair of saves in each of oakland s three world series championships from 197274 the expected protest vote for pete rose turned out to be a muted one rose , who was kept off the ballot by the hall of fame s board of directors because of his status on baseball s ineligible list , received 41 writein votes , none of which officially counted three ballots were blank only three members of the association made good on the threat to submit completely blank ballots , a total that did not substantially affect the fortunes of seaver or fingers or of orlando cepeda , the former giants and cardinals first baseman whose 246 votes fell well shy of the required 323 he was the consummate pro from day one , ron swoboda , the outfielder who played for the mets with seaver , said of the classic righthander and that comes from a guy who clearly was n't i and others felt our way along in the majors but seaver , he seemed to be walking a golden path certainly , any time seaver walked out of the dugout and followed his deliberate path to the mound , there was in the stands the anticipation of majesty and in the opposing dugout the reasonable expectation of humiliation what was special about him as a pitcher \? you 'd have to write a novel instead of an article , said jerry grote , the longtime catcher for the mets nolan ryan left guys shaking their heads , believing they were overmatched with seaver , they 'd get struck out and credit him with having made a good pitch they 'd come up again , strike out again and credit him with having made another good pitch then , the game would be over and seaver would be in double figures in strikeouts the guy did n't make bad pitches his career statistics make for pretty good reading seaver , who also pitched for the reds , the white sox and the red sox , posted a record of 311205 , notched 3 , 640 strikeouts , amassed 61 shutouts , won 20 or more games in a season five times , and finished with an earned run average of 286 to have a single memory of seaver is to end the discussion about whether he should be in the hall of fame , said tug mcgraw , the relief pitcher who pitched alongside seaver with the mets he had complete knowledge of his own ability and he was modest and astute enough to make sure it was always incorporated into the team s game plan as effectively as possible but it was pure good fortune that initially incorporated seaver s talents into the future of the mets seaver was first drafted by the braves , but his contract with them was voided by commissioner william d eckert , who determined that it violated major league rules on the signing of college players seaver was then awarded to the mets in a special lottery on april 1 , 1966 a year later , the 22yearold righthander made his debut for the mets at shea stadium , won his first game a week later and went on to be named the national league rookie of the year after going 1613 with a 276 era the magic of '69 seaver s presence and ability were the catalysts for the magic of 1969 when the mets unburdened themselves of their farcical past and won a pennant and world series tom was terrific , the mets were amazin , and seaver s 257 mark was his most dramatic stake to greatness in baseball and immortality in the hearts of new yorkers tom seaver was and always will be the franchise player for the mets , frank cashen , the chief operating office of the mets , said in a statement yesterday after 1969 , there followed other great triumphs , as well as tears and turmoil there was april 22 , 1970 when seaver struck out 19 padres , including the last 10 outs another world series appearance in 1973 , a 229 season in 1975 then , there was the cataclysmic trade of seaver to cincinnati in 1977 after a contract dispute there was the nohitter against the cardinals as a member of the reds , the return to the mets in 1982 and the embarrassing frontoffice mistake that led to his departure barely a season after that , the odd and yet exuberant experience of gaining his 300th career victory in a white sox uniform in a game at yankee stadium he had obvious technique , obvious ability from the getgo , said swoboda and then it was clear he had all the psychological tools to go with the physical equipment he struggled a lot as a player , a person , a performer , but he always seemed to at least have his hands on the problems in those struggles lowkey approach the 47yearold seaver , who has entertained notions of becoming a general manager while enjoying a second career as a broadcaster , had handled his expected election to the hall of fame with a silent diplomacy he declined to speak publicly about his chances or the importance of the distinction , and last night he told jack lang , the executive secretary of the writers association , nothing more than that he could n't believe he 'd received a record percentage of the vote his substance , his character , his intelligence all forbid him from making a big fuss over it , said mcgraw he might react with exuberance to those extremely close to him , but he probably does n't have all that much to say his performance has already spoken bill mazeroski and maury wills , each in their final year of eligibility , failed not only to receive the required 75 percent , but also did not garner the 60 percent currently needed to be considered later by the veterans committee chart seaver s tour of duty career highlights april 1 , 1966 baseball commissioner pulls the name of the mets out of a hat and awards them the rights to tom

in the late 1980 s , when wall street boomed and the rich got richer , winston st kitts , a subwaycar maintenance man who emigrated from guyana 14 years ago , discovered the american dream in queens mr st kitts , who is 38 years old , moved to queens two years ago from an apartment in crown heights , brooklyn he bought a twofamily house in jamaica , where he hopes to raise a family like the grimsleys of cambria heights , a schoolteacher , an auditor and their two children , and the cooks of far rockaway , a retired nurse , a computer operator and their three children , mr st kitts helps personify a census statistic that some demographers say is nothing short of astonishing the median income for black households in queens has virtually matched that of white households progress in a long struggle the finding , generated from a computer analysis of census records by the new york times , represents a statistical milestone , at least , in the struggle of blacks to achieve economic parity with whites demographers say that while national comparisons are still incomplete , they believe that queens is the largest political subdivision where blacks and whites have a common median income median income is that line at which half the group makes more and half the group makes less the 1990 census figures showed that , over the previous decade , the median income of black households in queens rose 31 percent , adjusted for inflation , compared to 19 percent for white households a decade ago , the median income of black households in queens was 95 percent less than it was for white households by 1990 , that gap was only twotenths of 1 percent demographers say many factors contributed to the shift queens s growing population of hispanic people , who can be of either race , tended statistically to hold down income gains of whites about half of all the hispanic people in queens described themselves as white to the census bureau and some affluent whites left the borough black gains , the demographers say , may be a greater reflection of immigration from the caribbean than of progress by americanborn blacks and many black families were able to enter the middleincome group by having more than one family member work there were 114 workers per white household in queens in 1980 and 115 in 1990 among blacks , the number of workers per household rose from 132 in 1980 to 151 in 1990 the figures signal the latest phase in the ethnic and racial evolution that has traditionally made queens , now with nearly two million residents and 700 , 000 households in its 112 square miles , the city s largest middleclass borough according to the census , the middle figure , or median , among all of the incomes reported by blacks and whites was nearly the same in queens 34 , 600 for whites and 34 , 500 for blacks just above the statewide median of 32 , 965 and generally high enough to qualify those households as middleincome blacks , who constitute about 20 percent of the borough s population , make up 18 percent of the queens households that reported an income of 35 , 000 or more blacks who earn at least 35 , 000 make up 49 percent of the black population whites earning at least that account for 49 percent of the white population the black population of queens mostly civil servants or people working in equal opportunity situations were making it in 1980 and more so in 1990 , and that s the way the system is supposed to work , said frank vardy , a demographer with the department of city planning they make it to queens because they want the american dream but statistical equality may be illusory the gains mask lingering pockets of abject poverty in queens and many sections remain largely segregated middleincome black neighborhoods have often formed on the fringes of ghettos and have further isolated the poor blacks who have been left behind moreover , median income represents only one measurement of success blacks have traditionally trailed whites in net worth , even among groups with comparable incomes , and have suffered discrimination grounded in race a more indelible characteristic than class in none of the other four boroughs or the surrounding counties in new york , new jersey and connecticut do the median household incomes of blacks and whites even approach parity , although middleincome blacks have made inroads in nassau , suffolk and rockland counties , in particular in new york city , the median income for whites was still higher than for blacks about 10 , 000 higher in chicago , it was nearly 12 , 000 higher in los angeles , 15 , 000 higher erosion of gains despite the income parity shown in the 1990 census figures , blacks , who traditionally have had less accumulated wealth than whites , remain more vulnerable to shifts in the economy and interviews indicate that some gains recorded by the census have been eroded by the recession allen eley , for instance , lived in a public housing project in south jamaica until he moved into a private home in springfield gardens but in april , he was laid off as a shipping clerk for a richmond hill company that distributes machine parts since then , mr eley , who is 24 , has been looking for a job that will keep him in the middle class

in a finding that has surprised medical scientists , a new study shows that once a person is infected with the hepatitis c virus , which causes the most common form of viral hepatitis in the united states , the virus remains in the blood for years , even when there are no signs or symptoms of liver inflammation in contrast , just a small portion of people infected with hepatitis b , which also causes hepatitis , go on to become chronic carriers but a second study provides some reassurance , indicating that for the first 20 years after infection the death rate in people with hepatitis c may be no higher than that in similar but uninfected people the finding indicates that the virus can be extraordinarily indolent even though it is a leading cause of cirrhosis , liver failure and liver cancer in this country the new research , by dr miriam j alter of the centers for disease control and prevention , dr leonard b seeff of the veterans affairs hospital in washington and their colleagues , is being published today in the new england journal of medicine hepatitis experts say the studies help flesh out an emerging picture of a silent epidemic that is only now becoming appreciated the studies are revelations of a sort , said dr jules dienstag , a hepatitis expert at massachusetts general hospital in boston 'poorly reported disease' the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that as many as 150 , 000 americans are infected each year with hepatitis c , and that 8 , 000 to 10 , 000 die each year from consequences of the infection but , dr alter said , it s a very poorly reported disease and it s extremely difficult to come up with accurate estimates dr seeff said that the usual estimates almost certainly understated the disease s prevalence because they were derived from studies of blood donors and that hepatitis c was most common among poor people , who do not often donate blood , and intravenous drug users , who are not permitted to donate since 1990 , blood has been screened for evidence of the virus at his own hospital , dr seeff said , 40 percent of the people admitted had hepatitis c , although almost none of them knew it i believe that hepatitis c is a tremendously common disease and that we have not known about it , dr seeff said we are seeing the tip of an iceberg dr alter said , according to this study , once you get it , you ca n't get rid of it hepatitis c is transmitted through blood and shared needles , but , dr alter found in her study , about 40 percent of people who become infected say they never used drugs or were exposed to infected blood it may also be transmitted through sexual intercourse , researchers say , but if it is , the likelihood of getting infected that way is very low we 've never been able to figure out how all these people became infected , dr dienstag said the only treatment for hepatitis c is with the immune system hormone alpha interferon , but just 25 percent of patients respond without relapsing the treatment requires six months of injections three times a week , costs about 75 a week and has unpleasant side effects like flulike symptoms , fatigue and irritability although liver functioning improves in those who respond to the alpha interferon treatment , dr alter said , it is not known whether the treatment eradicates the virus in her study , dr alter used antibodies to the hepatitis c virus and a sophisticated molecular test , polymerase chain reaction , to look for the virus s genetic material in the blood of 106 patients who had been infected with hepatitis c in 1985 and 1986 she and her colleagues found , she said , that the virus remained through the four years that we tested for it we were able to detect it even in those patients who appeared to have gotten over their infection , she said , adding , we have to presume that if you have the virus circulating in your blood , you are potentially infectious dr alter said that she and her colleagues fully expected that the hepatitis c virus , like the hepatitis b virus , would be gone when the patients' liver functions were back to normal we were taken by surprise by the finding , she said in their study , dr seeff and his colleagues analyzed data from five large studies of the 1970 s that had identified patients who had had blood transfusions and become infected with what was later discovered to be hepatitis c the researchers tracked the patients who died and asked whether the cause of death had been hepatitis c infections or other causes dr seeff said he predicted that after 20 years the patients who were infected with the hepatitis c virus would be dying at a faster rate he said he found it encouraging that his prediction was not borne out , although the hepatitis c patients did have a higher death rate from liver disease i do n't believe this is a benign disease , dr seeff said , adding that he was now gathering data on the state of health of those who have lived with hepatitis c infections for the past two decades and also was continuing to study death rates for another five years it may simply be a question of time , dr seeff said it may be that as we proceed , we will find that problems will develop and people will die of this disease as time goes on dr ira jacobson , a hepatitis expert at new york hospitalcornell medical center , said he too did not believe that hepatitis c infections were benign even if most infected people will die of other causes , some are devastated by the virus , he said i see so many patients who get in trouble with this virus , dr jacobson said we are seeing patients with cirrhosis and with liver cancer we used to call the cirrhosis of unknown cause , but now we recognize it s due to hepatitis c and we are coming to recognize in this country that liver cancer may more commonly arise from hepatitis c than from hepatitis b but , dr dienstag said , at the very least dr seeff s findings allow us to breathe a little bit easier until now , he said , we presumed that anyone with cirrhosis and hepatitis c had a good chance of going downhill but , in fact , there is a population of people who do fairly well we all feel this is encouraging
st louis , june 27 for the mets , it amounted to an exhausting case of supply and demand almost no runs almost all afternoon meant there had to be lots of superb , or at least stubborn , pitching inning after inning on and on it went against the cardinals , the score deadlocked at 11 , the day s heat suffocating the dugout , the drama on the basepaths in the eighth , ninth and 10th innings draining the mets' reserves of pitching and patience sid fernandez had given up a single run in seven innings wally whitehurst had danced with danger for three straight innings at last , the endurance struggle reached its critical stage with two out in the 10th , andres galarraga singled off a tiring whitehurst to put cardinals on first and third tom pagnozzi was at the plate , with a distinguished batting record against the mets \( a 350 average in 1992 a 318 mark for his career \) decisions , decisions manager jeff torborg faced a stark choice break club policy and call for closer john franco or risk a defeat that could once again break the spirit of a club walking between competitiveness and irrelevance in the national league east torborg opted for franco the lefthander got the out the mets manufactured a run in the 11th and franco closed out the cardinals 123 for a 21 triumph and so the survival saga that had taken close to four hours to unfold took what seemed like an instant to decide and the final , sudden resolution was set in motion by the decision to go to franco it s never an easy decision for me to go to my closer with the score even on the road , torborg said but pagnozzi was 0for11 against franco i was going by statistics it was strictly numbers the relevant numbers turned out to be pagnozzi ending up 0for12 against franco with his groundout to second today then in the top of the 11th , bill pecota delivered a twoout double off lee smith to score dave gallagher , who had walked and stolen second base the mets , who had not allowed the cardinals a run since the first inning , had scored their first run since the second and gained their first victory of a sixgame trip to st louis and chicago the question that hung in the clubhouse was whether the result would have been different for the mets friday night had torborg brought franco in before the cardinals claimed their 43 victory with a run in the ninth franco was available but ignored as jeff innis loaded the bases and then yielded the deciding hit i ca n't sit here and tell you i should have been in that game , franco said it s the manager s job to make those calls he gets paid for it the costs of those decisions , though , are felt by all the mets , and not all of them share torborg s philosophical reluctance to employ franco except when the mets have the lead those mets , deeply disappointed by the events of friday night , cited today s episode as proof of their point i do n't know how to give you guys my answer , franco said when asked if he supported his manager s strategy all i can say is i 'll do anything to help the club what franco almost did friday night was pick up the bullpen phone himself and call torborg he could n't and did n't , which is probably all for the good since the mets have n't done too well recently with incidents involving phones on the field i ca n't call him up , said franco , smiling fernandez and whitehurst had called up every ounce of their fortitude in keeping the mets in the game today fernandez yielded a run in the first inning on an rbi triple by ray lankford but then stranded a pair of cardinals then in the second he struck out three cardinals after having men reach second and third with none out whitehurst s escapes were just as remarkable cardinals reached first and second with none out in the eighth before the mets' reliever got felix jose to hit into a double play and struck out galarraga whitehurst then notched the final two outs in the ninth after cardinals had gained first and second it was an emotional win , said franco , 60 on the season he then smiled once more but i'm sure our pitchers would like to see us get a couple of more hits , he said inside pitch howard johnson hit his seventh homer of the season off donovan osborne in the second , a basesempty shot to left jeff torborg announced that wally whitehurst will replace anthony young in the starting rotation beginning with next tuesday s game against the cubs in chicago photo mets relief pitcher john franco celebrating after earning his sixth victory of the season yesterday against the cardinals in st louis \( associated press \)

havana , dec 20 the struggle for power today at voting station no 13 in the havana district of regla was an extremely polite affair neither of the district s two candidates for a seat in the municipal assembly of people s power campaigned almost everyone voted early and it appeared that nobody voted more than once the lines were short , the ballots cast with dispatch there were no cries of fraud after some prodding , antonio alvarez , a genial 57yearold boiler repairman who heads the local militia battalion , allowed that he hoped to emerge victorious his 36yearold opponent , orestes fernandez , a noncom in the cuban armed forces , would not go that far whichever one of us comes out ahead will be fine , mr fernandez said more than a year after some senior cuban officials began to suggest that the government would give people more of a say at the polls , the election today was much like those that have ratified the communist party s hold on power periodically since 1976 in further elections scheduled late in february , cubans will for the first time vote directly for representatives to the national and province assemblies , half of whom will be nominated by the 169 local assemblies chosen today but in neither vote will party policies or political control be at stake representatives of the country s tiny dissident groups , while technically allowed to take part , declined to run in any of the races today had any tried , officials said , they would have had a tough time getting nominated at the partyorganized meetings where candidates were chosen at least two government critics have been detained in the last few days , and several others have found their houses surrounded by angry groups of government supporters nonetheless , the election was cast by havana as a show of its political strength at a time the country is passing through the most severe economic crisis since fidel castro came to power at the beginning of 1959 this is a very great expression of the courage of the revolution and of confidence in the people , mr castro said today these are the worst conditions for an election in 13 , 865 electoral districts around the country , people awoke to a chorus of radio appeals calling on them to turn out and vote for cuba , for the revolution and for socialism in regla , as in other cities and towns around the country in recent days , some cubans quietly criticized the electoral process to a reporter as everything from an ineffective way to build support for the party to a totalitarian charade it seemed to be a sign of the government s continuing control , however , that at least in regla those people lined up to vote anyway all cubans over 16 can vote , but they are not legally required to and there is no process of registration there are lists , however , of those eligible to vote , and some critics of the government said privately that cuba s hard times made it especially unwise to venture even a muted statement of dissent by defacing a ballot or leaving it blank a 58yearold welder indicated that there were more than a few ways for the authorities to exert control it is very close to the new year , he said , so if you want to get some pork , the best thing is that you vote mr castro , who last year referred to capitalist democracies as complete garbage , said today that the problem with elections in such countries was the excessive role played by money and propaganda accordingly , the vote in regla , an old neighborhood that hugs havana s port , had none of that as soon as the polls closed at 6 pm , a handful of people gathered for the count first they learned that despite the caution about dissent expressed by government critics , nearly a fifth of the of 843 ballots cast there turned out to be invalid 41 had been left blank and 121 annulled , some of them scrawled with the word no the rest gave mr alvarez a victory by 363 votes to 318 but he scarcely cracked a smile and said he had no plans to celebrate all i am going to do , he said , is fight harder for the revolution
bonn , sept 9 chancellor helmut kohl acknowledged today that he had mishandled some aspects of german unification we did a lot right , but also some things wrong , mr kohl told parliament as it convened for its 199293 session he said it was now clear that unification brought with it enormous problems , more than many people , myself included , had expected but the chancellor ridiculed growing speculation that his christian democratic union , sinking in the polls , might soon dump him and form a national unity government with the opposition social democrats he pointed out that he was nearing his 10th anniversary in office , and said his friends were planning to mark the occasion by giving him a collage of a decade s worth of headlines predicting his imminent fall i will admire it on oct 1 with great pleasure , mr kohl said i might even hang it up in my office 3 days of debate mr kohl addressed parliament as it completed three days of debate about germany s 1993 budget the debate centered around problems in the formerly communist eastern states , where unemployment is high and violence against foreigners is spreading mr kohl predicted that for a long time , bonn would have to appropriate more than 100 billion per year for welfare payments , subsidies and investment in the east all major parties have agreed that payments to the east must be continued but few have faced the question how such large amounts are to be raised i have been taking part in these budget debates for 20 years , said otto lambsdorff , leader of the centrist free democratic party i can remember none where there was so much confused political discussion the only way to pay the looming bills , mr lambsdorff suggested , was a program of giving up growth in the west in order to build up the east hesitant to raise taxes the kohl government has suggested several revenueraising ideas , from increasing gasoline taxes to forcing wealthy citizens to buy nointerest bonds income taxes were raised 25 percent last year , and the chancellor is seeking to avoid raising them again finance minister theo waigel urged iron austerity at all levels of government , and added , a starting point would be stemming the flood of asylumseekers and reducing the social help they receive political leaders have agreed to cooperate in tightening the asylum law in this parliamentary session , but they are still debating how restrictive the new law should be mr kohl , who has been criticized for his combative attitude toward the social democrats , said today that he wanted to work with them to resolve the country s problems the social democratic leader , bjorn engholm , said he was willing , but accused mr kohl of mismanaging german unification what we have seen is disappointing , mr engholm asserted this government is like a ship drifting in heavy seas without a captain the crew urgently needs a clear word from the bridge , but the officers are chatting about the weather opposition parties meet planners from the two major parties have opened talks aimed at forging a solidarity pact under which corporations , wealthy individuals and trade unions would be asked to make equivalent sacrifices to pay the spiraling costs of unification mr kohl s speech today was in part an effort to counter the effect of recent speculation about his supposed political troubles various newspapers have reported that he is losing the confidence of his party , and some predict that he may soon be replaced by wolfgang schauble , leader of the christian democratic faction in parliament at a meeting with mr schauble and other senior aides on sunday evening , mr kohl reportedly asked bluntly if anyone present favored a change in leadership all pledged their loyalty despite mr kohl s clear intention to continue in office , public opinion polls suggest that he is in low standing with the voters the monthly allensbach institute poll , one of the most respected in germany , showed today that if an election were held now , the kohl government would win less than one vote out of three , and only 22 percent in eastern states
mayor david n dinkins took his campaign for racial harmony to crown heights yesterday , urging a mixed group of black youths from the neighborhood and jewish teenagers from around the city to look beyond their differences and unite in ways their parents have often not been able to holding a microphone and weaving around the crown heights youth collective , the mayor worked a crowd of 100 or so teenagers , at times like a television talkshow host he encouraged the teenagers to talk about race and reflect on a short presentation they had just seen on the life of dr martin luther king jr , a show that evoked images of the bombings , beatings and bravery of the civilrights movement in the south what did you get from that anybody \? mr dinkins asked that all people are created equal , said carlton screen , a 24yearold flatbush , brooklyn , native who is now a basketball player with the michigan great lakers anybody disagree with that \? he asked when no one responded , he noted , see , we are making progress effort to defuse tension mr dinkins s appearance was part of his efforts to stem the racial tension that has engulfed his administration and inflamed political opponents since the acquittal earlier this month of a black youth , lemrick nelson jr , in the slaying of a hasidic student , yankel rosenbaum the slaying occurred amid racial disturbances in the brooklyn neighborhood that began when a black child , gavin cato , was accidentally struck and killed by a car driven by a hasidic man in contrast to the high emotions since the verdict , the meeting yesterday was calm the jewish teenagers at the meeting were not from crown heights , but from an organization of reform youth groups from around the city the organizers had invited local lubavitch teenagers , but none came , a fact that one lubavitcher said was for religious reasons , but which some black participants said they interpreted as a snub mr dinkins also answered questions from reporters about a protest , to be led by assemblyman dov hikind , planned for tonight at a major reelection fundraiser for the mayor at the sheraton new york hotel and towers mr hikind , democrat of brooklyn , said yesterday that the protest would keep up pressure for an investigation into mr rosenbaum s death and the events leading up to the violence in crown heights last year mr dinkins , referring to his own efforts to bring people together , said that if mr hikind concentrated on efforts like this , frankly it would be more useful yesterday s meeting , on franklin avenue , had been organized before the verdict and was the second of two exchanges between the crown heights youth collective and the city region federation of temple youth since the violence in 1991 the event was not planned by the mayor s office , which has arranged several meetings with black and jewish groups in recent weeks aides said he attended to send a message to teenagers to increase the peace , a theme from his televised speech to the city last wednesday the mayor , who received a warm welcome from the teenagers and another hundred or so adults at the center , stressed historical ties between blacks and jews in the united states he said the two groups must forge better communications , even when they are not in agreement reasonable people can differ , and it s all right if people do n't agree on all things , mr dinkins said but they need to find ways to express the disagreement and to understand each other s point of view mr dinkins continued we 've got some africanamericans who are antisemitic we 've got some jews that do n't like black folks but that s not most people it s just some people and we need to work at that , and work hard at it , because for you young people it is your life you ought not permit any of us to behave improperly with respect to race relations explaining what was perhaps an example of miscommunication , levi huebner , a 32yearold lubavitcher , one of apparently two hasidic men from crown heights at the meeting , said that young people from his neighborhood had not come mostly because their religious practices frown on gatherings that mix males and females and that include the singing of christian religious songs , as was done during the show about dr king everybody has a right to their religion , and i think it s very beautiful , but for a jewish person to attend a church service , it s just not allowed , said mr huebner , who volunteers at the center and helps organize basketball games between black and jewish youths in the neighborhood both the jewish and black youths said the meeting was a good first step during mr dinkins s talk , he wandered in front of the stage , letting the young people themselves talk about race two very oppressed groups throughout history , in their backgrounds , should n't be against each other they should be together fighting what oppresses both of them , said david soskin , 14 the mayor smiled broadly now does that make sense or does that make sense \? he said i just know , i just know in my heart that good days are coming lakiesha booker , a black 16yearold from crown heights , said she had attended in part because she had never in her life spoken to a jewish person on the streets and felt that doing so was long overdue i do n't really blame anybody , she said but somebody , who ever has the power , should do more to get people together caroline borman , a jewish 17yearold from manhattan , said she faced a similar problem at her temple in midtown when young people there talked about improving race relations we were always very separated because we were all jews , she said we talked about these issues every day but we 're not going to solve anything talking amongst ourselves we have to talk to africanamericans photo mayor david n dinkins leading a questionandanswer session yesterday with teenagers at the crown heights youth collective \( chester higgins jr the new york times \) \( pg b3 \)
a significant new round of agency mergers and acquisitions seems imminent , although it will be far different from the wave of buyups and buyouts that roiled the industry in the boom years of the 1980 s the primary differences are that unlike many of the 80 s transactions , which were motivated by growth for growth s sake and occurred at spectacularly high prices , the next spate of deals will be impelled by much more practical purposes and will be reasonably priced among the considerations behind the forthcoming transactions are factors like needing to bolster international capabilities , improving service in important markets like los angeles and new york and paying down debt taken on during the 80 s growth binge if you want to identify the deals of five years ago as components of empirebuilding , said alan j gottesman , an analyst at paine webber in new york , these tend to be strategic or symbiotic on an operating level among the impending and expected transactions \( subject , of course , to the usual derailments over price , power and client conflict \) are these bbdo worldwide in new york acquiring the ross roy group in bloomfield hills , mich the two agencies share a major client , the chrysler corporation , which is believed to be considering a reduction in the number of agencies on its roster hill , holliday , connors , cosmopulos in boston buying a new yorkbased shop to strengthen its own new york office , which has lagged behind other large agencies' operations here ketchum communications in pittsburgh and new york and ayer inc in new york merging , combining an agency company that is stronger domestically \( ketchum \) with one stronger internationally \( ayer \) the lowe group in london acquiring scali , mccabe , sloves inc in new york from the wpp group plc in london , which has been under financial pressure from an extensive and expensive series of deals made in the 80 s susan l decker , an analyst at donaldson , lufkin jenrette in san francisco , said the transactions seemed more mutually beneficial this time around , to clients as well as to agencies for instance , she added , agencies realize that they need more geographic breadth as clients expand into other markets the backdrop for the new round oftransactions is the industry s continuing recession , now entering its third year when the business is lousy , anything s possible , said james d dougherty , an analyst at county natwest usa in new york i did n't make it up , but necessity is the mother of invention it s obviously a highly fragmented business that is always amply populated , he added some of those agencies find it possible to make a go of things in this climate some do n't mr gottesman said that several of the anticipated mergers were recessionrelated he characterized them as two guys who figure if they lean against each other , they 'd stand up under the wind better mr dougherty thought it telling that two likely acquisitions would involve two huge agency companies , the omnicom group in new york , owner of bbdo , and the interpublic group of companies , owner of lowe essentially , there are two agency groups that have money , he said , so they have a constant stream of suitors in all the transactions , mr dougherty added , there are none where the principals will walk off with substantial fortunes , which happened during the 80 s , with , for instance , the acquisition of the ted bates agency by saatchi saatchi mr gottesman said that because financing was available then and it is n't now , some of the deals , if they happen , will be mergers with no interchange of money if there is a silver lining , it might be that clients , who were mightily irked when executives at their agencies pocketed robust fortunes during the 80 s takeovers , will feel better about today s transactions
los angeles , dec 20 the san gabriel mountains in the distance were snowcapped , and it was so crisp here that players could see their breath in midafternoon but san diego coach bobby ross was so absorbed in putting his oncelaughable chargers in the playoffs , he never once put on a jacket wearing a mere golf shirt , ross finally pounded down his headset with two minutes to play and reveled in san diego s first postseason berth in a decade the chargers' 3614 victory today over the los angeles raiders certainly ordained them as the comeback team of the year , and perhaps of pro football history , because no team had ever before overcome an 04 start to reach the national football league playoffs and , over the years , 132 teams had been 04 and failed to make such a rally you know what s weird \? we have the same people who went 412 last year , said defensive end burt grossman , eyeing an eightinch cigar he 'd been handed the day brought every chargers fan out of the woodwork including owner alex spanos , who had not even set foot in his team s locker room since 1987 spanos had long been a selfproclaimed al davis wannabe , but , in the nine seasons he owned the team , the wealthy realestate mogul had been mocked from head to toe well , you know what i 've had to go through , he said it has n't been easy all these years what am i going to do to celebrate \? i know i'm going to sleep well , that s for darn sure nine years i 've waited for this it s just fantastic hugs for almost everyone spanos had chugged down to the sideline with about a minute to play and hugged nearly every person who moved he did n't hug me , grossman said maybe he does n't like me he s happy , just like everybody else you know , more money from being a playoff team now cheers emanated from the chargers locker room afterward , from what seemed to be an inspirational ross speech what ross speech \? grossman said he just gave us the schedule for tomorrow and said 'come and lift and we 've got meetings , and i 'll see you tomorrow' then he left does n't get real emotional everyone was cheering , but nobody really said anything to get us going we 're football players we 're not too smart we just cheer the chargers , winners of 6 straight and 10 of their last 11 , have clinched a wildcard berth and can actually take the american conference western division title with a victory next sunday in seattle they have the giants to thank , in part , for demolishing their rival kansas city chiefs on saturday we came off the practice field saturday and somebody said it was 357 giants , grossman said and we thought , somebody must be joking' pumping up the fans today s game became so vital that 20 busloads of chargers fans made the twohour trip up interstate 5 when san diego s lively linebacker , junior seau , made his team s first tackle dropping eric dickerson for a 2yard loss he pumped his arms toward the chargers boosters in the end zone usually all our games against the raiders are deserted , grossman said it s a rivalry , but nobody shows up the chargers were professors at monopolizing the football today in the first quarter alone , their time of possession was 13 minutes 43 seconds , while los angeles ran a paltry three offensive plays i was telling leslie o'neal , 'imagine if this keeps up , we 'll get 12 defensive plays this entire game , ' grossman said , referring to his linemate two sevenminute drives to field goals made the score 60 for san diego the angry raiders started crowding the line with nine defenders , at which time the chargers smartly turned to stan humphries s playaction passes general manager bobby beathard said humphries is the catalyst for their turnabout , and the quarterback acquired this summer from washington proved it humphries arched a 14yard touchdown to anthony miller and a 50yard postpattern touchdown to nate lewis while playing with a shoulder bruise by the third quarter , the chargers were rolling , 260 , and had actually dropped three humphries passes in the end zone the raiders benched jay schroeder \( 4 of 13 for 25 yards \) in the third quarter in favor of 37yearold vince evans , but it was a rout too large to overcome running back rod bernstine wondered where the champagne was afterward , but grossman said none here we 've got oranges and soda and cheap cigars , though you 'd think we 'd at least have 4 champagne i guess that s for next week photo raiders cornerback lionel washington pursuing chargers' rod bernstine in the first quarter yesterday \( associated press \)
after pleading guilty to fraud and theft charges , mayor david n dinkins s former campaign finance chairman is trying to lighten his punishment by providing investigators with tips and leads about what he says are irregularities in the mayor s 1989 election campaign , the investigators said yesterday but the investigators also said that the former treasurer , arnold i biegen , a manhattan lawyer , had not provided strong evidence to support his allegations the officials also acknowledged that they were skeptical of mr biegen s assertions because of his motives and erratic behavior , and one of them portrayed his charges as tidbits , rather than substantial allegations of serious wrongdoing still , they say they are now interviewing witnesses and reviewing documents in an effort to test the veracity of his claims investigators say it is far too early to tell whether mr biegen s allegations will lead to a major investigation checking is not believing if he tells us something we 've got to look at it , said one official it does n't mean we believe all of it among the allegations , the investigators said , are statements that mr biegen solicited cash contributions for the dinkins campaign that were never reported , as required by law leonard schwartz , president and owner of the globe wholesale company , a tobacco wholesaler , said investigators for the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau , had subpoenaed his records for 1989 and had asked whether he had made any improper contributions to the mayor s campaign in a telephone interview , mr schwartz said he had contributed to the campaign , but properly and legally a search of filings from the dinkins campaign did not find a record of a donation by mr schwartz , but election officials have often called the mayor s records incomplete mr schwartz also said that he had loaned at least 5 , 000 to mr biegen over the years he said mr biegen had been his company s lawyer in the past , and that they attended new york university law school together repayment seems unlikely of the loans he made to mr biegen , who is in debt to the internal revenue service , mr schwartz remarked , i think i 'll never see any of it the new york post and new york newsday first reported yesterday that investigators from mr morgenthau s office were examining contributions from mr schwartz to the dinkins campaign during a court hearing yesterday , prosecutors for united states attorney otto g obermaier indicated that they were also talking with mr biegen on jan 31 , the day mr morgenthau announced his state indictment , mr obermaier filed a criminal complaint against mr biegen , also accusing him of theft from the campaign in court papers filed yesterday , assistant united states attorney david lawrence said his office was engaged in negotiations concerning possible disposition of this case the papers seek to delay a federal indictment while the talks are in progress another former top dinkins campaign adviser , who has talked to federal and city investigators , said they mentioned several names and asked whether they had contributed to the campaign the adviser , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said none of the names was familiar on monday , mr biegen pleaded guilty to stealing 158 , 000 from the mayor s reelection fund by writing 29 checks to himself , a particularly conspicuous theft that has baffled other mayoral supporters and mr biegen s friends at the same time , he pleaded guilty to stealing 850 , 000 from a mentally impaired widow whose estate he was managing the theft left the oncewealthy widow of one of mr biegen s law partners virtually penniless , her advisers say the two charges each carry maximum sentences of 5 to 15 years in prison but mr biegen , who was also an adviser to gov mario m cuomo , could win leniency if he could persuade mr morgenthau to tell a judge that he had been helpful in nurturing investigations of others in various interviews , officials said they were coming closer to resolving the mystery of why mr biegen would have committed blatant , even clumsy thefts they said that he had acknowledged living lavishly , and that his spending supported this explanation

philadelphia , july 29 the eighthinning grand slam crashed into the bullpen in left the ninth inning then expired without a threat the mets were 63 losers to the phillies and suddenly a fourthplace club in the national league east the afternoon s only remaining electricity crackled quietly in the clubhouse players inquired about trade rumors general manager al harazin , unmoving , unsmiling , stared out from the corner the clock to the major league trading deadline was ticking and everyone heard it tomorrow should be an interesting day , said harazin the mets , who ca n't make headway in a race everyone has made a mess of , sent one of their premier pitchers to the mound to face a 24yearold lefthander with a 111 record three hours later , the mets were packing quickly , and perhaps one or two of them for good friday marks a pivotal trading deadline , and the sense of urgency in harazin s mind could only have been intensified by yet another desensitizing defeat the national league east has become a comic crapshoot , and a roll of the dice by the mets before friday appears inevitable am i going crazy \? said manager jeff torborg yeah but that s been forever forever got a bit longer today as the mets , forfeiting repeated chances to take charge of a game against the worst club in the nl east standings , gave up four runs in the eighth inning dave hollins s grand slam off lee guetterman a deceptive but sufficient oneout missile to left shattered a 22 game and left the recent record for the mets in the kind of rubble that had piled up throughout the season the defeat was their second in three games against the phillies , their fourth in five games over all their record for the season sunk to 4952 , their mark in the supposedly recharged second half at 76 that was a game that we had a real good shot at taking , said torborg it was , though , a game that was condensed to one moment in the eighth guetterman , who had yielded consecutive singles to darren daulton and lenny dykstra to load the bases , had gone 31 on hollins miss the strike zone , and the potential decisive run walks across the plate get too much of the strike zone , and there could be lots of phillies sprinting across the plate with a 31 count and the bases loaded , you go right after him , said guetterman i did n't think he hit it that well there were n't a lot of folks who shared guetterman s uncertainty all of veterans stadium stood up to track what hollins had done to a mediocre fastball left fielder howard johnson gave halfhearted chase and then surrendered dave magadan sat in a deep squat with his head in his hands at third as the phillies paraded past guetterman absently kicked dirt on the mound and turned for another baseball obviously , said guetterman , i did n't have what it takes today full treadmill stride guetterman had company the mets went scoreless through the first three innings against kyle abbott , the unpolished lefthander who had lost his first 11 decisions of the season the mets scored a run in the fourth when dave gallagher tripled in johnson with one out but the mets could n't deliver the additional run from third , and the club s offense without opportunism was again in its full treadmill stride in the sixth , magadan walked and johnson singled to start the inning but bobby bonilla , whose swing was n't helped by all the time he had to work on it during his justconcluded suspension , flied out to center magadan then got thrown out at the plate by left fielder stan javier when he tried to score on gallagher s single and bill pecota completed the exercise in exasperation by flying out to left potential big inning fizzles no runs , no clutch hits , no end to it all sid fernandez , who turned in yet another six effective innings , gave up his second run of the afternoon in the sixth to trail by 21 the mets manufactured enough offense to answer the one run but not enough to secure a triumph with men on first and third and none out , chico walker pinchhit for fernandez he got in a run but deprived the inning of prodigious promise with his 463 doubleplay grounder i was hoping for a big inning there , said torborg that s why i hit for sid we did n't make enough of it the bullpen then made a conclusive calamity of it in the eighth jeff innis , who had worked a 123 seventh , gave up a leadoff single to mickey morandini next to the mound was guetterman , the lefthander whose sustained effectiveness of late had been a shining and substantial bright spot for the mets he s been used a lot , said torborg he s probably tired but you hope you can get another inning out of him guetterman got all of one out daulton , rested after drilling the mets for 7 rbi the past 48 hours , hammered a single on the first pitch he saw all afternoon dykstra then lined another single to right against guetterman the stage was set and then cleared by hollins
washington , jan 3 the bush administration has given several former soviet republics the names of more than 50 americans listed as missing in action from world war ii and the korean and vietnam wars who might have been moved to the soviet union , officials said today the names include those of americans who fought in asia in world war ii , crew members aboard warplanes that were downed near soviet territory in the korean war and prisoners of war taken in vietnam , the officials said the defense department has assembled about 50 names of americans listed as missing in action from world war ii to before the vietnam war , officials said in addition , the state department has discussed with the former soviet republics the cases of several americans listed as missing in action from the vietnam war , said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity and would not release the list a spokesman for the state department said leaders of kazakhstan promised secretary of state james a baker 3d last month that united states officials would be allowed to visit saryshagan , 150 miles northwest of almaata , the kazakh capital , to investigate a report that american prisoners had been taken there from vietnam pursuing reports we continue to work with russian officials and officials of other republics where it s appropriate to pursue any reports that we get , even ones that we do n't have real substantiation for , said the spokesman , richard a boucher he did not specify which other republics had been notified state department officials are also preparing to meet next week with oleg d kalugin , a former major general with the kgb who says that at least three americans , two in the military and one from the central intelligence agency , were interrogated by soviet intelligence officers in vietnam in 1978 in taking the unusual step of disputing mr kalugin s contention , the agency said two of its agents had been interrogated in vietnam , but that one had been released in 1973 and the other in 1975 , when the saigon government fell to the communists and the country was unified the agency s reaction joined a growing body of official united states skepticism to mr kalugin s assertions that the soviet union had interrogated american prisoners five years after the united states quit the vietnam war in 1973 vietnam says it returned all american prisoners of war soon after a peace agreement was signed in 1973 agent released in 1973 the agency said one of its operatives was captured in south vietnam in 1968 , questioned at several locations in the south and then moved to north vietnam he remained in captivity in the northern capital , hanoi , until he was released with other american prisoners of war in 1973 , the agency said in at least one instance , the cia officer was questioned in hanoi by an individual who may have been a soviet intelligence officer , the agency said mr kalugin has identified the officer in charge of the interrogations as oleg nechiporenko , who he has said was working in the soviet consulate in mexico city mr boucher said mr kalugin had been cooperating with united states officials to try to find mr nechiporenko and set up a meeting with him a second intelligence officer was captured in south vietnam in april 1975 , the agency said , taken to hanoi and released in october of that year during this man s questioning by the vietnamese , there were some indications that soviet officials may have been supporting the interrogation , but none were directly involved , the agency said in a statement a spokesman for the defense department , bob hall , said in december that interviews with american prisoners who returned after the vietnam war had turned up no evidence of interrogation by soviet agents
donald fehr , head of the players union , will embark tuesday on a threeweek trip during which he will visit the players on all 26 major league baseball teams the purpose of the meetings is to answer questions players have been asking about the 27th and 28th teams , the two expansion franchises that will join the national league next season fehr had planned to talk to the players and answer questions about the nov 17 expansion draft , the protected lists , the people who own and operate the florida marlins and the colorado rockies and assorted other matters related to the majors' first expansion in 16 years events of last week and this , however , will certainly prompt a different line of questions from the players they have , after all , a vested interest in the outcome of the conflict between the owners and commissioner fay vincent because it has much to do with labor the word lockout will be tossed around the clubhouses fehr visits , as in , does this enhance the chances that the owners will reopen the collectivebargaining agreement this winter and lock out the players next spring \? the conflict and the severe change in the commissioner s powers that the owners will implement after vincent leaves , whenever that may be , raise other questions as well , although none the players may ask here are some possibilities in the new world of baseball , the one where the commissioner will serve as the owners' highpaid messenger boy , like the league presidents , who will decide such matters as the allocation of expansion fees when the owners ca n't \? who will look out for the welfare of the smallmarket clubs that complain about the significant advantages the largemarket clubs have over them \? do the milwaukees of the majors really think their bigger brethren will willingly expand the sharing of their revenue \? who will challenge the conflict of interest that some people think may exist in the relationship between the tribune company , owner of the chicago cubs , and the six clubs whose television rights they hold or will hold next year \? if the owners had let vincent know the rules from the outset and not changed them in the middle of the game , would he have made the decisions he did , knowing they had to upset some clubs , or would he have said no , 'thanks , i 'll pass and keep my job , ' letting the owners argue interminably over issues like expansion fees \? some owners profess to have been upset by what they viewed as vincent s trampling of the civil liberties of three yankees officials for their testimony in the steve howe grievance hearing do those owners really care about individual rights \? if they do , where were they when free agents were being deprived of their rights during three years of collusion \? vincent is the only member of management who has acknowledged that collusion occurred his successor , who will be a chief executive officer , not a commissioner as baseball has known him for 70 years , would not be permitted to do that if he did , his board of directors , the owners , would fire him reinsdorf s aboutface jerry reinsdorf of the chicago white sox is one of those who accused the commissioner of violating the civil liberties of the yankees' officials yet he made some curious comments recently about the rights of general managers recalling how some general managers ridiculed the owners' payforperformance proposal in the 1990 labor negotiations , reinsdorf told the associated press that general managers should n't be allowed to speak , most of them , because they do n't know what they 're doing the general managers should n't have even been allowed to have an opinion , he went on general managers , reinsdorf said , are only employees asked about the remarks , reinsdorf said , i probably said it in a heated moment nevertheless , the yankee officials are employees should they have been allowed to have an opinion about baseball s drug policy \? by and large , i 'd say no , reinsdorf said the drug policy is set by the commissioner s office and ownership if a general manager has an opinion , he can express it to his owner i would n't expect a general manager to be giving his opinion in press interviews but when you 've been subpoenaed and have to testify under oath , you have no choice could n't each official have said , under oath , that his opinion of the drug policy is irrelevant , that he has a responsibility to enforce it \? he can say that , the owner said , but if the questioner says we still want your opinion , then it s up to the judge to say if he still wants their testimony boggs s big task wade boggs was a 300 hitter each of his first 10 seasons in the majors , but in his 11th season , he has been a 300 hitter only one day , april 12 , when he had a 308 average built on 8 hits in 26 times at bat the next day , he did n't get a hit in four atbats , plummeted to 267 and has n't seen 300 since entering yesterday s game , boggs was hitting 259 what would boston s tarnished star have to do the rest of the season to extend his streak to 11 seasons \? if he were to play the remaining 28 games and he averaged four atbats a game , he would have to get 52 hits that 464 pace \( 52 for 112 \) would give boggs a 300 average exactly home \( almost \) alone john mcmullen wo n't be around next season as owner of the houston astros , but he knows a good thing when he sees it so he sent a letter recently to don fehr , the head of the players association in view of the successful recent road trip of the astros , mcmullen wrote , it seems only reasonable i should request your permission for another 28day road trip next season
indulge me for a change , the letters we have here are kinder gentler than usual nobody is accusing me of being on the take from the japanese no one is saying i am a dunderhead but the letters are thoughtful , too and , now and then , i need the reassurance dear sir i should begin by saying that i am not a car buff i am one of those rare people who basically drives them into the ground , and i have owned few cars that i did n't hold onto for less than 10 years my current ones are a '77 chevy caprice wagon and an '88 oldsmobile delta 88 my wife and i happened to be driving somewhere while i read your open letter to oldsmobile , and i said to her he might as well have written to a blank wall we had a few problems with the olds when we got it , and i wrote to them about a very embarrassing noise in the rear i received the inevitable form letter in reply we also received questionnaires from oldsmobile several times , asking what we thought about the car we responded that the glove compartment was a joke virtually none of the manuals and documents that came with the car would fit then there is a cassette holder in the front armrest when it is in the upright position , any small movement causes the latch to release , and the cassettes fall on the floor behind the seat for the life of me , i can never figure out how such design errors can occur do n't the designers ever drive the cars \? at any rate , i never received a response to my comments , even though they were expressed in a serious and wellmeaning manner you give some of these automobile companies such a ribbing , i sometimes wonder why they lend you those testers but i'm glad they do thomas w weber williamsville , ny wink , wink , nudge , nudge a dirty job , but somebody s got to do it

she announced , brushing aside all questions and glaring as she leaped into the vehicle and roared away there have been persistent rumors that mr salinger has completed one or two books but has decided not to publish anything except perhaps posthumously the author s agent , phyllis westberg of harold ober associates , said on wednesday that she was not aware of any such books she said mr salinger had left a recorded telephone message telling her of the fire but had not mentioned any manuscripts she has had no further communication with him , she said , because he does not have a telephone mr salinger s modest house , surrounded by three plain garagelike structures , including the author s writing studio , is positioned for privacy to reach it one crosses an old covered bridge high above a roaring brook and grinds for several miles up a steeply winding , hardpacked dirt road the last 100 yards are an extremely steep grade , and the salinger house , nearly invisible from the road , seems almost an eagle s nest with a panoramic view of mount ascutney across the connecticut river in vermont an immense white satellite dish behind the house suggests that mr salinger is still in touch with the outside world , at least through television the fire appears to have burned out the interior of about half of the main house , and two large , bright blue tarpaulins now cover sections where the roof is evidently burned through the fire did not damage a new wing , still being built , that thrusts toward ascutney mr salinger is a sort of literary mount fuji hugely prominent yet almost always shrouded in mist if ronald reagan was the great communicator of his generation , mr salinger has become its bestknown enigma after publishing the catcher in the rye in 1951 \( which is estimated to have sold two million copies \) and three volumes of novellas and short stories , mr salinger abruptly stopped writing for publication in 1965 with two exceptions , he has not submitted to an interview since 1953 the first of the exceptions was in 1974 , when he spoke by telephone for half an hour with lacey fosburgh of the new york times , venting his anger about unauthorized editions of his early , previously uncollected works there is a marvelous peace in not publishing , he told ms fosburgh , adding publishing is a terrible invasion of my privacy i like to write i love to write but i write just for myself and my own pleasure seven years later , mr salinger granted an interview to a columnist for the advocate in baton rouge , la , betty eppes , who was also a former insurance aqent and playboy bunny despite being singularly unrevealing , the eppes interview was reprinted in the paris review in 1981 more informative was a deposition mr salinger made in october 1986 in his successful suit to keep random house from publishing the original version of ian hamilton s biography , in search of j d salinger , on the ground that it made excessive , unauthorized use of mr salinger s private correspondence asked how he had occupied himself over the previous 20 years , mr salinger replied just a work of fiction that s all he added it s almost impossible to define i work with characters as they develop i just go from there good fences mr salinger has kept aloof from his neighbors in cornish as well as from prying journalists and the public for example , clara perry , who was mr salinger s nextdoor neighbor for 20 years , ran a kindergarten attended by both of mr salinger s children , matt , an actor , and margaret ann , now both grown mrs perry refers to him affectionately as jerry but says that neither she nor her husband were ever invited into mr salinger s house mr salinger s neighbors expressed great pride in his fame and literary accomplishments , but none could be found who had read anything he had written i'm not one for reading , a neighbor explained another , dorothy johnson , said , i never got around to them mrs perry said that she and her six children had never cracked one of mr salinger s books because the catcher in the rye was banned at the windsor public school they attended after the book became accepted , she said , the windsor school used to send groups of students to visit with him but pretty soon he stopped that , mrs perry said it got to be too much for him photo the house of the author j d salinger in cornish , nh , which caught fire on tuesday the house , positioned for privacy , has a panoramic view of mount ascutney across the connecticut river in vermont \( paul o boisvert for the new york times \)
washington , july 3 now that israel appears to be on the verge of getting a government that is serious about peace talks with the arabs , american officials say that washington s top priority in the negotiations will be to insure that the palestinians and other arab parties put forward more realistic compromise proposals the arabs did their share to get this peace process started , a senior administration official said the other day on the condition of anonymity but the fact is they have been sitting around for the last year and a half watching the spectacle of the bush administration fighting with israel it was a great show , but it s over and now their moment of truth is coming now , the official said , once prime ministerdesignate yitzhak rabin puts together a government , the arabs will have an israeli partner ready , at least theoretically , to trade territory for peace and impose a de facto settlements freeze , and in order to sustain that the arabs will have to put up or shut up right now i think that is something that makes them very nervous , the official added indeed , american officials say the palestinians and syrians have both been expressing concern that washington appears to be getting ready to urge them to compromise 2 visions of autonomy when the arabisraeli negotiations last broke off in april , american officials say , the likud government of prime minister yitzhak shamir was clearly dragging its feet its only concrete proposal to the palestinians was that they take control of an aspect of their lives that they already control administration of hospitals in the west bank and gaza strip for their part , the palestinians had offered their own autonomy proposal , and it was tantamount to a call for an independent palestinian state as american officials liked to point out , the terms of the madrid peace conference called on israel and the palestinians to negotiate interim selfgovernment arrangements for the palestinians but the likud government put forward only interim arrangements and ignored selfgovernment , while the palestinians put forward a plan for selfgovernment and ignored the requirement for a transition phase now , though , mr rabin says he wants selfrule for the 17 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip within a year he also says that he will allow the palestinians to hold their own elections and that he will not build new jewish settlements except in limited strategic zones in the jordan valley , around jerusalem and on the golan heights a test for arabs because of this shift , american officials believe for the first time that real progress is possible provided that the palestinians back off from their maximal opening demands in my mind , frankly , the most important thing is to make sure that the arabs are serious when they come to the table , another senior administration official said up to now they have not had an israeli government that really tested their willingness to negotiate a quick solution now you have israelis who will be talking credibly and seriously about proposals that should be taken seriously by the arabs , and it is critical that they be ready to engage that message has already been passed through diplomatic channels to the palestinians and all other arab negotiating partners , american officials said what distinguishes mr rabin from mr shamir , american officials have told the arabs , is not that mr rabin is a radical dove who will be ready to give away the store the difference , they say , is that mr rabin is ready to test with a degree of seriousness and resolve the proposition that the arabs really are ready for a different relationship with israel mr shamir refused to do that for instance , mr shamir would not accept even an american suggestion that he tell syria what if we were ready to withdraw from all or part of the golan heights \? what would you give in return \? american officials say they will not begin formal talks with mr rabin until he puts together a government , probably within the next few weeks several options are being considered mr rabin could visit president bush in august , or secretary of state james a baker 3d could travel to jerusalem and the various arab capitals american officials say they believe their relationship with mr rabin will be quite different from the one they had with mr shamir the likud leader did not trust the bush administration and insisted that washington not get involved in the middle east talks except when israel wanted it involved mr rabin s philosophy is that israel and the united states should try to agree as much as possible on an acceptable compromise formula , and then israel should enlist the united states to help sell it to the arabs mr baker s aides greeted the prospect of progress in the middle east talks with great enthusiasm , and not just because of what it portended for the negotiations these officials also hope that it will give mr baker an excuse to stay at the state department rather than moving to the white house so he can run the troubled bush reelection campaign that shift has been widely expected administration officials are also waiting for the new israeli government to be formed before they revisit the issue of israel s request for 10 billion in loan guarantees to help absorb jews from the former soviet union that request has been on hold since march , when prime minister shamir refused to meet mr bush s condition that israel freeze all new settlement building before washington authorized the guarantees accommodation is expected again , administration officials say they will take a very different approach with mr rabin mr bush had insisted on ironclad promises from mr shamir that he freeze all settlement activity , in part because he believed that the israeli leader had repeatedly deceived him on this question , american officials said in particular , they point to the administration s giving israel 400 million in guarantees two years ago on the condition that israel not build settlements in certain areas and that it provide washington with certain information on settlement building none of those promises were fulfilled the shamir government s attitude was that if there was a loophole they would use it , one of the senior administration officials said there was a consistent pattern of deception with rabin , the whole context will be different bush is not going to change his mind about wanting a freeze on settlements , but we now have an israeli government saying it wants to change priorities , it does n't want to go on building settlements everywhere , so we do n't have to worry about them saying one thing and doing another therefore , the official said , the discussions with rabin on this issue will have a very different character , and therefore a way will be found to work things out ideally , the official said , mr rabin and mr bush will reach an understanding in august and the legislation will be introduced in the senate in september
washington , nov 9 the supreme court heard arguments today in a freespeech case that could help define where advertising fits in the hierarchy of first amendment protections the city of cincinnati asked the justices to reinstate a ban on the distribution of advertising brochures from newspaper vending machines that the city licenses for use on public property two lower federal courts ruled that the ban violated the first amendment rights of the companies that publish the free brochures , one a compilation of local real estate listings and the other a listing of adult education courses and social activities cincinnati s lawyer argued today that the selective ban , which eliminated the brochures from 62 vending machines while permitting newspapers to continue using nearly 2 , 000 other machines , was justified by an effort to control litter and visual clutter he said the ban was permissible because the supreme court has ruled that speech that does no more than propose a commercial transaction has a lower level of first amendment protection than noncommercial speech justices join the fray the court has struggled for years over this question without reaching a clear resolution , and some of the strains were evident during the argument today the court had many questions for the lawyers representing each side , and neither lawyer appeared prepared for some of the justices' most pertinent queries as often happens when the justices find an argument less than satisfactory , they jumped into the case themselves , in the process conducting a lively argument that revealed a great deal of their own inclinations why do you pick on commercial speech \? justice antonin scalia demanded of mark s yurick , cincinnati s assistant city solicitor without giving the lawyer a chance to respond , justice scalia continued , when i think back to the important decisions in my life , buying a house was one of the most important justice scalia said that for himself and for other home buyers getting information about the real estate market was much more important than the war in bosnia , yet cincinnati was trying to keep the real estate brochures out of the vending machines why is that speech so unimportant that it can be suppressed \? he asked mr yurick replied that the court itself has indicated that commercial speech is entitled to a lesser degree of protection space as a limiter justice scalia was not satisfied he said the court had allowed government to suppress commercial speech only for purposes that had something to do with the distinctive nature of commercial speech , as with advertising that was fraudulent but commercial speech does n't clutter up your sidewalks any more than other speech , does it \? justice scalia said marc d mezibov , a cincinnati lawyer for the two advertisers , also encountered skeptical responses to his assertion that the constitution did not permit the city to treat advertisers any differently than newspapers in the context of vending machine access justice sandra day o'connor noted that the supreme court itself maintains three vending machines for daily newspapers in a small alcove on the ground floor would the court be violating the first amendment , justice o'connor asked , if it refused a request from the publisher of an advertising brochure to add another machine \? or can we limit it and say we have a very small space and we have to allocate it somehow , she said mr mezibov hesitantly answered that the court might be able to justify a limitation on the basis of limited space well , in a sense are n't the city streets a finite resource that can get too cluttered \? justice o'connor asked the argument underscored one difficulty with the court s commercialspeech doctrine , that of deciding just what commercial speech is the cincinnati ordinances that give newspapers a right of access to vending machines while banning the distribution of commercial handbills on the streets do not define the two categories several justices commented that newspapers often carry large amounts of advertising the real estate advertising brochure in this case , in turn , occasionally carries articles about mortgage interest rates and related subjects is there a definition that divides the world into two categories , newspapers and commercial speech \? justice david h souter asked mr yurick , the city s lawyer mr yurick replied that the two were different and that 'newspaper' is not such a vague term that it ca n't be understood by a reasonable person justice souter asked , is n't your problem that the ordinance is inarticulate \? he added we have no idea what the city may decide to do next the case , cincinnati v discovery network , no 911200 , is an appeal from a 1991 ruling of the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit , which has its headquarters in cincinnati in the decision , written by judge danny j boggs , the appeals court said that commercial speech has a high value to the society and should be presumed to enjoy full first amendment protection except when it is false , deceptive , or proposes a commercial transaction that is itself illegal or would create some distinctive harmful effect the distribution of advertising brochures from vending machines fell into none of these categories , judge boggs said there were these other developments at the court today cap on damages the court , without comment , refused to hear a constitutional challenge to a cap on damage awards against the state , adopted by the colorado legislature the colorado governmental immunity act provides that the state s financial liability , in an accident in which the state is at fault , will be no more than 150 , 000 per person or 400 , 000 per accident the limitation was challenged on behalf of the 9 people who were killed and the 19 people who were injured when a 67ton boulder being moved by a state highway crew fell off a rocky mountain highway and hit a grey line sightseeing bus in august 1987 claims against the state are in the millions of dollars , but the 400 , 000 limit provides only 11 , 000 for each victim of the accident if the pool of money were to be divided equally the colorado supreme court upheld the cap as a valid economic regulation the case was defoor v pacheco , no 911922 detroit car dealers the court refused to hear a challenge by 94 detroit automobile dealers to a finding by the federal trade commission that a 20year agreement among them to limit their showroom hours and to remain closed on saturdays was a violation of federal antitrust law detroit is the only metropolitan area in the country in which automobile dealerships are closed on saturdays the dealers entered into the agreement as a way of limiting their employees' working hours in order to thwart a labor organizing drive by the international brotherhood of teamsters the sixth circuit upheld the trade commission s findings earlier this year , while sending the case back to the commission for further consideration of the hours the dealers should be required to stay open the case was detroit auto dealers v ftc , no 92333
ask the jets' rob carpenter what happened to him in cincinnati and new england last season that caused him to wash out in both places and you 're likely to get a puzzled look and a shrug of the shoulders i really ca n't explain it to you i have no idea , said carpenter , a secondyear wide receiver who was cut by the bengals after they drafted him out of syracuse in the fourth round and then was picked up by the patriots i do n't know what happened but i had a pretty good preseason as a rookie , carpenter said yesterday i was second on the bengals in receptions i knew they wanted to put me on the practice squad but that did n't work out because new england claimed me carpenter played in eight games for the patriots he started one game , caught three passes for 45 yards the longest for 23 and then was left unprotected on plan b and was picked up by the jets on march 16 six catches against falcons now carpenter seems to have found a home with the jets in sunday s 2017 defeat in atlanta , he was the jets' leading receiver with 6 catches for 109 yards his long one of 51 yards surpassed all of last season s numbers in one afternoon with his days as a patriot behind him and pleasantly forgotten , carpenter hopes to give the jets more spark in the receivers department , where the jets are deep and strong and he is reunited with rob moore , a fellow long islander and a teammate of carpenter at syracuse moore was a standout wide receiver at hempstead high school and carpenter played at amityville memorial high carpenter was recruited as a quarterback at notre dame but transferred from south bend after his freshman year in 1989 he used his passing skill to throw a 69yard bomb to moore on an endaround play for the orange it was fun , said carpenter about those college days two guys up there from the same area , running around on the field catching passes and scoring touchdowns that s always fun , and to come back now and be doing the same thing \? that just adds to it plenty of competition carpenter , however , has to find a place among the talented wide receivers , with al toon and moore , plus chris burkett , a former starter for buffalo , and terance mathis on board before deciding to get carpenter , the jets asked moore about him you know i'm not going to dog my boy , said moore we 're good friends so it s good to have him here and have an opportunity to do the things we did in college moore was second in catches for the jets last season with 70 , behind toon s 74 , but he led the team in yards with 987 to toon s 963 he also led in touchdown catches with five , one more than burkett toon had none the 6foot2inch , 190pound carpenter and moore , 63 and 205 , were 12 in catches on sunday moore had 5 receptions for 99 yards i hope there s a lot of that , said carpenter , who was scheduled to back up moore this year but went in during the second half to replace toon jets coach bruce coslet was pleased with carpenter s effort he played pretty well a great addition , said coslet al toon s hamstring tightened up on him at the half and we were afraid he was going to pull it some more so he did n't play too much in the second half we were going with some three wide receiver sets the whole day and rob came in instead in place of burkett we know he can play with browning nagle connecting on 21 of 37 passes for 366 yards and one touchdown in his first pro start , the jets' passing game was their most potent weapon their running produced only 68 yards carpenter was also used as a punt returner he returned 3 for 18 yards , a long one of 16 but some regrets one of carpenter s regrets , aside from the jets' loss , was sitting helplessly on the sidelines while the falcons used the last five and a half minutes of the game to seal the victory another was the sack suffered by nagle at the hands of jesse solomon in the fourth quarter carpenter was supposed to go in motion and pick up solomon , a blitzing linebacker i was supposed to go in motion but i did n't get the signal , said carpenter , who had been waiting for the cue from nagle they were on the silent snap because there was so much noise he was supposed to lift his leg i should 've gone in on my own but at the time the ball was already being snapped so there was nothing i could do extra points the jets placed rookie tight end johnny mitchell on injured reserve yesterday with a sprained shoulder the 63 , 263pound no 1 draft pick suffered a slight separation of his left shoulder in the jets' first drive of the second half on sunday after his only reception , a 23yard catch he now has to miss at least the next four weeks , and cannot return until oct 11 at indianapolis
badalona , spain , aug 8 on the goldmedal stand tonight , in their corporatesponsored suits with logos purposefully hidden , the multimillionaire professionals from the national basketball association were flanked by teams from tiny breakaway republics that could barely scrape together the funds necessary to attend to their right was the croatian team it had just defeated for the gold medal , 11785 , in their bland , identificationless uniforms straight out of the 1950 s to their left were the lithuanians , jubilant bronze medalists after their 8278 victory over the unified team , in their tiedyed shirts and shorts that were paid for by a rock band , the grateful dead the beat had gone on for the united states olympic basketball team right until the finish , but that did n't mean its participation in the 1992 summer olympics , and its successful mission to bring back the gold , was the greatest concert there ever was actually , the greatest basketball i 've ever been involved in was in monte carlo , said magic johnson he was referring to the dream team s intrasquad scrimmages croats avoid total drubbing the dream team might have conquered the world , but ambiguity ruled the final night , from the toni kukocled croatian team s ability to prevent a total drubbing to the sight of jordan draping the american flag over his right shoulder to block out the logo of a company that is a rival of the one he is associated with everyone agreed that we would not deface the logo , said jordan , referring to the dispute between the dreamers and the united states olympic committee the flag ca n't deface anything its raising was not without memorable touches , as johnson s smile and teary eyes lit up the arena , as john stockton sang the words to the anthem and larry bird held his hand over his heart but bird , while saying he appreciated the opportunity to have joined what is the greatest assemblage of team talent in the history of the sport , also understood what was lacking , through no fault of its own , from its success i 've cried at home when i 've seen americans win close races , said bird i think you would 've seen a lot more emotion up there if we had n't won every game by 50 points neither bird nor johnson , the greatest duet the nba has ever heard , would say what their future plans about continuing in the league were , though bird offered a tease when he announced , this is my last game tonight , paused for effect , then added the punch line , tomorrow we do n't know as for the future of basketball competition in the olympics , bird said he thought the breakup of countries like the soviet union and yugoslavia would prevent the world from soon making major progress in its attempt to gain ground on the nba johnson , on the other hand , warned that the united states should not return to the days of sending college boys to do what he said had become man s work if you 're going to send these college guys , it s going to be a problem , i'm telling you , he said you look at croatia , at lithuania these guys can play the alarm goes off he did n't mean at the level of the dream team , but no one , not even scottie pippen , was going to deny kukoc his due after a 16point , 9assist , 5rebound performance the united states had beaten the croats by 33 in their first meeting last week , and johnson said it would 've been easier getting up for the unified team , which it had n't played but denials to the contrary , the dreamers were none too pleased to look up at the scoreboard with 9 minutes 44 seconds left in the first half to see croatia 25 , usa 23 coach chuck daly and johnson talked about croatia s sound strategy of working the clock , but the truth is that the united states was finding out first hand why kukoc , who is likely to be a future teammate of jordan and pippen in chicago , is considered the best player in europe kukoc , who is 6 feet 10 inches and possesses the passing skills of a guard , and drazen petrovic loosened up the united states defense with their 3point shooting and then kukoc began finding his teammates for open shots with a brilliant display of passing enter barkley not surprisingly , it was the appearance of charles barkley , the best united states player in the tournament , that turned the world rightside up barkley returned the lead to the united states with a 3point shot , fed clyde drexler with a behindtheback hit on the break , hit david robinson on another break and then spun along the baseline for a dunk and free throw poof the united states soon led by 18 the closest the croats would come in the second half was 7253 , but an 110 run made it 8053 photo magic johnson greeting a lithuanian player on the medals stand yesterday \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) david robinson of the us defending against croatia s toni kukoc as magic johnson moved in on the play \( associated press \) \( pg 4 \)

marnelavallee , france when the walt disney company embarked on the ambitious blitz of building that would make it , by the late 1980 s , the world s most talkedabout corporate patron of architecture , it seemed mainly to be assembling trophies a michael graves building here , a robert a m stern one there the architects were hired to design standalone objects , attractions to embellish the company s huge resort property in orlando , fla , and its headquarters campus in burbank , calif for better or worse , these buildings were fitted into existing disney environments but when the time came to plan the 45 billion project 20 miles west of paris that would become euro disney resort , there was no environment to fit into disney bought 5 , 000 acres of farmland and set out to construct a theme park , an entertainment complex and a cluster of hotels and for the first time , it left the job of making a master plan to its collection of celebrated architects graves , stern , frank gehry , stanley tigerman , robert venturi and antoine grumbach at least , that s the group that gathered over a weekendlong work session in new york early in 1988 to lay out euro disney the final roster of architects who got to design buildings around the theme park was somewhat different , but no matter given disney s high profile , this planning team may well have thought of its gathering as a latterday equivalent of the legendary collaboration of stanford white , charles mckim , daniel burnham and augustus saintgaudens , among others , who joined forces to design the chicago world s fair of 1893 white called that assemblage the greatest gathering of artists since the renaissance there would be scant reason even to try such hyperbole this time , since the overall result , the layout of the disney property , is a disappointment , and no advertisement for the virtues of collaboration there s a fair amount of striking architecture at euro disney , but the whole is less than the sum of the parts the most inventive thing to come out of the collaboration was the idea that the hotels should represent american themes , reversing the venerable american tradition of copying european architectural styles none of this has been enough to attract the vast crowds disney officials were confidently predicting when the resort opened , on april 12 whether because of reports of technical troubles , fear of traffic , a disdain for american popular culture or a preference for soaking it up in orlando , it has become clear after the first two months that europeans are n't storming disney s gates the heart of euro disney is a theme park almost exactly like the original disneyland in anaheim , calif , and the magic kingdom at orlando it s an improved version of a timetested design main street up the middle and themed lands arrayed around a central castle at euro disney , the castle is much grander than its predecessors , and many rides are improved by more advanced technology the best architectural improvement is the arcades that run behind main street , ornate versions of the grand , glassroofed shopping arcades of edwardian london and many american cities at the beginning of the century it s a splendid way of providing shelter in the inclement climate of france outside the theme park gate , the layout of the disney acreage seems guided by a desire to be both imperial and laid back , to mix versailles with mickey mouse do the great axial vistas of french classical architecture make a friendly family vacation experience \? not naturally when you drive onto this property and see robert a m stern s overblown , mock shinglestyle newport bay club hotel at the end of a regal vista , what you sense is a curious confusion of images is this american architecture pretending to be french or french beauxarts grandeur cloaking itself in american garb \? you are never quite sure beyond the newport bay , which at 1 , 100 rooms is said by disney to be the largest hotel in western europe , four other hotels and an entertainment complex are arranged casually around a manmade lake the entertainment complex , a kind of indooroutdoor street of shops and restaurants designed by frank gehry , may be the best thing on the property with its lively signs and bold metal structure , it s certainly the part of euro disney that manages to have the most architectural integrity , the best proof here that it s possible to design something that is as much fun as a stage set without being one the hotels themselves are a mixed bag the newport bay club is an amiable attempt to evoke the spirit of american turnofthecentury resort architecture , but its vast size makes its sweetness seem somewhat disingenuous surprisingly more successful is the hotel sequoia , designed by the one nonamerican in the group , the french architect antoine grumbach this hotel , intended to evoke the lodges in the national parks of the american west , looks from afar more like a sprawling suburban corporate headquarters but the public spaces inside are wonderful and call to mind frank lloyd wright s great arizona house , taliesin west , in a way that manages to be convincing rather than condescending this may be the first frank lloyd wright theme park building ever built
hilton head , sc , dec 30 the sight of the presidentelect and the first ladyelect arriving here today with monogrammed \( bc and hrc \) matching overstuffed boxes of work papers to celebrate new year s eve by talking about personal and national renewal with 1 , 500 friends invites the question is america really ready for the renaissance \? can the politesse of an intellectual salon replace where s mine \? in american politics \? is the average congressman evolved enough in his quest for personal renewal to embrace the manners of the group encounter \? if the time has come for new age politics , what will be done with all the old age politicians \? can the reasoned , reasonable talk of the renaissance weekend replace the pushing , grasping , gouging ways of washington \? the renaissance weekend , the fourday symposium that brought the clintons here this week , began 12 years ago in the mind of a man named philip lader , who was then president of the sea pines plantation , the prototype resort of this most planned of all communities mr lader , whose work had taught him the value of both group consensus and making friends , had a vision that was at once practical and utopian influential 'extended family' on the practical level , he thought it would be a good thing to establish a network , with himself at the center , of a lot of influential , wellconnected , very successful people on the utopian side , he proposed to structure this network or extended family , as he called it not around any gatherings where fun was had for fun s sake , but around annual weekend retreats in which the participants would be open and sharing of their vulnerabilities and toward the building of an inner life he figured the way to personal and national renewal lay in the redemptive power of stimulating conversation , and he designed a program around four very long days of group discussions covering everything from the most contentious of public policies to the most personal of family matters with such a range , it would seem renaissance weekend chats could get ugly , but they never do they are free and frank and open , yet very civilized this is by painstaking design all of the people involved every year , who pay 325 for couples or 250 for individuals , are selected to fit in with mr lader s design , and those who are too pushy for themselves or their beliefs one year are , as they say here , disinvited the next bill clinton , eightyear renaissance weekend veteran , always fit in perfectly , his fellow talkers say indeed , they say , the renaissance spirit \( it is a phrase that somehow comes out capitalized \) is the spirit of the clinton age the idea of the renaissance spirit is that there can be a diversity of ideas but that it should be done on very friendly terms , where you respect where people are coming from , in a way that is similar to the sort of english drawing room discussion i experienced at oxford , said tom schneider , an 11year participant to the extent that there is any ideology involved , people know that there are limits and that you do n't have to win the relationships are the important thing , and you do n't want to take any disagreement to the point where it might destroy relationships on tuesday afternoon , shortly after the clintons arrived for their sixday vacation built around renaissance weekend , mr schneider ran into his old friend mr clinton the two men chatted about mr clinton s recent economic conference in little rock , ark , at which mr schneider was a guest , and mr clinton compared it to a much smaller event a little more than a year before a fundraiser that mr schneider arranged at his washington law firm for the newly announced presidential candidate bill clinton for that fundraiser , i had the idea of making it like renaissance weekend , a friendly , open issues discussion , mr schneider recalled talking to bill yesterday , he connected the economic summit back to that he said the economic summit was just like that first fundraiser , but 10 times larger and then he said , 'and that s what the renaissance is really like' and he s right in real terms , the economic summit was modeled on an art form that was developed down here mr schneider s point seems well taken the 19hour economic conference he was host to in little rock last month was strikingly in keeping with the renaissance weekend model courtesy is central of the more than 300 attendees at the economic conference , many expressed opinions diverging from one another , but none expressed a point of view fundamentally in opposition to the central suppositions on the table and in favor of the conservative , republican approach to economics less taxes , smaller government although the guest list included democrats whose ideologies made them theoretical enemies , the tone of the gathering was one of determined amity this seems to be a very renaissance way of doing things in the panel discussions \( with topics and participants selected by mr lader and his wife , linda \) , diversity of views is encouraged , but only , as mr schneider suggested , to a polite point
east northport , li , dec 18 in the latest twist in the border wars between new york and new jersey , a small long island dairy has begun an advertising campaign that features a cow grazing contentedly on the asphalt in front of a petrochemical plant ever wonder why milk from new jersey does n't taste as fresh as ours \? the ad asks in bold black type the tongueincheek campaign , which began this week in a weekly newspaper on the east end , touts the supposed advantages of milk that does not have to travel the extra hours on the bumpy highways from new jersey to the island but one basic fact is left out none of the long island dairy s milk comes from long island cows no more cows oak tree farm dairy , a familyrun business here , has pasteurized , homogenized and distributed milk around long island for 50 years cows once grazed on its 37acre property , but in the 1950 s , the cosman family , the dairy s owner , moved them upstate now , it trucks 18 , 000 gallons of milk daily from farms near syracuse to the company s long island plant , where it is processed the absence of long island cows , however , has not stopped oak tree from firing a protectionist broadside intended to appeal to long island milk drinkers' local pride there s a very strong sense of loyalty to 'buying long island , ' and we want to capitalize on it , said charlene cosman , the dairy s chief financial officer people like the idea of keeping other long islanders working miss cosman also insisted that her company s milk was fresher and thus tasted better than her competitors' milk other dairies disagreed , and dairy experts were skeptical the campaign arrives amid heightened tension between new jersey and new york a few weeks ago , gov jim florio of new jersey announced a plan to lure away new york businesses more recently , new york announced efforts to crack down on shoppers who cross the hudson river to try to avoid new york s higher sales tax dweck campbell , the manhattan advertising agency that created the campaign , said it began work on it months before the border war began , but that it was pleased with the timing the ad is running in dan s paper , a free weekly that says it reaches 83 , 000 readers on the east end and in new york city the agency plans to expand to other newspapers and is considering radio and television it is unclear whether the ad has had any impact or whether long islanders care where their milk comes from 'from new jersey \? ' at a pathmark supermarket in commack this afternoon , a few miles from the dairy , six customers picked up storelabel milk and cream , under a handlettered sign saying they were from tuscan farms in union , nj none were aware of the products' origins , but when asked whether they had a preference between new jersey milk and long island milk , it was like asking marines whether they loved the flag this is from new jersey \? asked joe o'connor , a retired construction worker from smithtown where can i get long island milk \? i want to keep my money here joan ciliotta , a nurse from fort salonga , said she thought that long island milk might be fresher , but she said that would not affect what she bought i buy milk where it s convenient , she said miss cosman is banking on the idea that long islanders , hit hard by the current recession , will feel strongly about standing by one of their own her father established the dairy in 1941 , when there was , she said , a dairy every 250 feet today , all three cosman children work there the number of dairies on the island has dwindled from more than 12 in the 1960 s to 2 a few years ago oak tree became the last when the other was bought by a group that wanted to convert the land into a polo field miss cosman said oak tree milk is sold in 500 convenience stores , groceries and delicatessens on long island she declined to provide sales figures or information about profits until five years ago , ads like oak tree s would have been unneeded , because new york law barred milk from out of state now , most of the milk sold on long island is processed elsewhere , much of it by two new jersey companies tuscan farms and farmland dairies in wallington miss cosman said the ads simply highlight better quality from the time the milk is homogenized and pasteurized , oak tree gets it into the stores faster , particularly on the east end , she said the ad states new jersey milk must travel more miles than our milk to get to you plus it has to spend time near the new jersey turnpike , an activity that has never improved anything not surprisingly , dairy executives in new jersey are miffed since when is the jersey turnpike any worse than the long island expressway \? said colin kagel , vice president of administration for tuscan farms he added i was born in new york and raised in long island i have nothing against long island but we 're all getting our milk from the same cows asked to respond to the ad , david bandler , a food science professor specializing in the dairy industry at cornell university , said he was hesitant to become embroiled in the dispute this is not science , he said it is merchandising or whatever you want to call it the milk from new jersey , the milk from pennsylvania , the milk from new york all meets the same requirements of the pasteurized milk ordinance of the united states public health service , he said michael dweck , president of dweck campbell , said his agency s strategy was to run eyecatching ads that would provoke an outraged response asked if he was concerned about misleading consumers , mr dweck said it was intentional exaggeration and was not meant to be taken seriously the controversy is to some degree calculated this is oak tree s first campaign , mr dweck said , and its 500 , 000 advertising budget is not enough to establish a strong brand identity with straight product advertising the agency has scheduled a second ad for dec 31 that makes the first one look mild it shows a cow with three eyes in front of the three mile island nuclear power plant the ad starts , what is it about milk from pennsylvania that gives us a bad feeling \? mr dweck said that he had been brainstorming for weeks on an ad impugning connecticut the problem , he said with a sigh , is that it s hard to find something bad to say about connecticut with new jersey , he said , it took about three and a half seconds photos the oak tree farm dairy has begun an ad campaign to appeal to long island milk drinkers' local pride \( pg 25 \) the oak tree farm dairy trucks 18 , 000 gallons of milk daily from farms near syracuse to the company s long island plant , where it is processed workers checked the bottled product on an assembly line \( vic delucia the new york times \) the dairy s new advertising campaign arrives amid heightened tensions in the border wars between new york and new jersey \( pg 28 \)

milwaukee , march 14 the air was chilly and choked with rain the other day as shirley lowery wrapped a white scarf over her head and hurried into the county courthouse here she did not want to be late she felt that her freedom and even her life were at stake before then , mrs lowery , a bus driver , had been hiding out for days like a criminal she had even moved , with the help of bodyguards , to a secret new apartment but when she walked into the courthouse alone that morning , she did so , her daughter said , because she thought she 'd be safe in the halls of justice a few minutes later , the 51yearold woman , a grandmother of 11 , was dead murder in courthouse shortly after 9 am on march 9 , mrs lowery was stabbed 19 times with an 8inch butcher knife in a courthouse hallway she was attacked just feet from room 707 , where she was going to request a twoyear injunction against the man she had recently fled and deeply feared , benjamin franklin , her livein companion mr franklin , 52 , was arrested moments after the attack as mrs lowery lay on the tile floor near him he also had a loaded 22caliber pistol with him mr franklin was charged with firstdegree murder , but he has not entered a plea his next court appearance is scheduled for friday nearly 1 murder in 3 in 1990 , the last year for which the federal bureau of investigation has figures , 30 percent of 4 , 399 women identified as murder victims in this country were slain by their boyfriends or husbands since 1985 , the percentage of murdered women who are killed by their boyfriends or husbands has hovered around that figure , according to the bureau s uniform crime reporting unit in addition , millions of women are beaten every year by their male partners , and experts say at least 20 percent of all women seeking assistance in hospital emergency rooms are there because of domestic violence dr carole warshaw , a psychiatrist who is an expert on domestic violence and for more than eight years was an emergency room doctor at cook county hospital in chicagor , said the greatest risk of getting killed is when the woman attempts to leave , as we 've just seen in milwaukee the husband or the partner ca n't tolerate the idea of her leaving , dr warshaw said at heart of system the death of mrs lowery saddened this city because of the viciousness of the slaying and , even more perhaps , because of where it happened in the weary heart of the system she had hoped would help and protect her my mother had so much confidence in the courthouse , said mrs lowery s daughter , vannessa davis but if you ca n't go to the courthouse , what kind of hope do these women have \?

ralph cooper 2d s ears hurt the phones had been going helterskelter all day he took a call hi , you 're an act \? he said when are you going to be in town \? achoo excuse me , my hay fever now , you know there s no cursing \? what s the group s name \? sounds funky' that s cute , real cute now , i assume you 're going to do an original tune for this audience , you better be kicking or they do n't want to hear it they 'll run you out of there squealing ok , i 've got to jump off he pounced on another call , someone feverishly promoting a singer yes , i feel she can be the first video babe of the 90 s , mr cooper said now i got to jump my hay fever is kicking going crazy is what he was doing , what he did at the start of every week , when he began to map out that weekly showbusiness institution , ralph cooper s original harlem amateur night at the apollo theater ralph cooper , ralph cooper 2d s father , invented it in 1935 , and is still the host and the producer ralph cooper 2d is the cohost and supervises the madcap preparatory work the show has its indisputable virtues each week , it manages to flush out a bit of new talent as well as to persuade many others that a life of office work might not be so bad ralph cooper 2d s headquarters is four blocks from the apollo , which is at 253 west 125th street in harlem it s an unprepossessing tworoom suite with blue carpeting , fake wood paneling , fluorescent lights , a water cooler and a portable refrigerator the genial mr cooper sat at a scarred table with two beige phones , their cords tangled from use in a week , he hears a lifetime s worth of wretched singing this is a real fantasy land here , he said the fantasy sometimes comes true of course , most of the time it does n't after being on the show , many rethink their entertainment careers one bedeviled young man flew in from los angeles and could only squeeze in eight bars of his song before he was roundly booed off the stage he presumably rethought his entertainment career on the flight back the legendary event happens , as it always has , on wednesday night the dream of contestants is to ignite one of those sugary careers that get you booked into the apollo or maybe radio city for a weekend concert of their very own and a megadollar recording contract like michael jackson s it s not all that farfetched , for , on a magical night in the late 1960 s , the jackson five themselves came the way of amateur night and rocked the house other embers of past glory include ella fitzgerald , sam cook , aretha franklin , dionne warwick , gladys knight , marvin gaye , luther vandross , richard pryor and billie holiday \( whom ralph cooper discovered at the hotcha spaghetti place \) some of the best of the present amateurs find themselves on it s showtime at the apollo , a weekly television show that is seen in the new york area on channel 4 at 1 in the morning after saturday night live ralph cooper 2d recounted the way amateur night worked applicants come from down the block or as far away as japan if a transatlantic flight is n't involved , they 're asked to audition on monday night otherwise , a tape will suffice some applicants get on next week some get on six months later some stopped by in 1985 and still are n't on each week , the four acts that are judged best by audience applause receive cash prizes ranging from 50 to 200 and get to return for a monthly show off competition the winners then graduate to the quarterly top dog show those winners fight each other in the amateur of the year competition in december getting on toward dusk , mr cooper walked around the corner to the second floor of the national black theater here was where auditions were conducted in a square , scruffy room he strolled in and sank into a metal chair before a narrow table about two dozen nervy performers had shown up all of them emanated hope it was doubtful any would get on the show for at least a couple of months but you never knew who would come by i always hold a few slots , mr cooper said , in case i find the next michael jackson or the next anita baker variety helped , for mr cooper liked to mix up singers and dancers with magicians , jugglers and some novelty acts , if he found any the show has had basketball players shooting baskets on unicycles , men who walked on nails , a disabled magician and a fellow who fired sparklers throughout the theater novelty acts are in short supply , mr cooper said with a grimace getting a sparkler guy is not easy mr cooper addressed the aspirants ok , absolutely no cursing of any kind anyway , anywhere your act has to be three minutes long if you have to cut a verse to get to three minutes , cut the top , middle or end verse you cannot do medley one song per singer we will pull the curtain on you if you try it also , do n't freak out i will stop you where i need to stop you you do n't have to perform the whole song now ok , bang , here we go music pulsated as the first performer began she was a young woman with a snagged smile mr cooper watched with low enthusiasm she sang for a minute and he hollered , ok , out out ! she dropped off her application card and beat a hasty retreat a rap singer with an ineffectual voice got 45 seconds of mr cooper s time
hollywood , feb 2 remember la \? woody allen made fun of its quirkiness , its climate , its healthfood fads , its waiters who introduce themselves and virtually inform you that they 're your new best friend bette davis , as a broadway star in all about eve , sneered at her boyfriend , a director , for leaving new york to make a little movie in , of all places , los angeles for decades , film makers served up los angeles with nothing less than condescension , while new york was a metaphor for the cultural upside and also the gritty downside of life in recent years , the grit of new york has overtaken the glamour new york s gangs , violence and ethnic tensions have stamped many films the random craziness of walking new york s streets was central to the movies of the 1970 s and 1980 s now , movie makers are swerving away from new york and confronting an easier target just outside their palmshaded windows los angeles and it s hardly the woody allen portrait it s a bloody and violent town just like new york but with a difference why pick on new york when it s down \? asked laurence mark , a producer la will always be like brigadoon a place lost in time , even when it grapples with reality it s somehow a heightened kind of reality , a reality with a coat of shellac perfect for movies it may be awful , it may be nightmarish , but there s always a coat of shellac on it certainly the shellac will thicken in the next months as tougher los angelesbased movies surface only recently , steve martin s la story mocked , with an edge not entirely affectionate , the trendiness and wackiness of the city s upperclass west side now , in lawrence kasdan s grand canyon , six people in los angeles cram more freefloating urban anxiety into one movie than all the neurotics in woody allen s new yorkbased films not only are mr kasdan s people enduring personal angst , but the film also depicts homelessness , gang terror , sudden violence , heart attacks and even an earthquake at one point , kevin kline , playing a yuppie immigration lawyer , philosophizes that there seems to be so much wrong in the world , particularly in this city danny glover , as a tow truck driver , grumbles about this ugly town in fact , the city seems to be on the edge of collapse woody allen used to bash la from the outside , said michael tolkin , a screenwriter for a forthcoming film , the player , a satirical thriller set in hollywood and directed by robert altman now we 're into selfloathing part of the reason is as a city matures , as it becomes more complex , people start to introspect a little more the introspection has been spurred , in part , by a new wave of black and hispanic film makers based in los angeles john singleton s boyz n the hood , about black teenagers in the los angeles ghetto , was one of 1991 s most acclaimed and successful movies coming up in the next six months are white men ca n't jump , a story about basketball hustlers , written and directed by ron shelton american me , about the streets of east los angeles , directed by and starring edward james olmos , and blood in blood out , an epic set in the city s hispanic neighborhoods , directed by taylor hackford the films about teenagers , violence and poverty in los angeles are only a fraction of the ones set in the city mike nichols said that 'the graduate' was about the los angelization of the world , and i think it s finally come true , said kit carson , who has written screenplays for films including paris , texas the city is now really cropping up again and again as a metaphor but nancy meyers , who with her partner , charles shyer , is one of the more successful makers of comedy films \( among them father of the bride \) , said look , they 're always telling us to write about what we know maybe there are too many of us here maybe we all really need to get out of la more one film maker who consistently sought to tackle los angeles with seriocomic results was paul mazursky his 1970 film alex in wonderland included references to the smog and a fantasy scene in which maids revolt in beverly hills his other films chided los angeles phenomena like the sexual revolution , hippies and the nouveau riche what happened now is that la is simply more of a city , for better and worse more violent , more crowded , more polluted , he said and on the positive side , it s become more ethnic new york always had ethnics now , ethnics are making movies here and they 're dealing with problems gangs , corruption , violence that used to be just associated with new york not anymore ingoring the critics although film critics may have clout , some recent pictures emerging as successful seem impervious to soso reviews the addams family was a major moneymaker despite mediocre reviews and two lowbudget current films , the hand that rocks the cradle , about a psychotic nanny seeking revenge , and fried green tomatoes , a gentle movie about a group of southern women , have shown surprising strength among audiences despite some soso reviews years ago , such reviews could have killed the movies but not now

whose ages range from 8 to 16 years they were born to four different women , none of whom he married or promised longterm assistance each of the mothers receives welfare payments to help her raise the children , whom mr sherman now says he fathered impulsively and recklessly yet , he cites fond memories a recent train trip to philadelphia with his 12yearold son , playful romps in a city park with the youngest children , and the fondest memory of them all the day he learned , at age 16 , that he had first impregnated a girl i was one of the happiest guys around , he said as he rubbed the stubble on his chin on top of the world in rapid succession , mr sherman fathered more children at one point 12 years ago , three women were simultaneously pregnant with his children i was wild like all kids , he offered by way of explanation now , mr sherman , who has been unemployed for much of the last year , is searching for work , in part so he can begin paying the 60 a week total he owes in child support born to welfare the extent to which the nation s welfare rolls can be trimmed may depend , in large part , on whether other absent fathers , like mr sherman , choose to support their children in 1990 , 54 percent of the children on welfare had parents who never married an additional 33 percent had parents who had divorced or separated , according to data compiled by the house ways and means committee nearly half of all families headed by single mothers lived in poverty one parent should not be expected to do the job of two , said david t ellwood , a poverty expert at harvard university in a singleparent family , children need support from both parents adding to the ranks of the poor , and making the question of child support all the more pressing , is a soaring rate of outofwedlock births thirty years ago , 1 in every 40 white children was born to an unmarried mother today it is 1 in 5 , according to federal data among blacks , 2 of 3 children are born to an unmarried mother 30 years ago the figure was 1 in 5 studies show that nevermarried mothers are far more likely than divorced mothers to become chronically dependent on welfare like many other unwed fathers , mr sherman said he fathered children in his adolescence with little consideration for the implications for years , he said , he held a number of modestpaying jobs and tried , when he could , to give the mothers of his children money or milk to help out he said he also tried to maintain some sort of fatherly relationships with his children but the ties were tenuous , he said , made tense by his unexplained absences of weeks at a time and too many broken promises now mr sherman says he wants to become a more traditional father , more directly involved in his children s lives , a breadwinner who rescues his children from the welfare rolls but he is finding that becoming a responsible parent after so many years is terribly difficult , financially and emotionally mr sherman , a former construction worker with a highschool education , searches almost every day for a goodpaying job with the exception of occasional temporary work , he has been unemployed for ayear i 've got to get a job because i do n't want my children to want for nothing , mr sherman said as he sat in the city s employment office their christmas would be starting the day i got that job he acknowledged , too , that he must find gainful work to forestall the looming threat of jail for nonpayment of child support pride and anger rejected fathers refuse support only a small minority of unmarried mothers who receive welfare have childsupport orders in place , and of those who do , money is seldom collected federal laws on child support have been toughened in recent years many states are demanding that mothers who receive welfare name the fathers of their children , and some states are using blood and genetic tests to establish paternity and issue support orders the growing national awareness of child support was evident in gov bill clinton s speech accepting the democratic presidential nomination last week , when he said of fathers who owe child support , we 're going to make you pay but as the stories of mr sherman and other young men here in the poorer neighborhoods of baltimore show , the question of child support is enmeshed in the job prospects of fathers and it is entangled in the stormy relationships between men and women in impoverished environments where sexual liaisons are often casual and regarded as therapeutic , where bearing children out of wedlock has become the rule jesse b , a 36yearold father of a 14yearold boy , said he and his son were not even close because of longbrewing troubles between him and the boy s mother , whom he had not married a daughter discovered i know i did n't spend the right time with him , said jesse , who spoke on condition that his full name not be used he said he is not proud of the fact that i just was n't there for his son
mineola , li , jan 3 six minutes after the historically staid nassau county board of supervisors convened in its darkpaneled meeting room today , the fireworks began lewis j yevoli , the newly swornin democratic supervisor from oyster bay , looked around in confusion and asked , when can i speak \? then , taking the floor , he lambasted the county for paying 550 , 000 in what he termed unnecessary legal fees , much of it to wellconnected republican law firms as usual , lou , i think you are wrong , barked the county attorney , robert w schmidt , a republican leader from plainview but this is the first statement i have made before the board , mr yevoli said in mock frustration , to applause from a crowd of several hundred residents that spilled out into the corridors the power to say no this is nassau county government 1992 , a government that has been changed profoundly by an election that gave the democratic party its first significant taste of power if only the power to say no in a county that has been a bastion of republican rule for 75 years at the new board s first meeting , partisan squabbling delayed indefinitely the passage of a critical spending measure , known as ordinance one , authorizing the county to issue paychecks to its 16 , 000 employees during the new year in the ensuing confusion , republicans , citing an opinion by mr schmidt , said they could go ahead and issue the checks anyway , while democrats , citing an independent opinion , threatened to sue republican officials who issue the checks the sixmember board of supervisors , a first cousin of the disbanded new york city board of estimate , operates on a complicated system of weighted voting to assure a balance of power between the county s towns and cities none of this mattered very much during decades of republican rule , when budgets were passed as a matter of routine and the county could regularly raise taxes to pay for abundant government services but now , after a string of election victories , and in the midst of a county budget crisis , democrats have enough votes to block republican measures , but not enough votes to pass their own , creating a potential impasse on every issue punch and judy shows this threatens to transform board meetings from orderly and austere public events to something that looks more like punch and judy shows , as republicans and democrats alike seek to score points in elections several years in the future this was like a charade here , mr yevoli , a former state assemblyman , said in amazement as the board meeting broke up for lunch no one has the slightest idea what is going on , what is in the budget the democrats' new power began to be felt even before mr yevoli was sworn in on jan 1 in a preemptive republican budgetcutting exercise that trimmed 4 , 000 county jobs , and slashed county services , especially services to the poor and elderly while the republicans say they were simply responding to antitax voter sentiment , other officials saw the budgetcutting as a scorched earth policy in which cuts were so severe that democrats would have little choice but to support future tax increases to restore services the nassau county medical center has been hard hit by budget cuts , and a board member , who would speak only on condition of anonymity , commented the republican majority is decimating services in order to preclude the democrats from looking good it is the banality of evil at its worst jockeying over staff then , in separate behindthescenes negotiations leading to today s meetings , democrats and republicans jockeyed over staff some would say patronage with the democrats threatening to block all spending measures unless they got at least 500 , 000 of the 12 million budgeted all this came to a head in the wrangling over ordinance one , the spending measure that is routinely the first item on the board s agenda each year the democrats , saying they wanted to put an end to patronage and waste in government , said they would not authorize any spending on noncivil service jobs without first conducting a linebyline and namebyname review of the county payroll republicans agreed to provide the democrats with the information they sought but refused to authorize spending for civilservice employees unless the others were also included this set the stage for a messy showdown , at least until the county attorney ruled that last year s spending authority remained in effect , permitting the checks to go out spending cuts protested the deep spending cuts produced a parade of witnesses before the board , complaining about reductions in programs for the elderly and the parks , as well as the elimination of programs at the medical center , from abortion services to a poisoncontrol hot line to a clinic for multiply disabled children one woman , lorraine soldinger , told the board that her 8yearold daughter , crystal , who suffers from cerebral palsy and is legally blind , was able to walk for the first time a few weeks ago , with the help of doctors from the clinic she held up a photograph of the county executive , thomas s gulotta , visiting with her daughter when she was hospitalized several years ago for an operation at the medical center mr gulotta , who inscribed the photograph , was distributing stuffed animals at christmas you told me you will be there when i need you , mrs soldinger said to mr gulotta well , honey , i need you
simply brahms alice tully hall the two concerts of brahms s four symphonies , presented last week by the american symphony orchestra with little ballyhoo under the rubric simply brahms , cried out for more explanation performances of brahms symphonies are not so rare that a complete cycle automatically recommends itself , particularly in a hall that does not allow even a mediumsize orchestra of 69 players room to breathe expansively most likely , the project was conceived as a showcase for yondani butt , who was advertised as a special guest conductor mr butt , a youngish musician who was born to chinese parents in macao , has also studied chemistry though he received his musical education largely in the united states , he is scarcely known here except to record collectors familiar with his outings in obscure repertory what mr butt displayed at the first concert , on friday evening , was an ability to prepare an orchestra well in brahms s tragic overture and symphonies nos 2 and 4 , the american symphony played with tight ensemble and generally good blend and intonation that the winds tended to overbalance the strings may have been inevitable , given their relative numbers and the small hall s dry acoustics for the rest , the results were not especially impressive in straightforward , uneventful interpretations , mr butt offered few fresh insights into these welltraveled scores his slow tempos tended to be brisk , his fast tempos moderate , and none of them allowed much flexibility for moments of static mystery or intense lyricism a preconcert chamber recital offered a poorly tuned account of brahms s eminor cello sonata \( op 38 \) by nancy jo snider , with haskell small a deft but reticent partner on the piano , and a workmanlike performance of brahms s cminor piano trio \( op 101 \) by the figaro trio

the big winner in the second presidential debate was the audience i'm not just talking about the people who asked the candidates the questions in that studio in virginia , although as a journalist i feel an obligation to say a few things about them , none of which are particularly flattering to my trade they asked better questions than we have cooked up in other such forums they were informed without being obscure and personal without being maudlin they stayed on the issues they did n't try to show off the improved tone of the second debate was not because of a stroke of statesmanship or the steady hand of any reporter it was largely because one man with a ponytail and penchant for therapyspeak pleaded with the candidates to can the mudslinging , to cross their hearts and make a commitment to meet our needs , and we have many , and not yours he shamed them with authenticity the people in that studio reflected millions of people watching all over the united states , and they deserve this declaration we 've done 'em wrong conventional wisdom has been that americans are disgusted with the level of political campaigns , convinced that their opinion does n't count and disenchanted by the lack of heros all those things are true , but they have led us to a false conclusion that the average american voter is tuned out and turned off the facts are otherwise the overnight neilsens showed that almost five times as many people watched the first debate as the baseball playoff game , and those numbers did n't even count viewers of cable or public television a new york times poll recently asked people whether they were paying a lot of attention , some attention , not much attention or no attention to this race fiftyfour percent of the respondents said they were paying a lot of attention , up 20 points from 1988 it does n't sound as if americans hate presidential politics what they do hate , what led some to ross perot and his crackerbarrel campaign , are the spinmeisters who operate on the premise that voters are consumers and government is laundry detergent new ! improved ! in a nice box ! the night of the second presidential debate someone in the bush quayle camp mistakenly sent to some newsroom fax machines , including my own , a talking points memo meant for campaign workers tonight was a clear win , a big win for the president , said the memo , written before the debate began bill clinton came in a cautious and weak third place the instructions that followed suggested read the talking points so you are aware of the bushquayle campaign s spin' from tonight s debate tomorrow , you will receive letters to the editor points that can also be used to write opeds issue a news release declaring the president the winner if there are any talkradio shows on the air , call and praise the president s performance please use the talking points it is imperative that all surrogates are giving the same message sending the surrogates forth to spread the spin in lockstep is commonplace in political campaigns but it has its limits and those limits were clear thursday , in the sincerity of that unspun and uncommitted crowd one young africanamerican woman will be remembered for her singlehanded illumination of why george bush will likely not serve a second term her question was a simple one of the empathy variety how has the national debt personally affected each of your lives \? it was not that mr bush did not have a ready answer it was that he was completely flummoxed by the question he floundered around , asked to have it rephrased , finally came up with a disjointed response neither personal nor sensible despite the talking points conclusion that mr bush seized the momentum tonight , that moment was disastrous for a president who has seemed estranged from the pain of the people the candidates were much improved , the format and the setting both better but it was the audience that did the most to lift the second presidential debate above the adolescent bickering of the quaylegore meeting , and the torpor of the first debate a week ago those people made you remember what so often gets lost in the spin , the positioning , the reporters' analysis , the network leadall this is about them , about they the people we write stories they elect presidents
matapedia , quebec heavy clouds filled the valley of the matapedia river , a fine rain was falling , and darkness and mist were closing in i need to be able to see the rocks in the rough water on our way back , mr bryant , said kevin gauthier , my young guide , so i guess this will be our last drop when fly fishing from a canoe for atlantic salmon , you begin at the upper end of a salmonholding pool or run , covering with gradually longer casts all the water you can reach from the anchored craft , then drop 100 feet or so downstream , anchor and repeat the ritual kevin and i had gone three miles upriver to fraser pool earlier that afternoon in our outboardpowered canoe , starting out from the landing just opposite the cold spring salmon camp , where kevin works as a guide the camp is about five miles upstream from the matapedia s confluence with the ristigouche , one of canada s best rivers for large salmon during that afternoon and the three days of fishing that preceded it , the salmon of the matapedia , the ristigouche and the upsalquitch had spurned my offerings on two of those days i never saw or raised a fish , an astonishing change of pace from a visit to the upsalquitch and the ristigouche in midjuly , when cold water and lots of it had produced superlative angling for both salmon and grilse a grilse is a small salmon that returns to its natal stream after only one year at sea when anglers speak of catching a salmon , they are referring to the larger salmon that have spent two or more years at sea in new brunswick , the daily limit is two grilse , and you must release all salmon in quebec , the daily limit is one salmon you are done for the day if your first fish is a salmon if it s a grilse , you may keep it and continue to try for a salmon my host on both trips was joseph cullman 3d , who , with his brother edgar , has a salmon camp on the upsalquitch \( two brook \) and another on the ristigouche \( runnymeade \) on the second excursion , cullman had lined up additional waters for his guests to fish , including those of the cold spring camp on the matapedia and those of the ristigouche salmon club on both the matapedia and the ristigouche until that last afternoon with kevin , my only action had come from grilse on two occasions , grilse made passes at my fly but missed it another was hooked but pulled free after a short run i did catch a nice 6pounder on my last drop of the second evening while fishing with kevin on the matapedia only one of us , robert marschalk , had taken salmon he had two of them the larger of the two , a 17pounder , took a dry fly , a brown bomber , that marschalk had drifted over him 30 or 40 times on my final afternoon cullman had asked me where and with whom i would like to fish no salmon had been caught on the ristigouche or upsalquitch by any of us , so i chose kevin and the matapedia i enjoy kevin s company and it had been with him that i had caught my only fish up to that time i had a hunch that we were a lucky combination clearly , i mused that last afternoon when kevin said we had to leave , my hunch had been wrong i made my final cast on that drop and we headed back we had gone only a short distance when kevin cut the engine and said this is mary s pool let s make a quick drop on it waiting for the canoe to swing around and hang steady from the anchor before i began casting , i looked downstream over the dark water at a mistshrouded island and the barelydiscernible forested hills beyond a setting that was both mysterious and promising and thought of how good it would be to link up with a salmon at such a time and place my third cast was about 80 feet out , and when the sunken fly , a green highlander , was making its final downstream swing , it was taken by a heavy fish i raised the rod high and said , kevin , it s a big one lifting the anchor and poling ashore from where i would play the fish , he said i ca n't believe this ! i had n't planned to stop at mary s , but something made me do it it was a strange feeling the salmon went deep into the fly line s backing four times , and each time putting on all the pressure i dared i brought it away from the edge of the rapids at the lower end of the pool ten minutes into the struggle it came to the surface about 70 yards out , broad tail flailing a lovely fish ! oh what a lovely fish ! said kevin hooked at 7 30 , it was in the net at 7 50 , a bright 28pound female and my best salmon in five years kevin demonstrated firstrate skill in negotiating the several stretches of broken water between us and the landing in the darkness , and when i got back to home base at runnymeade i discovered that my host had caught and released a 29pounder on the ristigouche because none of the other guests had caught anything that afternoon , i tried to restrain my jubilation at my own good luck , but was not , i fear , altogether successful drawing
a friend who works at home discovered one morning that his personal computer s diskette drive would not accept a disk his 3yearold son observed him snarling and muttering as he tried repeatedly , without success , to get the computer to accept the disk maybe there s a penny in the hole , the child suggested sure enough , dad spied a penny in the narrow slot and eventually extracted it with tweezers the drive still would n't take the disk after another frustrating minute , the boy offered another thought maybe there s lots of pennies in there a rewarding time a comprehensive lesson on the care and maintenance of personal computers followed for the youngster , while the parent learned a valuable lesson , too spending time with the children at a computer can be rewarding in more ways than one according to a recent gallup survey sponsored by star micronics america inc , a personal computer printer company , 25 percent of american households report having a personal computer of those households , nearly 70 percent reported using the computer for schoolwork among all parents who said they owned or planned to buy a home computer in the near future , 78 percent said that they believed it could improve their children s performance in school many skeptics remain , but it seems that most parents and educators have agreed that personal computers are an important educational tool other national surveys show that all but a few elementary and secondary schools in the united states have at least one personal computer set aside for instruction financial realities , however , dictate that it will be many years before there is a computer on every student s desk computers are simply too expensive , and even if they were reasonably priced , few schools have enough electrical outlets to accommodate all that equipment so parents who can afford a home computer , or who can take time to expose their children to computers at the office or library , will be helping to accelerate their children s exposure to an information technology that will someday be ubiquitous all too often , though , parents simply plop the computer on a desk in the den , or plop their child in front of a computer in the office or local library , and use the machine as a teacher or television surrogate 'antidote to tv' computers are often presented as the antidote to tv , with people saying that tv is passive and the computer is interactive , said tom snyder , president of tom snyder productions inc , which develops educational software i have yet to see good evidence that the computer s level of interactivity is intuitively a good thing instead , mr snyder said , the interaction that happens in a computer program is about on the level of the worst conversation you had with the dumbest cat you ever had you are making choices , but that s kind of like your kid having hundreds of tv channels to choose from if they click around the channels , is that really interactive \? there s none of the rich context that occurs in a conversation mr snyder , a former schoolteacher and now a parent , cited a theory called contextual welding the theory , in brief , is that children may be able to recall in a computer game that , working out from the sun , mars comes immediately after earth and jupiter comes next but the same children may be unable to recall the planetary sequence in a conversation , or to understand it when it is applied to something other than a game the learning occurs when you get away from the computer and try your theory on someone else , he said imagine if pac man had a pause button , and you could play with another person you 'd say , 'hey , that monster is real close , ' and the other person might say , 'we should go this way' you introduce language that cements real learning those are things you can do with a computer , but not with tv that is partly why many educators think the real value of a home computer is as a catalyst to spark interaction between parent and child , or among groups of playmates margaret honey , a researcher at the center for technology at the bank street college of education in new york , said that one experiment in an eighthgrade class in roselle , nj , a suburb of elizabeth , shows that computers can be effective in creating studentparent partnerships each kid has been given a laptop computer , which they trot back and forth between school and home , ms honey said they do notetaking , writing , work with science data bases and they use the calculator the computers are functioning kind of like the electronic notebooks that we talk about for the future one thing the teachers wanted is for the kids and parents to sign a contract that talks about working together at the first open house at school , every single parent showed up until now , at a typical open house , five or six parents drifting in and out was considered a lot the parents i met were very curious , very enthusiastic and eager to support what their kids do a good locus educators emphasize that parental involvement is crucial for successful education , and the personal computer is an especially good locus for such interactions

orient point , li when the united states agriculture department created a center to study footandmouth disease , the deadly livestock infection , it selected plum island , 850 remote acres dotted with scrub pines off the northeastern tip of long island the virus could be so easily transmitted , and its escape would be so catastrophic , that congress demanded it be studied offshore beyond the water barrier , there was an extensive system of precautions , including an elaborate showering procedure for employees , decontamination and a weeklong enforced quarantine for cars leaving the island but 38 years later , things have changed at plum island , america s bulwark against epidemics of foreign animal diseases interviews with past and present employees and a review of internal documents indicate that staff cutbacks have undermined the traditional safety precautions at the island and that the center s plant and equipment have deteriorated to the point that repairs are expected to cost 60 million an internal memo from the agriculture department , which owns and operates the plum island animal disease center , describes longstanding violations of environmental codes much of the criticism of plum island comes from former union members , many of whom lost their jobs or were forced to take pay cuts when a private company took over management of the installation last year they point out that since the conversion , the support staff has been cut by a third , from 144 to 100 , the professional fire department has been eliminated , and many of the backup systems to contain viruses have been pared away moreover , documents show that the switch to a private contractor has not saved any money because of unforeseen additional costs while the risk of a deadly virus s reaching the wild deer or horse farms of the north fork of long island is small , the far greater danger , employees say , is to workers who would be largely unprotected in the event of a fire or a release of viruses , some of which could be fatal to human beings the agriculture department , however , says that while safety procedures have been relaxed , they are adequate dr c g crawford , the department s deputy area director for plum island , defended relaxation of the safety regulations as reasonable precautions for a remote threat of contagion i can think of a whole myriad of hypothetical situations where something might happen , and i refuse to categorically state that nothing will happen , he said by the same token , i believe the probability of all these events occurring at the same time is very , very remote but some employees are disconcerted by the new approach , and representative george j hochbrueckner , democrat of centereach , shares their fears earlier this month , in response to news organizations' inquiries , he questioned whether the private contractor , the burns and roe services corporation of oradell , nj , could maintain an adequate support staff under its budget he also questioned whether cuts in staff have caused unacceptable risks in safety and security and whether workers are being properly protected on the job the island harmful viruses and few visitors to residents of long island s easternmost hamlets , plum island is also known as mystery island , a place where no people live with its restricted access and work rules that seem to have dropped out of the andromeda strain , there have always been suspicions that the animal disease center was researching biological warfare to dispel those fears , plum island opened its doors to reporters in 1971 one of only three times that news organizations have been allowed to visit the other occasions were at the center s opening in 1954 , and in 1978 , to reassure the public after an outbreak of footandmouth disease on plum island dr crawford denied a request by the new york times to visit the complex but said he planned to allow a reporters' tour next month those who have visited the island describe a place that any science fiction writer would be proud to have imagined in an article last july , karl grossman , a reporter for the hampton chronicle who was on the 1971 and 1978 tours , wrote about a scientist who held a tiny vial and explained that its contents could infect 10 , 000 trillion cattle with footandmouth disease the scientist went on to point out that 10 , 000 trillion cattle was all the cattle that lived on the planet indeed , all the cattle that ever lived on the planet to enter a laboratory or decontamination building , employees and visitors take off their clothes and don labsupplied jump suits , underwear and slippers they enter through an air lock , the negative air pressure sucking the good , clean air with them into the chamber while insuring that none of the air inside escapes foreign animal diseases workers near harmful viruses that could be transmitted through the air are supposed to wear face shields with respirators although a inspector for the occupational safety and health administration found in 1988 that employees were not fitted for respirators upon leaving the buildings , the workers strip , pass back through the air lock , scrub their nails , spit and blow their noses to clear their respiratory systems , shower and shampoo their hair
el salvador has enjoyed a merciful but nervous peace since january , following a 12year civil war that claimed more than 60 , 000 lives the fighting ended with an agreement by guerrillas to lay down their arms and by the government to discharge war criminals from a brutal army an important milestone is fast approaching on aug 15 , a special commission will present its evaluation of the officer corps to president alfredo cristiani for possible purging this longoverdue weedingout deserves the full support of the us government the three commissioners , all respected salvadoran civilians , came to washington last week to meet with officials and members of congress but they found that the bureaucratic wheels have turned slowly the state department insists that it intends to share what it knows about notorious massacres , the murder of priests and of archbishop romero , and also about crimes attributed to leftist rebels a full response , drawing on files of other agencies , would honor the cause of justice , and strengthen civilian scrutiny of a rough latin army whose officers have had extensive us training past experience is cautionary in december 1983 , george bush , then vice president , flew to el salvador with a list of military officers believed to be involved in death squad atrocities none were punished or discharged the worst offenders were transferred to posts abroad far more sweeping changes are envisioned in united nations peace accords , which call for reducing by half the size of the army and for creating a national police force with guerrilla recruits un monitors fault leftist rebels for seizing new farms after the ceasefire , and for providing lists of only a portion of the weapons they are supposed to surrender but despite noncompliance by both sides , the accords have silenced guns to universal relief exhausted belligerents show no wish to renew a stalemated war and a warwasted economy is reviving , helped by a wise us decision to delay deportation of illegal salvadoran migrants , prime source of 800 million in annual remittances it will truly mark a new era in el salvador if the commission identifies malefactors , and mr cristiani removes them as officers fuller cooperation in washington can hasten that salubrious day
fort lauderdale , fla , march 25 greg cadaret easily passed his first test today in preparation for a possible berth in the yankee starting rotation when he tossed six sterling innings for columbus against the louisville cardinals in a class aaa game at tampa using all four of his pitches , cadaret squelched the minor leaguers on three hits , did not allow an earned run , struck out one , walked none and threw just 57 pitches manager buck showalter said that if scott kamieniecki was not recovered from cervicaldisk surgery and the club did not make a trade , cadaret would probably be the team s fifth starter when the season opens in 12 days cadaret had a slightly different viewpoint he said the yankees had told him he would be in the fifth spot if a trade was not made they need a starter and i'm the best they 've got in camp now , said cadaret , who added that he would be disappointed if he did not win 15 games as a starter for the entire season who knows who else might show up before it s over \? showalter , being more cautious , simply said that cadaret was not a lock as the fifth starter and that the final decision still depended on what kamieniecki did the next important date for that righthander is friday , when he is scheduled to pitch three innings against the mets cadaret will work every fifth day for the rest of camp alhough the acting managing partner , joseph molloy , said that the chances of the yankees making a trade for a pitcher this week were 5050 , showalter said he had not heard discussions of any imminent deal i have n't talked to anybody who has voiced an opinion that makes me think we 're getting ready to do something , the rookie manager said the yankees , who had no exhibition game scheduled today , are known to be talking seriously with at least five teams about pitching , and chris bosio of milwaukee is the name mentioned most often
los angeles it s not hard to figure out why helter skelter la art in the 1990 s has become the most talkedabout exhibition here in a long time everything about this big survey show , organized by paul schimmel of the los angeles museum of contemporary art , aims to be provocative from the intimations of charles manson s bloody rampage in the title , to the violent and ranting essays and poems by los angeles writers in the catalogue , to the actual works on view \( through april 26 \) in the museum s temporary contemporary warehouse annex those works , by 16 artists , are as full of images of tawdry sex and serial murderers as are the tabloid television shows that masquerade as news programs helter skelter seems even more closely related , in fact , to another recent smallscreen phenomenon like david lynch s defunct twin peaks , beneath its veneer of surreality is a cliche of america as one vast , roiling , sexcrazed , guntoting wasteland the disappointment of the exhibition is less its attentiongrabbing sensationalism than the pretense that this sensationalism amounts to something substantial and challenging at a time when the art world , always desperate for the latest trend , can cling to no dominant movement , the show eagerly celebrates one in los angeles unfortunately , the movement turns out to be good old adolescent nihilism helter skelter tries vainly to elevate this nihilism , lauding its borrowings from pulp fiction , cult religions , extremist politics and cartoons the artists' use of debased signs and symbols , and their embrace of raw subjects from everyday life , shock and disorient the viewer into another state of mind , mr schimmel writes in the catalogue , adding somewhat hopefully indeed , by presenting such graphic explorations of sexuality and violence which implicitly question contemporary standards of obscenity the institution now becomes as much at risk as the artists themselves those artists include familiar figures like chris burden and mike kelley as well as newcomers like victor estrada at 26 , manuel ocampo is the youngest in the show llyn foulkes , at 57 , is the oldest the show claims that this varied and loosely formed group presents an updated vision of los angeles that contrasts with the stereotype of the city as a sunny dreamland of fun but the alternative picture that helter skelter proposes of los angeles as a dark and dangerous place has been no less a stereotype , at least since 1939 , the year nathanael west published day of the locust as the work of ed kienholz makes clear , it has also been an aspect of the art scene here for decades that the catalogue cites west and the history of film noir , and also suggests that the art on display somehow breaks ground , illustrates the fuzziness of the show s thesis in part because its subtitle misleadingly implies it is a survey of the whole of los angeles art in the 90 s , helter skelter has provoked criticism for not including more works by women and minorities this criticism seems to miss the point the show deserves to be faulted on political grounds for including artists like robert williams , a cofounder of zap comix , whose paintings full of naked bimbos mark the exhibition s nadir the works on view are a disconcertingly mixed bag perhaps the strongest piece is mr burden s medusa s head , a fourton meteorite strangled by dozens of miniature railroad tracks the sculpture , which was on display last year at the brooklyn museum , serves as a parable of ecological catastrophe all the more potent for acknowledging the nostalgic connotations of trains baby baby , by mr estrada , presents one of the exhibition s few truly haunting images , a sculpture of two gigantic , pinchfaced , bubblegumpink babies joined at the crotch by an enormous phallus in the shape of a nuclear cloud charles ray provides an amusing bit of trompe l'oeil a custommade mannequin of a woman in a business suit , set apart in its own room so that a viewer does not realize at first that she stands eight feet tall mr ocampo s antiqued canvases , full of religious symbols and references to the nazis and the ku klux klan , convey a raw energy despite their melodrama and mr foulkes s paintingscumreliefsculptures bring to mind the art of francis bacon in their combination of careful finish and macabre humor one portrays superman as an aging , shellshocked father , glued to his television even superman , it seems , is defeated by the banality of american life for every interesting work in helter skelter there are too many others , like richard jackson s pointless clockfilled installation , that simply fall flat the few contributions by women artists are conspicuously weak liz larner s installation with mirrors and chains called forced perspective is one of them nancy rubins s mountainous pile of trailers and water heaters , a humorless imitation of something vito acconci might concoct , is another and meg cranston s video installation , with its image of a fireplace and its muzak soundtrack , is yet another this sort of work does n't so much transcend as mimic the stereotypes of middleamerican life , with its canned music , its trailer homes and its stupid office humor mr schimmel describes the attitude of the artists in the show , his first as chief curator at the museum , as in your face he writes that none are 'dogooder' artists who seek to use their art for direct political ends if the 1980 s gave rise to political correctness , which sees everything in moral terms , the decade also in its glorification of greed and selfishness fostered the spirit of amorality and alienation that suffuses helter skelter it sometimes seems that for art to attract attention nowadays it must take place at one extreme or the other what ultimately makes helter skelter such a chilling event is not the preponderance of blood and gore but the absence of compassion photo victor estrada s baby baby at the los angeles museum

washington , aug 10 in these postolympic days , bureaucrats here seem to be shooting for their own kind of world record they have been hours away from finishing a north american free trade agreement for a week trade officials from canada , mexico and the united states have been in the watergate hotel here since july 29 they have been busily agreeing to eliminate trade barriers , but the final compromises never seem to happen an american official pointed out today that president bush was scheduled to return here on tuesday afternoon from kennebunkport , me , and could announce a deal then if it was ready three other american and canadian officials said the deal could be ready on tuesday or possibly wednesday the many delays reflect the extraordinary number of details that must be settled in creating the world s largest and richest regional trading bloc some of these details will affect dozens of companies and thousands of workers a political edge while none of the details appear to be dealbreakers , they do give the negotiations a political edge that makes the final pact all the more difficult to achieve the beer industry , for example , employs thousands of people in all three countries and reaches into the refrigerators of millions of households , making it difficult to set a schedule for the lowering of tariffs the 1988 united statescanada free trade agreement mostly excluded beer because the canadian industry fought successfully to retain provincial restrictions on imports the same issue has come up again this year , compounded by a trade war now between the united states and canada over beer duties and by the difficulty of reducing the high tariffs surrounding the mexican beer industry similar employment issues have delayed a final compromise on american apparel imports from canada the issue has been narrowed to the question of the size of any increase in the current american quota for dutyfree imports across the nation s northern border negotiators have reached general understandings on the two most politically sensitive issues in the talks the american auto industry and the mexican energy industry but squabbles over details are still blocking a final compromise a rough consensus emerged a week ago , for example , that a little more than 60 percent of the value of cars and trucks would have to be produced in north america for the vehicles to qualify for dutyfree treatment but no country wants to set the precise percentage until after the rules are set for calculating it once the rules have been set , a process nearly finished this evening , each country will be able to figure out the effect on its factories before setting the final percentage a technical dispute mexico is resisting american efforts to force pemex , the mexican state oil company , to award more contracts to american and canadian companies in this case , too , part of the disagreement concerns a technical dispute how to measure the value of contracts awarded to foreign companies the issue has snarled the broader question of how quickly mexican stateowned enterprises should be forced to do business with foreign companies because of these remaining stumbling blocks , which are all likely to be solved in a single , broad political deal , participants in the talks do not know how much longer they will be stuck at the watergate hotel leery of predictions like shepherds told to stop crying wolf as long as the flock seems calm and intact , the negotiators insist that a final deal is near , though they are becoming leery of predicting when the accord will be finished i am so frustrated , said one negotiator who has been predicting an imminent deal for nearly a week but when asked today when a deal would be finished , he cheerfully replied , my best guess would be tomorrow another negotiator said he had given up on all predictions after deciding that they were a waste of time there will be a wolf , there will be an agreement , insisted a washington trade lobbyist the lobbyist demanded anonymity because , he said , comparing the agreement to a wolf might inaccurately suggest that he opposed the pact
lincroft pine trees , rocks , the unbelievably cold water around mount desert island , lobster , l l bean mail order mention the state of maine , and chances are that these images come to mind art , too maine is not hospitable landscape , nor is it especially majestic yet the artists drawn to it are legion winslow homer , marsden hartley , edward hopper , john marin , george bellows are but a few of the names and their accomplishments have not discouraged later generations from trying their hands although many familiar figures , including marin , are represented in art of maine bounty of woods and water , this show at the monmouth museum , on the brookdale community college campus here , is not exactly a roundup of stars it is , rather , an attempt to present the state as a source of inspiration a resident , valerie van winkle , did the honors as guest curator , selecting 72 canvases from the holdings of galleries in maine , connecticut and manhattan and from the occasional private collection the result is a mixed bag , and it often seems as if the mere fact of an artist s painting maine was reason enough for inclusion not that the character of the region is necessarily recognizable dennis pinette , for example , seems to paint his own mental scenery one of his oleaginous visions concerns boats moored on khakicolored water and suffused in sulfurous light another alludes to a junkyard on a dark gray day the strangest involves shapes that could be either discarded batteries or derelict housing this is expressionism with an apocalyptic flavor more urban than rural in its inspiration alison hildreth extrapolates from nature , producing tall , crusty abstractions in muted colors that suggest rugged landscape and rock formations then there is hans moller s blue 1037 , in which the blue outlines of fishing craft float on crimson water between bluegray headlands and under a pink sky with a pink sun the paint is applied in dabs with white spaces in between , and this , coupled with the japanese flatness of the design , gives it the character of a stencil carl nelson and philip barter are two painters who apparently have drawn inspiration from milton avery in mr nelson s between pool points a ghostly white threemaster blocks the entrance to a blue bay marked by slabs of contrasting color summer blueberry field , by mr barter , involves two rounded masses of vivid green under a blue sky where hangs a cloud shaped like a bolster dahlov ipcar tidies fall landscape into a currier ivesstyle image where geese fly in single file , a hawk pursues smaller birds , and hounds follow a fox it is a scene calculated to inspire an embroiderer by far the most memorable metaphors for nature are alan gussow s raga for a foggy coastal morning , a lovely map of shapes in slate gray , quiet greens and tans , and john heliker s watercolor , maine landscape , which is nothing but a mass of small kleelike notations mr heliker is one of the many painters who were eclipsed but not obliterated by abstract expressionism and , represented by the allblue , semiabstract seagrass , william kienbusch is another noteworthy figures of an earlier vintage include william zorach , whose fame is for sculpture , and walt kuhn , who , with arthur b davies , was responsible for the 1913 armory show were maine to adopt an official painter now , neil welliver , with his acres of trees , boulders and water , would surely be first choice here , he contributes characteristic works like outcropping , where the sun percolates through trees onto lichencovered rocks , and the handsome etching and aquatint of a brown trout suspended in a stream but there is also the very atypical image of two skeletons , one hauling the other out of a pool , a painting of the early 1960 s the show abounds in what might be called routine landscapes , many of them mediocre but one very good indeed this is cardona s house , by robert solotare the building sits in soft sunlight among trees , its lineaments detailed with skill and affection , and off to one side are the street lamps that make it urban rather than rural landscape another eyecatching work is pines from the studio , a gouache with collage that turns a forest into a dark allover abstraction flecked with a kind of calligraphy in graywhite the artist is none other than david driskell , author of books on african and africanamerican art and former student at , among other places , the skowhegan school in maine it is a show well worth visiting but , as already indicated , it lacks a curatorial hand the pictures have been hung without any attempt at orchestration , and about onequarter of them could \( and should \) have been eliminated nevertheless , it does what it set out to do , which is to show that the beat that began with fitz hugh lane and frederic church goes on art of maine continues through sept 20 brookdale community college is on county route 520 , and the museum is open from 10 am to 4 30 pm tuesday through saturday and 1 to 5 pm sunday photo brown trout , state ii , an etching and aquatint by neil welliver

as helium gas screamed from a tank truck into a huge plastic gas bag yesterday , final preparations began for the launching of earthwinds , a balloon whose threemember crew hopes to be the first to circumnavigate the world in a single balloon flight larry newman of scottsdale , ariz , captain of the earthwinds , said there was a good chance that weather conditions in akron , ohio , would permit the launching of the balloon this weekend to begin its voyage of some 22 , 000 miles at an altitude of about 35 , 000 feet although manned balloons have crossed both the atlantic and pacific oceans , none has successfully circled the earth , the last great goal of recordseeking aeronauts mr newman was a crew member of both the transatlantic balloon flight in 1978 and the transpacific flight in 1981 with mr newman on the earthwinds flight will be maj gen vladimir dzhanibekov , chief of astronaut training in the russian air force , and don moses , an american builder and expert mechanic besides the three men , the balloon , which is higher than the statue of liberty , will carry scientific experiments built in the former soviet union and by the national aeronautics and space administration two balloons in one earthwinds is radically different in design from any previous longduration balloon shaped like an hourglass , it is actually two balloons an upper lifting balloon containing some 11 million cubic feet of helium , and an anchor balloon suspended beneath the crew capsule and containing compressed air ordinary gas balloons carry ballast in the form of sand or water , and when a balloonist exhausts his supply of ballast , the balloon is forced to land but earthwinds makes its own ballast and will be able to stay aloft for more than a month the duration of conventional gas balloon flights is limited by the warming and cooling effects of daytime and nighttime flight during the day , balloon gas warms , expands and provides so much lift that the balloon ascends to such heights that it must release some of its helium to prevent the gas from ripping open the balloon but at night , the cooled helium contracts , and its reduced lift causes the balloon to descend too far , forcing the pilot to drop ballast this cycle can continue for only a few days before ballast is exhausted and the balloon is forced to land but on earthwinds , nearly one ton of extra air can be pumped from the atmosphere into the anchor balloon , thereby making the balloon system heavier and preventing it from rising during the warmth of the day in the cool of the night , compressed air can be released from the anchor balloon the equivalent of dropping sand ballast to prevent the balloon from descending this unique system for replenishing ballast , its designers say , is expected to give the balloon a duration of at least 40 days , more than double the time expected to complete the roundtheworld flight the pressurized crew capsule with its myriad of flight instruments , controls , compressor engines , generator , survival clothing , food and other equipment was moved last week from its stand in the loral defense systems air dock to a flatbed trailer from which it will be launched the anchor balloon , resembling a 100footdiameter golf ball , was inflated and pressurized two weeks ago yesterday , the big plywood crate containing the folded plastic lift balloon was towed to the inflation site 100 yards from the hangar , and technicians began filling the balloon with helium from two tank trucks during the early stage of inflation , the height of the balloon is expected to greatly exceed the 200foot height of the roof of the hangar , so inflation is being conducted outdoors with a full load of helium , the balloon was expected to become round and low enough to squeeze back into the immense hangar for final rigging in the last stage of preparations the lift balloon will be attached to the capsule and the anchor balloon , and this entire flight train will be moved to the nearby launching site a 'different' experience general dzhanibekov said he gave the flight only a 50 percent chance of success but added that its potential scientific and technical rewards would make the risk worthwhile also , the experience is different , he said as a soviet astronaut he made five space flights in one he commanded the rescue operation that saved the salyut 7 spacecraft this flight will leave us broke and badly in debt , mr newman said , but it s something i 've always dreamed of mr newman said much of the credit for the flight belonged to his

nashville the bluebird cafe sits in a strip shopping center next to the patio hair salon in the pricey green hills area of nashville its owner is a wouldbe gourmet chef turned countrymusic entrepreneur , and the help often turns out to be stray folkies from places like boston or astoria , queens it is about as close to the hokey hustlers' mecca immortalized in robert altman s brilliantly defamatory 1975 film nashville , as the twostep is to slam dancing with country music riding an enormous wave of popularity , it is not surprising hollywood is taking another crack at nashville , this time with the thing called love , a film directed by peter bogdanovich about the subculture of aspiring songwriters who flock to places like the bluebird the question is whether film makers can figure out the new nashville , symbolized by a place like the bluebird , as well as the old one savaged by mr altman many people here have their doubts country music may have achieved a crossover popularity few would have thought possible a few years back , but selling garth brooks albums in manhattan may be a lot easier than getting beyond the dogpatch cliches still surrounding country music i think there was a worry at first we were going to do a patronizing , fake , hollywood version of country music , said mr bogdanovich during shooting here last month i think we 've convinced people that we may fail , but the intention is very much to make an honest picture in nashville , where memories of country music on film run from the 1980 wrongnote urban cowboy to mr altman s merrily scabrous film full of scheming music city manipulators , they 're still waiting to be convinced i 've never seen a movie that s gotten it right , said liz hengber , a former bluebird waitress turned songwriter , who saw the first song she sold , reba mcentire s for my broken heart , go to no 1 on the country music charts in 1991 people are hoping this does n't get turned into 'heehaw' it s not that the nashville of myth and fable is gone opryland usa , where the faithful worship at the venerable temple of country tradition , celebrated its 20th anniversary in 1991 and has been visited by 40 million fans but the nashville scene these days mirrors the crossover appeal of country music as it has metamorphosed from its strictly southern roots into the suburban country music of today for those drawn neither to the angry rap of public enemy nor the highdecibel histrionics of guns 'n' roses , country is increasingly turning out to be white america s popular music of choice , making nashville s sound a 3 billion industry it s no accident that country music has surpassed top 40 in listenership and rather than the predictable twangy fare of the past , country has produced a riot of styles , from folkies like marychapin carpenter and nanci griffith to the honkytonk of randy travis and alan jackson to the texas country of george strait , the cajun music of joel sonnier and the country r b of t graham brown then there are the emerging countrypop icons and heartthrobs like garth brooks and trisha yearwood it s all young and mostly wholesome you knew country had become demographically correct when ms yearwood recently signed on to represent revlon cosmetics the bedrock of the phenomenon and a great slice of americana can be seen regularly at the bluebird , where singersongwriters from around the country show up to market their wares started in 1982 by a young woman named amy kurland , the bluebird began as a place that would offer gourmet food with a side order of music but soon after taking over the bluebird , she could n't help noticing that it was a wonderful , intimate setting for about 130 people to listen to music soon the side order became the main course , and the bluebird was gaining a reputation as a showcase for upandcoming artists and songwriters the walls are now full of pictures of past and current performers there are hot acts like mr brooks , alan jackson and the indigo girls there are those who , alas , never quite became household names , like the immortal ethel and the shameless hussies there are old folkies like eric anderson , loudon wainwright 3d and janis ian seven nights a week , there is music ranging from bigname acts to the mondaynight open mike where any aspiring songwriter with a song and a little nerve can get up on stage and hit the road to stardom or make an utter fool of himself nashville is kind of a buzz town , said the 37yearold ms kurland , as she sat in the empty club while the film s technicians set up outside word gets around garth brooks came in here when he was an unknown and auditioned like everyone else he sang a song about putting a woman up on a pedestal , and i was so taken , i got up on stage and asked him to marry me that s one extreme the other night we had a guy who goes by the nickname of 'the sentimental oriental' he drove down from chicago , and sang a song called 'chop suey and you' he was absolutely dreadful , but everyone sang along with him , and he got a huge round of applause , and i'm sure people will look forward to the next time he plays
albany , july 18 legislative leaders and gov mario m cuomo said tonight that they had reached an agreement on a fiscal aid package for suffolk county under the agreement , which the leaders announced about 10 pm , albany would authorize suffolk to issue bonds to close its 1991 budget deficit and would also allow it to raise its sales tax by half a percentage point , to 85 percent in the agreement , which is contigent on the state s leaders reaching an accord on a fiscal bailout of nassau county , suffolk would be allowed to issue bonds to borrow 36 million to close the 1991 deficit , and could later borrow whatever the projected 1992 deficit is , once all sides determine it nassau still unresolvedxx the deal followed meetings today between governor cuomo , assembly speaker saul weprin of queens , the senate majority leader , ralph j marino , and the suffolk county executive , robert j gaffney talks over a proposed fiscal bailout for nassau county , a key to an overall budget package for long island s floundering governments , broke down this afternoon , and nassau county officials and state leaders said that negotiations had reached an impasse governor cuomo spent the afternoon trying to broker a deal between mr weprin , the speaker of the democraticcontrolled assembly , and several long island republicans , including nassau county executive thomas s gulotta and senator marino but mr cuomo was unsuccessful officials said tonight that they hoped to meet again on sunday morning i'm disappointed that we were n't successful in achieving a successful compromise , mr gulotta said as he left the meeting but i'm sure we 'll be available to keep talking mr weprin said mr gulotta had turned down a number of compromise proposals simply because of politics i offered them three different options and they accepted none of them , said mr weprin angrily so they left and that s where we stand now approval sought for bonds nassau is seeking permission from albany to issue up to 71 million in bonds that would be used to close the county s deficit and to raise another 40 million to 60 million a year by increasing its mortgagerecording tax to 2 percent from 1 percent with these measures , officials hope to be able to close an estimated 153 million deficit in its 18 million budget and freeze property taxes a particularly big issue for mr gulotta , who faces re election next year without the package , officials have warned , the county will run out of money by the fall officials said that the talks unraveled over the issue of how to set the rules for the mortgagetax increase mr gulotta wants to be able to use the revenues from the new tax to close the deficit and keep taxes frozen for at least two years but mr weprin said he would agree to that plan only if nassau would submit to a management audit by state comptroller edward v regan at the end of the first year in mr weprin s account , mr gulotta stated that he did n't want a management audit of county finances until after his 1993 election but mr gulotta said that it was mr weprin who had brought up politics i'm shocked and surprised at the speaker and the distortions which he has set forth in his statement , he said and he accused mr weprin of taking his remarks out of context i indicated to him at one point that if his motive was not political in nature , then the requirements he was imposing could be imposed after next year s election as easily as before it , he said break in suffolk logjam from the other end of long island , suffolk county s executive , mr gaffney , asked albany today for permission to borrow up to 91 million and to raise the county sales tax suffolk recently reduced the estimate of the deficit in its 13 billion budget , from 91 million to 47 million besides granting those requests , the agreement tonight would also require the state comptroller to conduct an annual audit of suffolk county government of the salestax increase , onehalf the revenues would be used to pay off the bond debt , one quarter would be used for police districts , and one quarter would go to the county s general fund the increase would phase out when the bonds are retired , in six years or less mr cuomo said at a news conference tonight that the leaders had also agreed to a number of other bills besides the bond act , but that their final resolution was contingent on an agreement over nassau an agreement on a bailout for both counties appeared close in the waning hours of the regular legislative session on july 3 , but the plan unraveled and the legislature adjourned the session ended with other issues unresolved , including a proposed bond act to create jobs and bring in new business and a proposal to expand the powers of the state thruway authority
rain replaced the rail yesterday as the chief complication on the horizon for the 11 colts primed and waiting for the 124th running of the belmont stakes today more than 60 thoroughbreds will race in 6 stakes on the belmont park program , new york s biggest day of racing in 1992 , with a total purse of more than 15 million in the main event , there will also be the honor of winning the third jewel in the triple crown plus a shot at the 1 million bonus for the best overall performance in the three american classics the kentucky derby , the preakness and the belmont for an extra dash of drama , seven of the senior stars of racing , notably strike the gold and fly so free , will race for 500 , 000 and bonus points in the nassau county handicap , the fifth event in the american championship racing series but a cloud was hanging over the belmont barns yesterday rains soaked the track and turned it into a bog that was described in official understatement as sloppy nine races were run in the mud yesterday , but the nine scheduled for today were the ones causing anxiety the trainers , keeping their options open , jogged their horses for some final exercise or walked them along the shedrow of the barns , away from the rain and some made contingency plans for using mud caulks or cleats for firmer traction , to meet the challenge of running a mile and a half in the ooze in the belmont stakes the track superintendent , joe king , reported that the weather forecast called for rain continuing until maybe 8 o'clock this morning after that , conditions are expected to improve , but king said that in any event he expected the track to be closed in the morning , with no workouts permitted at that point , he said , we will monitor the drainage and evaluate the situation then we will either harrow or seal the track , as appropriate the track , in fact , was sealed after the ninth race yesterday afternoon heavy steel plates were dragged behind tractors to compact the surface and harden it so that the rain would run off to the sides depending on the weather today , king will either seal the surface again or send harrows over the surface to rake it for more normal racing long shots are n't complaining none of the 11 colts entered in the 764 , 800 belmont stakes was considered a confirmed mudder , chiefly because few 3yearold horses have had the chance to race in the mud but the general feeling around the barns was that some long shots like robert s hero \( 201 in the early line \) and jacksonport \( 501 \) stood to lose less than the favorites ap indy , who drew post position no 1 on the rail casual lies , who will start from the next gate , and pine bluff , the winner of the preakness , who is booked into gate 3 if it s muddy , said murray garren , the trainer of jacksonport , it would help a lot but neil drysdale , who trains ap indy for tomonori tsurumaki of tokyo , said that mud was like the rail there is n't much you can do about it drysdale said he suspected his colt , a son of seattle slew and grandson of secretariat , would still run with command over a sloppy track but he added i would like to see a fair track that s not predisposed toward one horse my main concern is to have a safe track speed may be favored ton bohannan said that pine bluff , a son of danzig , had never raced on a sloppy track but , he added , he handles it fine in the mornings scotty schulhofer , who will saddle montreal marty for the belmont stakes and fly so free for the nassau , suggested that a muddy track would have the reverse effect it would favor tactical speed if the track stays heavy , schulhofer said , the late closers will be put at much more of a disadvantage finish line six horses were scratched from yesterday s feature , the 92 , 850 jaipur stakes , and five ran in the mud , especially prestonwood farm s to freedom with julie krone steering , he finished six lengths in front of fourstardave , who edged smart alec by a head for third to freedom , trained by john tammaro sr , handled seven furlongs in the slop in 1 224 5 and paid 360 chart 124th belmont stakes lists the field for the 124th running of the belmont stakes today
mineola , li , nov 5 less than a week after she pleaded for the chance to spend thanksgiving with her parents , amy fisher appeared in nassau county court today and asked to be sent to prison she was immediately remanded to the nassau county jail miss fisher , who was to have been sentenced next month for the shooting of mary jo buttafuoco , also asked that her sentencing be moved up at a hastily called hearing held in open court but attended by none of the reporters who have doggedly followed every detail of the case , miss fisher s lawyer , eric naiburg , told judge marvin goodman that his 18yearold client had decided jail was better than being a prisoner of the media her home is being staked out by reporters , mr naiburg said she cannot even go into a restaurant without people jumping up to call the media 'that would not work' he added in an interview after the hearing , we had hoped to give her 30 days of enjoyment , but it was clear that that would not work but others involved in the case offered another theory for miss fisher s decision to go to jail after she had fought so hard to be released on 2 million bail they said miss fisher had been interviewed at length by a syndicated television program , inside edition , and they speculated once the interview was broadcast , judge goodman might have decided to revoke her bail mr naiburg acknowledged that miss fisher had been interviewed by inside edition for several hours on oct 30 , the day before she appeared in court and assured the judge there would be no more media interviews judy geder , a spokeswoman for king world productions , the company that produces inside edition , said that segments of the interview with miss fisher would be broadcast on monday , tuesday and wednesday she declined to discuss the contents of the interview , and she would not say whether the company had paid for the interview marvyn kornberg , the lawyer for mrs buttafuoco s husband , joseph buttafuoco , said he expected the interview to include statements that conflict with what miss fisher has already told the court and arresting officers but mr naiburg said what will appear in the television interview is perfectly consistent with what she has said all along he said the decision to have miss fisher remanded to jail was reached to protect her emotional health , and protect her from pressure of national media attention authorities have said that miss fisher shot mrs buttafuoco after mr buttafuoco decided to end his affair with the teenager mr buttafuoco has denied having an affair with miss fisher the case has drawn national attention and both miss fisher and the buttafuocos have sold their stories to movie producers
recently , melonie morris , who is 17 and lives in the south bronx , has been mulling an idea maybe she should become a pastor it is an idea that does n't go away at a time like this , when melonie has been spending almost as much time at st john s evangelical lutheran church as the rev john heinemeier , its pastor on friday night a week ago , for example , she and pastor heinemeier and a couple of mothers led a group of pilgrims accompanying mary and joseph from nazareth to bethlehem actually they were 20 children marching along fulton avenue , past the solid apartments as well as the rubblestrewn lots and the litter of bottles and plastic foam in the morrisania section they were reenacting mary and joseph s search for lodging in the church s posada , or las posadas \( the inns \) , a mexicanamerican tradition calvin genfi , 10 , wearing a vaguely middle eastern headdress , knocked on prearranged apartment doors and read joseph s lines in a strong voice we need lodging please , kind people , we need lodging ! \( boys all repeat we need lodging then mary the baby is coming ! please , kind people , the baby is coming ! girls all repeat the baby is coming ! \) the tough role belonged to the innkeepers they looked as if they would have much preferred to be handing out cookies and hugs than their appointed lines you cannot come in ! said hazel lemon , a devoted church member doing her best to sound gruff do n't you know people have better things to do \? one stop was in the living room of lorraine gibbs , an elderly woman confined to a chair by serious surgery well , i really do n't have any room , she said to the wideeyed children crowding around her i'm so sorry , i'm so sorry , she added it was all in a night s work for melonie , who teaches sunday school each week and has an afternoon job at the church teaching reading and arthmetic and helping children with their homework last sunday , however , was more of a marathon at 9 30 am there was the sunday school pageant to be rehearsed and andre johnson , 4 , to be consoled because he could not play the lead part of the brightest star melonie assisted at the altar during the liturgy , which incorporated , between the readings and the communion , the children s pageant , several baptisms and christmas carols worship was followed by a congregational meeting on the church budget , by a prechristmas party for the church women and by a choir concert and a dramatic rendering of o henry s the gift of the magi then there were 150 packages of homebaked cookies and cans to be wrapped for the christmas eve visits and services at the fulton avenue prison and a nearby shelter for the homeless melonie did not leave church until 6 when pastor heinemeier first suggested that she seek ordination , i was shocked , melonie said , but i like to teach , do missionary work , counsel , aid people and get things done properly melonie uses the word shocked fairly often born in jamaica and reared mainly in florida , she moved to the bronx three years ago , just down the block from st john s they accepted us with open arms i was so shocked , she said st john s is a handsome church , the work of 19thcentury germanamerican lutherans german phrases mark the memory of the longdead parishioners for whom the finely painted windows were donated around the turn of the century in the 1930 s st john s became the first lutheran church in new york city to integrate by 1980 , all its congregants were black today , virtually none has a lutheran background and it has a growing minority of hispanic members melonie and her younger brother and sister were baptized in 1990 but i was always a religious person , she said i always prayed last summer , st john s sponsored her participation in a workshop on video and television production for church youth at pacific lutheran university in tacoma , wash she loved the campus , the libraries and the idea of using new technology to tell the story of her church and neighborhood people she met there were shocked at the way i am , she recalled i was always hearing 'melonie , is n't she sweet \? ' as though they were expecting someone really harsh from the south bronx but she admits that surviving in the south bronx does make a lot of people harsh and cold my faith , it helps me think beyond every situation , she said if something is bad , i'm sure it can be improved when certain things get bad , all i do is think of jesus , and my heart gets filled with joy , and that helps me to keep my sanity and especially my patience , no matter what comes my way and a lot of things have come my way , she added she draws a tight veil of privacy around what those things are her family , however , has had to move three times in the last year melonie requested prayers for her family last sunday at church at our savior lutheran high school in the northern bronx , where she transferred from public school , i'm quiet , melonie said i keep to myself , she continued but it is different in my church i just talk and get to know everybody it seems to be different in the neighborhood , too during the posada , melonie repeatedly exchanged hugs and greetings with passersby early this month , she completed an eightweek leadership training program conducted by south bronx churches , a community group know for sponsoring lowincome housing she was the youngest person in the program pastor heinemeier , a texan with a booming voice , naturally likes to talk of birth and rebirth at this time of the year of jesus , of the church , of the neighborhood three years ago a fire on christmas destroyed the back of the church when i first saw it , all i did was get on my knees and cry , melonie said we had services that day in the lower level , and for a year afterwards i remember the pastor saying we will overcome , we will pick up our tools and rebuild this church i remember him saying this is the kind of situation jesus was born in no heat and hardly any shelter she also recalled the day the church was rededicated that was a day to jump ! replacing the destroyed central window behind the altar was a new window designed by the distinguished illustrator ashley bryan , who was the church s first black member in the 1930 s the window shows a black jesus rising from the dead pastor heinemeier sees that as a symbol of the whole neighborhood , where 1 , 200 families will soon be moving into renovated housing so does melonie any time i pass a building and see it s being repaired , she said , i say , 'thank you , jesus' photo when it was suggested that she seek ordination , melonie morris , 17 , said , i was shocked but i like to teach , do missionary work , counsel , aid people and get things done properly melonie spends almost as much time at st john s evangelical lutheran church in the south bronx as its pastor \( ozier muhammad the new york times \)
for 70 years it has been public school organizing principle no 1 each grade has hightrack students , middlelevel students and some version of the sweathogs on welcome back , kotter while some discuss voltaire in class , others are in metal shop some make the algebrareadiness cut , some do not it s the american way now , a growing number of educators most of whom , it is safe to say , never took metal shop are convinced that it s the wrong way their cause is detracking , the dismantling of the sorting mechanisms that american schools rely upon pressing arguments of efficacy or equity or both , they are trying to convince americans that stratification in school hurts some and helps none this proposition , practically unheard of a decade ago , has set in motion a debate between advocates of the advantaged and advocates of the disadvantaged betweenclass ability grouping separating students not only by ability but by classrooms has no benefit for anybody , said prof robert e slavin , a research scientist at the johns hopkins university professor slavin , who has studied tracking and conducted extensive reviews of other research on the subject , says segregating low achievers might hurt them academically and clearly has negative effects on their behavior , social development and prospects for postsecondary education in addition , he said , for average and high achievers there does n't seem to be any benefit tracking may refer to arrangements as unbending as the old high school academic general vocational programs or as casual as an houraday math class for selected sixth graders almost every first grade in america starts dividing students by assigning them to different reading groups , a practice that is not seriously disputed as long as the children are in the same classroom and can move from one group to another in the debate over grouping , fierce enough already , the adversaries differ on the very definition of tracking those who want to end ability grouping use the term tracking loosely their critics accuse them of appropriating the word to cast aspersions on all forms of advanced and remedial classes usually , by either definition , tracking involves separate texts or curriculums the detrackers , hammering away at assumptions that intellectual potential is fixed at an early age , say children in the middle and lower groups are underestimated anne wheelock , author of the newly published crossing the tracks how 'untracking' can save america s schools \( the new press \) , put it this way lots of kids are being taught far less than they can learn , which is what i see tracking as being all about it is n't just rhetoric to say that this is one of the reforms that can address both issues of excellence and equity the advocates of change are ostensibly prevailing on their side , among others , are the national governors association , which endorsed detracking in its national education goals a carnegie foundation task force that came out strongly against ability grouping in turning points , a 1988 report on the middle grades , and the national education association , which stated that rigid academic tracking creates academic problems for many students from all socioeconomic and ethnic groups and segregates students by race and class i believe there s growing agreement that tracking and ability grouping is harmful for most kids , said willis d hawley , director of the center for education and policy at the vanderbilt institute for public policy studies in practice , however , change lags far behind talk while most middle schools have probably discussed ending or reducing ability grouping , only a small percentage have done so in high schools , the threetiered system remains almost untouched , although most have long since eliminated acrosstheboard tracks in favor of different levels in each academic subject proponents of detracking have some scholarly opposition several studies show that fast learners benefit from placement in hightrack classes , while those at lower levels do not suffer for their experience also , parents are skeptical about detracking , and the better their children perform on tests , the more skeptical and vocal they are finally , reorganizing for heterogeneous groups in which students of different abilities study the same subjects together requires innovations in curriculum , extra training for teachers and more help than many administrators can summon certainly , questions about stratification strike at deeply held beliefs regarding mobility and meritocracy , communitarianism and competition everyone has interests to be promoted or threatened i never got so much mail , said adria steinberg , editor of the harvard education letter , of the response to the publication s two recent articles on tracking , and i 've been here five years jeannie oakes , a professor of education at the university of california at los angeles , who in 1985 wrote the first major work on detracking \( keeping track how schools structure inequality \) , estimates that 80 percent of american secondary schools and 60 percent of elementary schools currently use some form of ability grouping
gleaming , frostless refrigerators are a staple in millions of american homes so are modern cooking ranges , dishwashers and airconditioners yet the prices of these ubiquitous household appliances have been falling since 1989 , reversing a decadesold trend toward higher prices and creating one of the pockets of deflation that keep appearing in these hard times deflation can be dangerous nothing so characterized the great depression as the phenomenon of falling prices , falling real estate values and falling wages , snowballing across the nation the pockets of deflation that exist today are only a shadow of that 1930 s experience , and almost certain to remain so but they are helping to gradually reshape the national outlook there has been a certain resurgence in fond memories of inflation , according to richard t curtin , director of the university of michigan s consumer research center , whose polls go back to the late 1940 s , the last period of noticeable deflation our surveys show that the kind of animosity that we have had toward inflation in the past decade is weakening at the edges people are starting to associate more inflation with more jobs and greater wealth that association might be helpful to presidentelect bill clinton his prescription for reviving the economy involves more spending on public works projects and tax credits to encourage companies to invest in machinery both are steps that in the past have increased the federal deficit deficit spending , in turn , often increases inflation a nolongersounhappy prospect , if the polls are accurate whatever the case , deflation is certainly a discussion topic in the clinton camp , derek shearer , an adviser to the presidentelect , said because some prices have fallen , the nation s annual inflation has been a very mild 3 percent or less in recent months business people that we deal with bring up deflation all the time , mr shearer said presumably , these business people include manufacturers of steel , paper , chemicals , oilfield equipment , aluminum , copper , printed cotton cloth and shipping cartons all have suffered from falling prices since the late 1980 s , according to the labor department , which tracks price changes even car manufacturers , which always seem to raise prices , have gotten a whiff of deflation in new car prices over the last 12 months in some cases , such as chemicals and paper , prices rose sharply until 1989 because demand exceeded supply and , to fill all the orders , plants operated at full capacity but as these industries opened new plants , the united states economy fell into the long period of recession and slow growth that still endures as demand has evaporated , the scramble for orders to keep the new plants busy has forced down prices , and as prices have fallen the companies have cut costs through layoffs , staff attrition and wage freezes similar labor costcutting is common in the home appliance industry , although deflation there has different causes five major manufacturers compete for sales at a time when the weak economy has curtailed home construction and also home remodeling , once major sources of sales we have become pretty much a replacement industry , marian stamos , a representative of the association of home appliance manufacturers , said and people nowadays resist replacing their appliances until repairs become too expensive the most dangerous deflation involves real estate values primarily office buildings where high vacancy rates have driven down rents and building values unable to repay loans , many building owners defaulted similarly , deflation has made many families reluctant to keep up mortgage payments why pay off a 130 , 000 mortgage to own a house whose resale value has declined to , say , 115 , 000 from 145 , 000 \? and , in fact , mortgage defaults have risen in the northeast and in california , where home price deflation has been greatest such defaults in the 1930 s brought on bank failures that wiped out the savings deposits of many americans wages also fell , making loan payments ever harder to pay to raise cash , there was panic selling of homes and businesses , and that made prices fall even more deflation spread none of these things are happening now wages are stagnant , but for most americans they are not falling more important , deposit insurance , bank bailouts and other federal programs have made the government , in effect , the custodian of buildings and other assets that in the 1930 s were so hurriedly sold but deflation , confined as it is today , clearly has delayed a recovery falling prices destroy wealth and prompt companies and consumers to cut back the mandate that the clinton administration has , said donald hilty , a chrysler corporation economist , is to stop deflation drawing
orlando , fla , jan 11 with a program that dazzled the judges for its theatrics if not its difficulty , christopher bowman completed a week filled with his own special brand of craziness to win the men s title of the national figureskating championships here today and make the united states olympic team for a second consecutive time after leading 18 other skaters through the original program on friday , bowman delivered just what he needed in the freeskate phase of competition , a safe but entertaining routine , to earn the highest scores from eight of the nine judges while he completed all seven of his triple jumps , none was the most difficult , the axel but it was a day for unusual scores paul wylie won the right to join bowman in the winter games at albertville , france , next month , finishing second even though he failed to complete his two tripleaxels and a third triple jump among the seven planned in his free skate wylie left the ice virtually certain he could not have been among the first two skaters , the ones certain to be named to the olympic team usually , the united states figure skating association puts the first three skaters from the nationals on the olympic team but the thirdplace finisher , mark mitchell , the hardluck skater of his generation , was held off the team in favor of todd eldredge , although that could change in two weeks eldredge , the 20yearold national champion of 1990 and 1991 who withdrew from this competition before it began because of a back injury , was named as the third member of the team on a conditional basis he must prove himself healthy enough to compete in the olympics by jan 24 , the date the albertville organizing committee has required all countries to designate their teams mitchell would get the third spot on the team if the association determines by then that eldredge cannot skate as well as mitchell the men s final was to be followed by an evening program featuring the women s free skate kristi yamaguchi , nancy kerrigan and the defending champion , tonya harding , were leading after the original program friday night the title was the second in the event in four years for bowman , a 24yearold skater from van nuys , calif , known for his entertaining nature on and off the ice he won in 1989 , the first year after brian boitano s departure to professional skating in 1990 , he could not skate because of a back injury , and last year , eldredge beat him displaying calm amid tension for any number of reasons , not the least of which was the week he endured leading to the competition , this would seem a most satisfying achievement he arrived in orlando amid a swirl of rumors growing in size and severity that he was or is a frequent partaker of illegal drugs the association went to far as to issue a statement , saying there was no hard evidence to prove bowman was anything less than a model citizen while another skater might have reacted with shock , dismay or anger and buckeld , bowman thrived he was splended in his original program and even better in what he did in the free skate , even if it did not please all who watched , including those who questioned why he failed to include a tripleaxel this took every drop of my blood , bowman said , sitting beside his third coach in two years , john nicks , at a news conference the tripleaxel was a decision between my coach and myself this was something i wanted to do in this event , i did n't need it i want to peak in albertville , and this is the gateway to albertville there will definitely be a different scenario there nicks took credit for the strategy of not including the tripleaxel , more difficult from other triples because it requires an additional halfrotation he cited his 30 years of coaching for providing him the intuition that bowman would not need it if that suggested he had a touch of clairvoyance , sensing the other skaters would fail in critical ways , he said nothing to dispel the notion this was the program that christoper needed at this time , he said an opposite opinion they both took particular exception to remarks made by dick button , the former national champion who was commentating for abc sports speaking to reporters after the telecast , button called bowman s program ordinary , boring , slow , conservative and sedate but i have a full head of hair , bowman said like bowman , wylie , a 27yearold cum laude graduate of harvard , was a member of the united states team at the 1988 winter games in calgary , although neither of them skated well there bowman was seventh and wylie 10th as boitano took the gold medal this was wylie s 11th attempt for a national title and one of his least impressive while his elegance never betrayed him in the original program or the free skate , which is worth twice as much in the final accounting , he failed to covert his more difficult elements on friday and again today i wish i could have hit everything in my performance , he said i pressed through and landed everything in the ending but when i went and got changed , i was did not expect to be in the award ceremony photo christopher bowman during his winning performance in the finals of the singles competition yesterday \( associated press \) \( pg 4 \)
albany , june 3 in a bizarre legal sideshow to the congressional redistricting battle , a state judge today invalidated the new lines for state senate elections this fall , acting on a lawsuit that the republicans who drew up the senate lines insisted had been kept secret from them the judge , leland degrasse , issued a fourpage ruling that said there had been numerous violations of the state constitution , including unnecessary crossing of county lines and unequal populations in the 61 senate districts he said the court reserved the right to draw the lines on its own but senate republicans cried foul and vowed to moved for a dismissal in state and federal courts , arguing that the senate republican leader should have been named as a defendant they said they had never been served papers the judge s ruling appears to indicate that no republicans were named as defendants instead , the senate official technically named was a democrat , lieut gov stan lundine , the senate president gov mario m cuomo , attorney general robert abrams and the assembly speaker , saul weprin , all democrats , were also named as defendants the senate s republican majority leader , ralph j marino , who controls the chamber s business , assailed the surprise lawsuit in a statement tonight he described it as a political dirty trick that is more characteristic of the democratic bosses of tammany hall than the pseudodemocratic reformers of today mr marino added the fact that the state s top democrats were all sued in relation to the senate lines , and kept that suit secret not only from the republican majority in the senate but the public as well , should serve notice to each and every new yorker of the types of lowdown political dirty tricks the democrats play in our state mr lundine dismissed mr marino s statement , saying the charge that one particular lawsuit was secret is ridiculous all lawsuits are a matter of public record , and by their very nature cannot be kept secret mr weprin s spokesman , steven greenberg , said the suit was routinely included in a list of the dozens of legal actions related to redistricting that mr weprin faces in carrying out the speaker s duties it s not our job , he said , to make sure that the senate officials knew about the suits , adding , they could have looked it up the assembly lines , drawn by the democrats who control that house , were not at issue in the action the plaintiffs were several registered voters from new york city , westchester county , rochester and buffalo , none of whom appeared to be household names senate officials said that the use of the voters as plaintiffs was a device , and that the democratic officials had in essence arranged to have themselves sued in a case they wanted to lose judge degrasse s political affiliation could not be determined tonight despite senate assertions that he was a democratic party henchman he said in his ruling that he was acting on issues unrelated to the pending united states justice department review of the plan that review will determine whether the plan conforms with federal voting rights act provisions intended to maximize minoritygroup influence
the new york stock exchange fined shearson lehman brothers and two senior traders a total of 600 , 000 yesterday for manipulating the price of a stock immediately before a public offering underwritten by the firm after a 19month investigation , the big board charged that peter j dapuzzo , the former cohead of international equities , and emmanuel geronimos , the former manager for shearson s institutional block trading , arranged for a trade to manipulate downward the price of conagra inc common stock at the time of a stock offering in november 1990 the exchange also charged that the firm failed to control the distribution of proposed and approved stock research rating changes and failed to supervise trading surveillance several punishments shearson and the two traders settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt details of the proposed settlement were disclosed last month shearson was censured by the big board , fined 500 , 000 and ordered to tighten the rules on the flow of information between its investment banking operations and trading division mr dapuzzo , who now works with steinhardt partners , a money management firm , was also censured , fined 100 , 000 and barred from any association with a member firm for four months steinhardt is not a member of the new york stock exchange mr geronimos was censured and was barred from any association with a member firm for two months the shearson case caught widespread attention on wall street because mr dapuzzo was a widely known and influential trader when he and mr geronimos went on leave from shearson after the big board investigation began , rumors began to circulate that the equities division had been rife with wrongdoing but with almost none of the rumors substantiated by the big board s investigation , shearson executives uninvolved in the case were looking at yesterday s outcome as something of a small victory this is n't half as bad as some people thought , one shearson executive said , speaking on condition that he not be identified people involved in the case said yesterday that they did not expect regulators to go any further although the securities and exchange commission requested documents months ago in the case , there has been no indication that anything has been pursued cost to shearson 105 million still , the case has been costly to shearson , which has now paid 105 million to resolve the problem the firm paid conagra 550 , 000 , the additional amount it would have received in its stock offering had the manipulation not occurred the new york stock exchange investigation , which began on a tip from a shearson employee who was ordered to participate in the trade , found that executives at the firm were under great pressure to get the price of conagra s stock lower at the time of the offering the firm had arranged for a number of buyers to purchase 44 million shares of conagra stock at 3325 in november 1990 but , on nov 20 , the day before the offering , 5 , 900 shares changed hands in the last minute of trading , pushing the price up to 33375 a share , the big board complaint says that rise made a number of the prospective buyers uneasy , and several of them called shearson to say that they were unwilling to buy the new offering at the higher share price conagra , fearful that the offering would appear to have been priced at a discount , asked for the offering price to be raised to the higher level after some negotiations , conagra agreed to price the stock issue at the closing price on the pacific stock exchange , which stays open later than the big board details of accusations the exchange complaint states that mr dapuzzo then asked mr geronimos to instruct some employees to arrange for conagra common stock to close at 3325 on the pacific exchange a shearson employee had a floor broker on that exchange place a trade at the close , selling 100 shares of conagra at 3325 the broker put the trade in his error account , effectively guaranteeing that the trade would not be cleared a spokesman for the firm , steve faigen , said that shearson had already taken steps to correct the problems found by the big board he added that an internal review found no incidents where the former procedures resulted in placing customers at a disadvantage mr dapuzzo , 51 years old , said yesterday that he had settled the charges to put the problem behind him i had to settle because it was taking too much time and costing too much money , he said and i am really relieved the only thing i had to consent to was that there was a 100share transaction every other issue of concern passed the litmus test
of all the media mergers in the last few years , none seemed to have a greater chance of success than the matsushita electric industrial company s 61 billion acquisition of mca inc in 1990 the marriage was free of many of the blights on other deals while the sony corporation is thought by many in the industry to have overpaid for both columbia pictures and a new management team , and time warner has been digging itself out of debt since its merger , matsushita is thought to have paid reasonably for mca and it did so without relying much on leverage mca is among the most valuable and most stable studios in hollywood although the heads of other studios have come and gone , lew wasserman has remained at the mca helm for 46 years , 19 of them with sidney j sheinberg as his president one of the last of the hollywood moguls , mr wasserman expanded mca s holdings beyond universal pictures the production studio whose movies included such hits as et and jaws to include theme parks , movie theaters and a music and book company given that track record , matsushita was not about to risk costly turnover and a potentially disruptive transition by bringing in a new management team , as sony did at columbia nevertheless , while executives at matsushita headquarters in osaka insist that the merger is proceeding well and most in hollywood are reluctant to talk about the subject for the record , extensive interviews with executives inside and out of mca indicate that , 16 months after the union , relations between the studio and its new owner are badly strained more than anything , the rising tensions seem to billboard the difficulties of bridging the gap between two very different businesses and cultures to create the global media conglomerates so highly touted in the 1980 s as one rival entertainment executive put it , creative businesses are people businesses you have to have the right people in place , and let them pick the right talent matsushita might not understand that because people are n't as important in hardware businesses hollywood executives say that as a staid , 47 billionayear industrial and consumer electronics monolith and a newcomer to the movie business matsushita was ill prepared to cope with the booms and busts of hollywood from the outset , it has had only a polite and superficial acquaintance with mca executives , freeing the latter from secondguessing from osaka losing virgin records but in the wake of a disappointing year at mca and a bleak market in japan for consumer electronics , matsushita , some executives at mca and other studios believe , has grown nervous and heavier handed , antagonizing some mca top brass and sparking speculation in the industry that executives including mr sheinberg and david geffen , the record impresario might leave by far the biggest blow to mca s autonomy came in december , when matsushita refused to let the studio expand its record business internationally by bidding for britishbased virgin records it was not only that mca executives had worked on a deal for seven months , only to be told brusquely by matsushita not to proceed many felt matsushita was reneging on its original vow to help mca grow to remain competitive in an era of megamergers and mightier rivals like time warner if matsushita is not helping us become bigger and better , then likely i'm not going to continue there because i am only interested in winning , said david geffen , who sold his record company to mca before the buyout and subsequently sold his mca stock to matsushita for 710 million mamoru furuichi , a member of matsushita s board , said through a translator that mr geffen s goals are the same as the company s it is also our hope to be no 1 in the world we have the same target the virgin decision also highlighted the changing power structure at mca one longtime associate recalls mr wasserman saying somewhat wistfully , 'you know , i ca n't make a deal now without the japanese' the associate added , that is a real departure from his glorious past he had been the king now , he is a lion in winter it was really sad can you imagine lew wasserman going to osaka as a division head \? a potential further encroachment on mca s independence was matsushita s creation in march of a new division in osaka to interface with mca the 20person entertainment arts division will be headed by mr furuichi , who will spend one week a month in los angeles the division will work to support mca in japan and to help projects worldwide in the business area , not the creative area , mr furuichi said but that step and matsushita s increasing requests for extensive financial data from mca added to the uncertainties in hollywood over its parent s agenda mr sheinberg , a craggy , outspoken former lawyer of 57 , says the new group can help smooth prickly relations if it supports mca and presents the big things we want to do so matsushita can digest it in their fashion but , he adds carefully , if someone gets the idea that the group will supervise mca or in some sense develop into a shadow government , none of which has happened , it will be a disaster he said he was hopeful that mca executives will be able to run the company as planned matters of style
moscow , nov 26 president boris n yeltsin and the leader of his government , yegor t gaidar , today rebuffed opposition demands for major policy or personnel changes , drawing the political battle lines four days before the start of an anxiously awaited session of the full russian parliament for days reports had circulated in moscow that mr yeltsin had struck a compromise with civic union , the major centrist opposition coalition , that included adopting portions of its economic program and a change of several key cabinet members but in a policy address today to the sitting parliament , mr gaidar outlined an economic program that specifically rejected several important demands of the opposition he said there would be no return to direct statecontrolled distribution of resources , no freeze on prices and wages , no artificial rate for the ruble and no large new credits to state industries then mr yeltsin s office announced that gennadi burbulis , a senior presidential aide who has long been one of the opposition s main targets , had been dropped as state secretary , only to be reassigned as head of the president s group of advisers later in the day , mr yeltsin reportedly assured a group of deputies that there would be no further changes in the government if that was so , the only changes in advance of the congress were the resignation of one cabinet member , information minister mikhail poltoranin , the shift of mr burbulis and the dismissal of the head of the central radio and television network , yegor yakovlev the latter action was not even clearly linked to the congress none of the changes affected mr gaidar s team of ministers and aides who are directly responsible for plotting and applying economic policies mr poltoranin was an old ally of mr yeltsin s , and mr yakovlev made his name in reform journalism under mikhail s gorbachev , the former soviet president there was no telling whether the book was firmly closed politicians agreed that mr yeltsin could still jettison more aides after the congress began , and parliament is certain to assail mr gaidar s program when it meets on friday deputies gave a sampling of their irritation today with speeches from some hardliners demanding a vote of noconfidence in mr gaidar , the acting prime minister for the moment at least , mr yeltsin and mr gaidar appeared to have rejected any tactical compromise civic union s initial reaction was one of surprise tass quoted arkady volsky , a leader of the opposition coalition , as saying that virtually all of the proposals agreed on with the government were absent from the government s program mr volsky said the governing board of the coalition would meet on saturday to give its assessment to the situation seeking a slower pace civic union has agreed with the government s broad aim of instilling a marketoriented economy but the coalition had sought a far slower pace , with a more gradual elimination of state controls it also reportedly sought a far broader reshuffle of the government there had been rumors that several senior cabinet members possibly including the ministers of foreign affairs , economics and foreign economic relations would be sacrificed in exchange for political support at the congress of peoples' deputies next week , mr yeltsin and his government are expected to come under sustained attack , and the support of civic union a coalition of power managers of state industries and several moderate conservative parties had been viewed as crucial for the president but after a meeting with mr yeltsin today , foreign minister andrei kozyrev told reporters , there will be no change in the team or its policy in its broad outlines , mr gaidar s policy speech did not set out any major variations in previously outlined policies but that , in fact , was the novelty , since most deputies who packed into the parliament chamber had expected to hear a new compromise economic program
even in new york city s troubled child protection system , this oversight was remarkable none of the caseworkers who investigated allegations that doris harden had mistreated her children discovered that she had previously served three years in prison for holding down a 7yearold girl while another young woman sexually assaulted the child with a toilet plunger the four workers missed other important details as well ignorant of the prior abuse conviction , they initially did not speak with the mother s parole officers , who knew she was a crack user who had refused treatment the workers interviewed ms harden , but never talked to her boyfriends , despite warnings that one of the men was prone to violence and drug dealing fatal burns it was one of ms harden s boyfriends who later said he had accidentally caused what proved to be fatal burns to the groin , buttocks and legs of her fivemonthold son , jeffrey the roundfaced infant with the soft , fuzzy head of hair died jan 17 the boyfriend , jeffrey phillips , told the authorities that he had wiped the baby with a cloth that he had not realized was soaked with cleaning fluid the medical examiner ruled the death a homicide , saying the burns were caused by immersing the child in scalding water and noting that the child had three broken ribs mr phillips has not been charged , and the police say the death is still under investigation mr phillips declined to comment whether the caseworkers in the city s child welfare administration could have prevented the child s death will never be known , but the flaws in the handling of jeffrey harden s case illustrate what experts and advocates for children have long called the achilles' heel of the child protection system in new york and the nation the frequently poor quality of casework in a fragmented bureaucracy staffed by inexperienced , overburdened workers who do not stay in the job for long over the last three years , the problem has gotten worse as the dinkins administration has reduced the staff of caseworkers who investigate child abuse by about 25 percent , even as reports of abuse and neglect have continued to surpass 50 , 000 annually last year , a staggering 77 percent of the workers who investigate child abuse reports resigned , were laid off or moved to jobs in other agencies inevitably , caseloads have risen sharply in january 1990 , investigative workers carried an average of 14 cases none had more than 30 now , caseloads average 195 and commonly top 30 in the harden case , high turnover led to a constant stream of changing workers in a span of only 18 months , the case was passed to four different workers , each of whom would manage only a partial investigation before transferring out of the unit responsible for the case by the time jeffrey died , every worker in the unit was gone the city s 22page reconstruction of the case , combined with court records and interviews with the family , caseworkers and parole officers , shows what happens when workers with too many cases and too little experience conduct investigations but the problem is not simply one of human error in the harden case , the workers had to make extremely difficult decisions with incomplete information child protection workers are not entitled to parents' prior criminal records , which are kept confidential under state laws meant to safeguard privacy but if their ignorance of ms harden s prior childabuse conviction was understandable at first , it was less so after she went back to prison for a parole violation workers talked to her parole officers , but never found out what crime she had committed usually , the city s handling of childabuse investigations is shielded from public scrutiny by state confidentiality laws meant to protect family privacy but records of the city s internal investigation of the harden case were provided to the new york times by an official who believes they highlight failings of the system in a recent interview , ms harden denied all reports that she was an abusive or neglectful parent , and she denied ever using crack she said she had never left her children alone in her apartment , and she disputed the hospital s account of how rarely she visited her baby before he died , saying that she had visited every day caseworker no 1 a report of abuse is not followed up ms harden , now 28 , first got into serious trouble when she was a teenager she lived at the time with her mother and most of her 11 siblings in a housing project in the south bronx she had dropped out of school in the ninth grade , where she had been in a special class for slow learners on may 17 , 1981 , ms harden , then 17 , smoked marijuana and angel dust with a 15yearold friend , eva younger , ms harden later said then they sexually assaulted a chubby , 7yearold girl in pigtails ms younger told the court that she repeatedly forced a toilet plunger into the child while ms harden held the girl down ms harden testified that ms younger made her participate in the assault after threatening to hit her with a stick if she did not smoke marijuana i felt dizzy and i did n't know what was going on , she told the judge something just come up in my mind and i did it
drexel burnham lambert inc sued hundreds of its former employees yesterday in an attempt to recover more than 250 million in bonuses paid shortly before the company filed for bankruptcy in early 1990 the bonuses have been at the heart of some of the biggest controversies resulting from the collapse of the wall street powerhouse indeed , the size of drexel s bonuses was long a legend on wall street , but yesterday s lawsuit for the first time provides details of how rich those payments were , showing that many executives got between 100 , 000 and 1 million each month the largest bonus , 166 million , went to leon black , former head of mergers and acquisitions , less than a month before the bankruptcy filing but the largesse was widespread , with more than 50 executives receiving more than 1 million even as the firm s finances deteriorated connection to reality since the collapse , some drexel executives have said the bonus payments seemed to lose all connection with reality in the final years as billions of dollars in revenues flowed through the firm still , the huge payouts appeared almost minuscule in comparison with the more than 1 billion paid over five years to michael r milken , the former head of the junk bond division last year mr milken pleaded guilty to six felonies involving securities laws violations and is now serving a 10year prison sentence drexel is now negotiating a settlement of other litigation against mr milken while the payments have come back to haunt all the drexel executives who received them , no bonus money is being sought from the former head of the firm , frederick h joseph in the months before the bankruptcy , mr joseph was scrambling to strengthen the firm s financial condition and took all of his bonus in stock , whose value was wiped out wildly out of control but mr joseph is widely held accountable for a bonus structure that many believe flew wildly out of control the payments made shortly before the bankruptcy came largely as a result of guarantees mr joseph had made earlier that year as the firm deteriorated no effort was made to renege or even renegotiate those guarantees rory o millson , a lawyer with cravath , swaine moore who is representing drexel , said the firm was also negotiating with other executives who are not included in the suits filed yesterday about possible settlements of claims against them resulting from the bonus payments while the payments raised questions about whether the executives took the money with the knowledge that drexel was going under , mr millson said that the firm did not have to prove such an allegation to recoup the money under the bankruptcy code in october , in a report examining the bonuses , the securities and exchange commission criticized the payments as excessive but concluded that drexel had done nothing illegal in making them such payments to insiders shortly before a bankruptcy are often classified as a preference , because executives got benefits that other creditors did not under the bankruptcy code , a company can sue for the return of preference payments dating as far back as a year before the filing date pursuit blocked in some cases that restriction will prevent drexel from going after some of the highest bonuses that were paid for example , a little more than a year before drexel filed for bankruptcy , the firm paid a bonus of 165 million to peter ackerman , a top official in the junk bond department mr ackerman was paid only 5 million in the year before the filing , according to the sec report the bonus guarantees proved devastating to the firm in june 1989 , as the firm was experiencing huge losses in its junk bond investments and deals it underwrote , drexel paid about 105 million in bonuses to about 120 executives in its corporate finance division alone by july , the firm s condition had worsened , but the bonuses kept going up , with the corporate finance executives getting about 163 million that month the total payments in those months were slightly lower for the more than 60 executives in the junk bond division with about 78 million paid in june and about 66 million paid in july but bonus payments exploded in august for the 60 executives , who divided up about 254 million for the month multimilliondollar bonuses totaling as much as 20 million in a single month continued to be paid every month to the junk bond division until bankruptcy lifetime s worth of pay those payments gave many drexel employees more money in a single month than many would see in a lifetime for example , john kissick , who was named to replace mr milken as head of the division in 1989 , was paid about 1 million a month from june though december 1989 in 1990 , he received more than 300 , 000 before the firm collapsed some executives were paid millions even if they did little or no work for example , terren peizer , a trader in the division who spent most of his time as a government witness against mr milken , and little or none at work , was paid about 25 million in the eight months before the collapse following is a list of all drexel executives who received more than 1 million in bonuses in the eight months before the bankruptcy filing corporate finance department joseph adams 15 million christian g andersen 24 million joel asen 1 million jeffrey beck 25 million martin berman 13 million arthur bilger 38

parity \( the league would prefer to call it competitiveness \) is so much a fact of pro football life that it is possible no new playoff teams will be determined today thus making millions of fans , and more than 1 , 000 players , uncertain about postseason payoffs until next weekend going into yesterday s buffalodenver game , only four clubs were assured of the 12 playoff berths , and none has even clinched a division but some grand old names can return to their onceaccustomed spots as division champions by the close of business tonight pittsburgh could win the american conference central division for the first time since 1984 , and dallas can top the national conference east for the first time since '85 over all , four division champions could be crowned twenty teams remain alive the eight alsorans include two teams that made the playoffs last year the jets and the bears the others already eliminated are the bengals , lions , patriots , cardinals , seahawks and buccaneers the worst teams still with a chance are the giants , falcons and rams , all 58 some scenarios for this weekend minnesota can clinch the nfc central title if it defeats san francisco at home while green bay loses at houston tonight dallas would win its division if it beats washington on the road or if philadelphia loses at seattle san francisco can win its sixth nfc west title in seven years if it defeats minnesota and new orleans loses to the rams in los angeles pittsburgh can win its division even if it does n't beat chicago , as long as houston and cleveland both lose buffalo , miami and washington can clinch playoff berths , but only with help from one or more teams ok , if you must ask buffalo needs either cleveland , houston , kansas city or san diego to lose miami needs losses by indianapolis , houston , cleveland , denver and kansas city washington needs green bay to lose and philadelphia to win injury relations behind the headlines about the injury that paralyzed the jets' dennis byrd , the repeated concussions that led to the retirement of his teammate al toon and the numerous quarterbacks being knocked out of action is the fact that 224 players have been on injured reserve this season that means one of every seven players in the league has missed at least four games though 227 players went on injured reserve last season , the publicity surrounding injuries is increasing and now trainers have guidelines from the league on how to speak to the news media the advice in the pamphlet they receive includes the following never answer a question with 'no comment' it makes you sound guilty learn to answer negative questions with positive answers prepare your thoughts in advance , take a deep breath and relax smile it will make people like you hall of honor in the confusion of the marines' landing in somalia last week , not much attention was paid to the mv lummus , a containerizedcargo carrier that supplied much of the needs of the first wave of troops the

dallas , oct 26 while saying he wanted to put the issue behind him , ross perot kept alive his story of republican campaign skulduggery today , and the white house spokesman suggested the independent candidate was paranoid other presidential aides later tried to soften that tone in a surprise appearance at a press briefing that was being conducted by some of his aides , mr perot first said he accepted the denials from the bush camp of a plot to embarrass his daughter but he then suggested that he did not believe the denials , since they had not been made until he had disclosed his suspicions in a television interview mr perot said on the cbs news program 60 minutes on sunday that he had dropped out of the presidential race in july because he had been informed of a republican plan to smear his daughter carolyn with a doctored photograph depicting her in a lewd manner , and to disrupt her aug 23 wedding 'would n't you respond \? he said today that on two occasions before he reentered the race he had discussed the matter with bush aides , including james a baker 3d , the white house chief of staff , and that no one had issued a denial until the day of the 60 minutes broadcast let s assume that somebody that you knew well , accused you i never accused anybody , i just said i was told this would happen of something this bizarre , mr perot said today would n't you respond \? would n't you , particularly if you wanted the millions of people who support that man to support you would n't you at least go back and say , we 've looked into this we did n't do it we do n't know anybody who did \? mr perot s comments prompted a tart rejoinder from marlin fitzwater , the president s press secretary it s so crazy that he seems to have latched onto this theory , much like other people latch onto ufo theories , and he seems to believe it , said mr fitzwater , with the president s campaign in denver 'delusions' are suggested i think the news media needs to take a look at this because they 're the only ones left who can investigate it and prevent us from electing a paranoid person who has delusions , mr fitzwater added this man simply cannot see the truth other republican officials sought to soften some of mr fitzwater s remarks not long after they had been made asked by reporters later in the day if he thought mr perot was paranoid , mr baker said , not in my view , no but he added , when someone makes this kind of charge , they ought to provide some little scintilla of evidence mr baker also disputed mr perot s account , saying that a number of top republicans , including barbara bush , had spoken with mr perot and had told him the dirtytricks reports were untrue about 25 minutes into press briefing by his aides , mr perot appeared , he said , to set the record straight he told reporters i watched the early part of this on cnn let s get a few things straight he then began a lengthy , often testy , explanation of events that came to light from the interview he gave on 60 minutes meanwhile , top advisers to gov bill clinton , quietly gleeful , stayed carefully above the fray never interrupt your opponent when he s making a fool of himself , said paul begala , a senior clinton strategist gaining in the polls mr perot s accusations came at a time when public opinion polls were showing that his strong performance in the presidential debates and his heavy advertising on television and radio had produced gains for him with the voters but the new accusations have once again allowed his critics to portray the texan as someone who shoots from the hip on the slimmest of evidence and they are pointing out that the reasons he gave on 60 minutes for dropping out of the race are not the reasons he gave when he announced his decision on july 16 at that time , mr perot said he was dropping out because the democratic party had been rejuvenated and because he did not want to throw the election into the house of representatives and perhaps contribute to a constitutional crisis since mr perot reentered the race on oct 1 , the bush campaign has been careful about criticizing him , fearing that attacking the dallas businessman would alienate his supporters and realizing that mr perot was drawing votes away from mr clinton but mr fitzwater said today that the republicans had decided to become more aggressive about mr perot because they feared voters were beginning to believe his accusations , even though they had been greeted with skepticism by news reporters the press saw it that way , but i'm not sure america did , mr fitzwater said of doubts about mr perot s accusations baker tells of denials mr baker said mr perot had been given direct denials of any plot against his daughter marlin fitzwater , bob teeter , barbara bush and george bush have all said there is nothing to this , mr baker told reporters at a bush campaign stop today george bush told you last night , and barbara bush told perot and margot perot at the debates when they were up there on the stage there was nothing to this mr perot is about to begin broadcasting a new set of nine 60second and 30second television commercials , as well as the new 30minute paid program he broadcast tonight in that presentation , on abc , mr perot spent little time discussing his proposals for the nation s economy , instead providing what was in essence a seminar on how to create and build a small business producers of the cbs program said today they had investigated the reports and had been unable to substantiate them don hewitt , executive prodcuer of 60 minutes , said he doubted if the accusations would have been put on the air if mr perot had not discussed them in an interview conducted he had last week with the 60 minutes correspondent , leslie stahl as he has done often throughout his campaign , mr perot today angrily accused reporters of distortions that make him look bad he singled out morton dean of abc news for a report last week that raised doubts about mr perot s story that five armed black panthers had been discovered crossing the lawn of his north dallas home in the early 1970 s bent on doing him or his family harm mr perot has said that the gunmen were chased away by a guard dog mr perot said he had told mr dean that a number of people , including his son ross jr , could verify the story the younger perot , who was a boy at the time of the incident , told reporters in the briefing today that he had not actually seen the terrorists , but had been told about them by his father officials of the dallas police and the federal bureau of investigation said they had no report in their records of any such incident the police did say that mr perot has often notified them of minor incidents occurred outside his home when a reporter asked why the press could not talk to the security guard who had spotted the attackers , mr perot snapped because it s none of your business it has nothing to do with the campaign but harold birkhead , a retired marine who was one of mr perot s security guards at the time , said in a telephone interview today that the incident never occurred he said mr perot did not have guard dogs on his property at that time this is just a figment of his imagination , mr birkhead said photos reporters surrounded james a baker 3d , chief of staff , on a denver

amsterdam , oct 8 all day , the curious make the 20minute metro ride from the center of the city to the apartment building where an el al cargo jet crashed on sunday evening many stand and watch as cranes continue to lower lines into the scorched gap the plane tore in the building , searching for bodies among the rubble the crash , which prime minister ruud lubbers called the worst disaster in the netherlands since world war ii , has focused attention on the daily tragedies in the lives of the residents of bijlmermeer , the poorest quarter of the city and the visitors making the trip to the crash site are discovering a part of the city some never knew existed center for immigrants bijlmermeer is teeming with immigrants from africa , asia and the caribbean some immigrants come to take

junkies and the people who do n't work and you wonder this is my country and i am not afraid , but it cannot go on forever like this lab at airport the city authorities have tried to reassure the illegals who might have friends or family in the wreckage to come forward with reports of the missing i promise you that you will not get into difficulties , said ed van thijn , amsterdam s mayor the city has set up a laboratory at schiphol airport , 10 miles from bijlmermeer , to identify the bodies and coordinate the reports of the missing so far , 51 bodies have been found , and some dutch officials are now projecting a death toll of around 120 people instead of the 250 estimated to have died shortly after the crash , reuters reported the authorities say that some victims may have been

pittsburgh , may 28 man for man , the chicago blackhawks are n't as skilled as the pittsburgh penguins , even though they have a few sharpshooters the most accurate are jeremy roenick and steve larmer , who have combined for 212 points in the regular season and playoffs when the blackhawks tried to even the stanley cup finals tonight against the defending champion penguins at civic arena , roenick and larmer were sitting on the bench for long stretches of the game chicago coach mike keenan decided to play his intimidation specialists , mike peluso and stu grimson , who have accounted for 16 points and 658 penalty minutes approaching playoff record keenan s strategy did n't work , although any other approach might have failed as well in a game filled with close checking , the penguins won , 31 , behind two goals from mario lemieux pittsburgh now holds a twogamestonone lead as the series moves to chicago for games 3 and 4 on saturday and monday nights meanwhile , lemieux has compiled 15 goals in 13 playoff games , four short of the postseason record shared by reggie leach of the 1976 philadelphia flyers and jari kurri of the 1985 edmonton oilers lemieux had the gamewinner in the 54 openinggame victory tuesday night and now has four goals in the first two games of this series lemieux , who won the conn smythe trophy as the most valuable player in last year s stanley cup finals , missed six games in the playoffs with a broken bone in his left hand the penguins lost the game in which lemieux was injured , and the game that followed but since then , they have won nine consecutive games , two short of the league s postseason record set earlier in the playoffs by chicago i'm playing some pretty good hockey right now , said lemieux , whose goals came on quick shots from the slot after passes from the right side from rick tocchet the first goal , the gamewinner at 12 minutes 55 seconds of the second period , came on a power play and broke a 11 tie surprised by toughguy strategy lemieux said he was surprised by keenan s strategy everyone was surprised not to see roenick and larmer play much , he said i guess it s up to mike keenan to decide who he puts on the ice before the game , keenan had complained that lemieux takes intentional dives in an effort to get the referees to call penalties against the opposition in this case , the blackhawks keenan did n't discuss the officiating after tonight s game , but he explained his reason for benching roenick and larmer he said they were unable to penetrate the pittsburgh zone and had provided chicago with very little offensive thrust we were trying to wear the penguins down with our bigger players and take the body more frequently , keenan said he said roenick , as well as the rest of the players on our club , is going to have to get better roenick , 22 years old and in his fourth season , admitted he was too keyed up in game 1 but he thought he was playing better tonight , before his lengthy breaks began midway in the second period i'm not going to argue with him , he said of keenan nothing he does surprises me anymore mike has his reasons for doing things i do n't know his reasons and i do n't really care i worry about what i'm going to do his teammates took several unprovoked and unnecessary penalties , including one for having too many men on the ice , the second consecutive game in which they have done that when it was suggested that the blackhawks were in disarray , roenick responded we were obviously we were shorthanded goal for penguins everything seemed to backfire for chicago when pittsburgh s paul stanton took two minor penalties on the same play to give the hawks a fourminute power play midway in the first period , it was the penguins who scored , with bob errey taking a long lead pass , racing down the ice and beating goalie ed belfour with a soft backhand shot bad goal , said keenan , an equalopportunity critic later , belfour stopped lemieux with a sweeping stick check on a breakaway bryan marchment tied the game for chicago at 10 24 of the second period , but that was it for the blackhawks lemieux scored twice in the next five minutes , and chicago was unable to answer back players on both sides talked about how different it might be when the teams go to chicago stadium , which has a smaller rink and vociferous fans perhaps if michael jordan can learn to skate , the hawks will have a better chance of evening the series there slap shots between the second and third periods , the ottawa senators won a coin flip staged by john zielgler , the league president , and will choose first in the expansion draft next month the tampa bay lightning will have the first pick in the entry draft of amateur players ottawa and tampa join the nhl next season , bringing the league to 24 franchises the nhl , which has n't had a contract to appear on a major american network since 1975 , is knocking around ideas to get more visibility

san francisco , april 8 american semiconductor manufacturers , the bedrock of the nation s hightechnology industry , have stopped the japanese erosion of their competitiveness and might be poised to make a comeback after a decade of decline , according to a growing number of industry executives and analysts the new assessment represents a sharp contrast from the prevailing view five or six years ago , when many executives and analysts were saying that the american producers of silicon chips were in danger of being driven to extinction by the japanese that prospect raised concern among government and industry officials because semiconductors are critical for national defense , given their use in advanced electronic weaponry and since chips are the basic building blocks of computers , telephones and robots , there was concern that if the american chip industry faltered , it would weaken the entire electronics industry , one of the nation s largest employers for now , the american share of the world semiconductor market has leveled off at just under 40 percent , up from recent levels but down from more than 60 percent in the 1970 s for the first time in years , there was even a gain in 1990 and some executives expect to see gains for 1991 and 1992 as well , although preliminary figures for 1991 do not show this meanwhile , the japanese share of the world market peaked at 51 percent in 1988 and has dropped a bit since equipment makers gain american companies that make the equipment used in semiconductor production also appeared to be making a comeback today in washington , sematech , the semiconductor industry consortium , and vlsi research inc , a market research firm in san jose , calif , announced that leading american makers of such production equipment registered an increase in 1991 worldwide market share to nearly 41 percent from 38 percent in 1990 the big question now is whether the american semiconductor industry can actually gain ground or whether , after a hiatus , it will begin sliding again many executives and analysts say they expect a stalemate , with neither the japanese nor the american producers gaining much ground still , even that would be good news , given the trouble some other industries , like consumer electronics and automobiles , have had in stemming a slide i do n't consider it a comeback , it s a stabilization , said andrew s grove , president of the intel corporation , a major american chip producer still , he added , i think the auto executives would kill for this indeed , the playing field today seems vastly different than in the middle 1980 s , when japanese companies had driven most american companies out of the business of making the most widely used chip and when even the central intelligence agency concluded that the american industry could not compete in its present form the american resurgence stems partly from a shift in the economics of the business in a way that favors products that the american companies specialize in also , american chip quality has vastly improved and government programs to help the industry , such as the sematech consortium and the semiconductor trade agreement with japan , have played some role as well but the main factor appears to be a victory of sorts of brain over brawn , as american companies have continued to lead and even increase their lead in cleverly designed and highly profitable chips these include microprocessors that serve as the central calculating chips in personal computers , as well as chips that specialize in displaying images on a computer screen , processing sound and video signals for computers and transmitting information the japanese companies have surged to dominate the market for memory chips , which store information in computers but they require huge investments and produce little profits surprisingly , the japanese have not been able to follow up their success in that business by moving strongly into others kinds of chips instead , the japanese find themselves overly dependent on the market for memory chips the result is that many japanese companies are believed to be losing money in their semiconductor operations and may no longer be able to maintain their high investments it is possible to build a case now that you could n't make five years ago that the american semiconductor industry is in a better position than the japanese , said michael borrus , an industry expert at the university of california at berkeley difficult future is still forecast but others say danger still lies ahead ian m ross , chairman of the national advisory committee on semiconductors , said the recent rise in american market share and fall in japanese share stemmed largely from declines in the prices of memory chips , which hurt japanese companies disproportionately in a report issued in february , the committee , which was formed to develop a national strategy to help the industry , concluded that the american industry continues to be under intense pressure from its international competitors
orlando , fla , march 7 the chicago white sox have begun a process that would enable them to retain bo jackson but avoid a march 15 decision on his contract option jackson , whose labored , limp running in spring training appearances has shown he is not ready to play serious baseball , was placed on waivers thursday for the purpose of removing him from the club s 40man major league roster and signing him to a minor league contract but the real intention , according to a general manager of another team , is to have jackson become a free agent so the white sox can sign him to a new minor league contract the white sox have not announced their move , but two general managers said jackson s name appeared on the waiver wire thursday ron schueler , the general manager of the white sox , said he was not at liberty to discuss waivers asked about the idea of signing jackson to a minor league contract , schueler said , we have discussed options , but none of these will come out until after the 15th the white sox must decide by march 15 whether they want to exercise the option they have on jackson s contract for the coming season the procedure the white sox were said to be following works this way if no team puts in a claim in the 72hour waiver period that expires at 2 pm tuesday \( only business days count \) , the white sox could remove jackson from the 40man roster they then would request jackson s permission to send him to the minors they need his permission because he has been in the major leagues for more than three years jackson would refuse the assignment and become a free agent the white sox would then sign him to a minor league contract , under which he could continue trying to work his way into playing condition arn tellem , jackson s new agent , has been talking to the white sox about a new contract hip injury is obstacle a hip injury suffered in his football career has made it difficult for jackson to run , thus limiting his play even as a designated hitter any of the other 25 clubs could claim jackson , but no one is very likely to do that , given his condition the white sox could have put jackson on unconditionalrelease waivers , but once he was released , they would n't be able to sign him until may 15 jackson s existing contract calls for a 910 , 000 salary this year plus 10 , 000 a game up to 150 games \( maximum 15 million \) that he is available to play he earned 1 , 010 , 000 last year after the white sox signed him as a free agent the kansas city royals released him during spring training last year , saying they thought his hip injury would not permit him to play the yankees , with first crack at him on the waiver list , reached the same conclusion and passed in 23 games with the white sox in the last month of last season , jackson batted 225 , hit 3 home runs and drove in 14 runs
tokyo , oct 1 for weeks now , japan has been consumed with yet another scandal , one that sounds eerily like the last three powerful politicians are caught taking millions of dollars from businessmen desperate to manipulate the country s political system , the public is outraged and the government offers vague promises to clean up a rampantly corrupt system but in critical ways , this scandal has been dramatically different rather than resign and sink out of view for a decent interval , the key players have all but brushed the latest scandal off this morning , only days after admitting to charges that he received 4 million in illegal contributions , japan s most powerful politician , shin kanemaru , emerged from his house for the first time in a month , declared that the issue was settled , and headed off to work and though the public has usually trusted japan s normally dogged prosecutors to pursue every illegality , it has widely criticized them this time for showing remarkable deference to mr kanemaru and then abruptly ending their investigation before reaching the most explosive issue , the ties between japan s political leaders and the country s mobsters overwhelmingly , japanese say the message being sent now is clear what makes this scandal different from the others is that this time no one really thinks anything will change once the protests die down most conspicuous , prime minister kiichi miyazawa has repeatedly refused to acknowledge the scandal publicly he grew visibly angry at japanese reporters today , stalking away when they brought it up rage and resignation people have given up , minoru morita , one of the country s leading political commentators said today there is a lot of rage , especially about the revelations that these politicians used gangsters to solve their problems for them but he went on to say that everyone knows that there is no real alternative to the governing party why the welleducated , wellheeled electorate of the world s secondlargest industrial democracy tolerates the neverending series of scandals is an enduring mystery , openly debated these days on nighttime political talk shows and in newspaper editorials the most common answer offered by the japanese themselves is that , corrupt or not , the liberal democratic party has presided over japan s phenomenal postwar economic expansion for 37 years , and that no one dares tinker with a system that works but at a time japan is deeply mired in a recession , that answer alone seems unsatisfactory in this scandal , many are beginning to suggest , the reaction is muted precisely because the investigation began to expose a side of japanese politics much darker than in scandals past money politics everyone has suspected that the party , businesses and the yakuza operated closely together , said an influential adviser to the liberal democratic party , using the japanese term for organizedcrime syndicates but when they thought about the implications of revealing it , everyone got scared even some opposition parties , he added even before this scandal , there was increasing evidence that the public was growing more cynical about the chances of cleaning up a system that revolved around what the japanese term money politics the complex political reform bills that the liberal democrats promised after prime minister noboru takeshita was forced to resign in 1989 , in an infuencepeddling scheme called the recruit scandal , have never gotten through parliament moreover , the major players in the scandal have all returned to center stage in political life , including mr takeshita and prime minister miyazawa japanese have a tendency to get excited easily and then forget easily , seiichi tagawa , a member of parliament who led 18 of his colleagues in a mass defection from the governing party after the lockheed scandal nearly two decades ago over the years , they all returned to the fold , except mr tagawa but a second reason for widespread doubts that anything will change arises from the failure of the opposition parties to capitalize on the scandals in the aftermath of mr takeshita s resignation , liberal democratic leaders were clearly scared of a move toward the socialist party , which scored major advances in an election a few months later since then the socialists have fallen into disarray , failing to persuade even the angriest voters that they were ready to govern indeed , the opposition parties have been remarkably quiet in the latest scandal , prompting speculation that many of them concluded they had much to lose from further revelations what is new this time are revelations that the liberal democratic party had become beholden to some of the country s most prominent organized crime figures mr kanemaru has been accused of asking the leader of a yakuza syndicate to silence rightwing protesters several times , including once to assure the election of mr takeshita as prime minister a rap on the knuckles the gobetween was supposedly the president of tokyo sagawa kyubin , a transport company in need of the governing party s support to get lucrative licenses to operate throughout japan soon afterward , the mobster involved in the deal was reportedly lent 2 billion the money was lost in the tokyo stock market plunge , an event that led to the unwinding of the tale though japanese commentators professed to be shocked by the evidence , prosecutors have apparently been less impressed they indicted the company president , hiroyasu watanabe , but they acceded to mr kanemaru s demand that he not be questioned about his role instead , mr kanemaru submitted a terse written statement and paid a 1 , 700 fine then the prosecutors announced that they were ending their investigation into a dozen other politicians none of them identified who reportedly received some of the money given to mr kanemaru there are no other facts to be investigated on suspicion of violation of the law , said the deputy chief prosecutor , takeo takahashi protesters reacted by throwing yellow paint over the entrance to the prosecutor s office the asahi shimbun , a leading daily , said the move left a stain in the prosecution s history in the sense that they allowed a man of power to bulldoze them legal experts say anyone else would have been forced to answer questions and probably to stand trial the most searing attack came from an unlikely source the chief prosecutor in sapporo , one of japan s largest cities though the japanese legal profession is usually loathe to criticize its own in public , the prosecutor published a long essay charging that the team handling the kanemaru case had committed a serious breach of duty the tradition of never yielding to power , and never being afraid of power has been passed on from generations of prosecutors , the official , michio sato , wrote today in the world of justice , there absolutely should not be the case of giving somebody special treatment 'nothing special to say' prime minister miyazawa brusquely rejected suggestions the other day that mr kanemaru s power and prestige had kept him out of jail the prosecutors are impartial , so i have nothing special to say , he told japanese reporters but koichi kato , the chief cabinet secretary and mr miyazawa s chief spokesman , has clearly been uneasy as reporters have pressed him to assess the morality , as well as the legality , of the charges at one point the other day , he conceded , while carefully treading around criticism of mr kanemaru , that japanese politicans might be wise to spend more time determining whether or not their associates are gangsters
for one listener , an all too rare encounter with the dresden staats kapelle last summer , in a choreographed version of the mozart requiem at the salzburg festival , carried a tinge of disappointment only because the music , grand as it was , did not fully exploit the splendid orchestra s resources the staats kapelle s program at carnegie hall on thursday evening quickly compensated , with a first half consisting of two lavishly orchestrated tone poems by richard strauss don juan and death and transfiguration and the ensemble responded with richly sonorous yet superbly refined performances under the itinerant american conductor andre previn this is a time of transition for the staatskapelle , which traces its ancestry back to 1548 the orchestra has been without a music director since hans vonk departed in 1988 giuseppe sinopoli takes over in the fall but more crucially , the staatskapelle , like many another eastern european institution , faces radically altered economic conditions in a competitive freemarket setting with continued governmental support , now from the state of saxony , the staatskapelle has been able to maintain the full range of its activities , its manager , eberhard steindorf , said at intermission indeed , opportunities for touring and recording have increased but the musicians earn only 50 to 60 percent of what their counterparts in western germany command so far , mr steindorf added , morale remains high , and no one has left for another orchestra , but some players undoubtedly will and the biggest difficulty , under such circumstances , is finding players of suitable stature to fill vacancies certainly no problems were evident in the performances here the staatskapelle can rival the finest american orchestras in unanimity of ensemble and hairtrigger rhythmic precision , but the orchestra s musicality extends far beyond sheer technique the characteristic rising octave in the sublime resolution of death and transfiguration seemed less a leap than a breath , an inhalation leading to the sigh that followed the staatskapelle s overall sound conveys a distinctive central european warmth and mellowness exposed wind solos were often remarkably strong , as in the trumpetlike tone of the principal oboist in the strauss , though not always ideally polished yet any individual shortcomings seemed to disappear in the burnished sonority of the whole none of this is to minimize mr previn s contribution each of his strauss conceptions caught the mood and sustained the drama admirably after a somewhat soporific opening movement in beethoven s seventh symphony following intermission , mr previn s tempos became livelier , although he never really challenged these expert players still , all the performances showed meticulous preparation indeed , one of the consistent joys of the evening was the care for dynamic distinctions and shadings , ranging from a fullbodied pianissimo to an openthroated fortissimo that never grew harsh in carnegie s unforgiving acoustics may the staatskapelle continue to thrive in difficult times
sofia , bulgaria , jan 15 the bulgarian government will investigate companies that it believes siphoned millions of dollars from state funds and spirited them abroad , a highranking bulgarian official says a committee under presidential control will be created , probably after a runoff on sunday in which president zhelyu zhelev faces velko valkanov , the candidate of the former communist party , now called the socialist party mr zhelev is expected to win the committee will be asked to investigate former bulgarian secret police officers , foreign trade companies and others thought to be involved in illegal financial activities the communistera bulgarian secret police was said to play a central role in such operations , as well as in illegal arms sales , drug trafficking and international terrorism many millions of dollars are now outside the country , out of control , said the highranking official , who spoke on condition of anonymity some bulgarian journalists have said that robert maxwell , the british press magnate who died in december , had financial interests in some of the bulgarian companies suspected of involvement in money laundering maxwell was only one of many businessmen , said grigor lilov , a journalist working for the newspaper 168 hours there are other names , who since 1985 have worked very closely with bulgarian state security mr lilov , 37 years old , worked for seven years for the bulgarian communist party paper , rabotnichesko delo in november 1989 he joined the staff of 168 hours , a popular paper that represents smallbusiness interests police ran 395 companies mr lilov , who said he began his investigation last february , estimated that altogether 395 companies spread from austria to singapore had been managed by the bulgarian secret police he said he had direct proof that former police officers led 58 of these none of mr lilov s allegations about mr maxwell s involvement have been confirmed by bulgarian officials and several telephone messages left in london for a lawyer for kevin maxwell , one of mr maxwell s sons , were not returned mr lilov said the connection with mr maxwell began with a 1987 secret document confirming approval by todor zhivkov , then the bulgarian communist leader , for business cooperation with mr maxwell it is not known , mr lilov said , how much mr maxwell knew about the companies' activities , since the agreements governing the joint ventures prevented him from exercising a vote evidence found in london a person in london , who insisted on anonymity , said one of the investigations into mr maxwell s empire now being conducted in britain had found evidence that mr maxwell , through one of the joint ventures , bimex , had obtained money from bulgaria but i do not know if the transaction was proper or improper , said this person , adding that the transaction had been a loan to one of mr maxwell s private companies of less than 5 million nor did he know if the british investigators had discovered any other transactions involving bulgarian funds or if they had been in contact with bulgarian officials president zhelev has said that he wants to clear bulgaria s international reputation , which was badly damaged by reports of secret police involvement in the killing of a bulgarian dissident , georgi markov , in london in 1978 and by allegations of an official bulgarian role in the attempted assassination of pope john paul ii in st peter s square in rome in 1981 the bulgarian government has begun investigations of complicity in international terrorism and has pledged to cooperate with western intelligence and humanrights agencies bulgarian officials have said they are convinced that there was direct bulgarian involvement in the markov killing , but they doubt that a bulgarian connection existed in the attempt on the pope s life pattern of phantom companies the government started to investigate the financial activities of the secret police last summer one official , who requested anonymity , said the investigations were difficult because private banks were unlikely to provide information about their clients' accounts in some cases , regarding the financial questions , we have some information that highranking officials from other foreign countries were involved , the official said yordan vassilev , chairman of parliament s national security committee , described a pattern by which phantom companies would be set up through a partnership between an official of a bulgarian state enterprise , a secret police officer and a westerner the three would establish a company in a country where there were weak financial controls the company would then apply for loans to establish another enterprise far away he offered this hypothetical example i 've got a permit from the bulgarian foreign trade bank , which knows about me , and i use that to get a loan from a western bank to build my enterprise , and i buy a piece of land say , in gabon only i never build a factory , and six months later i sell the land to some other crook , and in five years' time the only real thing that exists from the deal is a loan being demanded by a western bank from the foreign trade bank because i disappeared long ago
barcelona , spain , aug 1 halfway through these olympic games , there are more hairy issues and bald heads than multimedal heroes matters are unlikely to change this week in barcelona , where drugs , commercialism and poor sportsmanship have found a comfortable roost on the medal stand too often , the snapshots of grace and heartfelt accomplishment have been tainted by careless accusations , bullying , greed and provincial haggling in all likelihood , the late avery brundage , puritanical head of the international olympic committee , had none of this in mind he certainly could not have visualized charles barkley , the steamrolling forward on the united states basketball team , whose olympic motto was formed very early on when he said , why do n't they just take their buttwhipping like people and go home \? already , three british athletes a sprinter and two weight lifters were sent home for positive drug tests two weeks before the games the sprinter , jason livingstone , was a great fan of ben johnson , the symbol of olympic disgrace a german swimmer , dagmar hase , had a tantrum when she was awarded a gold medal by an old nemesis , the head of doping control for her country the official , harm beyer , later resigned under pressure , with a passionate poolside speech 'i have been insulted' i have been insulted , said beyer , who had been accused by hase of discriminating against former east german athletes in favor of the west germans i am leaving before it gets worse the united states , as usual , led the standing in controversy in a scant seven days , the americans managed to offend just about everybody inside and outside the olympic village the telegenic dream team alternately charmed and insulted the curious michael jordan , a nike spokesman , flew through the air , but threatened to stay earthbound if forced to mount the medal stand in a reebok uniform barkley shoved an angolan , then quipped , how did i know he did n't have a spear \? members of the women s swimming team , inclined to throw their bronze medals back into the pool , could not stop talking about the size and allegedly suspicious success of the chinese team , hinting that the chinese were using performanceenhancing drugs jenny thompson , worldrecord holder , unraveled in the individual sprints and blamed the drugtesting procedures fina , swimming s governing body , changed its testing policy midway through the competition , under pressure from the united states conveniently overlooking their own recent history with the drug suspension of angel martino , the americans demeaned the accomplishments of swimmers like zhuang yong , lin li , and yang wenyi bob samuelson of the united states volleyball team questioned a call too loudly , for too long he was shown a second yellow card that would eventually cost the americans a victory against japan , after an appeal to the international volleyball federation samuelson s teammates , a rowdy bunch , shaved their heads like samuelson to prove their persecution complex the head of the united states olympic delegation , leroy t walker , filed a protest of his own asking for reconsideration it failed , but pleased the team anyway it has a lot of purpose , said rich wanninger , team spokesman for the volleyball team , who also shaved his head to show we 're not just here to be kicked around a boxer , eric griffin , was upset in the 106pound division , and united states officials today filed a protest about the scoring the soccer team imploded earlier , as coach lothar osiander benched his goalagame scorer , steve snow , against italy if snow had scored a goal against italy in the first game \( a 21 loss \) , the americans would still be playing soccer in the quarterfinals , and osiander could stop complaining about the lack of talent in the united states there were inspiring moments to remember from the first week , as the focus of competition moved from swimming and gymnastics to boxing and track and field kristina egerszegi , a graceful and gracious swimmer from hungary , won three individual gold medals and established herself as one of the greatest backstrokers in history tatyana gutsu of the unified team , a substitute for an injured teammate , beat shannon miller of the united states to take the overall women s gymnastics title and become the reigning pixie among the victims was kim zmeskal , whose 10thplace finish was a bitter disappointment budding stars emerge budding stars had their comingout parties fu ming xia , a 13yearold chinese , won the women s platform diving , the secondyoungest individual gold medal winner ever she was so acrobatic , rival coaches complained that diving would never be the same franziska van almsick , the lanky , powerful 14yearold swimmer , stroked to two silvers and two bronzes she is one of the last vestiges of the old east german system the midway medal count has produced a few surprises china , building an efficient sports system , is surpassing germany , which is restructuring its own the united states was bolstered by 27 swimming medals , 11 of them gold as track and field began on friday , there was reason to hope that a new competition would clear the air a bit instead , the three top finishers in the shotput mike stulce and james doehring of the united states and vyacheslav lykho of the unified team became the first medalwinning triumvirate in history to share a history of past drug suspensions with that sort of a sendoff , the second half of the olympics could live down to the first

six months after taking the reins of salomon inc , warren e buffett and his lieutenants yesterday portrayed a firm that had lost a tremendous amount of business and , after a toptobottom renovation , was now primed to claw much of it back more focused , more profitable , and more cohesive , said deryck c maughan , the chief operating officer and mr buffett s heir apparent , describing how a sleeker and betterorganized salomon would emerge from a government inquiry into the firm s role in a treasury market scandal last year inquiry s end is near speaking to institutional investors and analysts , the salomon executives said the investigation of the firm s bidding violations was nearing the end , and would be resolved within months we cannot predict what the resolution will be or what penalities will be imposed , said robert e denham , salomon s chief legal counsel we cannot rule out the possibility of criminal charges fortyfour lawsuits have been filed against salomon by shareholders , investors and treasury bond buyers , mr denham said , and have been consolidated into three legal actions related to the firm s bidding violations as part of the revamping of salomon s business , mr buffett confirmed , salomon had scaled back speculative trades involving large amounts of the firm s money , which were once a big source of salomon s annual profits there s less enthusiasm for that , he said salomon reduced its balance sheet by 37 billion in 1991 , mr maughan said , at the same time that its business of selling new stock issues missed out on wall street s 1991 boom we were on the bench , mr maughan said boards of directors do feel reluctant to reward salomon with a lead manager position on such sales salomon last week reported a 29 million loss for the quarter that ended on dec 31 but mr maughan said salomon had resumed selling commercial paper and mediumterm notes , which were suspended after the scandal arose in august he also pointed out that salomon s underwriting business has improved since jan 1 buffett is staying a while mr buffett said he would remain interim chairman of salomon brothers inc , the firm s securities arm , until the legal questions surrounding the scandal were answered he is expected to cede the position to mr maughan but remain chairman of salomon inc , the holding company salomon paid its employees 12 percent of their total compensation in stock last year , mr maughan said the firm s highestpaid employees received 50 percent of their compensation in stock , mr buffett added no stock options were awarded last year , and none are planned for this year , mr buffett said salomon employees now own about 125 million shares , or about 11 percent of the total outstanding , mr maughan said , adding that he supported the idea of an eventual 30 percent ownership by employees higher ratings expected mr buffett said he expected the firm s credit ratings to be restored once the federal regulators the securities and exchange commission , the united states attorney s office and the federal reserve reached a decision regarding the treasury violations i think our credit will be viewed as better than it was before the scandal , mr buffett said the capital level is not in question credit agencies lowered their ratings on salomon s debt after the firm admitted to the bidding violations moody s investors service inc lowered its rating on salomon s senior debt to a3 , from a2 , in august the next month , the standard poor s corporation lowered its rating on sal omon s senior debt to a , from a mr maughan stressed the importance of restoring salomon s position as a primary dealer in the bond markets , even if shifting regulations altered the role of such dealers the government market is the hub at the center of the wheel , he said the wheel is not going to work as well if there is n't a hub no total pullout seen mr maughan insisted that despite its scaling back in some areas , salomon would not abandon some whole areas of its business , as some speculated last year it s inconceivable that we would get out of investment banking , or shrink to domestic markets , he said mr buffett , for his part , again described the scandal as the work of a few individuals in a business that does have some risk , mr buffett said , we 've seen how much a firm can be put at risk by one or two rogue elephants
the season of the darkened marquee is suddenly becoming the season of the booking bonanza in the next three months , 22 shows nearly as many as opened in the entire 199091 season will open on broadway , and producers have been eagerly seeking theaters to accommodate this burst of activity the spring lineup is also unusual in that it will bring to broadway the largest contingent of hollywood stars to act on the new york stage in years producers are counting on marquee names to attract investors and , they fervently hope , audiences to salvage a broadway season that , until now , has been deeply disappointing to producers and plagued by a severe postholiday audience slump that has been worsening by the week at the same time , off broadway theaters are cutting back on productions and other programs , a new study has found page c11 the incoming shows are a huge number when you realize that there were 28 shows during the entire 199091 season , said george wachtel , director of research for the league of american theaters and producers so far this season , 15 new productions have opened the roster includes new plays by august wilson , lanford wilson , neil simon and john guare revivals of three classic american musicals , guys and dolls , the most happy fella and man of la mancha , and a london hit produced by cameron mackintosh , five guys named moe but there will be none of the extravagantly produced new musical spectacles that have been a staple of broadway in the last decade , possibly reflecting the declining public taste for such shows , and certainly demonstrating the difficulty of raising the huge investments they require but the heavy pace of activity on broadway does not reflect a complete turnaround for the commercial theater seven new shows are sponsored , in full or in part , by nonprofit , institutional theaters like the lincoln center theater or the manhattan theater club , which are renting broadway theaters to accommodate their expanding activities while these presentations will be eligible for tony awards , they do not spring from the creative efforts of commercial producers , and their revenues will not primarily enrich investors so glum has been the broadway picture this season that even when all the new shows now planned open , a handful of theaters will remain dark unless other producers suddenly rush in with lastminute productions so many stars , so little space nevertheless , few seasons on broadway have been greeted with as much anticipation as this spring if this derives partly from the contrast with the dismal state of the season so far , the enthusiasm is also linked to the tinseltown factor it has been a long time since so many names with hollywood sheen have planned to illuminate the great white way the stars coming soon to broadway include alan alda , alec baldwin , ellen burstyn , glenn close , joan collins , richard dreyfuss , gene hackman , gregory hines , judd hirsch , raul julia , jessica lange and al pacino the fact that so many stars are available may be in part a consequence of the recession cutbacks in hollywood salaries and production schedules have made it impossible for many west coast names to find quality vehicles at their prices , according to several producers who spoke on condition of anonymity a limited run on broadway , with the prospect of an award or two , may be a careerenhancing way to ride out the recession so tight is the crush of new bookings that many of the new shows had difficulty finding their tentative theater homes some producers are actively rooting for the speedy demise of planned or current shows so that more desirable theaters will be freed for new productions the traditional postholiday decline in audiences and ticket sales seems to have been worsened by a recessionplagued winter , and more and more broadway shows have empty seats a week ago , only two shows , the phantom of the opera and miss saigon , were complete or nearcomplete sellouts , and sales were generally so low that even solid hits like dancing at lughnasa and the will rogers follies had seats available two shows , park your car in harvard yard and two shakespearean actors , say in their advertising that they are in their final weeks right now there are more empty theaters than at any time i can remember , and the recession has definitely affected our industry , said roger berlind , a producer not only do theatergoers have less money to spend on entertainment , he said , but investors have been more reluctant to risk capital in a time when everything is marked down , and their house or their art is worth less than they thought although the recession has not dried up venture capital on broadway the spring lineup is evidence that substantial investment money is available angels are clearly more cautious not only are they not putting money in megamusicals , but the emphasis now is also on straight plays , which account for 13 of the new productions and cost considerably less to produce than musicals among the nine musicals scheduled to open soon , most are revivals of proven hits rather than riskier original works
hallandale , fla , oct 31 on a clamorous day at the races when paseana won , sky classic lost and arazi practically disappeared , the 3yearold colt ap indy outran a field of international stars and won the breeders' cup classic by two lengths over pleasant tap and probably also won the race for horse of the year ap indy , the regally bred son of seattle slew and grandson of secretariat , ran the mile and a quarter at gulfstream park in a snappy 2 001 5 as he won the 3 million classic , the richest race in the world and he provided the dramatic high on america s premier day of racing , a day in which the largest and best contingent of horses from europe to ever compete in the cup won none of the seven races it was the dramatic high because ap indy had been stalking pleasant tap in the bid for the sport s ultimate honor horse of the year today , they ended up two lengths apart after racing a mile and a quarter with the title on the line horse of the year \? asked chris speckert , who trains pleasant tap i believe my horse is as good as ap indy it s got to be close we deserve to still be in the hunt my horse is the best 3yearold in the country , said neil drysdale , who trains ap indy and he s in serious contention for horse of the year this was the ninth time the best horses had gathered from north and south america and europe had competed in the breeders' cup for world renown and 10 million in prize money it was also the day arazi returned to racing in the united states from his domain in france his return came just one year after he won the breeders' cup juvenile by five lengths and six months after he just as stunningly ran eighth in the kentucky derby but this time , backed heavily by the crowd as the 32 favorite in the mile , he delivered no dramatic kick , scored no coup and ran 11th in a field of 14 worldclass milers while he was laboring , the claiborne farm s lure not only ran the race of his life but also broke the track record by zipping the mile in 1 324 5 , which was more than one second faster than step forward ran it on march 13 , 1976 this also was a day that began with anguish , and memories of the bitter breeders' cup at belmont park two years ago when the prize filly go for wand and two other star horses did not survive their races this time , the gasps from the crowd came during the very first race on the cup program , the sprint the 14 horses were entering the turn for home when the 5yearold british sprinter mr brooks suffered a stress fracture of the right foreleg , collapsed along the rail and pitched his jockey , lester piggott , the 56yearold folk hero of european racing the stricken horse then rolled across piggott and trapped him until onlookers from a nearby clockers' stand pulled the jockey free piggott suffered a fractured collarbone , at least one broken rib and some spleen and lung damage , but was reported in stable condition later at hollywood memorial hospital the horse was humanely destroyed by injection the accident cast a pall over the crowd , but the ominous tone was softened somewhat by a series of stunning performances the 2yearold filly eliza won the breeders' cup juvenile fillies with a dramatic burst of late speed the argentine mare paseana made a sizzling comeback from two straight losses and won the distaff by four lengths over versailles treaty and gilded time won the juvenile and , with a perfect record in four starts , probably became the early choice for next year s kentucky derby redemption \? not this time then it was time for arazi to take center stage the 3yearold colt , bred in kentucky but raced chiefly in france the last two seasons , marched to the post on a mission redemption he was back to settle a score , flanked by his owners , allen e paulson and sheikh mohammed bin rashid almaktoum of dubai , and his trainer , francois boutin how could they have known that a virtuoso performance was about to be given by lure , a 3yearold colt who is a son of danzig and a grandson of alydar \? but lure shot into the lead , and did n't look back he led by two lengths most of the way and by three at the wire paradise creek , a 301 shot , was second by a neck over brief truce then came val des bois from france , and selkirk from england and nine lengths back in 11th place , struggling to escape traffic on the inside arazi i wo n't take anything away from arazi , said pat valenzuela , who also rode the colt in his other american adventures it was a very fast time he sat behind the leaders and just could n't finish with them shug mcgaughey , who trains lure , said the difference for his colt was grass i 'd never put him on grass until we got to saratoga , and that turned him around we had a lot of disappointments before in the main event , the classic , the early lead was set by new york s thunder rumble but he lost it after a mile , and then ap indy came flying from fourth place to first in the same late dash that won the santa anita derby and belmont stakes he had two lengths on pleasant tap , who had half a length on jolypha , and some celebrated horses finished farther back sultry song was fifth , thunder rumble was seventh , strike the gold was eighth and rodrigo de triano 14th and last , and a symbol of a lost day at the races for europe s best pat kelly , who trains sultry song , another candidate for horse of the year , said heavy traffic was the problem , and added there was a lot going on in there photos ap indy , ridden by eddie delahoussaye , heading for the finish line to win the breeders' cup classic by two lengths yesterday \( associated press \) ap indy \( 4 \) , with jockey eddie delahoussaye , making his move in the stretch before winning the breeders' cup classic yesterday \( associated press \) \( pg 10 \)
the western european governments at the united nations meetings on the environment this month are not just talking about the greenhouse effect , they are on the verge of doing something about it the catch , argue alan manne of stanford university and richard richels of the energy power research insitute , the research arm of the electric power industry , is that part of what they are planning to do is likely to be selfdefeating that is not to say the plan , which could be put into effect as early as 1993 , is necessarily foolish there may be no better alternative for attracting a winning coalition of countries and interest groups within the european community but it does make plain there is more to coping with global greenhouse emissions than identifying leastcost abatement strategy and getting on with the job while washington is still dithering about what to to and when , the pressure for a greenhouse fix in northern europe notably scandinavia , the netherlands and germany has become overwhelming in december the european community s energy and environment commissioners tentatively adopted a plan to tax energy in general , and nonrenewable carbon fuels in particular the plan would phase in a tax on the carbon content of coal , lignite , natural gas and oil equivalent to 5 a barrel by the year 2000 there would also be a parallel tax of the same magnitude on all energy consumption if something rings false here , you have a good ear carbon taxes make sense as an incentive because carbon dioxide emissions are the primary culprit in global warming but why would taxing nuclear or hydropower help contain the greenhouse effect \? no reason at all indeed , mr manne and mr richel , who pioneered the use of computer models to simulate the economic consequences of antiwarming policies , argue that the general energy tax would have a perverse effect , adding cost while actually reducing the net impact taxing carbon emissions , they note , induces both energy conservation and fuel switching but taxing energy consumption as well reduces the incentive to move from the most carbonintensive fuels \( coal and lignite \) to natural gas or carbonfree nuclear fuel thus the european plan gets far less greenhouse bang for a buck than a carbon tax alone the number of bucks at risk is nothing to sneeze about higher energy taxes can be expected to reduce economic growth because they encourage investment in energysaving equipment that might otherwise have gone into productive capacity the economists estimate that the combination tax would reduce europe s gross domestic product by 20 billion in the year 2000 why , then , make the inherently costly solution to greenhouse warming even costlier \? one reason is that european countries vary in both their production and dependence on highcarbon fuels taxing energy as well as carbon would reduce the differential economic impact and perhaps check national divisions over greenhouse policy another is that a tax on carbon alone might put the bloom back in the cheeks of the nuclear industry a consequence that would undermine the green coalition that is antinuke as well as antigreenhouse the easiest political sell within europe may not be the easiest in the other great carbonemitting continent , north america the united states uses more energy per dollar of output than europe thus , it should not be surprising that the mannerichels simulation shows that a broadbased energy tax would be even more expensive in america than in europe and while the broad tax might serve the parallel function of blurring the impact on regions and industries , the fact that europe would end up with an overall economic advantage would surely depreciate its political currency in the united states all this suggests that the political perils in attempting a single global antiwarming strategy exceed the benefits it probably makes more sense to negotiate national commitments to emissions targets an x percent reduction in y years and to leave it to individual countries to choose the means to the agreed end negotiated emissions limits would also open the door to an approach that many economists believe would sharply reduce the total cost of taming global warming international emissions trading europe might , for example , find it cheaper to pay the soviet union to shut down coalfired power plants than to save an equivalent amount of carbon emissions by , say , investing in more fuelefficient cars or america might forgive brazilian debt in return for a commitment to stop the deforestation of the amazon none of this , of course , addresses the murky scientific and economic issues of how much global warming is too much but the world well , parts of the world are in no mood to wait for clearer answers drawing
aladdin city , fla , sept 18 the answer to the big question , says julio c perla , is yes there are a lot of monkeys out there , he says but none of them are ours mr perla is curator of the monkey jungle which , along with parrot jungle , coral castle and several other south florida tourist attractions , was battered by hurricane andrew and is struggling to clean up and reopen since the storm , rumors have spread through the area that monkeys escaped from the attraction and have been roaming through the rural streets up to no good , of course every once in a while , someone will come by with a baboon or a monkey that they had captured , said mr perla , a man gentle in the way of many people who work with animals but he said they all belonged to commercial breeders who sell the animals to laboratories and other users our monkeys do n't know what it means to escape , he said , because you ca n't escape from freedom many of the 400 monkeys , apes and simians are never caged but because they are territorial they tend to remain where they know they can find food a pack of 90 gray java macaques , longtailed monkeys less than two feet tall , have roamed through the seven acres of cypress gumbo limbo trees for 60 years while the creatures with the funny shapes and weird hats , known as tourists , were kept in caged walks before the hurricane , most of the animals were brought to concrete shelters but some refused to go , and the keepers simply had to open the gates and hope the animals , many of them born on the grounds , still had the instincts to care for themselves the jungle was essentially destroyed many of the old cypresses blew down , taking walkways , cages and a part of the stage area for animal shows with them most of the animals have been accounted for , but among the missing is gypsy , an old female macaque with a cantaloupe personality rough on the outside , sweet where it counts she is the reason why every time i get a report that somebody has seen a monkey out there , i shoot out to see if maybe it s her , mr perla said volunteers from zoos around the country have worked with local volunteers to clean up the debris mr perla said he hoped that the attraction would reopen by nov 15 and he hoped gypsy would be there the parrot jungle and garden in miami reopened last saturday but p j , a brightly colored macaw and usually a star of the performing bird show , seems to have come up with a bad case of stage fright by all accounts , p j is a smart one , as macaws go , and normally would have no trouble with a problem like 9 minus 3 that the host , dan lewis , gave him during a recent show but when he waddled over to a small bell and handle , which he pulled with his beak , p j rang the bell seven times the 45 people in the parrot bowl , many of them foreign tourists , laughed p j tried again and rang four bells this time with the sound of chain saws clearing paths nearby , mr lewis uneasily asked p j to try one more time he correctly rang six bells , but then got the next trick wrong leading mr lewis to tell him , p j , you need a bit more study but it is n't really p j s fault , mr lewis said all the performing birds have been a little stressed out since the storm so many trees at parrot jungle blew over that the whole park is much lighter , and much hotter , than before , and big birds like p j just do n't like change patrick j callan , general manager of the 56yearold attraction , said all 1 , 200 birds and animals survived the storm , even the 57 pink flamingos who remained outside in a pond , submerged up to

president bush lands in tokyo with 21 top american business executives and a full cargo of economic evasion , selfdelusion , bombast and prefabricated agreements that cleverly avoid the realities of the problems between the united states and japan but that s all right it will be fair trade at its best the japanese will meet him with their own complete product line of economic hypocrisy , including that new and fastgrowing specialty , contempt lightly camouflaged as compassion so the mission will leave the united states and japan in exactly their present positions the japanese using their skills , social strengths , history and every trick in the trade to remain powerful and growing , the americans wasting their own rich talents and national heritage , looking up now and then for a good cry the reason for the failure will be that neither the us nor japan talk candidly to each other or to their own people about the core reasons for the problems and what can be done to solve them and , just as important , both sides do not acknowledge that not everything can be solved some problems between them are deep in national social contracts that neither intends to change so we might as well get on with the struggle where there is no way out experience , i keep learning , does not necessarily mean wisdom , but i did wind up my tour as a foreign correspondent in japan knowing one thing about the japanese mystery there was none the country , like every other , is scrutable , on its own terms japan is a social , political and economic whole a cartel if you do n't like it , a cooperative community if you do the japanese have shown that within that sense of community they can argue , adapt and change but government , business , politicians , the bureaucracy and the unions regard themselves as members of a national economics team , not adversaries the idea that they are opponents to be separated by antitrust laws or conflict of interest concepts a basis of american society is to them foreign and foolish every day businessmen and government officials cooperate with each other americans would call it conspire and against the outside world in ways that in the us would put them all in jail the contract is for loyalty up , loyalty down japanese unions have a way of staging work stoppages during lunch breaks but their members know they will not wake up one morning to find out that 70 , 000 of them have been fired before that would happen , executives would resign , other companies would pitch in and the banks would come through with loans , on government orders the japanese are simply not going to change that system it has made them one of the most prosperous countries on earth and , thanks to the us , all accomplished peacefully under parliamentary democracy americans would not like to be japanese the japanese system does promote conformity , obsequiousness , rigidity it suits neither american law nor american tradition and let s never forget that it has been american history , law and culture that inspired the world and still does hardly the japanese but once our politicians recognize the differences between the countries instead of pretending there are really none , the us can face reality one essential is to examine our own laws and traditions , to see if some should be changed to permit more of the industry cooperation , combined research , shared capital investment and encouragement of savings that have helped japan we do n't have to become japanese neither do we have to remain ostriches second step in those defined cases where the us , calmly and patiently , decides that the japanese system is being used deliberately against us we should calmly and patiently sock it to them an american president should have the courage to say all that then he has to go one hard step further and say that what the whole world says about us is true we spend too much , invest too little , allow our schools to be dominated by the limits of dullards he should tell us that if we do not change we will wind up really deserving what the japanese now just pretend to have for us compassion and how would we like that \? then he can accomplish something in tokyo , not before

in candide , voltaire defined optimism as a mania for maintaining that all is well when things are going badly in other words , the novel could be considered instructive advice for contemporary politicians campaigning for reelection and for theater companies embarking on a stage version of the 18thcentury classic candide is an imperishable work of philosophy and satire , one that reached its theatrical peak in the leonard bernstein musical ten years ago , the playwright len jenkin wrote a new adaptation , which was presented at the guthrie theater in minneapolis now , for her parting production as artistic director of the csc theater , carey perloff is offering the new york premiere of the jenkin version the production is codirected by ms perloff and her csc successor , david esbjornson while one must give the show points for ambition , it does not have the inventiveness that can make it seem anything more than highminded the play starts on an intriguing note a large puppet head of voltaire , designed by hugh landwehr , dominates the open stage emanating from it are voices in french delivering a babel of voltaire in the course of the play , the head is used for a variety of settings , but it eventually limits the movement of the actors , entrapping the play in the scenery at the same time , mr jenkin s device of treating the novel in story theater style is selfdepleting a narrator explains what another character is about to do before he does it , or , in several instances , before he repeats the narration during one of candide s adventures , someone else comments enthusiastically that it is a splendid sight but we are shown nothing except for people staring at a brightening light all this encourages the nondramatic side of the narrative after writing this less than imaginative adaptation , mr jenkin went on to far more dramatic explorations in his original plays except for occasional annoying anachronisms \( knockknock jokes , of all things \) , the text follows the general outline of the original voltaire the scene moves from bulgaria to eldorado and other far corners of a real and mythical world while never seeming to change its course the principal alteration is one of speech , as the actors awkwardly affect different nationalities and accents the directors employ a cast of motley talents , none of them able to lift the material to voltairean heights in the title role , victor mack has the necessary ingenuousness but little comic flair edward hibbert s fussily academic pangloss is not chimerical in his changed appearances among the principals , only julia gibson as cunegonde has a sprightly assertiveness she , along with the others , is victimized by the lack of fluidity in the conception the minor players , overworked in role doubling , often seem at sea off the coast of one of the countries visited by candide although it is always a pleasure to hear voltaire s wit , albeit with a jenkin twist , the play moves with painstaking slowness through the story , chapter by chapter , for nearly three hours david lang s sparse musical underscoring only makes one long for the bernstein songs a chorus of glitter and be gay or auto da fe would considerably improve the voyage candide by len jenkin , adapted from the book by voltaire directed by david esbjornson and carey perloff scenic design , hugh landwehr costumes , teresa sniderstein lighting , brian macdevitt composer , david lang sound , john kilgore 3d production stage manager , crystal huntington assistant director , david hoffmann movement director , lesley farlow presented by ms perloff and patricia taylor at csc theater , 136 east 13th street , manhattan candide victor mack pangloss pococurante edward hibbert cunegonde king of eldorado julia gibson martin kent gash baron sr cacambo dennis reid baron jr vanderdendur michael gaston baroness old woman rebecca schull paquette clairon kimberley pistone 18thcentury gentleman don fernando 18thcentury gentleman jacques friar giroflee ragotsky william keeler photo rebecca schull , left , victor mack and julia gibson \( gerry goodstein \)
paul broten s usefulness had never been questioned by the rangers this season crafty , careful , and dedicated to transforming himself into a small thorn in every opponent s side , he had always been an asset , albeit not a flamboyant goalscorer that s why broten was the first to laugh at the prospect of being allowed to zoom in unimpeded on mike vernon and take a penalty shot with 13 seconds left to play in the second period last night at madison square garden you try to score on every chance you get , which for a player like me is n't very many chances , said broten , who describes new york as a tough place to play you have to play good or they make changes but when broten , who had just seven goals in 41 previous games , was done zooming , zigging and zagging , vernon was n't chuckling and the rangers held a 42 lead they ultimately held on for a 64 victory , their leagueleading 30th of the season , and all that scoring hilarity proved too much for vernon the veteran goaltender was removed in the final period after adam graves , the sixth ranger to connect for a goal , made it 62 a plethora of pointers but only broten received an earful of pointers from his entire team before taking his shot he came down the line and everybody gave him a piece of advice , said coach roger neilson , who kept his own contribution to broten s scoring scheme very brief just score , was all that neilson said , and that s what his player did broten earned his penalty shot , the 15th in the nhl this season but only the 7th to find its way into the net , after being yanked down by gary suter on a breakaway attempt he made it count by closing in on vernon and swiveling his body to and fro like a windshield wiper before he gleefully tucked the puck behind the goalie s outstretched left leg i worked on a move , made my move , and it worked , said broten the rangers , who never trailed in the game , received their scoring from sources ranging from the unexpected , like broten , to the pleasantly surprising , like sergei nemchinov , who made it 52 with his 22d goal of the season , to the consummately reliable , like mike gartner gartner , who received a pair of silver sticks before the game to commemorate his accumulation this season of his 500th career goal and 1 , 000th career point , returned to more traditional tools once the game began he used his everyday wooden stick to launch the slick shot that set up darren turcotte for the first goal of the game turcotte , who had just returned from a twogame absence attributed to sore ribs , scored his 15th of the season by netting gartner s rebound during a power play at 6 minutes 11 seconds of the first period just 23 seconds later , randy gilhen took aim from the right boards and slammed a lateral shot between the right post and vernon s wavering glove to give the rangers a 20 lead rob zamuner , appearing in his first nhl game , and tie domi provided the assists the rangers pelted vernon with a seasonhigh 19 shots in the opening period , as they flexed their power play four times and allotted none to their guests but robert reichel prevented the flames from being shut off the scoreboard by beating mike richter at 16 49 gartner gave the rangers a 31 lead early in the second period as he scored his 27th goal of the season by swerving around sergei makarov to direct jeff beukeboom s rebound into the net at 4 29 but makarov exacted his revenge with a blast from the slot at 5 31 the flames were a far more aggressive adversary in the second period , and it was with the greatest difficulty that the rangers nursed their 32 lead along until the closing seconds , when broten s penalty shot made things much more comfortable slap shots the game was the last time the rangers will wear white shirts at home this season following the allstar game break , they 'll wear their blue road jerseys here in observation of yet another of the league s strange directives to all its teams as it celebrates its 75th anniversary joe kocur , who received a sore hand along with the seasonhigh 17 penalty minutes he collected during fisticuffs against buffalo tuesday , did not play doug weight s broken right finger has been fitted with a splint , jan erixon remained out with sore ribs and mark hardy s shoulder separation will keep him sidelined three to five more weeks photo flames' goalie michael vernon blocking a shot by rangers' mike gartner last night as flames' trent yawney defended \( barton silverman the new york times \)
john sparco won a bitter victory last year in his medical malpractice case he had sued two doctors who , he said , botched his brain surgery in september , eight years after he filed suit , the doctors agreed to settle the case but there was one condition their names would have to be kept secret only their hospital , johns hopkins university hospital in baltimore , would be mentioned in the public record the settlement was thus kept secret from the public and from a newly formed national list of doctors who had lost or settled malpractice suits , a list intended to inform hospitals and state licensing boards about questionable doctors 'a slap in the face' when mr sparco learned of the secrecy condition , he was outraged it was a slap in the face , he said but he was deeply in debt from pursuing the case and had been unable to work since the surgery although he wanted to see justice done and the doctors' names made public , he felt he had no choice but to agree to the order cases like mr sparco s have proliferated in recent years files are routinely sealed , for example , in product liability suits , medical malpractice suits and suits involving toxic chemicals released into the environment these secrecy orders have a significant bearing on agencies like the food and drug administration , which are denied pertinent information about the safety of products they regulate in the case of silicone breast implants , trial lawyers first saw the documents that cast doubt on the implants' safety some eight years before the drug agency did the agency ordered a moratorium on the implants immediately after reading the documents another recent case involved some side effects of the sleeping drug halcion but in that case , the company agreed to let the drug agency see the documents in question trial lawyers defend the use of secrecy orders , saying that the system is working well and that judges always have the option to refuse orders that can harm the public they maintain that such orders are necessary to protect trade secrets and keep unproved accusations of wrongdoing by doctors or corporations out of the public eye robert d monnin , a cleveland trial lawyer who is president of the defense research institute , which represents 18 , 000 trial lawyers , said the debate over protective orders is an emotional issue right now but he added , the system works just fine mr monnin said a principal benefit of secrecy orders is that they induce parties to settle and reduce litigation in addition , he said , the orders protect companies from unreasonable disclosure of proprietary data a lot of things in lawsuits start out as allegations , mr monnin said suppose somebody gets in an everyday auto accident and gets a broken arm then they come in and sue the manufacturer of the car , saying , 'give me all the documents you have since you have been making cars' you may think that s farfetched , but we get requests like that with a protective order , he added , the car maker can agree to provide some documents in return for secrecy , and then settle the case quickly the question is , 'is a protective order supposed to serve the public or is it supposed to serve the parties \? ' mr monnin asked the answer , he said , is that it is supposed to serve the disputing parties but opponents of secrecy orders vehemently disagree they are an absolutely horrible problem , said arthur bryant , executive director of trial lawyers for public justice what these companies want to keep secret is exactly what the public needs to know mr bryant said companies can use the orders to keep damaging documents away from the eyes of state and federal regulators , for example with the help of secrecy orders , every lawyer whose client wants to sue a company has to start from scratch in finding out what documents the company has this makes product liability suits much costlier for the litigants mr bryant contended that the companies often say i will give you what you want if you agree to keep it secret if not , i will fight you tooth and nail and i will still argue for secrecy faced with such a choice , mr bryant said , a plaintiff will often sign on the dotted line and take the documents 'a systematic coverup' george annas , a lawyer who directs the program on law , medicine and ethics at boston university , said secrecy orders had become a serious problem in the medical profession when doctors settle malpractice suits , he said , they routinely move to have the cases sealed there is a systematic coverup , and that s bad for the public , mr annas said even though nobody would say they are doing this to hurt the public , that s the effect legislators in some states are becoming so concerned by what they perceive as the abuse of secrecy orders that they are passing laws to restrict this wellestablished legal tool florida , new york and texas recently passed laws that greatly restrict secrecy orders , and on jan 30 the california senate passed a bill that would create similar restrictions in that state in addition , a washington public interest group , trial lawyers for public justice , has embarked on a national project to petition courts to lift secrecy orders in cases where they believe the orders hurt the public

toronto , july 31 if being unable to acquire jim abbott from the california angels was not disturbing enough for the yankees tonight , they also had to place danny tartabull on the 15day disabled list then they had to try competing with the firstplace blue jays and their anemic effort probably bothered manager buck showalter more than the two off the field setbacks sure , the yankees could use a superb pitcher like abbott and a power hitter like tartabull , but they looked like a raggedy bunch that needed much more than one strong arm and one strong bat tonight against toronto tighter defense , any semblance of offense and pitching , any decent pitching , might have prevented the blue jays from coasting so smoothly to a 132 victory at the skydome but the yankees received none of the above ugly , ugly , ugly instead of receiving anything , the yankees gave tonight they helped give the blue jays a miserable fourrun inning with two infield misplays they helped toronto smile on its way to two home runs , two basesloaded walks and 13 hits by choosing shawn hillegas to start and following that with tim leary and greg cadaret their lethargic effort helped toronto ease to its seventh straight victory over the yankees it was good to see us tie it up 11 after giving up a cheap run , said showalter , after his club lost its fifth in six games it got pretty ugly after that so ugly that leary , who was bounced from the starting rotation a month ago and almost released recently , pitched for the first time in 25 days it was the baseball version of garbage time , and leary obliged by yielding a 419foot tworun homer to joe carter , the third batter he faced leary was hammered for five hits and six runs in two innings as the blue jays padded their lead to 121 why leary \? he s the long guy and that is his role , showalter said so ugly that hillegas lasted three innings and was pounded for four earned runs and six hits hillegas has now surrendered 11 earned runs in his last eight innings , and showalter was noncommittal about giving him another start that , hillegas conceded , was terrible fiverun seventh it was so ugly that the blue jays were not satisfied with an 81 lead in the seventh so they added five more runs todd stottlemyre , who had lost six of his last seven decisions , won for the first time since defeating the yankees , 163 , june 8 after allowing one run in seven innings the blue jays showed the talent gap between the two teams might be greater than the 13game gap in the standings that does make it depressing , to tell you the truth , said first baseman don mattingly , when asked about the obvious difference between the clubs to me , it does the yankees unraveled in the second , and it all started with john olerud s high chopper that mattingly lost in the skydome lights he crouched to field the ball and shielded his face as it bounded past him for a double it was the beginning of an avalanche as the blue jays scored four runs to make it 51 , and the rout was only beginning i did n't see it , mattingly said minor leaguer on michael s mind it was easy to see and sense that hillegas s trial in the rotation might end soon since general manager gene micheal scouted sam militello thurday and the 22year old pitched a fourhit shutout for class aaa columbus to run his record to 122 , the yankees might recall him recalling militello might be michael s option after the yankees did not complete a trade for abbott before the deadline though managing partner joseph molloy said thursday that he would trade any players except mattingly for the lefthander , the yanks were unable to offer the angels a package that they found enticing everything is quiet , said one club official it does n't look like it is going to happen but it looks like tartabull will have a difficult time playing 120 games this season after he was placed on the disabled list with persistent muscular spasms in his lower back it is the 255 million man s second stint on the list this year he is eligible to return aug 11 bernie williams , who was hitting 307 at columbus , was recalled and might remain in the majors for the rest of the year even if williams stays with the yankees for the next 11 weeks , chances are he will not witness a fiasco like tonight s game the yankees simply had a terrible day , on and off the field
a man wielding a box cutter slashed four women , including one with a baby , during a crazed spree in brooklyn yesterday morning but was captured after swinging a bottle at a police officer who chased him into a dark subway tunnel , the police said i ca n't impress on you enough that this city police officer , alexis anderson , is a hero in every sense of the word , said al o'leary , a transit police spokesman this is not just a chase , but a chase into an extremely dangerous environment officer anderson said , i do n't think i'm a hero i did my job none of the four women , or a fifth whom the suspect punched , were seriously injured , mr o'leary said but the health of the slashed women will have to be monitored , he said , because the first woman cut turns out to be hivpositive , and that raises great concern for the other three victims a spokesman for the centers for disease control in atlanta , kent taylor , said the risk of aids infection was probably minimal , but it s hard to tell the virus is pretty fragile and there s so many factors how long it was between slashings , how much blood , mr taylor added asked what he meant by saying the virus was fragile , he replied in the open air , usually it dies relatively quickly about 90 percent dies within the first hour the slashings all took place within an hour mr taylor said the victims should be tested for the aids virus , which would normally show up after 6 to 12 weeks motive undetermined mr o'leary identified the suspect as rodney jordan , 22 years old , of 102 cumberland walk , flatbush the first slashing , mr o'leary said , took place in a housing project at 200 throop avenue he was apparently visiting a relative when he attacked one of his relative s neighbors with a box cutter , mr o'leary said the motive for that attack , which took place between 9 30 and 10 am , was undetermined yesterday the identity of the victim was not disclosed the suspect ran to the stairway of the myrtle avenuewilloughby street subway station , mr o'leary said , where he attacked sylvia vasquez , 31 , slashing her on the neck he then ran to the brooklynbound platform where mayda cruz , 32 , of brooklyn , was waiting for a train with her baby in a stroller he slashed her on the face and both arms , mr o'leary said , but the baby was unharmed the suspect boarded a train and cut clarissa ortiz , 21 , of brooklyn , on her left hand , then punched naomi diaz , 18 , of manhattan , in the face , mr o'leary said officer anderson , 31 , a member of the force for seven years , was aboard the train i got off and chased him into the tunnel , the officer said he was hiding i kept telling him , 'be cool , do n't be crazy' called 'very courageous' when the man moved into a more lighted area , officer anderson ordered him to kneel i cuffed one hand , but with the other he pulls out a bottle and we struggled a few hits here , a few hits there , he said i finally got his other hand and cuffed it mr o'leary called officer anderson very courageous for going in there you 're not chasing the suspect on level ground , but on railroad ties in a very dark environment , mr o'leary said not only do you have to be concerned about trains coming through , but there s the everpresent danger of the third rail , which carries 600 volts of electricity officer anderson , a father of two , said people say i did a great job , and i appreciate that but there s 26 , 000 cops out there , and i think they would have done the same thing photo police officer alexis anderson , who apprehended a slashing suspect in a subway tunnel \( nick malter for the new york times \)
first , start with the company s oftmentioned negatives operating standards are inconsistent the chairman recently unloaded 12 , 000 shares of his stock , and the buyout firm that brought the company public in 1991 sold a huge 80 percent stake in the offering , perhaps signaling a lack of faith in the company s future so with all these danger signs , why is wall street getting so hot on the international house of pancakes \? largely because this is one time the signs do n't mean what they seem once a sleepy pancake and sausage house teetering on the brink of financial failure , the ihop corporation has been rejuvenated into a financially strong and briskly growing national restaurant company with a unique franchising strategy top that with a record of improving average sales per store each month for the last 120 months , and it s no wonder that some large investors think ihop stacks up well people do n't realize how much growth there is in this concept , said sandy mehta , a vice president with ariel capital management , which owns about 11 percent of the company we think a lot of it the stock is pretty cheap relative to the market , but also relative to other restaurant companies ihop shares , which closed yesterday at 1750 , unchanged in overthecounter trading , are selling at 22 times earnings but institutional analysts say the shares are trading at only 12 times their earnings estimate for next year even in rough economic times , it seems , people do n't lose their appetites earnings have been growing steadily , with a 26 percent gain in the latest quarter but what makes ihop so attractive is that unlike some other national restaurant chains , its quarterly fortunes are only loosely tied to the amount of food it sells because of the almost guaranteed cash flow generated by its franchising strategy , ihop performs like what might be called a restaurant annuity as a franchiser , ihop , which was taken private in 1987 by kelso company , develops everything from the design of each restaurant to the land it stands on before it turns over operations to a franchisee at that point , the restaurant is essentially a turnkey operation , giving ihop unusual control over its performance franchisees pay the company rent and royalties , and they buy pancake mix from ihop and contribute to their own advertising the great part about the ihop story is that they have multiple , highmargin revenue streams , whether it is rent , leasing of equipment or pancake batter , said gregory ekizian , a vice president at eagle asset management , which holds about 6 percent of ihop s stock it is a lowrisk , highgrowth restaurant operator ihop earned 47 million last year on revenues of 105 million but less than half of those revenues came directly from selling food about 52 million was from rent , service fees and other renewable charges from the franchise system of course , with royalties tied to franchise sales , ihop stands to make more money when business is brisk and since the company went public , pancakes have been virtually flying out the door ihop has also gained a loyal following on wall street because of its skill at remodeling its older restaurants and turning them into powerful producers remodeling increases sales 15 percent per store on average , according to company filings , and ihop expects to remodel as many as 160 of its more than 500 stores this year and next at the same time , the company is finding new revenue by bringing in new franchisees almost none of whom are solely investors , but rather people who want to run a restaurant themselves we use franchising as a management tool , said richard k herzer , the chairman and chief executive of ihop i am not using the balance sheet of the potential franchisees to develop the company ihop gets paid for financing the 200 , 000 to 350 , 000 fee it charges new franchisees for developing sites , with 20 percent of that paid up front in cash the company has a backlog of franchisees , mr mehta said unlike most restaurants , they have never had to advertise for them what about all those negatives \? they do n't mean much in the eyes of ihop s fans sure operating standards are inconsistent that is why ihop has begun a remodeling program that has proved a boon to earnings as for the sale of shares , mr herzer said he needed the cash to address some real estate problems he had he points to the more than 700 , 000 remaining shares he owns and kelso s sale of 80 percent does not look so suspicious given the fact that the firm made 11 times its investment in the offering and does not have a record of holding on to companies once they are public but all those negatives have helped the bulls on the stock , particularly because the concerns helped push the original offering price down from 14 to 10 for the people who bought this at the offering , mr mehta said , this has been a really good investment
for those who think of baseball s 26 owners as the only members of a snobbish country club but could never prove it , proof is now available when a seattle group , including the japanese soninlaw of the owner of the nintendo videogame empire , announced its intention to buy the seattle mariners in order to prevent the franchise from being relocated to st petersburg , fla , the baseball hierarchy blanched commissioner fay vincent announced that major league baseball has a strong policy against investors from outside the united states and canada , and warned that approval of the seattle group was unlikely baseball s ownership committee had a hurried conference call but by offering to provide 60 percent of the 100 million purchase price , the nintendo people were n't trying to buy a baseball treasure , such as the hall of fame at cooperstown or one of babe ruth s mustardstained uniforms if anything , the seattle group would be doing baseball a favor over its 15 seasons , the mariners franchise has been all but invisible never in a divisional race never above 500 until last season never willing to bid for any of the expensive free agents even so , the nintendo of japan president , hiroshi yamauchi , responded to a group of seattle businessmen and civic leaders , including senator slade gorton , republican of washington , that was trying to keep the troubled american league franchise jeff smulyan , the mariners' owner , has imposed a march 27 deadline to produce a local buyer if none is approved , smulyan apparently plans to hijack the team to st petersburg throughout his reign , vincent has denounced the moving of a franchise vincent and the owners have also been concerned about smallmarket teams coping with the spiraling salary structure now a local seattle group wants to keep the team there now its japanese money could afford the salary spiral but the commissioner mentions a strong policy against foreign ownership yamauchi s soninlaw , minoru arakawa , the president of nintendo of america , has lived in the seattle area for 15 years and has raised his family there he s as seattle as grilled salmon baseball s thinking in the seattle situation is what occurs on some countryclub admissions committees it s the opposite of what vincent keeps calling for more minority involvement in baseball s front office and dugout call it racist call it snobbish whatever you call it , this thinking is as narrow as a bat handle if the baseball hierarchy looked beyond the next pitch , it would leap at the opportunity for japanese involvement in a major league franchise if the mariners were financed by nintendo money , they might play some exhibition games in japan and they might develop a following on japanese television when supersonic jets arrive , the major leagues just might want to expand to tokyo and other asian cities for almost a century , baseball s world series has been a misnomer for what is merely the north american championship let the mariners be the first planks in a 21stcentury bridge to a true world series another sham is the requirement of local ownership george steinbrenner , the yankees' principal owner now in exile , has a manhattan apartment , but even when active , he always spent more time in tampa , fla john mcmullen , the owner of the houston astros , has a new york office and resides in montclair , nj but for all its nintendo money , if problems develop , the seattle group has drawn up provisions to keep the franchise there yamauchi would grant an irrevocable proxy to his soninlaw if the franchise were put up for sale , for 120 days other members of the group would have the right of first refusal to purchase it for the next 120 days , it could be sold only to people from the pacific northwest for the 120 days after that , only to people who would keep the club in seattle the group has also announced that john ellis , the chairman and chief executive officer of puget sound power and light , would be the franchise s representative to baseball as well as its daytoday boss but more important , it has mentioned the words that truly terrify baseball creating legislation to revoke baseball s antitrust exemption baseball s hierarchy might also be interested to know that minoru arakawa is a member of the overlake golf and country club in the seattle area to keep the mariners there , baseball s hierarchy should revoke its strong policy against admitting him to its country club photo fay vincent \( dith pran \)
los angeles , nov 9 some visionary playwrights want to change the world some want to revolutionize the theater tony kushner , the remarkably gifted 36yearold author of angels in america , is that rarity of rarities a writer who has the promise to do both as a political statement , angels in america , a twopart , sevenhour epic subtitled a gay fantasia on national themes , is nothing less than a fierce call for gay americans to seize the strings of power in the war for tolerance and against aids but this play , by turns searing and comic and elegiac , is no earthbound ideological harangue though set largely in new york and washington during the reaganbush 80 s , angels in america sweeps through locales as varied as salt lake city and the kremlin , and through highflying styles ranging from piquant camp humor to religious hallucination to the ornate poetic rage of classic drama when was the last time a play embraced intellectual poles as seemingly antithetical as judy garland and walter benjamin , joseph smith and mikhail gorbachev , emma goldman and nancy reagan \? almost anything can happen as history cracks open in angels in america a valiumaddicted washington housewife , accompanied by an imaginary travel agent resembling a jazz musician , visits a hole in the ozone layer above antarctica an angel crashes with an apocalyptic roar through the ceiling of a manhattan apartment to embrace a dwindling , christlike man spotted with kaposi s sarcoma a museum diorama illustrating the frontier history of the mormons comes to contentious life ethel rosenberg returns from the dead to say kaddish for her executioner , roy cohn no wonder the audience is somewhat staggered as it leaves the mark taper forum , where the complete angels in america had its premiere in a dayandnight marathon on sunday \( it is scheduled to travel to the new york shakespeare festival in february \) the show is not merely mindbending at times it is mindexploding , eventually piling on more dense imagery and baroque spiritual , political and historical metaphor than even an entranced , receptive audience can absorb in two consecutive sittings part 1 of angels in america , titled millennium approaches and a sensation at the royal national theater in london this year , remains a dazzling , selfcontained piece while the new , at times stodgy taper production , directed by oskar eustis with tony taccone , does not yet reach the imaginative heights of declan donnellan s london staging , the work s alternate chords of deep grief and dreamy wonderment still produce exhilaration for the heart , mind and eyes part 2 , titled perestroika and never before seen in a full production , seems a somewhat embryonic , occasionally overstuffed mixture of striking passages , talmudic digressions and glorious epiphanies mr kushner is by no means exhausted , but he may have to harness his energies more firmly to keep his audience from feeling so by the final curtain huge as the playwright s canvas is , both parts of angels focus intimately on two couples , one gay and one nominally heterosexual , in which one partner abandons the other louis ironson \( joe mantello \) , a jewish leftist and legal cleric , runs out on his aidsstricken lover , a wasp esthete named prior walter \( stephen spinella \) , once the disease s ravages leave blood on the floor joe pitt \( jeffrey king \) , an ambitious republican lawyer clerking in federal court , deserts his loyal but longsuffering wife , harper \( cynthia mace \) , once his homosexual longings overpower his rectitudinous mormon credo whether intact or fractured , the couples intersect throughout the play , brought together by chance events , by interlocking fantasies \( erotic and mystical \) and , indirectly , by the machinations of roy cohn as written by mr kushner with a witty , demonic grandeur worthy of a shakespearean villain , and played with maniacal relish by the braying ron leibman in high , redfaced dudgeon , cohn is the antichrist of angels in america the witchhunting accomplice of joe mccarthy is seen in his final guise as an unofficial mr fixit in the ed meese justice department and new york city s most famous closeted gay aids patient in one brilliant passage , cohn argues that he is a heterosexual who has sex with men rather than a homosexual because gay men , unlike him , are men who know nobody and who nobody knows , men who have zero clout it is mr kushner s sly point that gay people could learn something from the despicable cohn about the amassing of political power , and it is one of the play s most provocative strokes that this cutthroat often has the funniest and smartest lines for mr leibman , the vindictive , cadaverous cohn may be the role of his career , and his performance need only shed some don rickles shtick to realize it his theatrical power is matched by mr spinella s prior , another kind of aids patient entirely it is the abandoned , delusional prior who is visited by an angel at the end of part 1 and becomes a heavensent prophet of survival for his people in part 2 mr spinella , a bonethin young man with a boy s open face and an extravagant spirit , is triumphant in this mammoth part , creating an ethereal but toughspined sprite who fills the theater with his transcendent will to live even as his body is gutted by inhuman horror he is the ideal heroic vessel for mr kushner s unifying historical analogy , in which the modern march of gay people out of the closet is likened to the courageous migrations of turnofthecentury jews to america and of 19thcentury mormons across the plains
newark , sept 29 a grand jury accused three newark police officers today of taking the law into their own hands four months ago by ambushing a teenage cartheft suspect and trying to cover up their actions after one of them fired a shot from an illegal handgun that critically wounded the youth the jury charged officer kenneth holloway jr with aggravated assault in the shooting of the teenager , howard caesar he and two other officers , jose montalvo and gerard piacenza , were charged with conspiracy and misconduct in filing false or misleading reports the officers , all of whom have been on the force less than two years , denied the charges through their lawyers and contended that the prosecutor s office had used them as scapegoats secret , nearly fatal plot the indictment was couched in obscure legal language about misfeasance and nonfeasance , but in response to questions at a news conference , the acting essex county prosecutor , james f mulvihill , acknowledged that the misconduct that the men are charged with amounted to this that the officers went off on their own , without telling superiors , and carried out what ultimately became a secret , nearly fatal plot to seize a stolen car and arrest its occupants the prosecutor s office has declared open season for the car thieves , said richard banas , the lawyer representing officer montalvo with this indictment , we 're protecting criminals and attacking the police the indictments followed a twoandahalfmonth investigation by a special essex county grand jury into a case that came to symbolize newark s increasing problem with car theft among idle young people and the dangerous rivalry it spawned among joy riders and frustrated police officers court papers say that the conspiracy by the officers led them to a treefilled park in newark s north ward at 4 30 am on june 9 , where they could look down , unnoticed , on the intersection of 16th avenue and south 17th street and the approach of a stolen car making tight , screeching circles , called doughnuts , beneath the street lights it was then , the indictment says , that officer holloway , carrying a 45caliber handgun for which he had no permit , fired a bullet that struck mr caesar as the 17yearold emerged from a black 1987 camaro officer holloway , 30 years old , is charged with seconddegree assault in the shooting of mr caesar in a separate charge of aggravated assault , he is accused of pointing a gun at a passenger in the car , elmer smith , 19 , who , the indictment says , was fired at after fleeing through a vacant lot two other counts

and officer piacenza , 24 , face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of three counts of seconddegree conspiracy and misconduct , and officer holloway faces up to five more years on the possession charge mr mulvihill , the acting prosecutor , also said the grand jury had indicted officer holloway s father , kenneth holloway , and a brother , bismillah q holloway , on charges that they perjured themselves before the grand jury mr mulvihill would not elaborate on those indictments although not mentioning mr caesar by name , mr mulvihill announced today that the driver of the car had been charged as a juvenile with receiving stolen property , the camaro i 'll leave you to draw your own conclusions about who that was , mr mulvihill said mr caesar was released from the hospital on saturday his brother , omar stark , said today that the family would have no comment until wednesday police director angry mr caesar , who suffered critical abdominal wounds , lay near death for weeks as citizens and city and state officials debated what to do over the epidemic of car thefts in newark and nearby towns for reasons of public safety , the police are prevented from engaging in highspeed pursuit or from using their weapons in most cartheft cases but as the thieves have become more brazen , ramming police cruisers and driving wildly through the streets , public officials have sought to take a harder line , and some residents have criticized the police for abusive behavior toward the core of teenagers and younger children for whom joy riding is a pastime that is rarely punished of the six officers at the scene of the shooting last june 9 , three testified before the grand jury two had immunity from prosecution and one pleaded guilty to filing a false report and was permitted to enter a oneyear pretrial intervention program he could be readmitted to the force next june all are suspended without pay pending departmental review the city s police director , william r celester , who attended the news conference today , said he was angry that we have officers in our department who would do this but he would not elaborate on the prosecutor s remarks , saying only that each of the officers would be subject to a separate departmental investigation the three indicted officers are to be arraigned wednesday afternoon in superior court before judge joseph a falcone 'fed up with car theft' mr holloway said in june that he had fired warning shots from his 9millimeter semiautomatic pistol , the weapon authorized by the newark police department no shell casings were found at the scene the indictment says officer holloway ignored guidelines requiring him to report firing his weapon and unlawfully possessing a 45caliber handgun that he used to shoot mr caesar the prosecutor , mr mulvihill , would not say if a 45caliber pistol had been recovered the investigation determined that mr caesar had been wounded by a 45caliber slug that ricocheted off pavement near west side park , where some of the officers were standing moments after the news conference ended today , lawyers for the three officers appeared in the prosecutor s waiting room to deny the charges , adding that repeated searches of mr holloway s home and car and of his father s home and car had failed to produce a weapon the lawyers characterized their clients as scapegoats of a prosecutor s office that had made up its mind to bring an indictment at all costs the people of newark are fed up with car theft , said anthony fusco , officer holloway s lawyer you have a bunch of cops here doing their job , and nothing else what happens to the criminals , what happens to caesar \? vincent scoca , who represents officer piacenza , and mr banas , whose client is officer montalvo , said they welcomed a trial and expected acquittals the lawyers were scornful of the grand jury testimony offered by the three other officers who were at the park last june they made deals , mr fusco said that testimony is tainted newark police officers on patrol today had little to say about the case , and none would speak for attribution some expressed surprise that mr holloway had been charged when the weapon apparently had not been found it sounds kind of political , one officer said rocco malanga , president of the patrolmen s benevolent association , said the indictments were expected but we 're confident that once this goes to a trial , our officers will be cleared , he added the poet amiri baraka , who leads a citizens' group seeking to install an allcivilian complaint review board in newark , said his group was pleased by the indictments it validates what we 've been pushing for , he said these mad police should not have open season on our young people photo officer kenneth

san francisco when sciencerich but cashpoor biotechnology companies go looking for a savior with deep pockets , they usually turn to one of the giant drug concerns cortex pharmaceuticals inc , a startup company focusing on products for treating brain diseases , tried that route at first , but found a better match with a company its own size this week cortex , based in irvine , calif , announced a collaborative agreement with alkermes inc , a fouryearold company in cambridge , mass , that is developing technology to enable drugs to enter the brain more easily the two companies will codevelop compounds that cortex is now working on that are believed to counteract the destruction of nerve cells that accompanies strokes alkermes will also make a series of investments in cortex , which could ultimately total as much as 265 million cortex s management knew it could not afford to develop the compounds into drug form and bring the drug to market alone , and began looking for possible partners among the large pharmaceutical companies but after nine months of meetings with several candidates , none of which they would name , they became discouraged with the slow pace and bureaucracy of those concerns in contrast , the deal with alkermes came together in just one month i think we fell in love with each other very quickly , began dating intensely and were married soon after , said raymond t bartus , cortex s executive vice president for research and development and chief operating officer alkermes is very aggressive , he said , noting the rapid progress alkermes has made moving its own product into human clinical trials another attraction is that a single successful drug will have the same relative importance to both companies having spent 15 years in large pharmaceuticals companies , i greatly appreciate the net value of working with another small company , dr bartus said the net value of a success here is not diluted for either of us the worst thing we could have done is to do a deal where our firstborn was n't treated with the utmost importance for alkermes , which is developing drugdelivery technologies rather than drugs , cortex presented an opportunity to acquire a drug candidate at an early stage to which that technology can be applied although itself a young company , alkermes has both more capital , as the result of two successful public offerings last year , and more experience taking a product through development into clinical trials if you think of us as being a company building a significant development capability , the smart thing to do is to pump products through it , said richard f pops , president and chief executive of alkermes it is a huge commitment for a company to make , to take a drug from a benchlevel lead to a drug in a vial that you can actually inject in a patient the collaboration will focus on three classes of enzyme inhibitors discovered by cortex they block the action of calpain , an enzyme that appears to be responsible for the destruction of nerve cells after the brain is temporarily deprived of blood , as during a stroke or heart attack the action of calpain follows the stroke by several hours , providing an opportunity to administer a drug that blocks it under the terms of the agreement , alkermes will provide 2 million to cortex in research and development funds this year and an additional 25 million in 1993 as products of the collaboration proceed through clinical trials , cortex will receive up to 10 million in payments tied to passing various hurdles in testing and regulatory review the agreement gives alkermes worldwide , exclusive rights to make and market any products resulting from the collaboration cortex will receive royalties on sales in a related transaction , alkermes purchased 750 , 000 newly issued shares of cortex s common stock for 15 million , and warrants to purchase an additional two million shares of common stock one million shares at 3 each and another million at 750 each cortex shares closed yesterday at 375 , up 15625 a share , in overthecounter trading alkermes shares closed at 27 , up 475 a share one reason cortex decided on the partnership was that its relatively low stock price precluded doing a secondary public offering during the bull market for biotechnology stocks in recent months cortex went public several years ago , at a relatively early point in its history , which has limited its subsequent ability to raise capital alkermes waited longer , and was able to go public last year at a more favorable stock valuation the check that we write today is very , very manageable , given our balance sheet , mr pops said , noting that alkermes has about 56 million drawing

the manhattan district attorney , robert m morgenthau the banker , sheik khalid bin mahfouz , is chief operating officer of the national commercial bank , the largest bank in saudi arabia , which has a branch in new york mr bin mahfouz is also believed to be a principal banker for the saudi ruling family from 1986 to 1989 , mr bin mahfouz was a director of bcci , which collapsed a year ago as evidence emerged that billions of dollars had been lost in what became the biggest bank fraud in history an associate is also indicted the district attorney also announced the indictment of haroon kahlon , an associate of mr bin mahfouz , who was accused of acting with bcci s chief executives to carry out more than 1 billion in transactions with mr bin mahfouz s bank in essence , the indictment accuses mr bin mahfouz and mr kahlon of conspiring with bcci executives to mislead auditors and regulators about the extent of mr bin mahfouz s holdings in bcci and about the bank s financial condition the defendants engaged in a scheme , the indictment said , to defraud bank regulators and directors , auditors , depositors and custmomers of the bcci by , among other things , misrepresenting and concealing the true financial condition and ownership of the bcci mr bin mahfouz is now in saudi arabia , mr morgenthau said at a news conference , noting that the country has no extradition treaty with the united states none of mr bin mahfouz s or the national commerical bank s assets in the united states have been seized , mr morgenthau said , but he warned that an investigation of national commercial bank was continuing denying the charges , lawrence g smith , executive vice president of national commercial bank s new york branch and a spokesman for mr bin mahfouz , said that mr bin mahfouz was not part of the group that created and controlled bcci as someone who suffered huge losses himself , mr smith said mr bin mahfouz is not only surprised , but quite frankly astounded by this action according to mr smith , the saudi banker had 200 million in personal assets on deposit at bcci when the bank collapsed , in addition to the 330 million that bcci owes to national commercial , and was himself taken by surprise at the scandal the indictment appeared to breathe new life into investigations of bcci , which seem to have proceeded more slowly than mr morgenthau and other prosecutors had expected six months ago , when bcci executives pled guilty to federal and state criminal charges and agreed to surrender 550 million in cash and securities , mr morgenthau predicted that the plea would speed his investigations but at a news conference where he announced yesterday s indictment , the district attorney said further investigations would take time asked what difficulties he had encountered in domestic investigations of bcci fraud , mr morgenthau replied that it had been hard to obtain necessary records , many of which are in abu dhabi , whose government was the major shareholder in bcci we 're making progress , but it is slow , mr morgenthau said asked for an update from his projection a year ago that bcci investigations were 25 percent complete , mr morgenthau said maybe we 're 28 percent of the way through the felonies mr bin mahfouz and mr kahlon were charged with carry a maximum fouryear sentence , in addition to punitive fines mr smith protested that mr bin mahfouz was not given a prior chance to respond to any of the district attorney s concerns , and was not approached for an interview even though he met with investigators at the department of justice and the federal reserve bank in recent months this is a profound abuse of local prosecutorial powers for two further reasons first , all of the challenged acts were lawful and second , none of those acts took place in new york , mr smith said in the past , mr morgenthau s office has argued that the bcci case is within his jurisdiction because the bank has been found guilty of moneylaundering in the united states , and because most dollardenominated international banking transactions are cleared in new york mr morgenthau has been often credited as an active investigator in a case that many investigators ignored according to the indictment , mr bin mahfouz invested more than 700 million in bcci and more than 140 million in credit and commerce american holdings , the holding company that owned first american bank mr bin mahfouz made a secret arrangement with bcci s chief executive , agha hasan abedi , and others , the indictment contends , to sell his bcci shares in 1988 and his ccah shares in 1989 without informing the bank s regulators until april 1990 at least 300 million that was paid to mr bin mahfouz for his shares were falsely recorded as loans , mr morgenthau said , and those false loans were then presented to auditors as genuine assets certain bcci loans were also parked with national commercial , mr morganthau said , and bcci placed more than 200 million in national commercial as collateral for these loans but bcci s financial condition was misstated , the indictment said , because national commercisal confirmed the deposits without telling auditors that they were being held as loan collateral photo manhattan district attorney robert m morgenthau announced yesterday the indictment of sheik khalid bin mahfouz \(

six people were hit with plastic birdshot pellets and two others , including a 2yearold girl , were scratched by flying glass during a fight at a club soccer game in upper manhattan yesterday , the police said none of the injuries were serious , and all the victims were in stable condition at local hospitals last night , a police spokeswoman , sgt mary wrensen , said the fracas occurred about 7 30 pm during a game between two soccer clubs , chilean united and uruguay cerro , on the field of george washington high school in washington heights an argument among opposing fans escalated when two men began throwing bottles and then two other men stood up , one carrying a shotgun and the other a 38caliber revolver , sergeant wrensen said the man with the shotgun fired plastic birdshot into the crowd , and then fled
officials of the international brotherhood of teamsters said yesterday that their members had not been hired by a wholesale delivery company embroiled in a labor dispute with the newspaper deliverers union and said teamsters would not cross the deliverers' picket lines in a message that was sent to teamster locals in the metropolitan new york area thursday night and again yesterday , ron carey , the international president , said all teamsters are expected to honor pickets set up by members of the newspaper mailers and deliverers' union of new york and vicinity , his spokesman said when mr carey was informed there might be problems here , the first step he took was to say that if these people were involved in lawful picketing , we were n't going to cross the lines , said the spokesman , matt witt about 200 drivers in the deliverers union lost their jobs thursday in a labor dispute with imperial delivery service imperial recently bought the two wholesale distribution companies that used to employ the drivers thursday night and again yesterday , union drivers tried to block trucks from entering the wholesale centers , which are in new rochelle , ny , and east farmingdale , li imperial is under contract with teamsters local 917 jerold e glassman , a lawyer for mr imperatore , said that a small number of the 150 replacement drivers were members of local 917 who worked at a distribution site in peekskill , ny he said the remaining replacement drivers were recruited from the metropolitan area through advertisements in local newspapers the president of local 917 , john t burke jr , did not return repeated phone calls yesterday but officials with teamsters joint council 16 , which includes local 917 , said yesterday that mr burke had assured them that none of his members would cross the picket lines any truck that is crossing picket lines is being driven by a nonunion scab , said frank mazza , a spokesman for the joint council i have every reason to believe that local 917 is holding tight with the teamsters mr imperatore began replacing unionized drivers after members of the deliverers union rejected contracts wednesday night that would have significantly diluted the union s powers in the workplace and reduced members' wages officials with the deliverers union and the teamsters said yesterday that they believed that mr imperatore was recruiting drivers from other parts of the country , just as the tribune company did during a strike by workers at the daily news that began in 1990 a replacement driver injured by a rock thrown through his truck window thursday night was from oklahoma city but mr glassman said that most of the replacement drivers came from the metropolitan area a worker at a ramada inn in new rochelle said yesterday that a representative of imperial had taken a room for the last five months and had met on several occasions with people answering advertisements for truckdriving jobs the representative checked out of the hotel thursday , according to the worker , who spoke on condition of anonymity yesterday , chartered buses and vans accompanied by private security guards shuttled replacement drivers in and out of the distribution sites , passing through lines of union workers who spat , hurled rocks and shouted taunts at them many of the union drivers expressed bitter disappointment that longtime workers were being replaced it s not fair , said bobby royal , who worked at the new rochelle site for 10 years how could they take guys who have worked for the company for 40 years and tell them that you 're not part of the company \? many of the unionized drivers said they were counting on other unions to come to their aid members of the deliverers union are scheduled to meet with barry feinstein , president of teamsters joint council 16 , and other union officials on tuesday to discuss how the international union can support the drivers mr glassman said the members of local 917 who are now driving at the two wholesale centers had originally been hired to deliver the national , a sportsoriented daily , which folded last year he said their union contract would expire in 1994 but it was not clear yesterday whether the contract was still valid , since the drivers had been transferred to a new location , he said mr burke , the president of local 917 , was charged last year with embezzling union funds according to a courtappointed investigator , mr burke and other union officials recruited associate union members who paid dues but did not receive full benefits the money from these members was used to increase mr burke s salary , the investigator said the charges are pending before a federal judge in new jersey mr burke could be fined or expelled from the teamsters if the charges are proved
to most people , it is a lawn mower , but to the environmental protection agency it is an uncontrolled mobile source that becomes part of the suburban swarm adding measurably to smog on a summer s day and the time has come , the agency says , to clean it up , along with weed eaters , leaf blowers , chain saws and a lot of other offroad gaspowered machinery a lawn mower can easily spew as much smogcausing hydrocarbon into the air in an hour as a modern car , experts on pollution say , even though the car has 30 times as much horsepower chain saws are worse the california air resources board says a chain saw operated for two hours emits as many hydrocarbons as a new car driven 3 , 000 miles that is because modern cars have microprocessors that can precisely control an engine s mix of fuel and air injectors to break the fuel into droplets of optimal size , and catalytic converters to catch anything that passes through the engine unburned lawn mowers and other outdoor machines have none of these in fact , they have all the pollution control equipment of a '57 chevy without a muffler electronic yard work tomorrow , william k reilly , the administrator of the environmental protection agency , and an organization of electric utilities plan to announce the start of a program to clean up america s lawn mowers the effort on lawn mowers will be part of a plan that will eventually cover all kinds of engines , small and large , used off the highway that would include construction equipment , farm tractors and even the service vehicles on airport aprons nine utilities around the country will each give away 100 newly designed batterypowered mowers , taking their customers' old gasoline models in trade and asking them to test the new mowers in the field or , more precisely , on the lawn and report back on their performance meanwhile , the epa will haul the old mowers into its labs to study their emissions , in preparation for issuing new airquality regulations similar to the rules now in place for cars and trucks in its new gettough approach , the epa plans to make an example of the lawn mower we joke around and call it the last frontier for mobile sources , said gay mcgregor , an airpollution specialist in the epa s mobilesource laboratory in ann arbor , mich the lawnmowerengine industry , after initial resistance , is acknowledging the mighty little machine s role in air pollution at the outdoor power equipment institute , formerly the lawn mower institute , dennis c dix , the executive director , conceded , we certainly could do better his industry , which never worried much about exhaust , is being forced by california to abide by new regulations that are to take effect in 1994 and 1999 and may be extended to other states as well ann mcclure , the executive vice president of the professional lawn care association of america , said there s an irony in this turf actually helps to cleanse the air , taking what emissions there are in the air , removing them , and replacing them with oxygen at caterpillar inc in peoria , ill , a big maker of the type of agricultural and heavy construction equipment that is likely to be regulated soon , rita l castle , said that the trend was not unexpected she added , they 've gone after most of the large emissions sources , and offroad vehicles certainly deserve a close look a snowblower exemption \? at the toro company , karl c kaukis , the director of marketing for the lawn boy line , said lawn mowers could be cleaned up , but consumers would find them more costly he added that he hoped for a common sense approach specifically , he said that he hoped that the cleanup would not extend to snow blowers , of which toro is a major producer the utilization is so low , and the summer utilization is zero , he said smog is a summer hazard , though carbon monoxide , which small engines also emit , is a particular problem in some cities in winter nobody is certain how many lawn mowers are in use or what their emission levels are after a few years without being tuned up , but an epa study late last year suggested that in areas that are already in violation of smog rules , nearly 20 percent of volatile organic compounds and nearly 30 percent of nitrogen oxides come from nonroad sources mixed with sunlight , those two chemicals make smog the population of nonroad sources varies now from place to place in the metropolitan new york area , for example , outboard motors on pleasure boats are numerous , but in colorado they are not most manufacturers will try to lower emissions from gasoline engines by redesigning the combustion chambers , in many cases switching to overhead valves instead of side valves , a change made by the auto industry 40 years ago they also plan to make engines that run on a leaner fuelair mixture california has adopted rules to begin in 1994 for improvements that the state says can be achieved with existing technology , and stricter rules for 1999 that will require new approaches
any list of america s living literary wonders must include horton foote , whose roads to home opened the lamb s theater company season last night mr foote s prolific playwriting career stretches back to the halcyon broadway of half a century ago his parallel service to hollywood has earned him a couple of oscars \( to kill a mockingbird , tender mercies \) as well as a latterday sideline in hardscrabble independent film making \( 1918 , on valentine s day \) and here mr foote is now , in a small playhouse in the shadows of the broadway behemoths , directing his own script , meticulously tending to a vision that has deepened but not wavered throughout his long career the roads to home , a trilogy of related oneact plays first seen briefly off off broadway a decade ago , is modest foote but echt foote the setting is texas the time is long ago \( the 1920 s \) the lives on display are unexceptional , undramatic and just when the audience is set to relax into an elegiac reverie that might resemble nostalgia , the playwright finds a way to make his characters' inner turmoil so ferociously vivid it leaps beyond their specific time and place to become our own like carrie watts , the displaced foote heroine played by geraldine page in the film the trip to bountiful , the women who dominate the roads to home live uneasily in the big city of houston and hunger to return somehow to the cozier venues of their youth the chattery mabel votaugh \( jean stapleton \) , in whose parlor the evening s first two acts take place , never tires of gossip and memories of her beloved harrison , the mythical texas town that is a fixture on the foote canon s map since mabel is married to a railroad worker , she notes repeatedly that she is entitled to passes that can be used for a trip back home but she never gets on the train instead , she plays sympathetic host to neighbors whose own yearnings for home have been shaken in act i , titled a nightingale , annie gayle long \( hallie foote \) , a pretty , younger woman also in thrall to her native harrison , drops in every day on mabel rather than look after her two children the disconnected annie tends to break into geographically askew homesick song \( my old kentucky home \) without provocation even as she compulsively relives the violent murder of her father that shattered her harrison childhood in act ii \( the dearest of friends \) , mabel s best friend , a transplanted louisianian named vonnie \( rochelle oliver \) , seeks refuge after her own household is rocked by her husband s infidelity a few baldly stated sorrows aside , mr foote buries the heartbreak of these vignettes in humorous talk informed by dense period and character detail vonnie s melodramatic chronicle of marital woe must take time out for a description of a splendid meal taken at a prized hotel restaurant mabel s enthusiastically prurient recounting of distant church scandals invariably upstages the crises at hand when the women s spouses make their belated appearances , the roads to home skirts farce the men exist in a remote orbit of their own , and even the one nominally contented husband , mabel s frequently somnolent railroad man , addresses his wife only when he needs her to read the living room clock ms stapleton is more comfortable with mabel s sassier outpourings of domestic malice than with her pathos , which her facial muscles oversell emmett o sullivanmoore is a dyspeptic delight as her husband , the most sharply realized of the menfolk , and ms oliver is affecting as a desperate wife who turns almost maniacally to prayer after love , rage and tears have all failed her but the central and transporting performance in the roads to home is that of ms foote , the author s daughter , who plays the only character to return in the third act that act , titled spring dance , is set four years later in a garden outside an auditorium in austin let me call you sweetheart wafts in from the unseen dance floor the smell of roses permeates the april air men and women in evening clothes exchange stiff pleasantries and sit even more stiffly were it not for the first act s exposition about ms foote s character of annie , one might not immediately guess that the setting was a state asylum for the insane annie is still an elegant woman and a font of fond , articulate memories of harrison as played with eccentric , unsettling dignity by ms foote , a luminous beauty who preserves her regal posture even as she breaks down , she is understandably the zelda fitzgeraldesque belle of the ball a cracked ball it is , however though annie s wouldbe suitors are highly refined especially in the delicate performances of frank girardeau and dan mason none of them know what day it is , let alone what roads might ever take them home the author finds bleak absurdist humor in this party s fugue of utter psychological disorientation , and it carries his usual , disturbing kick the austin asylum does not seem much different from the houston households of the preceding acts for each of the sad , trapped married women in this ostensibly nostalgic play , not for just the incarcerated and abandoned annie , life is eked out in a madhouse in the roads to home , home survives only as an illusion , cruelly out of reach , that allows them to go on the roads to home written and directed by

when le cygne , the renowned and elegant french restaurant , was forced to close its doors last year , it was seen as further evidence that luxury dining was on the ropes yet the new tenants of the gracious town house on east 54th street audaciously dismissed doomsayers and opened a sumptuous seafood restaurant called oceana the quality effort by the new team is obvious the wisdom of its upscale strategy remains to be seen oceana is owned by john and nickolas livanos , a father and son from white plains who have a successful establishment there called livanos , in addition to six other restaurants in the region the third partner at oceana is james galileo , the former chef of livanos who now oversees the kitchen in manhattan former patrons of le cygne will certainly feel at home in oceana the same pastoral murals grace the main dining room , and while the colors have been changed slightly , the cushioned setting reminiscent of an ocean liner retains all of its charm servers wearing white jackets and bow ties are especially courteous and vigilant mr galileo has fun playing with textures and colors on the plate fortunately , this whimsy is supported by sound knowledge of food affinities but he gets carried away occasionally , as with a daunting plate of cold shelled lobster garnished with american caviar with a ziggurat of pasta in the center , chive oil around it and a sort of tomato compote underneath nothing in this culinary collage melds , so it is like eating an antipasto sampler more typical of mr galileo s style is an engaging tower of crabmeat , ripe avocado and roasted sweet peppers , all crowned with a fried leaf of spinach another felicitous union is a lightly bound grilled seafood sausage and a wonderfully saline gratin of sea urchin served in the shell the urchin roe is particularly good with some of the house rosemary flatbread , which my table depleted so fast i'm sure the waiter suspected we were filling our pockets my favorite starter is called multitextured rock shrimp and snapper cake , ringed by an intensely flavored , lustrous lobster sauce enlivened with a dab of horseradish caesar salad is a misnomer of sorts it is a fine green salad garnished with smoked shrimp , but lacks anchovy and garlic flavor quality smoked atlantic salmon comes with black bread and salmon mousse some of the chef s most cohesive efforts are seen in daily specials like the extraordinary fresh cod set over white beans and crispy baby artichokes with garnishes of arugula and crabmeat this is a gutsy dish exploding with flavor also recommended is the wellgrilled tuna steak surrounded by caramelized pearl onions , crispy chunks of foie gras and a juniper vinaigrette the sweet onions are a perfect match for the foie gras swordfish gets interesting treatment , too it is grilled and set over a layer of creamy goat cheese and sliced yellow potatoes along with roasted vegetables and a light tomato vinaigrette wolffish , called loup in france , is exquisitely fresh and flavorful , presented over fresh spinach , sliced yellow potatoes and with a light tomatocilantro vinaigrette there are as many versions of bouillabaisse as there are rum drinks in the florida keys this one has an odd appearance , with all of the shellfish sticking halfway out of the broth like so many sinking freighters more a stew than a soupy casserole , it packs sparkling flavors each element is cooked to perfection mussels , clams , shrimp , sea bass , john dory and grouper an avalanche of aioli slides from a slab of bread into the sauce , giving it just the zippy edge it needs oceana s wine is comprehensive , well balanced and priced fairly one of the most compelling desserts is the napoleon of poached pears and gingerflavored mascarpone velvety chocolate torte with cappuccino ice cream is a winner , too , as are the fruit sorbets and the ripe apple tart with a fluffy caramel mousse oceana is trying to fill some mighty big shoes by taking over le cygne s home so far its hospitality and sensitive approach to seafood cooking make it a welcome addition indeed oceana 55 east 54th street , manhattan , \( 212 \) 7595941 atmosphere pretty and

bragging about realestate deals is to most new yorkers what brandishing a fistful of wild animal pelts once was to the pioneers it shows an ability to triumph over adversity and can humble the most bitter of rivals but this week , residents of soho , tribeca , chelsea and parts of brooklyn went strangely quiet on the subject uhm , mumbled mac adams , a sculptor who has lived in a sprawling tribeca loft since 1970 , ca n't you just say my rent is average \? for support , he turned to a man who defined average as 685 a month for a loft space the size of a threebedroom apartment on the upper west side those rents , which would be low even in less fashionable places , are threatened with the expiration of a 1982 law that for the last decade has protected artists' living quarters while at the same time encouraging their landlords to bring those spaces into compliance with safety codes the artists' anxiety is in albany s hands the state legislature is considering a sixyear extension of the law as well as a republican legislative remedy that artists fear almost as much as an expiration of the law recent weeks have seen the spectacle of a busload of artists trooping to albany for some unaccustomed lobbying , as well as fundraising efforts by landlords who hope to sway legislators through more direct means the law was due to expire on sunday but yesterday , the legislature , unable to fashion a solution , extended the deadline until wednesday that leaves another week for negotiations between the democraticled assembly , which traditionally supports tenants , and the republican senate , which favors landlords landlords are among the largest contributors to republican senatorial candidates if the law is defeated or is allowed to expire , artists who first settled in these former commercial districts and transformed them into one of the great artistic centers of america may be forced to move , or to sink into a tangle of litigation debate over the extension has pitted landlords tired of receiving belowmarket rents against a wellorganized and wellconnected community of artists bent upon preserving both their homes and the tenor of the communities they have created it has also focused attention on the byzantine world of real estate in neighborhoods that have shifted from commercial to residential use with only the barest of official restraints mr adams , who last year completed one of the nation s first major monuments to veterans of the korean war \( the sculpture is in battery park city \) , said that he and his family would have to move out of new york if his rent were raised to market levels , about 2 , 000 but he said he would move anyway , because the tribeca neighborhood would change it would n't be the community that i like living in now , he said it would turn into some upscale residential area with fancy restaurants mr adams lives at 311 church street , near the holland tunnel exit the artists contend that having discovered and upgraded neighborhoods that were once derelict , they have every right to remain without being forced to pay huge rent increases mayor david n dinkins has argued fervently for the law , saying that the arts bring new york about 6 billion in revenue each year and rank as one of the city s incomparable glories the landlords counter that the preservation of the arts is all well and good , but that it is a matter for the city , state or federal governments to care for , not business people roots of the conflict the roots of the conflict are in the early 1970 s at that time , scores of small industrial buildings , left vacant and decaying in the wake of an industrial exodus to the sun belt , were taken over by young artists eager for large spaces and a toehold in the city s art world the owners had no income , said thomas berger , president of the association of commercial property owners , a group that represents loft building owners when artists approached them for spaces in which they could both live and work , the owner and the prospective tenant both knew this was illegal , mr berger said so did the city , he said however , the city felt that if that happened , the owners would start paying their realestate taxes again so the city closed both its eyes and this continued until it became chic for a while , at least , it seemed as though everyone benefited the landlords made money from space that otherwise would depreciate the artists had huge studios and used some of the money they saved on rent to upgrade the spaces with kitchens , bedrooms and baths the taxes helped to fill city coffers then came the realestate boom of the 1980 s almost overnight , landlords realized that they could be getting at least double the rent tenants , now armed with lawyers and an organization , lower manhattan loft tenants , recognized that they could resist eviction notices and in some cases even stop paying rent altogether because their buildings did not meet safety minimums the solution , all parties hoped , was the loft law of 1982
hoboken , nj , may 26 the towering waves sped toward the shore , turning white as they rose and fell with a crash , scouring away sand on new jersey s newest beach the pounding , accompanied by the familiar roar of a storm surge , continued until a voice said , ok , wayne , that s enough wayne clark turned toward his computer keyboard , tapped a couple of keys and the ocean subsided mr clark is a research engineer at the stevens institute of technology here , where roiling and calming the seas is becoming old hat after a while it gets boring , he said of the nearalmighty power he exercises the voice that actually commands the operation belongs to dr michael s bruno , the director of the davison laboratory at stevens , whose water tanks have tested the hull designs of all but one of the sailing ships that have won the america s cup since the 1930 s now , the laboratory is turning its attention to the largely undeveloped field of coastal engineering and trying to better understand the forces that chew away new jersey s beaches during storms a 120foot beach has been built up at one end of a 320foot water tank to test a new device invented by a flemington company that is designed to slow erosion this is n't another offshore obstruction designed to break incoming waves , because they do n't work , dr bruno said the waves always break them , eventually current strategy the present strategy for preserving new jersey s beaches , the heart of its 9 billion tourist industry , is replenishment pumping or trucking sand onto badly eroded beaches or areas starved for some natural rebuilding by wave action the process is expensive and must be repeated about every five years the new device , invented by breakwaters international , would sit on the ocean floor , at least six feet below the surface even at low tide the storm waves pass over the structure , a concrete wall with a curved top facing the beach as water flows back out to sea , it loses much of its captive sand passing through slits in the wall in addition , some of the return water is directed up into the path of the incoming waves , depleting their energy the heavy interlocking concrete structures would be placed parallel to the beach between existing jetties and groins , forming a compartment that would prevent much of the sand from escaping , dr bruno said for the last two weeks the lab has been subjecting the artificial beach to heavy pounding by waves of different heights and frequency , as well as by random waves dr bruno said the tests show the system was effective the testing area is actually two beaches separated by a long board that reaches far out into the 170 , 000 gallons of water in the tank one half of the beach is unprotected and the other half has a small model of the concrete wall submerged off the strand the beach on the unprotected side has a sharp drop just off shore due to the action of the artificial waves , while the sandy bottom under the water on the protected side has retained its gentle slope dr bruno said everything , from the waves to the underwater wall and even the sand grains , is onesixth the size of what would be found along the real shore we used sandblasting sand , which it so happens is exactly onesixth the grain size of sand found on new jersey s beaches , he said more than 30 tons of it was trucked in the reason we agreed to conduct the study here is because it would be almost prohibitively expensive and difficult to get a permit and conduct a test in the ocean , dr bruno said it s a catch22 situation since for the want of analysis a system that may provide some benefit might never be built it will be up to the company to use the test results to try to persuade state and federal agencies to approve and finance construction of the system along stretches of real beach the study cost about 40 , 000 , including the cost of the sand , and breakwaters international paid about threequarters , he said the sand will be pumped into a slurry tank and stored until it is needed for another beach experiment , he added about three years ago dr bruno joined in forming the alliance for coastal engineering at stevens from maine to florida , every state has some coastal engineering agency attached to the state , but in new jersey we have nothing , he said we provide no money in the budget and finance beach restoration through bond issues , and as a result there is no research none photo in an effort to understand the forces that grind away new jersey s shorelines , a 120foot beach has been built up at one end of a 320foot water tank at the davison laboratory at the stevens institute of technology in hoboken dr michael s bruno , the director , is overseeing the project \( william e sauro the new york times \)

you grew up with rockandroll and remember when elvis was king , the beatles were fab and michael jackson was in grade school but increasingly you 've noticed signs of advancing years as unmistakable as crow s feet and love handles you 're hooked on the delta blues of robert johnson instead of the rock of jane s addiction , and worry that phil collins and genesis are speaking for you when they title an album we ca n't dance you watch the older stars on vh1 more than the young turks on mtv you recognize a rap song , when you do , by the james brown tune it samples , not the rapper and you 're genuinely interested in how dick clark keeps his youthful looks take a deep breath you 're having a mid rock crisis tom vickers , a 42yearold talent scout for mercury records , says he coined the phrase five years ago after retreating backstage during a concert by an aging superstar when an act you love is on its second encore , he said , and you 're bored out of your mind , then you know you 're having a midrock crisis but the midrock crisis is more than boredom on a personal level , it s the realization that , while you still think of yourself as hip , you would not know a dramarama from a teenage fanclub and do n't particularly care culturally , it is the inevitable confusion that results from the fact that rockandroll , a style born of youthful rebellion , now loosely defines music that can appeal to anyone from 6 to 60 cosmically , it is what may keep rockandroll from making a great leap forward , until the retro midrockers are too old to have an influence musicians have been facing the midrock crisis for decades mick jagger , now 48 years old , said he did n't want to sing \( i ca n't get no \) satisfaction after he turned 40 \( he changed his mind \) last fall , sting celebrated his 40th birthday by being host to a payperview concert from los angeles for midlife rock fans , there are plenty of indicators of a midrock crisis the proliferation of grammy categories for genres like rap , heavy metal and alternative acknowledges the music of teenage america , while the biggest awards still reflect a middleage sensibility the schedules of outdoor , suburban concerts are peppered with veterans like james taylor and jimmy buffett , whose soldout shows have more to do with their greatest hits than their ability to sell recent recordings such midrock acts have become summer perennials hollywood ca n't stop using songs from the babyboom hit parade to sell movies my girl used the 1965 hit by the temptations for its title , and pretty woman was named after a 1964 roy orbison tune love potion no 9 is currently in production ray charles sings georgia on my mind during the title sequence of the cbs series designing women , and bob seger performs for a pickup truck commercial on the newsstand , rolling stone caters to midrock nostalgia with special issues devoted to the music of each of the past four decades this year rolling stone turns 25 the calendar confirms that the time is ripe for rockandroll to have a midlife crisis in 1994 , it will be 40 years since elvis presley walked into sun studios in memphis , the event sometimes cited as marking the birth of rockandroll the generations that have grown up since then are the first to continue buying new recordings into middle age musicians , record company executives , radio programmers , television producers , managers , critics virtually everybody in the music business grew up with the same record collections , and most instinctively hear new music in the context of older music decades ago , parents could drive their children crazy with the bigband sounds of glenn miller these days , kids and their parents know who put the ram in the ramalamadingdong , sing along with rem and together wonder about michael jackson yet that does n't mean that teenage fans of nirvana are going to get excited about their dad s robbie robertson album for the record industry , the midrock crisis means learning how to market a wide variety of popular music to an increasingly compartmentalized audience babyboom consumers stairway to heaven' revisited a 1990 consumer profile by the recording industry association of american reported that consumers over the age of 35 accounted for 29 percent of the total dollars spent on prerecorded music , compared with 28 percent attributed to buyers under the age of 19 the younger buyers kick off trends and send records to the top of the charts the older consumers buy broadly everything from wynton marsalis to john prine to a cd replacement for the beatles' sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band record companies are recognizing that they must put out albums that appeal to both what are all those midrockers buying \?

even while closed for more than two years of renovation , the solomon r guggenheim museum has been the subject of unceasing speculation so sweeping are the changes its director , thomas krens , has been proposing since 1988 , when he took over this revered institution of 20thcentury art on upper fifth avenue a litany has evolved mr krens will shortchange new york by dispersing its artistic treasures throughout branches of the guggenheim he is obsessed with dealmaking and with courting highprofile businessmen , collectors , curators and politicians who can help him pull off those deals the museum has become more about money , power and prestige than about art now the renovations are done well , almost done , since money ran out before the auditorium could be completed the guggenheim spent roughly 60 million for the museum and for a warehouse with conservation studios on the west side of manhattan with the warehouse the formerly cramped museum is now able to consolidate its holdings at three locations and eliminate five storage sites it has been renting the new museum opens to the public a week from today , and the litany of speculation will begin to give way to reality it is far too early to reach a final verdict , but certain facts are becoming clear and they should allay some worries far from abandoning new york , the expanded guggenheim will have a vastly greater presence in the city than before bigger is n't necessarily better , but in this case , it can only mean an improvement mr krens has made the enlargement and exhibition of the permanent collection his top priority at a time when other museum directors are only slowly realizing the economic wisdom and necessity of this approach overseeing the renovation of frank lloyd wright s building and the addition of new galleries , designed by gwathmey , siegel associates , mr krens has also demonstrated a sensitivity to architecture and an awareness of the need for diverse kinds of spaces for displaying modern works , particularly from the postwar era these are encouraging signs , although they hardly wipe away all reservations troubling questions persist about the financial repercussions of the expansion and about exhibition plans the emphasis in forthcoming shows on familiar names and mainstream movements fuels the charge that mr krens is interested above all in size and power it is noteworthy that educational programs have yet to be developed at the guggenheim first , the expansion the painstaking refurbishment of wright s spiral masterpiece and the construction of an annex has nearly tripled , to 80 , 000 square feet , the space available for exhibition and added the sort of tall , straightwalled , flatfloored galleries that the guggenheim desperately needed those new spaces pose problems the narrowness of the annex means that elevators cut into the galleries , and none of the rooms are uncomplicated spaces in which to display art but the changes are a good thing at an institution that could heretofore put on view the tiniest fraction of its more than 6 , 000 works , which include some of the great paintings by mondrian , kandinsky , dubuffet and many other european masters in a move that should create an even more dynamic change in the cultural life of the city , the museum has rented three floors of a onetime loft building in the heart of soho , at the corner of broadway and prince street the site provides room for offices , a bookstore and a cafe , and an additional 27 , 000 square feet of exhibition space \( more than the whitney museum of american art has \) , designed by the architect arata isozaki the guggenheim thus becomes the first major museum to embrace physically a part of the city that is home to much of the art community the choice of a site diagonally across from the hugely popular dean deluca food store , and the decision to give the prime corner space to the museum s bookstore , may reflect the same marketing instincts that motivates businesses like the gap it s not every museum whose main entrance is through a bookstore but the guggenheim calculates that income from attendance and the bookstore will at least cover the rent , and that the exhibitions and the quality of the galleries justify the means the plan for soho is to emphasize not contemporary but older art , providing a historical context for the new and helping to break down the traditional barrier between uptown museums and downtown artists the exhibitions uptown and downtown slated for the next few years , which include shows of the russian avantgarde , abstraction , italian art of the 1950 s and contemporary german photography , do n't suggest much artistic risk , or attention to lesserknown and unconventional talents the guggenheim insists that these qualities will emerge , although the question is how prominently they will figure in the museum s profile because mr krens seems to want to use exhibitions to entice artists who will donate works to the museum , he may be inclined toward the household names he seeks for the collection moreover , the ability of the museum to pay for its expansion rests partly on attracting large numbers of visitors and that virtually requires blockbusters and bigname artists
