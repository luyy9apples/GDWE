filabusi , zimbabwe , march 13 if this is an outpost of tyranny , it was not immediately obvious in this oneroad backwater buried in zimbabwe s hilly southwest flank in a clearing amid donkey carts , raftershigh scrub and at least 3 , 000 peasants , zimbabwe s sole political opposition leader , morgan tsvangarai , delivered a throwthebumsout harangue aimed at crucial parliamentary elections later this month after 25 years of rule by president robert g mugabe s party , the zimbabwe african national unionpatriotic front , the money you are using presently is as good as old newspapers , he cried the grain silos are full of cobwebs there is no harvest this year it was a civicsbook image of what mr mugabe , 81 , promises for the elections on march 31 , possibly his last as president an honest campaign to rebut accusations that he has devolved into a dictator when mr tsvangarai last campaigned three years ago , governmentrun youth gangs routed supporters with clubs and party members lost homes and even lives to midnight arsonists on this day , the police briefly detained a few slogansinging supporters , but otherwise stood idly by but there is a vast difference between an obviously peaceful election and a fair one and with two weeks left to a potentially defining moment for mr mugabe , there is mounting evidence that the raucous campaigning masks an expansive effort by his party to rig the outcome both independent analysts and members of mr tsvangarai s party , the movement for democratic change , or mdc , cite growing barriers to a fair ballot they say that polling places are scarce in opposition strongholds that two in five enrolled voters are suspect that zimbabwe s vast , mostly antimugabe diaspora is barred from voting that the 8 , 500 election observers are limited to those , like russians and close african allies , who are likely to rubberstamp a government victory most westerners are excluded from witnessing the vote foreign journalists are effectively banned from zimbabwe under threat of arrest \( though many enter the country as tourists \) governmentrun media are heavily biased broadcast interviews with opposition figures mysteriously drown in static there is a dearth of independent judges to rule on election complaints election oversight is split among a bevy of commissions largely staffed with mr mugabe s cronies most important , perhaps , the government controls the biggest incentive to undecided voters the distribution of almost all emergency food in a nation where , agricultural experts say , 4 people in 10 are unsure where to find their next meal given such advantages , they probably believe they have won the election and that creating freer conditions on the immediate eve of the election will not hurt , said reginald matchabahove , chairman of the zimbabwe election support network , a coalition of prodemocracy groups the assumption on mugabe s side is that he will get a twothirds majority in the parliament anyway during a daylong tour of zimbabwe backcountry between bulawayo and harare , the capital , candidates for both zanupf and the opposition were seen beseeching crowds at groceries and liquor stores in the mountainous chromemining region near zvishavane , rival candidates were also seen handing out bags , apparently stuffed with corn , from automobiles plastered with their posters the police were evident , but none interfered with campaigning our campaigns are going freely , said albert ndlovu , the mdc s provincial organizer for mashonaland west , a rural province of 12 million in northcentral zimbabwe there are pockets of violence here and there but generally , we would say it is a bit quiet many here see mr mugabe s loosening of the reins as a calculated gamble by someone supremely confident of victory of the 150 seats in parliament , zanupf holds 98 , including 30 whose occupants are governmentappointed and are not being contested the mdc has a bare 51 seats , down six from the last election to gain control , the party would have to win an additional 25 seats an impossibility , most here say the voter rolls are crucial and contentious a computerized study in january of 100 , 000 registered voters by the freezim support group , a prodemocracy organization , concluded that as many as 2 million of zimbabwe s 56 million registered voters are suspect the group estimates that 800 , 000 voters are dead , 300 , 000 are listed more than once and more than 900 , 000 do not live at their recorded addresses opposition efforts to challenge the lists have proved futile david coltart , an mdc legislator from bulawayo , dispatched supporters housetohouse last month to verify his region s rolls the police arrested them within hours , saying he needed permission for political gatherings armed with a court order , he redeployed the team and they were arrested again the mdc is just losing direction , said margaret , a jobless 28yearold single mother of two in bulawayo who once worked for the zanupf zanupf will regain threequarters of the seats they lost in the 2000 elections , she said one reason , she said , is zimbabweans' reverence for mr mugabe , their liberator from white rule , widespread chaos notwithstanding if your father rapes someone , you do not shun him , she said he s still your father she refused to give her last name yet among many zimbabweans interviewed , the mdc is seen as surging in popularity thousands have swarmed to rallies , even in rural areas long seen as government strongholds , and the government s decision to allow open campaigning has emboldened ordinary people burdened with sclerotic leaders and restless younger underlings , zanupf also is not the welloiled political machine it once was but if this election hinges on anything , many say , it may be food or the lack of it one year ago , mr mugabe ordered the world food program to stop distributing most food aid , stating that zimbabwe was selfsufficient in fact , outside experts agree , the opposite was true but by forcing the world food program to reduce food distribution , the government ensured that the hungry would look to the government for aid , often tied to support of government candidates the national constitutional assembly , a prodemocracy group , reported in february that food was used as a political tool in nearly three out of four districts it surveyed but the government has also courted a powerful backlash by failing to fill the vacuum it created by rejecting international food aid as he stood at in the crowd at the filabusi rally , ngwenya , a 52yearold farmer with seven children who would volunteer only his first name , agreed that this election is first and foremost about food a people s government must first see if people are eating , he said correction march 22 , 2005 , tuesday a frontpage article on friday about the coming parliamentary elections in zimbabwe misspelled the surname of the sole opposition leader he is morgan tsvangirai , not tsvangarai
jo o padilha had been saving money from his work as a restaurant deliveryman outside boston when he heard a tantalizing offer to buy a cleaning franchise marcos martins , a brazilian immigrant like mr padilha , was looking to go into business tri duc nguyen , a vietnamese immigrant in portland , ore , needed a way to make money after fujitsu closed the factory where he worked all three men put thousands of dollars into cleaning franchises and say they were shortchanged as mr padilha retells it , the top boston representative of coverall cleaning concepts said he could make 3 , 000 a month cleaning buildings if he paid 12 , 880 for a franchise what is more , mr padilha says he was told he could easily parlay his investment into a large cleaning business so mr padilha paid the money and was assigned two women s health clinics , in haverhill and newburyport , mass he was told it would take two and a half hours a day to clean the clinics , but it took six hours , he said coverall also gave him two dialysis clinics , and soon he was cleaning and shuttling among clinics from 5 30 pm to 7 am on weekdays , with six more hours on weekends he estimated that he worked 65 hours a week and 280 hours a month but his receipts show that coverall , which handled payments , paid him 1 , 262 a month , less than half what he says he had been promised i was doing all this work , but the check was for very little money , mr padilha said so he went to the director of coverall s boston office to complain when i came in , they said i had no more work , mr padilha said he said the supervisor of one clinic no longer wanted me they took all my work away in one fell swoop i asked for my franchise money back , but they said no it s sad for a man to cry , but i left that room crying , he added mr padilha said he recouped none of his investment and soon learned that mr martins had obtained the franchise to clean the dialysis clinics mr martins said i asked why the person who was doing it before had discontinued the work the field consultant told me the person had gone back to brazil mr martins put 5 , 000 down and promised to pay 306 a month for two years to obtain a franchise that he was told would generate 2 , 000 a month for him he said he cleaned clinics 72 hours a week , about 300 hours a month , but received just 1 , 366 he , too , was , abruptly terminated at the clinics for reasons he says he never understood a dozen franchisees , including mr padilha and mr martins , are suing coverall , charging it with fraud , breach of contract and failing to pay the minimum wage they assert that the company took out improperly large commissions and did not have enough customers to supply franchisees jacqueline vlaming , coverall s general counsel , said that her company had done nothing wrong and that the service employees union had stirred up janitors against it in january , coverall settled a lawsuit in los angeles , for an undisclosed amount , brought by 10 janitors charging it with fraud in franchising ms vlaming said there were no minimum wage violations , asserting that franchisees were not employees we procure commercial cleaning contracts , she said , and we provide them to our franchised owners , who we teach to be in business for themselves coverall was founded in boca raton , fla , in 1983 and says it has 7 , 500 franchisees and 37 , 000 accounts denying mr padilha s assertion , ms vlaming said coverall did not fire franchisees to obtain fees from new ones we do n't churn , she said we do n't have to terminate people to sell franchises it does n't work that way mr nguyen paid 5 , 000 to national maintenance contractors , which assigned him a law firm to clean in downtown portland the work took four hours a day , about 90 hours a month having bought a franchise that was supposed to generate 1 , 800 a month , mr nguyen was upset that he received 932 a month for that work , and when the law firm reduced its floor space , his earnings fell to 755 he said that he asked for more buildings to clean but that national maintenance ignored his calls they wo n't talk to me , he said they do n't keep me informed i feel they 're cheating me mr nguyen and several other janitors complained to the oregon attorney general daniel h rosenhouse , a lawyer with that office , said national maintenance was under investigation for possible minimum wage and overtime violations involving franchises lyle graddon , chairman of national maintenance , which is based in bellevue , wash , said his company had many happy franchisees the wage standards office in washington went through to see if anybody in our company was paid less than the minimum wage , mr graddon said they were all paid considerably more than the minimum wage in 2003 , national maintenance paid 300 , 000 to settle a lawsuit brought by 12 vietnamese and cambodian janitors who accused it of deceptive practices and of not returning their franchising fees after their accounts were canceled as part of the settlement , the company agreed to repay 75 percent of franchising fees if a janitor s account was canceled for reasons other than customer complaints
when adam pascal talks about his career in entertainment , he often knocks on wood i 've been extremely fortunate , he said recently , knocking on a wooden coffee table in his suite at the ritzcarlton in battery park city , where he was promoting the film rent , which opened wednesday i started out playing in a rock band and for a long time did n't feel comfortable calling myself an actor , but after having success in various genres i came to the conclusion that i did n't have to call myself anything my experiences as a musician , an actor and a producer have been extremely validating , and people can call me anything they want and that s ok at 35 , mr pascal still has the boyish good looks and charismatic smile that helped him star as the hivinfected punk rocker roger davis in the 1995 stage version of rent , for which he was nominated for a tony award during the last 10 years he has also had starring roles on broadway in aida and cabaret and a featured part in the film school of rock with jack black mr pascal was also the producer of an off broadway hit , fully committed , and has released two solo albums but unlike many aspiring actors who began by performing in high school plays or winning a solo in the school chorus , mr pascal , who grew up in woodbury \( where his parents still live \) and graduated from syosset high school in 1988 , did neither i was a rock musician , said mr pascal , who sang and played guitar during my years in high school , i was one of the guys who smoked cigarettes in the courtyard , hung out behind geico , where we rode our dirt bikes , and traveled around playing in battles of the bands it was n't until 1995 , after graduating from the new york institute of technology , that mr pascal s outlook began to change he had broken up with his band and was living in new york city when he got a call from a friend and former syosset classmate , idina menzel , who had just landed the role of maureen in a rock opera scheduled to open in the new york theater workshop they were looking for someone to play the part of roger , and she thought of me because i was a rock musician , he said i had never gone on an audition before , but on a lark i decided to do it four auditions later , all held within a week , i got the part it was supposed to be a 10week off broadway run , and since nobody knew where it was going , we all kept our day jobs mine was working as a personal trainer in different gyms throughout new york city the rock opera , based on la boh \? , opened in december 1995 it was set in the east village and revolved around a year in the lives of the artists and struggling youth living there we knew it was something special , mr pascal said but it was n't until we moved to broadway four months later and saw the reaction of the audience that we realized how big this was going to be for four years , eight performances a week , mr pascal played roger on broadway and in london an emotional , demanding and rewarding experience after 'rent , ' i was in a state of limbo and not sure what i wanted to do , he said i still thought of myself as a musician and resisted being identified as an actor but i did n't have much luck with record deals , so i started going out on auditions it was a time of selfdiscovery just as he was about to give up and get a real job , mr pascal said , he landed the starring role in aida , which he played for three and a half years other successes followed , as both a movie actor and a producer in 2003 , when the roundabout theater offered to extend the run of cabaret at studio 54 if mr pascal accepted the lead role of the emcee , he became further committed to his identity as an actor and played that role for 12 weeks since his debut in rent , the original cast members have gone their separate ways many to success in films , tv and theater but mr pascal had kept in touch rumors circulated about recreating the show as a film , but he said he did not have much hope of being part of the plans i heard about several ideas that were on the table including a popstar version by spike lee that was planned to star justin timberlake and christina aguilera but i was not involved , he said when that fell through , i figured that if a film ever got made , i 'd be too old so i was very surprised when i finally got a call that there was actually going to be a movie and they wanted to meet with me the film , which was shot in san francisco , was a reunion for six members of the original cast thankfully , none of us had changed much in nine years , mr pascal said we were so happy to be reunited and realized that ultimately , this film would be the longestlasting legacy of the show mr pascal s career is a source of pride in syosset just ask carole hankin , the superintendent of schools , who has encouraged the expansion of arts programs in the district dr hankin boasts of syosset graduates who succeeded in the entertainment industry , including ms menzel , who won a tony for her role of elphaba in wicked natalie portman , who starred as queen amidala in star wars films judd apatow , who produced and directed the film the 40yearold virgin and scott prisand , a broadway producer of brooklyn the musical and bombay dreams but mr pascal said that of all his roles , the one that has been the most fulfilling is that of husband and father to his two sons , now 4 and 2 in hollywood , nothing is permanent , but this is a role that is forever , he said and what if his children want to become actors \? i would dissuade them , he said emphatically it s an emotionally draining , selfesteemwrecking business but while damaging to the psyche , the fates nudged me in this direction this was my calling , and it s what i'm meant to do photos adam pascal , at far left , is in the film version of rent he was nominated for a tony award for the stage production \( photographs by ozier muhammad the new york times mr pascal and phil bray columbia pictures \)
cleveland like many prominent researchers at the nation s major medical centers , eric j topol , the chief academic officer of the cleveland clinic foundation , has over the years had consulting and financial ties with numerous drug and medical device companies dr topol , an outspoken cardiologist who frequently opines on the medical issues of the day , has done work for drug companies like eli lilly , the medicines company and a partnership of bristolmyers squibb and sanofiaventis recently , however , as he has come under the spotlight for potential conflicts of interest , he said in a letter to one company that he had decided to end most of his relationships to maintain my academic credibility the decision follows a report in december by fortune magazine that dr topol , a leading critic of the painkiller vioxx , was a paid consultant to a hedge fund that had made money betting that shares of merck , vioxx s maker , would fall dr topol severed his ties with that firm , though he said he had no knowledge of the firm s investment position his voluntary move to end most of his corporate ties comes as drug makers find themselves under greater scrutiny for their relationships to researchers at the same time , medical centers are trying to deal with doctors who are increasingly entangled with companies whose primary goal is to make money , not necessarily to deliver the most appropriate care the cleveland clinic , one of the most entrepreneurial and prestigious medical institutions in the country , for one , is struggling to revamp rules intended to ensure that corporate connections do not lead to bias in patient care or academic research but it is far from willing to sever all ties the clinic , a nonprofit health system with nearly 4 billion a year in revenue , has in recent years become the epitome of medicine inc , where doctors and researchers are encouraged to develop new drugs , devices and medical treatments it is hardly alone in confronting these ethical questions but the aggressive and freewheeling capitalist spirit that has taken it to the top of the medical profession has also made conflicts of interest more visible than at many other institutions many of dr topol s colleagues on this sprawling 130acre campus are starting companies and serving as consultants and board members in some cases , they may use their patients in clinical trials to test new treatments in which they have a financial stake all of these financial arrangements with industry yield various kinds of conflicts , said dr jerome p kassirer , a former editor in chief for the new england journal of medicine , who recently wrote a book , on the take \( oxford , 2004 \) , about the undue influence of business on medicine to address those concerns , the cleveland clinic says it is overhauling its ethics policies , and will present them to the board for approval , perhaps within weeks we want to protect data from money , said guy m chisolm iii , a cell biologist who is spearheading the effort money has no role to play in validating and directing data but getting consensus on solutions is no easy matter , dr chisolm said we 've grappled with them , we 've debated them delos m cosgrove , for one , who took over as the clinic s chief executive last october , says he does not believe that acrosstheboard restrictions are desirable what we want to do is encourage innovation , dr cosgrove said there are always going to be conflicts in the world the clinic , even in its new policies , will not prohibit financial relationships that give rise to conflicts most medical centers refuse to take this step because they rely on money from private industry , and they argue that any prohibition on outside business ventures would cause the best researchers to flee to institutions that allow them to profit more from their inventions a few academic centers go as far as preventing researchers from studying a drug or a device from a company in which they have any financial interest harvard medical school , for example , does not allow its researchers to receive significant compensation from serving as consultants or holding equity in private companies if they are studying anything related to those companies but like most institutions , the cleveland clinic is trying to avoid outright bans by asking researchers to disclose their ties and trying to minimize the effect of the conflicts dr mildred k cho , a medical ethicist at stanford university , however , argues that managing conflicts , especially when the institution is itself involved , is unlikely to be very effective , given all the pressures that are pushing in one direction situated in a dismal area of cleveland , the clinic , which was founded by four doctors in 1921 , essentially operates as a gigantic group medical practice it takes immense pride in its delivery of cuttingedge medicine , having pioneered angiography and coronary bypass surgery under the direction of its former chief executive , floyd d loop , also a cardiac surgeon , the clinic amassed more than a dozen hospitals and focused its attention on one of the most profitable areas of medicine cardiac care within the last few years , it has started both a medical school and a venture capital fund called the foundation medical partners , which invests in companies founded both on campus and outside though it sits in a gritty urban center , the medical center fairly gleams with freshness and wealth its paying customers patients with insurance are able to help finance the clinic s constant expansion and renovation our facilities are second to none , boasted michael o'boyle , the system s chief financial officer the institution is now pouring some 500 million 300 million of which is expected to come from charitable donations into a new heart center , intended to showcase the latest in cardiac care and to treat the tens of thousands of heart patients who visit the clinic each year the expansion comes on the heels of the construction of a new stemcell research center all of this display of financial resources has drawn criticism among some in the community that the cleveland clinic has provided very little charity care to patients without insurance it is among a group of hospitals being sued by plaintiffs' lawyers across the country contending that the hospitals violated their obligation as charities by overcharging people without insurance some community leaders have mounted legal challenges to the clinic s moves to exempt certain operations from local taxes the clinic argues that it does its fair share and that any profit goes into areas like research and education we have no shareholders , we have no market capitalization , said mr o'boyle what we make we reinvest the clinic also says the lawsuit is without merit yet the clinic is unabashed in its push to capitalize on the medical expertise of its 1 , 400 doctors to increase its revenue to finance research in 2003 , the clinic says it filed for more patents per research dollar than the mayo clinic , johns hopkins medical center or massachusetts general hospital , the harvardaffiliated boston hospital i think they 're a lot more entrepreneurial than many of the others , said martin d arrick , an analyst with standard poor s , who follows the debt of taxexempt hospitals he praises the cleveland clinic for investing in those areas where it excels they 've followed a strategy of making their core asset shine , and you can see that dr cosgrove is particularly familiar with the interplay between industry and medicine he personally holds nearly 20 patents and developed a new catheter that reduced the number of strokes in patients undergoing heart surgery he also sits on the board of medical device companies like atricure and novare surgical systems and serves as a general partner in the venture fund started by the cleveland clinic the venture fund is independent of the clinic , though the clinic has provided about a third of its financing to date the fund makes its own investment decisions , but the clinic is a special limited partner that receives a share of the profits in return for access to the doctors' expertise dr cosgrove says he does not plan to sever his outside relationships anytime soon unless the clinic s board determines that these relationships are inappropriate i spent 30 years developing relationships with industry , he said i was an inventor and an entrepreneur and asked to be a venture capitalist by the institution similar ties abound at the clinic for example , the venture capital fund has invested in cardiomems , a device company in atlanta started by a clinic doctor the clinic recently started patient studies of an implantable sensor made by cardiomems used in surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm dr topol also served as a consultant to cardiomems atricure , a small cincinnati company making an atrial fibrillation device , has also received financing from the venture fund at the same time , the clinic is conducting a clinical trial of a new atricure treatment and the clinic s atrial fibrillation center often uses atricure products the clinic has also invested in novare surgical systems the first use in the united states of novare s device , an alternative to traditional methods of surgical clamping in beatingheart bypass surgery , was at the clinic dr cosgrove said these kinds of relationships have all been scrutinized by the board , and that he plays no role in any decisions involving the use of devices from these companies there s a difference between being conflicted and the appearance of conflicts , dr cosgrove said but managing the appearance of conflicts , as dr topol learned after fortune magazine revealed his involvement with the hedge fund , can be difficult i think there s a real problem in academics today , dr topol said there s a very closeknit relationship with industry , and it s too close when any individual can derive a profit from that relationship indeed , dr kassirer said it was often quite difficult to discern the subtle factors that affected decisions about patient care research has suggested that doctors who invent a medical device tend to use that device even where there are better alternatives available it has an influence on what you do , he said the cleveland clinic says it is currently reviewing some of the potential conflicts related to its own investments under the clinic s current rules , situations that create the potential for conflict of interest for an individual doctor must be approved by a special committee the proposed policies which would also apply to the clinic s own financial relationships would lower the amount of the financial benefit that would set off a review to 10 , 000 from 25 , 000 , with increased involvement by the clinic s institutional review board , which oversees research involving patients when there are institutional conflicts , including conflicts involving clinic executives , the clinic plans to propose a separate review process that would include members of the clinic s board in recent months , the clinic has had its statisticians or outside specialists review data independently when a study involves a researcher with a potential conflict of interest dr chisolm acknowledges that these strategies are works in progress the question raised by ethicists like dr kassirer and dr cho is whether it can be done effectively , if at all the ideal of handling these conflicts of interest , dr kassirer said , is not to have them at all
chicago , jan 6 with the nation s traditional airlines caught in a dizzying vortex , delta air lines is trying to break away from the pack by switching sides by capping fares and simplifying prices , delta , the nation s thirdlargest carrier , provoked a price war this week , as it became the first big airline to join forces with lowfare players like southwest , jetblue and airtran for consumers , the moves mean good deals for now and more opportunities to take cheap trips without saturday night stayovers and other restrictions they also will mean hundreds of dollars in savings on costly businessclass fares , a relief for many companies trying to save but over the longer run , it could mean fewer choices and the elimination of flights to certain smaller cities it could even force one or more airlines out of the big leagues , with the first casualty most likely to be us airways , which is in bankruptcy for the second time in two years nonetheless , in the last two days , one big airline after another american , a unit of amr united , a unit of ual continental northwest and us airways has hustled to cut fares to the levels set by delta , shaving billions of dollars in badly needed revenue at a time when they have already been making deep cuts in spending and eliminating jobs despite the furor that delta s action has caused , analysts and industry executives say , the move was inevitable it was only a matter of time before a big airline saw the light , said dan mckenzie , the airline industry analyst at smith barney they 've been gouging their best customers , and they ca n't get away with it any more scott d nason , vice president for revenue management at american , said there has been an inexorable drive to lower fares i 'd be lying if i told you i was shocked at delta s action after years of charging whatever they pleased for tickets , particularly for those bought at the last minute , big airlines can no longer escape the pressure to slash fares because of the growing power of lowfare airlines , which now carry a quarter of the nation s travelers , passengers are paying 84 on average for a oneway trip from new york to miami , and just over 200 to fly from new york to san francisco , according to back aviation solutions , an industry consulting firm but the big airlines simply cannot afford to offer such fares without adopting the lowcost model that is the hallmark of companies like southwest , jetblue and airtran not coincidently , all of those airlines made money in 2004 , when the big airlines collectively lost 55 billion , according to analysts' estimates further , they did so by limiting ticket prices to 299 oneway , far less than the 499 oneway cap that delta placed on coachclass fares this week , when it also put a 599 oneway cap on businessclass fares that means more cuts could be in store if the big airlines face what the market is truly demanding , executives at lowfare carriers say maybe they will get more real , the chief executive at jetblue , david g neeleman , said it will put pressure on a lot of folks , that s a given , said laura h wright , chief financial officer at southwest even with the higher caps , delta said it had had an enormous response on wednesday , the first day the fares were available , traffic on its web site rose 300 percent thursday was the single biggest day in the site s history despite all that , major competitors remain unwilling to impose their own fare caps although american , continental , northwest , united and us airways all cut fares on the routes where they compete with delta , none had adopted the fare limits , an indication that they had not accepted the idea of caps we do n't think that s the best thing either for us or our customers , said mr nason at american , which until late wednesday charged 1 , 099 for a oneway ticket bought at the last minute from dallas to la guardia airport that fare is now 699 mr nason said the newest fare battles would only accelerate the need at american and other carriers to step up their costcutting obviously , we were struggling financially before , he said the delta move will make the pressure that much greater ms wright said , to have those caps , you have to have low costs , and that puts a huge discipline on the operation even delta will not escape that cost pressure it came within a few hours of filing for bankruptcy protection last fall , avoiding it only when its pilots agreed to cut their salaries by a third moreover , delta has seen its cash rapidly ebb in the last year , and it is saddled with 20 billion in debt that it has not yet figured out how to restructure but delta , which has been thinking about the fare limits for at least four years , felt forced to act because of the invasion of its markets by lowfare airlines more than 60 percent of its competition on the east coast , in florida and at its atlanta hub comes from lowfare carriers given that , it no longer makes sense for delta to compare itself to the oldline airlines , said paul mateson , a delta senior vice president and the company s chief marketing officer as for forcing its rivals to go along , mr mateson said , the rest of the industry will have to assess what s right for them those airlines are viewing the 70yearold company s step as a betrayal of sorts , as if delta had crossed the playground to join up with the other side , the side that seems to be winning but someday , they too may be forced to cross over that realization is yet another burden for the airlines , which at this point must feel like sisyphus , constantly being crushed every time they try to make progress only a year ago , the companies were optimistic that they would be able to finally post profits in 2004 , but their efforts were stymied by the record climb in jet fuel prices they approached 2005 thinking that their efforts to slash costs , jobs and streamline their operations might finally pay off , only to be faced with delta s initiative , which is likely to make their problems even worse that means more of the cataclysmic upheaval that has racked the industry , said jan k brueckner , professor of economics at the university of california , irvine he went on when have you ever seen such adjustment in such a short period of time \? it s really unusual to witness this day after day
johnsburg , ny finally , american environmentalists have a chance to get it right about wind power news broke this week of plans for the first big wind energy installation in the adirondack park ten towering turbines would sprout on the site of an old garnet mine in this tiny town they 'd be visible from the ski slopes at nearby gore mountain , and they 'd be visible too from the deep wild of the siamese ponds wilderness , one of the loneliest and most beautiful parts of new york s forever wild adirondack forest preserve , the model for a century of american conservation in fact , it would be hard to imagine a place better suited to illustrate the controversy that wind power is causing in this country i know the area well i 've lived most of my adult life in this part of the world , and i 've skied and backpacked through the old mine and the woods around it , searched for \( and found \) lost hunters , encountered its bears and coyotes and fisher , sat on its anonymous peaks and knolls and watched the hawks circle beneath in fact , this very wilderness these yellow birches , the bear that left that berryfilled pile of scat , those particular loons laughing on that particular lake led me to fall in love with the world outdoors which is precisely why i hope those wind turbines rise on the skyline , and as soon as possible the planet faces many environmental challenges , but none of them come close to global warming in the past month new studies have shown that the trigger point for severe climate change may be closer than previously thought , and the possible consequences even more severe just to slow the pace of this rapid warming will require every possible response , from more efficient cars to fewer sprawling suburbs to more trains to well , the list is pretty well endless but wind power is one key component around the world it s the fastest growing source of electric generation , mostly because the technology , unlike solar power , has evolved to the point where it s costcompetitive with fossil fuels the danes already generate nearly a quarter of their power from the breeze the germans and the spaniards and the british are rapidly heading in the same

diany castillo , a 54yearold home health care aide who lives in brooklyn , says she is grateful that the fragmented bits of her past her moves from one state to another , her marriages and her name changes can be found in the vast commercial databases that contain personal information on tens of millions of americans last october , a private investigator in los angeles used those digital bread crumbs to track down ms castillo and send her a letter her estranged daughter , diani ramos , adrift for nearly a decade on the streets of southern california , was looking for her , the letter said the two were reunited in november in the heated debate over privacy rights and the sale of personal information by the datamining industry , the story of ms castillo and ms ramos may represent a contrarian s view but bernard cane , the private detective who found ms castillo , says this kind of happy ending could become much rarer if lawmakers begin to limit access to commercial databases , which can include , among other personal information , social security numbers in many ways , the interests of mr cane and his clients highlight the difficulties in finding a onesizefitsall solution that both protects consumer privacy and makes some information available for tasks like this one how does a doctor do surgery without a scalpel \? mr cane asked you 've got to have the right tools to do a job until now , the sam spade lobby has had surprising success in arguing that civilian investigators , like insurance brokers , employment screeners and other businesses , have a legitimate need for some sensitive consumer information but over the last month , as one company after another first choicepoint , then bank of america and two weeks ago , lexisnexis revealed the loss or theft of millions of bits of sensitive consumer data , americans have been forced to contemplate the vulnerability of their personal information congressional hearings into that vulnerability and into the loosely regulated data trade have already begun and as privacy advocates , federal and state lawmakers and ordinary consumers beat the drum for new regulations on the commercial handling of consumer data , private investigators who are major buyers of personal information from data brokers have been bracing for more scrutiny of their access the digital information available to mr cane and others in his business was greatly enhanced in 1993 , when the federal trade commission made a formal distinction between full credit reports , which are governed by specific rules of access , and the identifying information at the top of a credit report the latter , which is known as the header , includes the person s name , most recent address , date of birth and social security number that distinction allowed credit reporting companies to sell the header information to the growing databrokering industry , which was already amassing dossiers on millions of americans using public information sources like court filings and criminal records the commercial data trove quickly got filled with millions of social security numbers , and the question of just who ought to be able to gain access to those databases has been fiercely debated and haphazardly regulated ever since the federal trade commission permitted a working group formed by several database companies to come up with selfregulating guidelines in 1997 but privacy advocates argue that individual commercial data brokers still decide themselves who is eligible to buy personal information the grammleachbliley act , which went into effect in july 2001 , reversed the credit header rule and prohibited credit reporting agencies from selling that information outside the rules set out by the fair credit reporting act but the law did not clearly address what data brokers and their subscribers could do with the information already in their systems the access now enjoyed by private investigators troubles privacy advocates we 're concerned generally about accountability in this profession , said chris jay hoofnagle , an associate director for the electronic privacy information center , a digital rights group based in washington mr hoofnagle pointed out that investigators were not licensed in all states , and that in some jurisdictions licensing was a mere formality data brokers could conceivably limit access to investigators in states with robust licensing rules , like california , georgia and new york , but there is little evidence that this is done in practice and other critics have argued that inaccuracies in the databases make them dubious sources for conducting investigations organizations like the privacy rights clearinghouse , for instance , have gathered information on hundreds of cases in which consumers were wrongly denied credit or , worse , wrongly associated with a crime or a debt and still other critics suggest that investigators could get all the information they need the oldfashioned way by hitting the streets , reviewing court records and asking questions without ever having to look at anything like a credit header private investigators using information brokers are simply lazy , said robert ellis smith , editor and publisher of a newsletter , privacy journal they do n't want to do the legwork but kirsti ekeholm , a licensed private investigator based in atlanta , says her profession is too frequently dismissed in just this way investigators with expertise in databases know how to handle information that can often be incomplete or incorrect , she said these records were never designed to be exploited as a commodity to be sold , ms ekeholm said and while it s not possible you ca n't stop private information from being available you can limit how it s sold and limit what industries will have access to it indeed , ms ekeholm is among the many private investigators who have tried to stop big brokers like choicepoint from making even their lesssensitive data widely available , particularly to the general public part of this , of course , is simple turf protection for their business but ms ekeholm also argues that her industry shares the public s concerns over privacy , and that licensed investigators are trained to know how to protect it the pi industry gets a black eye in all this , ms ekeholm said but we have just as much interest in protecting privacy as anyone else i do n't want my information readily available to just anyone several past congressional efforts have sought to limit that availability across the board including to investigators but so far none has emerged from committee in such cases and in numerous negotiations with the federal trade commission , privacy advocates and state and federal legislators the national council of investigation and security services , a trade group representing civilian investigators , has mounted vigorous campaigns to stifle new regulations but major security gaffes at companies like choicepoint , which was fooled by thieves masquerading as legitimate subscribers , might make things considerably tougher for the industry this legislative session one of our strongest arguments has been that we are vetted , said bruce hulme , a private investigator in new york city and chairman of the trade group s legislative committee and if choicepoint and others do not properly vet their customers , then we 're all in trouble one bill introduced in january by senator dianne feinstein , democrat of california , would require companies to notify consumers when breaches of security occur it has won support from the investigators' lobby but another of senator feinstein s bills , the privacy act of 2005 , is opposed by investigators because it would limit access to all kinds of information that they use every day including the credit headers , mr hulme said and if that happens , investigators insist , reunions like that between ms ramos and her mother would become a much rarer thing in an interview , ms ramos explained how , at the age of 18 , suffering from an abusive past , clinical depression and a mental fog induced by an antipsychotic drug , she left her family , which was then living in fort myers , fla , and headed to california , seeking what she called a better life she did not find it instead , she says , she drifted for years between halfway houses , shelters and the streets in compton , hollywood , bell gardens and , finally , san diego during her time in california , ms ramos said , she was raped , robbed and jailed , and by last fall , she wanted desperately to go home but after nine years , all ties to her family back in florida had evaporated phone numbers were long forgotten and , in her troubled mind , even names and places had become sketchy in a strange twist , ms ramos reached out to the privacy rights clearinghouse in san diego for help she had become convinced wrongly that her identity had been appropriated by thieves the group put ms ramos in touch with certified investigative professionals , a membership organization in santa monica , which then put her in touch with mr cane ms ramos recalled names and middle names that her mother used diany , ziani , janet she had surnames , married and maiden , but the spellings varied , and were only guessed at phonetically pechouka , or pacheco , she thought or mourra and there was the street in fort myers where they had once lived seminole street the information turned up thousands of possible leads and duplicate names , mr cane said but as he narrowed the field , it was his ability to view social security numbers that allowed him to link various records associated with ms castillo , even as her name and location changed the process took about two weeks , mr cane said he did not charge ms ramos given the holes in the information , it might have taken six months to a year without the header information , mr cane said i 'd have had to retain folks , do background records searches on the ground , flown back and forth to florida if new legislation were to force such globetrotting , mr cane said , he could not afford to do it and neither could the justice system , which , he says , relies more heavily on private investigators using the data bazaar than anyone wants to admit i do n't want to find a new vocation , mr cane said but if they knock any more teeth out of my tiger , i'm going to have to retire my tiger
houston , nov 14 unexpectedly warm weather has bathed much of the united states in recent weeks , but fears persist that a classic energy shock may be unfolding as the nation heads into winter this time , though , the coming squeeze is in natural gas rather than oil executives at companies that consume large amounts of natural gas are warning almost screaming about the costs they expect to face over the coming months our monthly natural gas bill has doubled since august , from 700 , 000 to 14 million , said fletcher steele , president of pine hall brick in winstonsalem , nc mr steele said he planned to shut half of his production in january , when natural gas prices are expected to resume climbing again because of cold weather it is a problem that has been building for several years thanks to a huge buildup of naturalgasfired electricity plants in the 1990 s even as exploration has slowed , demand has outstripped supply the nation now depends on natural gas for 24 percent of its energy requirements , compared with 23 percent for coal and 40 percent for oil the threat of higher prices and potential shortages has led to a showdown over the most ambitious push to expand domestic drilling since the 1970 s the energy industry and major consumers of natural gas have been aggressively pushing congress to open areas for exploration while they have been rebuffed so far republican leaders in the house were forced to pull back on a budget bill that would have opened the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska and coastal waters off several other states to drilling energy suppliers are expected to keep pounding at the door the dispute over expanding drilling is related to the fierce opposition from environmentalists , real estate investors and residents of areas where the industry would like to put operations intended to increase imports of natural gas in the meantime , higher prices for the fuel are rippling through the economy and with more than half of the nation s homes heated by natural gas , millions of americans are already bracing for big price increases this winter the energy information administration recently predicted that the cost of heating a typical home with natural gas could rise by more than 40 percent in coming months , or an average of 306 a household at the same time , officials are warning businesses that they face possible disruptions in the natural gas supply in some states this winter under longestablished rules , utilities will give the highest priority to supplying natural gas to homes , possibly cutting off some companies and forcing some manufacturers to turn to other energy sources beyond the fear of supply disruptions , higher natural gas prices have stoked concern of price increases cascading through the economy , with the most recent monthly inflation gauge at 12 percent in september , the largest increase in a quartercentury the united states now has the highest natural gas prices of any industrial country , surpassing those in germany , the netherlands and china the prices have been pulling back from a posthurricane spike in october that sent them above 14 per thousand cubic feet , but they remain at unusually high levels , with the futures contract for december closing at 1161 on monday only three years ago , during a glut , natural gas was selling for as little as 2 per thousand cubic feet high prices are inflicting pain across the country , hitting hard at utilities in the mountain states , grain elevators in the midwest and chemical manufacturers along the gulf coast announcements of job losses in energyintensive industries are mounting for instance , lyondell chemical of houston said last month that it was shutting a foam chemicals plant in lake charles , la , cutting about 280 jobs the reason was higher energy costs , the company said , though lyondell also cited damage from hurricane rita other companies unable to pass all their higher natural gas costs to customers are starting to announce big losses for example , cms energy , michigan s largest natural gas utility , reported a 263 million loss this month the hurricanes made a bad situation worse the american chemistry council estimates that 100 , 000 jobs at companies that rely largely on natural gas have been lost since prices for the fuel began climbing in 2000 chemical companies have been particularly outspoken in calls for the bush administration and congress to focus on curbing consumption and repairing energy infrastructure in the gulf of mexico we need to declare a national crisis , andrew n liveris , the chief executive of the dow chemical company , said in recent testimony before the senate dow , the nation s largest chemical maker , has shut 23 plants in the united states in the last three years in places like somerset , nj south charleston , wva and elizabethtown , ky , as it shifted production to kuwait , argentina , malaysia and germany , where natural gas is cheaper call it demand destruction , mr liveris said dozens of plants around the country have closed their doors and gone away , and are never coming back the bush administration has begun to urge conservation , in moves that draw comparisons to president jimmy carter s calls in the late 1970 s to don a sweater and turn down the thermostat but as officials contemplate further action , the energy industry is stepping ahead with plans of its own longcontemplated projects have come back to life , including a 20 billion pipeline to bring gas from alaska to the lower 48 states and a 3 billion pipeline to transport rocky mountain gas to big cities beyond the lobbying to overturn drilling bans off coastlines , the industry is redoubling its efforts to overcome objections to importing large amounts of natural gas from countries in the middle east , africa and asia some of these projects might eventually materialize , but none quickly enough to bring natural gas prices down substantially before this winter still , the proposals are part of a major push by the energy industry to raise imports and overturn decades of environmental limits on domestic exploration if greater offshore drilling were allowed , we could move up by 50 percent to 100 percent of current production , a lot in natural gas , claimed john f hofmeister , president of the shell oil company in the united states the current supply shortage results mainly from production disruptions in the gulf of mexico , where nearly 40 percent of output remains shut but it has also revealed two disturbing trends disappointing production elsewhere in the united states and an inadequate imports via pipeline from canada wildcatters are frenetically trying to drill as much as possible in parts of the rocky mountain west , but these efforts have produced severe bottlenecks as companies have flooded the bureau of land management with a 30 percent increase in drilling applications over last year the result has been a backlog of two months or more for approval of hundreds of projects some companies that rely on natural gas to generate electricity are , meanwhile , scrambling to find substitutes , creating greater demand for coal , fuel oil and even wind energy prices for coal from the powder river basin of wyoming have almost doubled since september , to about 1950 a ton from 10 a ton , and railroads there are under strain to take more coal from the area and in colorado , the windenergy customers of one denver utility , xcel energy , will be paying about 10 less on average per month than customers who buy electricity made from natural gas the surge in prices is repositioning the debate over whether greater imports of natural gas are needed some officials , most notably alan greenspan , the departing chairman of the federal reserve , have warned repeatedly over the last two years about the risks of a supply shock because of too much reliance on domestic production our limited capacity to import liquefied natural gas effectively restricts our access to the world s abundant supplies of natural gas , mr greenspan said in june 2003 if north american natural gas markets are to function with the flexibility exhibited by oil , unlimited access to the vast world reserves of gas is required the united states currently has five terminals for importing natural gas regulators have approved the construction of eight more all but one are planned in coastal areas of louisiana and texas that are prone to hurricanes rooted in fears over accidents or terroristinduced explosions , opposition to terminal projects in other parts of the country raises the possibility that the united states might lose access to natural gas sources to other nations where governments can easily override local objections in china , for instance , officials in beijing recently determined that the country would build 10 lng terminals , paving the way for china to compete for natural gas reserves in asia and russia the scramble for those resources , of course , is less immediate than fears of a prolonged cold snap in the months ahead william poole , president of the federal reserve bank of st louis , said recently that natural gas prices were the biggest shortterm risk to the economy if we have a cold winter , mr poole said with the typical reserve of central bankers , we may find ourselves with an unpleasant crunch
washington as president bush traveled around the country last week , he got caught up in a battle of women women mothers and widows of men killed in iraq were the most vocal leaders of antiwar protests in texas , idaho and utah that dogged mr bush all week another woman , tammy pruett , whose husband and five sons have served in iraq , was showcased by the white house as a prowar counterpoint the tableau was a striking change from the 1960 s protests against the vietnam war , when the demonstrations were largely led by young men , who were subject to the draft although mothers protested that war too , they were not in the forefront of the movement what happened in 40 years \? how has that changed how the white house responds \? in interviews last week , some of the female protesters suggested that decades of feminism had pushed them more easily into leadership and public speaking roles in the antiwar vigils inspired by cindy sheehan , the mother of a slain soldier , who is demanding to meet with mr bush in a protest outside his ranch but they also viewed the war through the traditional prism of mothers and wives , and said that women felt the pain of loss more intensely than men there s a certain ferocity in motherhood , said celeste zappala of philadelphia , a cofounder of ms sheehan s antiwar group , gold star families for peace , and the mother of sgt sherwood baker , a national guardsman sergeant baker was killed in baghdad in april 2004 while protecting the iraq survey group , which was searching for large unconventional weapons ms zappala , who protested against the vietnam war in college and was a main speaker at an antiwar demonstration in salt lake city on monday , added maybe women feel more compelled , more empowered maybe it s because men in our country do n't speak so easily about things that are personal and so hard jean prewitt of birmingham , ala , whose son , pvt kelley prewitt , died in iraq in april 2003 , said her former husband , kelley s father , went back to work soon after their son died i was just a basket case , she said , adding that we gave birth to these boys , and they did n't ms prewitt said she voted for mr bush in 2000 and initially supported the war , but turned against it after no unconventional weapons were found the first year i was rather numb , and then i got angry , she said ms sheehan and the other protesters are financed in part by antiwar organizations and advised by fenton communications , a public relations firm based in washington that counts advocacy groups like moveonorg and truemajority among its clients they resent it , the protesters said , when their opponents call them agents of the left i may be a grieving mother , but i'm not stupid , said ms zappala , who runs a city program for the elderly in philadelphia no one has to tell me what to say and if people help me amplify myself , god bless them at the texas white house , ms sheehan s protests have been closely watched , and the mood there is one of concern but not yet alarm mr bush has been careful not to go on a direct attack against a publicly grieving mother like ms sheehan , and has pointed out that he met with her once already , in 2004 , and that he has sympathy for her and her right to protest still , he said last week that protesters like her were weakening the united states and emboldening terrorists , and vowed that he would not immediately withdraw all american troops from iraq , as she has demanded then , in an effort to counter the protesting women with one of their own , mr bush told 9 , 500 military families in a speech in nampa , idaho , about ms pruett , who has four sons serving in the national guard in iraq and a husband and another son who have returned from iraq america lives in freedom because of families like the pruetts , mr bush said , to big applause in a telephone interview on friday from her home in pocatello , idaho , ms pruett said that the white house learned of her story through two programs on cnn this past weekend , a picture of mr bush hugging ms pruett was at the top of the home page of the white house web site ms sheehan s supporters immediately pointed out that while there are mothers who have lost children in iraq who still support the president , ms pruett had lost none and should not be compared with them actually , i would agree with them completely , ms pruett said i have not experienced what they experienced , and i would n't judge how they chose to express their grief will ms sheehan s movement spread \? the historian doris kearns goodwin , whose son , lt joseph k goodwin , served with the first armored division in baghdad , said that it was too soon to judge , and that much depended on what happened in iraq over the next weeks but if more mothers and more women connect to the losses over there , it could move like wildfire across the country , ms goodwin said ms goodwin said that as hard as it was for the white house to respond to the women , it was harder to be the commanderinchief responsible for the losses , something she learned from conversations with lyndon johnson after vietnam he said he would wake up in the middle of the night worrying about what had happened to the bombs and who had died , she said it s an emotional thing for these guys , as much as we think they 're stalwarts as for mr bush , she said , i suspect he s asking himself , 'why did n't i just meet with her in the beginning ' of her summer protest white house letter correction september 1 , 2005 , thursday the white house letter column on monday , about the prominent role of women in the debate over the iraq war , incorrectly summarized comments by president bush about cindy sheehan s protest he said that an immediate withdrawal of american troops , as advocated by such protests , would weaken the united states and embolden terrorists he did not say that protesters like ms sheehan were themselves weakening the united states and emboldening terrorists
hartford , may 13 the execution of michael bruce ross is an aberration that is unlikely to lead to more executions in new england or the rest of the northeast , several death penalty experts said before mr ross , 45 , died by lethal injection early friday after forgoing appeals , no inmate had been executed in new england since 1960 several experts , including death penalty opponents , said in interviews this week that his case was too distinctive and extreme to accelerate other death penalty cases or increase the acceptance of capital punishment in one of the nation s more liberal regions it strikes me that the first person executed in new england in however many decades is a white serial killer who wanted to die , said michael a mello , a former capital defense lawyer and now a professor at vermont law school in a sense it s a perfect storm although mr ross s mental competency came into question because of his decision to abandon his appeals , professor mello said his case lacked other elements often used to fight execution , such as questions of innocence or racial bias mr ross , a 1981 graduate of cornell university and a former life insurance salesman , was arrested on murder charges in 1984 he eventually confessed to strangling eight girls and young women and raping most of them in the early 1980 s last year , after the state supreme court affirmed his death sentence , he decided to forgo further appeals he 'll become the benchmark , the yardstick against which to measure other cases , and very , very few other cases will match up , professor mello said the number of death row inmates is declining across the northeast , though not because inmates are being executed connecticut and new hampshire are the two states in new england that have the death penalty , and only connecticut has inmates waiting on death row six inmates remain there new hampshire s last execution was in 1939 elsewhere in the northeast , pennsylvania is the only state that has executed anyone since a 1976 united states supreme court ruling that allowed executions to resume the three inmates executed in pennsylvania since then had also decided to forgo appeals pennsylvania has 220 death row inmates , down from more than 250 several years ago , according to susan e mcnaughton , press secretary for the pennsylvania department of corrections the decline has resulted from some inmates winning new sentences , some being exonerated and some dying naturally , she said the governor is definitely signing death warrants for individuals , said ms mcnaughton , noting that gov edward g rendell , a democrat , had signed 35 death warrants since 2003 it s just that at one stage or another in the court process they are getting stayed no one has been executed in pennsylvania since 1999 and no executions are pending , she said none have been scheduled elsewhere in the northeast last june , new york s highest court found unconstitutional a central provision of the state s death penalty law last month , democrats in the state assembly blocked efforts to rewrite the law the state has two inmates on death row in new jersey , a state appeals court ruled in february that the state had to change the rules for how it carries out executions last year , the state had 13 people on death row now it has 11 , after the sentences of two inmates were reduced to life , a department of corrections spokesman said the last time an inmate was executed in new york was in 1963 , when two men were electrocuted the same year , new jersey conducted its last execution , also by electrocution richard c dieter , executive director of the death penalty information center in washington , which compiles statistics about the death penalty and argues that it is unjustly applied , said the only inmates executed in the northeast have been socalled volunteers i think in the end if someone wants to be executed , the precedent in state and federal court is that these generally go forward , barring total incompetency , which is a very high bar to reach , he said another connecticut death row inmate , sedrick cobb , recently wrote to a superior court judge saying that he wanted to forgo his appeals , a development first reported by the hartford courant but a lawyer who has represented mr cobb , david s golub , said that he continued to represent him and that the letter did not reflect mr cobb s true legal strategy mr cobb , who is black , was sentenced to death in 1991 for kidnapping , raping and killing a 23yearold white woman in waterbury in 1989 mr cobb , now 43 , has said before that he wants to forgo appeals , then changed his mind sedrick cobb is not a volunteer , mr golub said sedrick cobb is fighting his death sentence i'm not commenting on the letter sedrick cobb s death sentence is going to be overturned mr golub noted a recent poll by quinnipiac university that showed 59 percent of voters in connecticut support the death penalty but prefer life in prison without parole over capital punishment by 49to37 percent in the case of mr ross , however , 70 percent of voters in the same poll supported the death penalty support for the death penalty may be down but support for executing ross is way up , mr golub said he s very unlikable mr golub is among many death penalty opponents who believe mr ross s execution inside the prison at somers could prompt a fresh debate in connecticut , in part because mr ross will no longer be the focus but gov m jodi rell , a republican , has said she will veto any bill that repeals the death penalty lawmakers in both parties say a debate will not occur during the current legislative session , which ends in june michael p lawlor , a democrat from east haven who is the cochair of the judiciary committee in the house , said connecticut is not likely to see another execution any time soon , no matter what changes are made in state laws only volunteers , he said for involuntary executions in connecticut the waiting time could be 35 to 40 years representative lawrence f cafero jr , a republican from norwalk who is the deputy house minority leader , said the execution may mute rather than stoke debate life will go on and people will sleep better in connecticut knowing that for heinous crimes there s a penalty that will be carried out , he said it might take forever , but it will be carried out
connecticut coach jim calhoun , rarely noted for his modesty , proudly brags that his national title team last season was the best that college basketball had seen since the 1996 kentucky wildcats unfortunately for the current huskies , that is the standard they must live up to this year calhoun reacted to connecticut s 6662 victory georgetown last night in the quarterfinals of the big east tournament as if it were a 20point loss i think we played one of our poorer games , muttered calhoun , who was most disappointed that his team allowed georgetown to shoot 48 percent from the field the lackluster outing marked a stark change for the huskies , who have won 7 consecutive games and 10 of their last 11 uconn teams have made a habit of peaking in march , a result of a full season of being prodded by calhoun s bostontinged growl last night , however , the huskies \( 226 \) nearly squandered a 12point lead in the second half they escaped when georgetown s ashanti cook missed a scoretying jump shot with four seconds remaining denham brown sealed the game with 2 free throws with 15 seconds remaining in the semifinals tonight , connecticut will face syracuse , which routed rutgers , 8157 in last week s regularseason finale , connecticut whipped the orange , 8870 if georgetown had won , it likely would have sealed a bid to the ncaa tournament instead , the hoyas \( 1712 \) will have to sweat out the announcement of the tournament field on sunday i think we showed tonight that we can play with any team in the country , georgetown coach john thompson iii said while connecticut looked mortal , it managed to continue the program s stellar lateseason play in the last two seasons , the huskies have been 131 after march 1 over the past four seasons , they have gone 226 over that span connecticut , 30 this month , has won 18 of its past 21 big east tournament games none of that mattered to calhoun it s the first time we 've played so loose , he said , i mean , collectively , defensively and offensively , in probably a month the only good news for connecticut yesterday came from the return of its leading scorer , rashad anderson , for his first game since feb 7 anderson was hospitalized with a skin abscess on his leg that temporarily put him in intensive care and threatened his life anderson , who lost more than 15 pounds during the ordeal , entered the game early in the first half and got an assist on a marcus williams 3pointer on his first touch of the basketball anderson played 11 minutes and finished the game with 3 assists and 2 steals calhoun joked that he was happy that he even got to yell at anderson for getting beaten on a backdoor cut he 'll come back tomorrow and be ready to play at least as many minutes , if not more , calhoun said and if we 're fortunate enough to keep on going , and into postseason play , i'm sure he 'll have something to say about our success the linchpin of connecticut s success through its run of strong play before last night had been the strong play of williams , a sophomore point guard he entered the game tied for the nation s lead in assists with 8 a game williams finished with 10 assists and 14 points but calhoun still said that williams played poorly and blamed him for the team s lack of intensity the freshman rudy gay led the huskies with 17 points , although he missed the front end of a oneandone that could have sealed the game with 251 seconds left still , gay hit 7 of his 11 shots from the field and was 2 of 3 from 3point range calhoun said that gay s 6foot9 frame , combined with his athleticism , could end up making him one of the elite players who have played for him but kind words were hard to find last night , when calhoun said the best thing to come out of the game was a chance to play tonight we did win , calhoun conceded and that s what the idea is , to advance rebounds hakim warrick scored of 17 of his 23 points in the first half to lead syracuse to its victory over rutgers quincy douby led rutgers with 14 points

the bloomberg administration won approval of a new seventhgrade promotion policy last night during a contentious meeting at the department of education s lower manhattan headquarters , where the panel for educational policy voted in favor of holding back seventh graders who fail citywide english tests starting next year although three members of the panel were absent and two abstained , a resolution to adopt new promotion standards for seventh graders received eight votes one more than needed to win approval but before the vote , several protesters in the audience stood and , with scarves tied around their mouths , turned their backs to the panel during the approximately 15 minutes allowed for public comment , several other people criticized education officials for tying students' promotion to success on standardized tests others said that the new policy placed undue blame on students for what is , ultimately , the system s failure to educate but none of those objections compared to the avalanche of complaints that followed mayor michael r bloomberg s first announcement of tougher promotion rules for third graders in early 2004 back then , the panel for educational policy threatened to veto the plan mr bloomberg won approval only after he fired two of his appointees to the panel and the staten island borough president dismissed a third during a presentation about the promotions standards for seventhgraders last night , the city s deputy chancellor for teaching and learning , carmen fari a , told a roomful of parents and teachers that the administration s promotion rules introduced during the past two years for third and fifth graders had produced a tremendous amount of achievement in fact , the administration s policies to end socalled social promotion in the lower grades have meant that fewer children have been held back , not more , mainly because of intense and expensive remedial efforts it s time to do the same thing for middle school students so they can be successful in high school , ms fari a said she added that the initiative was not about punishment but about being prepared mr bloomberg first vowed in may to take on the issue of poor performance in junior high school after fewer students passed the state s eighthgrade reading test than in last year fewer than a third of the city s eighth graders were reading at or above grade level , according to the most recent scores the administration has pledged 40 million toward intervention efforts for the middle grades , including , ms fari a said last night , saturday classes , organizational and study skills workshops for students , counseling for parents of adolescents , and more teacher training if we do not do this , we are dooming students to fail in high school , she said once new state math requirements take effect during the school year 20067 , promotions for seventh graders will be tied to scores on both of the city s standardized reading and math tests
los angeles , jan 21 a phantom oil slick floating somewhere along a 90mile stretch of southern california coastline is killing sea life as investigators scramble to find its whereabouts and origins more than 700 seabirds have died , another 700 are under care , and at least one sea lion has been taken to a marine mammal center , officials say scientists were unaware that a killer blob was at sea until birds started turning up a week ago on the shoreline from santa barbara to venice beach most of the birds affected have been western grebes , though a few are rare pelicans the coast guard has conducted an aerial search of the shoreline , and oil samples have been taken from the birds and shipped to laboratories for analysis still , officials are flummoxed we have n't been able to eliminate anything , said dana michaels , a spokeswoman for the california department of fish and game we 've got a fullcourtpress investigation going , even things that sound silly on the surface among the possible sources that investigators are looking into are pipes broken during the la conchita mudslide that killed 10 people last week , leaking oil platforms in the ocean , seepage from the seafloor , abandoned oil wells , runoff from the los angeles metropolis , even cars and trucks that slid into the ocean during the torrential rains that recently pummeled california officials have found no large concentrations of oil offshore , and there has been nothing like a grounding of an oil tanker nor have there been any reports of leaking or distressed vessels at sea after the rain subsided last weekend , aerial surveillance did spot at least two dozen small patches of oil off the shoreline but investigators do not think those isolated patches could have harmed so many animals at last count , 733 birds had died , and 686 were convalescing at the los angeles oiled bird care and education center in the san pedro district , which abuts the busy los angeles harbor in addition , 13 endangered brown pelicans had been taken to sea world in san diego for treatment but all that is almost certainly not the final toll biologists believe that as many as 5 , 000 birds may have been harmed , said ms michaels , the fish and game spokeswoman whatever the case , the phantom spill s damage to wildlife makes it the worst since a spill off the orange county coast in 1990 killed about 3 , 400 birds a photograph this week showed an oil patch floating on the water near platform holly , one of 21 oilproducing platforms off the coast of santa barbara , ventura and orange counties but inspectors found no malfunctions by any of the rigs none of the oil can be attributed to platform holly , said ellen faurotdaniels , oil spill program supervisor for the california coastal commission offshore drilling is a politically and environmentally delicate issue in california , where oil companies are pushing to develop 36 undeveloped tracts off the coast the companies' leases on those tracts have been extended by the federal government and are due for review in coming months by the coastal commission
washington , june 22 david grosh was living the mellow life of an offseason lifeguard in rehoboth beach , del , when his childhood friend michael scanlon called from washington in 2001 with a proposition want to be head of an international corporation \? mr grosh said mr scanlon asked him , almost in jest i was like , sure , mr grosh said collecting less than 2 , 500 , he became director of the american international center , which used his rental beach house as its official address i was not really taking it seriously four years later , mr grosh , 36 , wearing jeans and sideburns , recounted that tale before the senate indian affairs committee , as part of its inquiry into jack abramoff , the highrolling republican lobbyist the senate panel and a federal task force are investigating whether mr abramoff defrauded several indian tribes while charging them more than 80 million in fees and expenses to promote their gambling interests the rehoboth center , purportedly a think tank , turned out to be one of several nonprofit groups used by mr abramoff and mr scanlon , his business partner , to funnel money from the tribes to themselves and to pet projects , according to documents and testimony at the hearing on wednesday , the third on the matter in what they frequently referred to as their gimme five scheme , mr abramoff and mr scanlon repeatedly talked about inflating their billable hours and shifting money between groups a move investigators think was intended to avoid taxes and hide the origins or recipients of the money to pay for travel , personal loans and a friend s political campaigns many of the exchanges were by email , giving senate investigators concrete evidence to release to the public as they continued to build a case against mr abramoff that has been mounting for nearly a year referring to the conservative leader ralph reed , mr abramoff said to mr scanlon 100k to ralph 25k to contributions \( 5k immediately to conservative caucus \) rest gimme five one email message from mr abramoff directed his assistant to pump up scanlon , a reference to padding their billable hours for the choctaws to meet an artificial 150 , 000 monthly target that the tribe testified it had never agreed to in 2001 alone , the choctaws paid 77 million to mr abramoff and mr scanlon for lobbying work but the pair spent just 12 million on the designated projects , keeping the remaining 65 million for gimme five themselves according to the email and witnesses the tribe ultimately paid mr scanlon as much as 15 million , and he gave mr abramoff 5 million in kickbacks , said senator john mccain , republican of arizona and the chairman of the senate committee mr abramoff betrayed a longstanding client , betrayed his colleagues , betrayed his friend , mr mccain said the notes , many dashed off on blackberry devices , showed examples of greed and deceit that even by washington standards are breathtaking , said senator byron l dorgan of north dakota , the leading democrat on the committee i'm past anger and bitterness , nell rogers , the administrative planner for the choctaws , said in her testimony on wednesday it s an extraordinary story of betrayal among the transactions discussed by the senate was a 1 million payment from the choctaws to the national center for public policy research , a nonprofit educational group that organized an overseas trip for representative tom delay of texas , the majority leader , in 2001 amy ridenour , the group s director , said she had agreed that her group would sponsor a trip to england so mr delay could meet members of parliament , but she testified that she learned only later that a lavish golf outing in scotland had been included ms ridenour said she had been misled by mr abramoff , whom she considered a friend for nearly 20 years , as he funneled money through her organization ms ridenour , who testified at length , said mr abramoff first helped her secure the choctaw donation and then instructed her to cut checks to a nonprofit group , the capital athletic foundation , and to a company , nurnberger associates , that he said would do legitimate educational work neither ms ridenour nor officials from the choctaw tribe knew that the foundation was run by mr abramoff , they testified , or that he owed the owner of the nurnberger associates 50 , 000 in unpaid personal loans from his days as a filmmaker the testimony showed in much more detail how closely mr abramoff worked with mr reed , the former head of the christian coalition , who received some money from tribes that participate in casino gambling to run a campaign to shut down rival casinos mr reed , now a candidate for lieutenant governor in georgia , has insisted he did not know he was receiving money from indian gambling entities the panel members remarked that mr abramoff had routed 10 , 000 from the choctaws to mr reed s campaign fund for chairman of the georgia republican party , without the tribe s knowledge mr abramoff also appeared to have a closer working relationship with grover g norquist , the head of americans for tax reform , than had been known the lobbyist refers more than once to payments made by the indian tribes to mr norquist s group in exchange for visits to the white house last year grover set a meeting for certain select tribal leaders \( coushatta and chitimach were the only ones \) and the speakers of the house of several legislatures to meet with the president in a small meeting for photos , etc , mr abramoff wrote to chris petras , an official from another tribe he represented , the saginaw chippewas , on aug 12 , 2002 the tribes paid for the event \( total cost was 100k for the entire thing , and each tribe put in 50k \) grover has asked me to line up a few tribes to do so again ms rogers , the choctaw official , testified that the tribe had not intended for its payments to go to americans for tax reform to gain white house access , and that in fact no one from the tribe had been part of the visit mr norquist has denied any link between the donations to his group and the west wing visits he organized some of the email and testimony provoked laughter in the hearing room i hate to ask your help with something so silly , but i have been nominated for membership in the cosmos club , which is a very distinguished club in washington , dc , comprised of nobel prize winners , etc , mr abramoff wrote in an email message on sept 15 , 2000 , to rabbi daniel lapin , a prominent social conservative who runs toward tradition , an alliance of jews and evangelical christians problem for me is that most prospective members have received awards and i have received none , mr abramoff wrote i was wondering if you thought it possible that i could put that i have received an award from toward tradition with a sufficiently academic title , perhaps something like scholar of talmudic studies \? in another email message , mr abramoff joked about his listing in the alumni directory for preston gates ellis , his former law firm i'm just surprised i am not under 'dead , disgraced or in jail , ' he wrote in the message , dated june 26 , 2001 the lobbyists under scrutiny did not comment on the hearing on wednesday a phone call to mr scanlon s lawyer was not returned andrew blum , a spokesman for mr abramoff , said in a statement with an ongoing political investigation being directed by the us senate and an investigation at the department of justice , mr abramoff is put into the impossible position of not being able to defend himself in the public arena until the proper authorities have had a chance to review all accusations mr grosh , now an excavator for a construction company , described the american international center as essentially a phantom organization after accepting the post of director to pay off a few bills , mr grosh said he began to grow wary when he heard mr scanlon talk about the rest of his business enterprises mr grosh quit after about five months out of a gut feeling , he said , that if it involved the federal government , indian tribes and gambling , i knew that was headed down the wrong way mr grosh testified that he did little work for the center which paid 15 million to greenberg traurig , mr abramoff s lobbying firm other than to install some computers in his house did you have any board meetings \? mr mccain asked um , i recall one , mr grosh replied how long did that last \? mr mccain continued fifteen minutes , mr grosh said , drawing titters from the room do you recall any business that was discussed at these meetings \? mr mccain said off the top of my head \? mr grosh said no then , he added i'm sure we discussed something
dallas , oct 21 mark cuban has spent so much time pushing boundaries and rattling statusquo thinking that he is nearly numb to the backlash that seems to accompany his every move in nearly six years as the dallas mavericks' owner , cuban has drawn hefty fines from the commissioner s office , curious glances from other owners and acerbic broadsides from columnists and talkshow hosts for his brash style and his selfindulgent involvement as both owner and berfan , cuban has been called irresponsible , foolish , crazy , an immature imp and a bigmouth by now , those labels must sound kind cuban has acquired a new passion and new critics mainly in the blogosphere who have given him a newly derogatory description unpatriotic and unamerican those accusations stem from cuban s role as the executive producer of the war within , a film that depicts the inner struggle of a wouldbe terrorist even for cuban , who practically breathes controversy , this is uncharted territory the film has been in limited release across the country if it is any indication , cuban s nascent moviemaking career will be a lot like his endeavors in pro basketball and technology unconventional and provocative one incensed blogger labeled cuban a jihadist propaganda producer there was one person , or probably two people , that wrote reviews saying this movie should not be made , cuban said the war within tells the story of hassan , a pakistani engineer who after being wrongfully imprisoned , and tortured , for three years by american forces becomes an islamic militant , and is sent to new york as part of a plot to blow up grand central terminal but while living with a friend s family in new jersey , hassan begins to have doubts about his mission he becomes torn between his religious convictions and his personal affections for his friend s family the film does not depict hassan as onedimensionally evil how are we ever going to understand what s going on right now if we do n't see these people as human beings \? the director , joseph castelo , said on the film s web site but in a post9 11 america , not everyone wants to embrace a suicide bomber with a crisis of conscience indeed , according to the screenwriters , no one wanted to produce the film until cuban picked it up an avowed risktaker , cuban was intrigued by the story line but he said he views the film s protagonist through a different lens i do n't think this movie necessarily gave him a conscience , cuban said i think it really portrayed him as a coward but i think what it did do was say that this guy could be the guy next door , the guy sitting next to you on the bus just like we hear about friends of the btk killer who say , 'we never knew' or timothy mcveigh s friends so it was n't my sympathy for the guy because there was none but it was to say terrorists do n't come in turbans with long beards , talking crazy they 're the person next door it is the softer depiction of hassan that makes the movie both compelling and controversial , cuban said you had to catch yourself on what you were thinking about this guy , he said some people try to look at it from the terrorist s side but i look at it from the american side it s a compliment to people who came over from the same circumstances , living the american dream , and not wavering at all not all of cuban s productions through his companies hdnet films and 2929 entertainment will be so heavy , or so controversial among his next offerings is a dramatic comedy , one last thing but clearly , cuban is drawn to challenging works hdnet s first film was the critically acclaimed documentary enron the smartest guys in the room his company also coproduced george clooney s good night , and good luck cuban first read the war script two years ago , while the horror of 9 11 was still fresh i thought it was timely , i thought it was interesting , i thought it was scary as hell , cuban said i'm the type that thinks if you do n't learn from history , you 're doomed to repeat it although the movie has not done much business in theaters , cuban is looking forward to its release on dvd in january contrary to the views of his critics , cuban said making the film was an act of patriotism the worst thing we can do is bury our heads in the sand and pretend it ca n't happen again , cuban said 'the war within , ' even though it did n't do well at the box office , on dvd it s going to be reminding people for years to come because it s a powerful , powerful movie if we can make a movie that reminds people over and over again that you always have to be vigilant or 9 11 can happen again , then it s the most patriotic thing i could ever possibly do
in new york , 2001 was a year to remember for the young and politically savvy that year , newly imposed term limits flushed out most of the city council , and recent changes in the city s campaignfinance regulations meant that candidates could receive windfalls in public financing in the years since , young people have become more visible than ever in city politics , whether forced by term limits to seek higher office \( gifford miller , 35 , is a prime example \) , or encouraged by the vacuum of power to seek election the tide is so powerful that the staff employees of many former council members have run for council seats themselves , among them jessica lappin , 30 , and gur tsabar , 32 , both former aides to mr miller \( in tuesday s primary , she won , he lost \) running for office at a young age is never easy candidates are typically struggling to establish themselves in a career , and invariably face the easy contempt of rivals who run campaign ads calling them inexperienced code for too young nevertheless , making it through these trials seems to be an early qualifier for high office a 2003 study by the eagleton institute of politics at rutgers found that roughly half of all governors , united states senators and members of congress held their first electoral office before the age of 35 the study also found that politicians under 35 are overwhelmingly male \( as are elected leaders in general \) , that 81 percent of them are white and that 29 percent have relatives who are or were in politics theodore roosevelt , elected to the state assembly at 24 , is perhaps the most famous of new york s early bloomers , but recent history provides more examples of prominent politicians who started young senator charles e schumer won an assembly seat at 23 , and representatives anthony d weiner and vito j fossella were first elected to the city council at 27 and 29 , respectively and there is a generation of even younger political mavens for such people , some of whom juggle two or even three volunteer positions , the campaign season is like catnip they spent this summer cheerfully handing out leaflets on street corners , and toiling in musty campaign offices amid cups of stale coffee here are three of these youngest of young turks robert reilly the sort of young man who refers to congressman fossella as vito if the tiny world of staten island republican politics were a family , robert reilly would be its adored baby in 1993 , while his mother volunteered for rudolph w giuliani s second mayoral campaign , robert , then 9 years old , used to sit in a corner of richmond county republican club headquarters , coloring and playing with ninja turtles sometimes , he recalled , staffers asked him to carry envelopes or do other such tasks they 'd give me little jobs that made me feel important later , when an uncle was gravely ill , mr reilly s parents used to stop at headquarters on their way to the hospital , leaving their son in the care of powerful island political figures like vito fossella , now a congressman everyone in politics watched out for me , mr reilly said according to his mother , mary reilly , it was this early and intense proximity to campaigns , rather than her admitted love of politics , that sparked mr reilly s political interest naturally i encouraged him , she said , but i never felt that i influenced him i exposed him to politics , just as my husband and i exposed him to baseball \( both influences took mr reilly is now a diehard yankees fan \) as he got older , mr reilly s family grew more involved with the republican party his mother became first vice chairwoman of the republican county committee his father , who owns a billing agency for hospitals , began letting candidates use his automatic dialer to make campaign calls his bayside office , with its multiple phone lines , has served as a callin point for republican poll watchers since 2000 the son , 22 and broadshouldered , with a dark crew cut and thick eyebrows , is today the very model of a connected young staten island republican , down to the way he refers to mr fossella familiarly as vito mr reilly has volunteered for so many campaigns that he distinguishes between those with which he was heavily involved \( nine \) and those in which he merely lent a hand \( too many to count \) he attended both of george w bush s presidential inaugurations , and spent so much time at last year s republican national convention that he stayed in a manhattan hotel all week , to be closer to the action at madison square garden despite his passion for the minutiae of government , mr reilly sometimes seems embarrassed about talking politics in front of people who do n't quite share his passion for delegate counts and judgeship contests this was apparent one recent afternoon when he and two friends were having lunch in a diner in grasmere , the sort of place where the three had eaten so often that none of them needed to look at the menu he keeps it at home with his mom , danielle fischetti , who had accompanied him to the last inauguration , said of mr reilly s passion for politics when he s hanging out with us , he s not thinking about work mr reilly would agree with this assessment if he s with his friends , he said , it s all about the yankees and what girl s cute but he does n't need much encouragement to climb aboard a political hobbyhorse when mr reilly describes his personal politics , he cites issues high on every islander s list of irritants overdevelopment , too few express buses off the island , high tolls on the verrazanonarrows bridge this is a bridge that they told us would n't be charged for once it was paid for , he said politicians should have stepped in when the mta raised the tolls again after lunch , sitting behind a desk at his father s company , where he is rotating through the departments to learn the ropes , mr reilly was even more voluble of police salaries , he said our cops get , what , 28 \? and we 're the biggest city in the world as for term limits you lost a lot of institutional memory there were people who did n't know where the bathroom was for mr reilly , there is a particular pungency to any discussion of term limits as a senior at st francis college in brooklyn , from which he graduated this year with a degree in political science , he wrote his thesis on the subject of the city s limits \( new york city term limits and their effects on policymaking in the city council \) while doing research , he figured out that up to 39 of the 51 council members might have to give up their seats in 2009 , leaving him an opening to run \( he will be 26 \) among other things , such a move would please his mother my mother loves politics , he said , and i 'd probably want her to be my campaign manager meanwhile , though , he has had trouble finding offices to seek there s not a lot of seats in staten island to run for , he admitted in 2000 he decided to pursue a seat on his community school board , and had collected 500 signatures when the state legislature postponed the election and eventually dissolved the board i was kind of disappointed , he confessed when you 're going for yourself , it s different you 're more of a maniac sophie waskow the sort of child who played 'office' rather than 'house' in the family playroom her shoulderlength red curls bouncing behind her , sophie waskow hurried down a long corridor in the woolworth building and entered an office out of which councilwoman eva s moskowitz was running her campaign for borough president \( ms moskowitz ended up coming in second , to assemblyman scott stringer \) she was greeted by a storm of cooing from six young women , all of them campaign staffers , and none of whom had seen ms waskow since she left for vacation a month earlier your skirt looks great , one said another added your hair looks shorter did you cut it \? a third woman chimed in with gentle irony , girls' club ! despite this youngersister treatment , ms waskow , 20 , had probably been associated with ms moskowitz longer than anyone in the room since age 15 , she has spent nearly all her summers working for the councilwoman over the summer of 2004 , she served as ms moskowitz s constituent liaison , in charge of wrangling with balky agencies and consoling distraught east siders and this past summer , she coordinated the recruitment and deployment of 75 volunteers for ms moskowitz s petitioning process , a job that regularly involved 12 and 14hour workdays the other day , over coffee in an upper west side diner , ms waskow described with relish the trials of her job as liaison the constituents call in and say , 'there s a pothole' i would say , 'ok , where s the pothole \? ' and then you send letters to the appropriate agencies and then you send the constituent a letter saying , 'dear bob , here s what i 've done' and then , a couple of weeks later , you follow up with the agency and they 've lost the letter , and you fax it over ms waskow , the daughter of a technology consultant and a high school librarian and currently a junior at brown , was the sort of child who played office rather than house in the family s basement playroom , and she adapted easily to her first volunteer position with ms moskowitz , at 15 , because , as she put it , i like filing at brearley , the rigorous upper east side girls' school that ms waskow attended through high school , she was class president in both her junior and senior years , and even when on the sidelines found it hard to tamp down her natural desire to organize when the senior class was planning its traditional endofyear pranks , for example in this case , making a mountain of student desks and roping off a cafeteria table with caution tape ms waskow could not resist the urge to coordinate events , even though she was out with a bad cold i was really ill , she said , so i was trying to do things from home ms waskow met ms moskowitz in 2000 , when ms waskow was in the ninth grade , and the newly elected councilwoman spoke at her school ms waskow volunteered that summer and was invited back for the next , when she helped organize a dear neighbor letterwriting campaign for ms moskowitz s reelection bid , in which 500person mailings were sent from supporters to their neighbors she s extraordinarily responsible , and she was so in ninth grade , ms moskowitz recalled i keep thinking that she s graduated college when she was in ninth grade , i thought , 'finally , she s graduated i can hire her full time' and she had to remind me , 'no , i have to go to 10th grade ' typically , having worked at ms moskowitz s office one summer , ms waskow kept returning i do n't really like to do things and then stop them , she said i 've done ballet since i was 3 it is with a certain detached amusement that ms waskow views the budding political operatives , mostly male , who often intern with council members , help with campaigns , and view government jobs as political steppingstones i have n't met many girls who want to run for president , and i have met guys who want to run for senator or president , she said it s not a bad thing that they know what they want to do , but i 'd hope they understand what it is to be behind the scenes before they say , 'i want to run ' and her political goals \? i do n't know what i want to do this weekend , she said , let alone in the year 2009 george espinal he has called 311 so often \( 300 times , he estimates \) that some operators greet him by name on summer evenings in lower inwood , dyckman street is thick with cars headed for the dark , treelined stretch near the marina there , teenage drivers fling open their car doors and park half the night , merengue blaring from their speakers george espinal , an 18yearold dominicanpuerto rican with expressive brown eyes and a shy smile , could easily have passed for one of those drivers he had the requisite goatee , the oversized tshirt , the baggy jeans and the droopy little backpack but as he marched down the street , he was clearly fuming these cars are just like live entertainment systems , mr espinal said in the newsletter he publishes , put out by his block association , friends of payson avenue , mr espinal has printed pictures of the interiors of the cars one of them , a van , was lined with huge speakers , transforming it into a moving boom box noise is without question a serious problem in upper manhattan the rate of calls to the city s 311 number , at 66 per 10 , 000 people annually , is the city s highest but something more than a bunch of noisy teenagers lay behind mr espinal s irritation heading down dyckman street , he ticked off a list of small crimes that , in his opinion , worsen the quality of life in his corner of inwood there are the men smoking marijuana on the sidewalk , unmolested by the police \( god forbid a kid runs into them what kind of example are they setting \? \) there are the illegal sidewalk barbecues and garbage cans full of household trash \( think about if everyone did that \) that phrase , think about if everyone did that , is mr espinal s mantra in a laissezfaire neighborhood where children play basketball in the middle of the sidewalk and women sell fruit juice from makeshift stands , he stands for order and neighborhood spirit despite his youth , mr espinal clearly aspires to be his neighborhood s unofficial leader he runs a block association , administers an internet chat group for his neighbors , serves with the auxiliary police and has organized a series of drives to clean up inwood hill park he has called 311 so often \( 300 times , he estimates \) that some operators greet him by name and he gets results on his block alone , he has gotten two trash cans installed , successfully petitioned the city s department of transportation to install a speed bump , and persuaded the department of sanitation to make sure people clean up after their dogs , resulting in a wave of summonses that angered some neighbors \( my stepfather got mad and said , 'you should n't be complaining , ' he recalled \) mr espinal comes from difficult family circumstances his father has been in federal prison for involvement in a cartheft scheme since mr espinal was 3 , and his mother , who lives in kingsbridge in the bronx and suffers from epilepsy and crippling anxiety , cannot work her former husband , mr espinal s stepfather , still lives in inwood , and mr espinal uses his house as a base for his advocacy work , though he spends nights with his mother none of my family members support what i do , he said matteroffactly one day i'm going to gracie mansion on thursday if i told my family about that , they 'd make some idiot remark although the roots of mr espinal s activism may be murky , it has no doubt helped that he can be stubborn as a mule when his mother lived in canarsie , for example , he refused to attend the notoriously violent local high school because he felt unsafe i 'd roam around the neighborhood until school was dismissed , he recalled i 'd look at different houses , have a slice of pizza i was going to prove to them that i was n't going to a school i did n't feel comfortable in he ended up attending washington irving high school near gramercy park , a school he loved so much that during a conversation last june , he was unable to say exactly what day classes ended i do n't care , he insisted i like school i see new people , i learn it s a clean , safe , quiet neighborhood on the beat in inwood , mr espinal keeps a sharp eye on his neighborhood , almost as if he were being paid to do so those people are very clean with their store , he 'll say , pointing to a deli or a female got beat up on that corner \( mr espinal sometimes talks like a police officer , even down to his use of 24hour time let s meet at 1300 hours , he 'll say \) most local politicians know him by name , and many have good things to say about his work george is very visible and vocal , said councilman miguel martinez , who gave mr espinal a citation on sept 4 , honoring his work for his neighborhood it s rare that we see young people involved to the magnitude that george is in his own assessments of local politicians , mr espinal sometimes shows a teenager s impatience they fight over stupid issues , he said during a walk through the neighborhood , gesturing toward a railroad substation , now empty , that sits beside an overpass they 've been talking for four years about making this into a dominican cultural center instead , they 're arguing about jurisdiction mr espinal has just begun his freshman year at john jay college and his last act for inwood left him with mixed emotions last month , he organized a community meeting about the noise produced by cars on dyckman street and the latin club at the marina about 60 residents attended , and for the next two sundays , police officers and parks department staffers closed part of the street to cars since then , mr espinal has heard both praise and muttering i had a lot of applause , he said i got a lot of emails saying , 'george , great job ' but a neighbor who attended the meeting , and did n't know that mr espinal was its organizer , accused the antinoise crusaders of trying to destroy the community she was like , 'oh , because it s spanish music , because of gentrification , the white people are trying to get rid of us , ' he said mr espinal was learning a hard political lesson , surely the first of many his predicament recalled a comment he had made earlier in the summer i'm the bad guy for caring about my community , he said then but i'm also the bad guy if i do drugs so where am i supposed to stand \?

in their second and final debate of the 2005 mayor s race , michael r bloomberg last night belittled his democratic challenger , fernando ferrer , as a serial complainer who lacked serious solutions to improve the public schools , the city s economy or the quality of life in new york mr bloomberg was far more assertive than in their first televised debate on sunday and sought to diminish mr ferrer s credibility but the democratic candidate was equally ferocious about linking mr bloomberg to virtually anything unpopular with at least some new york voters including the iraq war , president bush , school dropout rates , the atlantic yards project in brooklyn , ground zero rebuilding and subway fare increases the mayor , who holds a comfortable lead in the polls , attacked mr ferrer at least eight times during the onehour debate , and with more force than the two times he criticized mr ferrer on sunday democrats saw anxiety in the mayor s parrying , while mr bloomberg s aides said the time had come a week before the election to portray mr ferrer as a nitpicker bereft of ideas for the city s problems he stands for complaining , he stands for identifying problems and never coming up with solutions , mr bloomberg said of mr ferrer five minutes into the debate it s easy to be a critic it s very hard to lead later , the mayor became more specific , arguing that mr ferrer had not solved any major problems when he was bronx borough president or a city councilman though mr ferrer has tried to make high dropout rates a signature issue in his campaign , mr bloomberg scorned his record in improving city schools during his time as a public official , for instance when my opponent had the opportunity to do that , for 19 years while he was in office , he did nothing , mr bloomberg said he did n't even talk about graduation rates until all of a sudden he s running for mayor you ca n't have it both ways mr ferrer after a dramatic pause for effect , one of several he used last night swiftly lashed back by noting that when he was borough president , his office had provided millions of dollars to public schools for computers and other needs he told mr bloomberg that it was beneath you to pass the buck on school dropout rates as they tangled over precise numbers , with mr ferrer saying the dropout rate was 50 percent and the mayor saying that figure was actually the fouryear graduation rate , which has risen to 54 percent he s just making up a number , or he does n't understand , the mayor said of mr ferrer the mayor s direct attacks were a turnabout from sunday s debate , when mr ferrer repeatedly assailed the incumbent and mr bloomberg often shied away from rebuttals but last night , the stakes were higher if sniping and sparring quickly became a staple of the debate , there were also no especially memorable attack lines , and none of the politically jarring blows that mr ferrer was seeking in an effort to damage the mayor or inject momentum into his struggling campaign in the closing days of the race even when each candidate was allowed to ask one question of the other , there were few fireworks mr ferrer challenged the mayor for remarking once that poor new yorkers receive better health care than the wealthy mr bloomberg replied that he was praising highquality care at the city s public hospitals the mayor , meanwhile , tried to pit mr ferrer against the city s major editorial boards , which have endorsed mr bloomberg mr ferrer replied by criticizing the new york times and the new york post but in the final minutes of the debate , mr ferrer tried to pull a surprise by directly challenging the mayor to additional debates mr bloomberg has regarded his challenger as the political equivalent of the flu \( which was briefly discussed last night \) , recognizing the potential threat but ignoring and avoiding it as much as possible i do n't think it s right to avoid debate in this city , mr ferrer said why wo n't you debate anymore this season \? a moment later , turning again to the mayor , he said come on , we 've still got a week to do this mr bloomberg stared stonily ahead throughout this when a wnbctv panel member offered him the chance to respond , he said , having a debate about debates is not a good use of this time mr ferrer sighed slightly and smiled the democratic candidate was by far the more theatrical of the two he drew out the word no a few times , guffawed loudly once , sighed with frustration more than once , raised his tone at points and dripped with sarcasm at others , and looked at the mayor frequently and called him mike yet he did not seem to burn as hot as in the first debate , when he jabbed his fingers in the air at the mayor and took a step or two toward him in some answers both of which actions were tweaked as obnoxious immaturity by the mayor s camp afterwards each candidate spoke a bit of spanish at points as well , in a further attempt to make inroads into the hispanic vote , which could prove crucial on tuesday mr ferrer , who is of puerto rican descent , repeated a favorite phrase of his grandmother as he lambasted mr bloomberg for donating his own money to president bush and other fellow republicans tell me who you walk with , and i 'll tell you who you are , mr ferrer said by way of translation mike , in two languages , you 're a republican mr bloomberg , when asked to say something nice about mr ferrer , called him a great family man and a better spanish speaker , but then added , in spanish , that he was trying to learn the language mr ferrer , for his part , credited the mayor for not worsening racial tensions in the city as a new yorker , i thank you for that the niceties were prompted by the panelists from wnbctv , however for the most part the swatting continued , with each candidate even injecting a dig into their statements of admiration for the other mr ferrer said the mayor had been divisive in other ways , while mr bloomberg when asked if there was a ferrer policy that he respected suggested he could find none he was in a position where he criticized the school system but he never took the opportunity to fix it , mr bloomberg said every child who is in high school today was in elementary and middle school when mr ferrer was borough president , from 1987 to 2001 the debate began with questions about the suddenly intensifying ad war between the two political camps , as wnbctv which televised the debate , sponsored by the campaign finance board asked mr bloomberg for his reaction to a new , cartoonlike ferrer ad that depicts the mayor stuffing money into president bush s pants i do n't know that comic books are very important in this election , mr bloomberg scoffed we should be talking about real issues pressed if he wanted people to believe or not that he was a republican , since he was a democrat until 2001 and has referred to himself as a liberal , the mayor replied i do n't know if i want them to believe it i believe in some things in the republican party , i believe in some things in the democratic party when he was shown a clip of a bloomberg ad denouncing him as a flipflopper on issues , mr ferrer raised the specter of republican attacks in 2004 against the democratic presidential nominee , john kerry , who was popular in new york sounds to me like an ad that george bush ran against john kerry , mr ferrer said it was one of several times that mr ferrer tried to persuade viewers that the mayor was a bush lackey asked if city hall should be used as a bully pulpit to urge withdrawal of troops from iraq , mr ferrer exclaimed , you bet i do ! and chastised the mayor for once saying that the war was not a local issue mr bloomberg said flatly that withdrawal should be up to the generals , but added that decamping now would mean that new york s fallen service members would have died in vain one new policy difference that emerged clearly last night was over the military recruiting in public schools mr bloomberg said that if businesses could recruit there , so should the military , while mr ferrer said he opposed it because students should focus on preparing for jobs at times mr bloomberg acted as if he were tutoring mr ferrer on managing the city budget , explaining the intricacies of taxing and spending and suggesting a problem in mr ferrer s plan to cut taxes for homeowners while also using tax money to build more lowcost housing you ca n't have it both ways , the mayor said , while committing himself to deliver an increasingly efficient city government that seeks the leastpainful spending cuts he also said he would press ahead with new development projects in a second term , and chastised mr ferrer for being a critic of any grand endeavor that might create jobs i have yet to hear one major development project in this city that my opponent is in favor of , mr bloomberg said mr ferrer entered last night s debate with a rising confidence in his candidacy , aides said despite polls showing him roughly 30 points behind , aides said he believed that his debate performances and the intensifying campaign ad war had posed the first real challenge of the fall to mr bloomberg yet this debate was also mr ferrer s final chance to appear on equal footing on television with the mayor , who has used his personal fortune to help build his lead with unlimited campaign advertising the democratic challenger relentlessly attacked mr bloomberg on sunday , and last night , with a much wider audience expected , he faced far higher stakes it was perhaps his last , best hope to damage the mayor in advance of the election on tuesday freddy ferrer has been outspent , he s been outstrategized , and he s failed to register with voters on the issues , said norman adler , a veteran political consultant in the city these debates are really his only chance to hit back directly against the mayor and try to make a case directly to the voters mr ferrer s goals at this late stage , aides said , were to present himself as a capable and spirited leader in the two debates , portray himself as the democratic standardbearer , and energize his core base of voters hispanics , bronx residents , blacks , the elderly to increase the odds that they will got to the polls on election day
when my family moved to fieldston road in riverdale in 1950 , we were the only chinese on our block the private sylvan neighborhood we called home was nothing like the crowded cities we had fled during the chinese civil war where were all the people \? the entire population in my neighborhood , and across the border into westchester , seemed to live within the confines of their large tudor houses shielded by privet hedges traffic was almost nonexistent , unless you counted the buses that carried students to and from riverdale school for boys , or the fieldston property owners association patrol car that cruised the streets searching for people who did n't look as if they belonged people like us i ca n't say when exactly i knew that we were different for one , there were two kinds of different there was different as in not belonging and there was different as in special it was easy to figure out that i was the first kind of different when the association patrol car stalked me the last few blocks home from school and driver rolled down the window to ask me where i lived , as if i were an interloper but i was the second kind of different special together with my older sister , marcy , as the only nonwhite children at st margaret s parochial school the nuns petted and praised us as cute as a button and later as smart as a whip following their lead , our classmates accepted , indeed embraced us , as fellow students and as friends , though i must confess that i felt singled out different in a bad way when the nuns enjoined us students to be generous with the collection box destined for the poor , starving children of china and my classmates turned around to stare at me , as though i were one of those children likewise , i never knew quite what to say when a neighbor praised me by saying , how well you speak english ! or when a stranger to our neighborhood stopped me to ask , where do you live chinatown \? some children were much more forthright about their prejudices once while walking home from school i was taunted by boys from ps 81 who pulled at the outer corner of their eyes and sang the derogatory ditty ching chong charlie later , my parents told me to ignore them poor things , they did n't know any better , those bullies who hung out at junior s corner on mosholu parkway and who got poor grades , which they could raise , along with their manners , if they just stayed home and studied special was also something i felt when my sisters and i walked the few blocks to our grandfather s house on delafield avenue , also within the purview of fieldston property owners association , for our weekly chineselanguage lesson , taught by his cook , regina on television in those days , chinese men were usually cooks or houseboys who worked for whites but in real life ours anyway it was our paternal grandfather , a former vice president of nationalist china , who had a white bodyguard stationed in a tiny cabin on his property different and special were fairly evenly matched until nainai came from china to stay in 1958 she arrived via havana , where she 'd waited eight years for her american visa my paternal grandmother , my grandfather s first wife , nainai , was a onewoman band , a minichinese cultural revolution we should have suspected a major upheaval in our lives by how scrupulously she surveyed our backyard sandbox almost immediately , chinese vegetables sprouted where we 'd once made our mud pies and sand castles but her horticultural sights did n't stop there they swung round to the front yard and soon my mother s flowerbeds were filled with oblong green heads of bok choy and red round tomatoes she did n't stop at planting vegetables one summer day when i was walking her to the dentist s office she spied , growing along fieldston road under the horse chestnut trees , a green cresslike vegetable that grows in southern china called gow gay nainai discovered that gow gay also grew in riverdale not only along fieldston road but also on the median dividers along the henry hudson parkway in the 50 s , traffic was such that it was possible for my sisters and me to scurry with nainai across the parkway to where her precious gow gay grew with cars whizzing past us she would spend the next halfhour or so an eternity to us placidly gathering her soup greens , while we sat as far away from her as possible , pretending she was n't ours fifty years later , many chineseamericans have moved into neighborhoods in riverdale , westchester and similar areas with the strong current of chineseamericans entering the country s mainstream , what in my childhood was a unique situation is now a matter of course while i applaud pluralism and tolerance , none of the children growing up there now will have the kind of memories i do like the strangely bifurcated cultural experience of watching a venerable chinese granny foraging for gow gay along the henry hudson parkway oped contributor leslie li is the author , most recently , of daughter of heaven a memoir with earthly recipes
london , july 10 a world war ii commemoration on sunday became a show of nostalgia and defiance , while britain s religious leaders held a meeting to help thwart any violence against muslims following thursday s terrorist attacks there were no new leads in the case , although optimism rose briefly for a few hours when police announced that three britons arriving at heathrow airport had been arrested the three were later released without charge in a sign of the authorities' desperation for clues , the police appealed to citizens to hand over any images taken at the sites of the attacks with cameras or cellphones because they might contain crucial information at least 49 people were killed and more than 700 wounded in the attacks on three subway trains and a doubledecker bus , the worst terrorist attack in britain in decades from a balcony at buckingham palace , queen elizabeth ii and her family watched a wartime lancaster bomber drop one million red poppies over a crowd of thousands of veterans thronging the mall in bright sunshine in front of her the commemoration of the ending of world war ii had been arranged months in advance , but it became a display of britain s ambiguous mood part resolve , part nervousness after the terror attacks the terrible thing today is that we do n't know our enemies , said dennis jardine , an 81yearold veteran in a wheelchair outside a memorial service at westminster abbey i knew who my enemy was because we all had our uniforms so what can you really do against it \? while rescue workers toiled deep underground to retrieve bodies from one bombed subway tunnel , the country s most senior christian , jewish and muslim leaders gathered , anxious to head off religious tensions caused by the attacks , which the authorities have said bear the hallmarks of islamic extremists a number of retaliatory acts against britain s muslim population have been reported since the attacks the religious leaders sought to distinguish between islam as a faith and as a label for the terrorists sheik zaki badawi , head of britain s council of mosques and imams , said anyone claiming to commit a crime in the name of religion does not necessarily justify his position in the name of that religion people do things in the name of islam which are totally contrary to islam he was speaking alongside other religious leaders sir jonathan sacks , chief rabbi rowan williams , the anglican archbishop of canterbury cardinal cormac murphyo'connor , the roman catholic archbishop of westminster and david coffey , the moderator of the free churches each took turns to read from a shared statement urging what dr williams called the continuing efforts to build a britain in which different communities including faith communities can flourish side by side at st pancras parish church , close to tavistock square where 13 people died in the thursday bombing of a no30 doubledecker bus , paul hawkins , the vicar , urged 100 congregants to name the people who did these things as criminals and terrorists , but we must not name them as muslims none of the 49 people believed to have been killed have been formally identified under painstaking british procedures , and so there is , so far , no official list of the dead charles clarke , the home secretary , said he was very optimistic that the bombers would be captured but , like other officials , he warned of possible future attacks our fear is , of course , of more attacks until we succeed in tracking down the gang that committed the atrocities that is why the no1 priority has to be the catching of the perpetrators sir john stevens , the former head of the metropolitan police , said in a newspaper interview on sunday that the bombers were almost certainly british i'm afraid there s a sufficient number of people in this country willing to be islamic terrorists that they do n't have to be drafted in from abroad , he said he said the probable suspects would be highly computer literate they will have used the internet to research explosives , chemicals and electronics he said he believed that the suspects would be apparently ordinary british citizens , young men conservatively and cleanly dressed and probably with some higher education they are also willing to kill without mercy and to take a long time in their planning , he said we believe that up to 3 , 000 british born or britishbased people have passed though osama bin laden s training camps over the years , he said plainly , not all went on to become active islamic terrorists back in the uk , but some have the bombings also rippled through the world of arts and entertainment with the inevitable moments of bitter irony and bad taste waterstone s bookshop in london scrambled to cancel print advertisements for incendiary , a new novel written in the form of a letter to mr bin laden by a woman whose husband and son died in a london terrorist attack , the bbc news reported but some of the ads were irretrievable , including posters already hung in the london underground , where three of the four bombs went off  vandalism at new zealand mosques wellington , new zealand , july 10 \( ap \) four mosques were vandalized in northern new zealand overnight sunday , leaving windows smashed and walls splashed with graffiti , the police said they declined to say whether the attacks were linked to the bombings in london on thursday but prime minister helen clark immediately condemned the attacks , linking them to retaliation new zealanders across all communities are horrified by the terrorist attacks in london , which are the work of evil people , she said in a statement but it is wrong to target the muslim community here in retaliation
he was a management consultant who viewed himself as a great strategist he engineered a merger that propelled his secondtier securities firm to the top and then outmaneuvered rivals to stay on top of the firm for eight years but in the end , it is an inability to manage the firm well that is bringing philip j purcell s career at morgan stanley to an ignominious close mr purcell , 61 , announced his retirement on monday , after a weekend board meeting in a letter to employees , he cited the continuing personal attacks on me as having caused a distraction for the firm the bank said mr purcell would step down as soon as the board chose a successor , but no later than the 2006 annual meeting mr purcell has run morgan stanley for eight years , since the firm merged with dean witter discover , the retail brokerage firm that he ran in that time , there has been a succession of presidents it was the replacement of stephan f newhouse as president on march 29 that brought the firm s current turmoil into view in the furor that led to yesterday s announcement , attention focused on personalities and on rival strategic visions should morgan stanley hang on to its underperforming retail operations , as mr purcell wanted \? should it spin off its discover credit card business , something mr purcell endorsed under pressure this spring \? but even as those arguments were playing out , there were indications that morgan stanley had not been well managed in critical situations that had nothing to do with grand strategies the most expensive of those came in the management of the pretrial proceedings of a suit filed by the financier ronald o perelman , who claimed that morgan stanley had been an active participant in a fraud organized by albert j dunlap when mr dunlap was running sunbeam , which led to mr perelman ending up with worthless sunbeam stock morgan stanley did a poor job of complying with requests for evidence , and assured the judge that things had been done that turned out not to have been done at best , it appeared that no one in management was monitoring the performance even as the judge became more and more upset at worst the view taken by mr perelman it appeared that morgan stanley was trying to hide damaging evidence the judge directed the jury hearing the case to assume that morgan stanley was in on the fraud , something the firm denies the verdict , which will be appealed , was for 145 billion , most of it in punitive damages another case emerged last week there the dollar amounts were smaller , but the lack of effective management was similar nasd found that in two cases in 1999 and 2000 morgan stanley underwrote initial offerings for companies in which it owned stakes dating from before the company went public under the rules at the time , morgan stanley had to hold on to those stakes for at least a year after the offering , a fact that was disclosed prominently in the prospectuses but no one seems to have told the traders responsible for the positions of those rules and the shares were sold months earlier than allowed morgan stanley agreed to surrender the profits after regulators discovered the errors one might have expected that the man who had run dean witter a firm that catered to retail investors and that once ran a highly effective advertising campaign emphasizing its devotion to the well being of its customers would be sensitive to public perceptions but in the aftermath of the wall street scandals , while other chief executives were laying low or sounding contrite , mr purcell offered the opinion that i do n't see anything in the settlement that will concern the retail investor about morgan stanley that reference was to a 14 billion settlement by wall street firms concerning violations by research analysts morgan stanley paid 125 million of that , but was rightly proud that none of its analysts were singled out for violations but it was the most prominent firm involved in a practice unknown to the public , which amounted to passing on money from companies to other wall street firms to produce supposedly independent research on those companies william h donaldson , the chairman of the securities and exchange commission , was infuriated and mr purcell quickly apologized on wall street , many things can be forgiven those who make money , and in going out monday , mr purcell pointed to the stock s performance since the merger , he wrote in a letter to employees , our stock price has outperformed the sp 500 nearly threefold and the sp diversified financial index by 50 percent there is no finer firm on wall street when the dust settles , that will remain the one unqualified truth in this debate whether or not morgan stanley deserves to be viewed as the best , it may be that its research arm could use some help , at least when it comes to producing performance statistics from the close of the merger on may 31 , 1997 , through friday , morgan stanley shares , with dividends reinvested , had risen 172 percent , according to calculations using bloomberg data that is nearly three times the performance of the sp 500 , which gained 60 percent contrary to mr purcell s statement , it is not quite as good as the performance of the sp 500 diversified financial index , which was up 173 percent after the discrepancy was pointed out , a morgan spokeswoman said mr purcell had cited the wrong index he meant the sp financial index , a broader group , which bloomberg figures show was up 101 percent in the period against a measure more often cited the american stock exchange broker dealer index morgan has lagged badly that index was up 432 percent perhaps more importantly for mr purcell , most of that good news is years old in fact , his tenure from a stock market performance can be divided into two periods during his first three years , morgan stanley outperformed its competition , rising 256 percent while the amex broker dealer index was up just 202 percent since then , however , morgan stanley investors have lost 24 percent while the index is up 76 percent some of that loss has come in the last couple of months , as the turmoil mounted , with morgan stanley shares losing 10 percent of their value in the period from mr newhouse s ouster through friday yesterday , morgan stanley shares rose 1 , to 5088 , a 2 percent gain mr purcell is not done yet the former mckinsey consultant plans to stay on until the board chooses a successor he said the board is committed to the firm s integrated securities strategy , a reference to keeping the retail operations that some dissidents had wanted to divest even in leaving , mr purcell asserted his control the director leading the search said none of the executives who campaigned against mr purcell would be considered to replace him and on the conference call with analysts , mr purcell took all the questions , with the company s lead director and the head of the search notable for their absence
new rochelle , ny , may 21 for her first time in the last group of an lpga event , paula creamer began with one of her favorite routines before hitting her opening tee shot , she climbed beneath the gallery ropes at wykagyl country club , walked among the spectators and spotted her parents , paul and karen , among the paying crowd as fans murmured at the sight of creamer , she hugged her parents , walked back to the tee and sent her golf ball airborne here we go , guys , paul creamer muttered to observers as his daughter disappeared down the fairway this is where i get stressed eighteenyearold paula creamer , bidding to become the youngest player to win an lpga event since 1952 , shot an evenpar 71 on saturday to trail the leader , christina kim \( 70 \) , by one shot heading into sunday s final round of the sybase classic gloria park \( 71 \) , the 2002 sybase classic champion , and the rookie joo mi kim \( 71 \) were also one stroke behind kim , who was at sixunderpar 207 through three rounds the storylines at wykagyl are plentiful creamer and kim , 21 , grew up a halfhour apart in the san francisco bay area , creamer in pleasanton , calif , and kim in san jose , calif mind you , i'm a couple of years older than her , kim said we had different lifestyles and different kinds of friends back then , just as we do now , but i 've played with her a couple of times i think i know her better than a lot of other tour players out here do despite the proximity of their hometowns , the two could not be more different kim spends part of her round speaking to her golf ball or to anyone who will listen creamer tends to keep her eyes on the fairway when kim hits a good shot , she speaks when she hits a poor shot , she speaks again i'm loud , i'm outlandish , i'm vivacious , bubbly , kim said i 've heard many things said about me , some not so good , but i wo n't repeat those kim did recall one incident during a tournament in canada when a volunteer gave her grief about wearing a kangol hat , a sometimes accouterment of the rapper ll cool j she said , someone tell that girl she has to wear golf clothes she is on a golf course , ' kim said she was a little more oldfashioned everyone is entitled to their own opinion one s opinion may affect how you see things , but i'm not going to say , 'oh my god , they do n't like what i'm wearing' you do n't have to if you do n't like what i'm wearing , look at someone else judging by the guffaws from kim s gallery saturday , people liked her look just fine she interacted with the gallery and kept her ball in play well enough to be in position to record her second lpga victory creamer , though , was tough on herself saturday , despite making four birdies she was cross after four bogeys prevented her from making a move on a day when none of the leaders went low i hit the ball terrible , creamer said i feel like i should be five or six shots better than i am right now , which is hard for me to sit here and say , but it s the truth i feel i'm trying too hard almost at times creamer , who is scheduled to graduate from high school thursday in bradenton , fla , struggled when her ball strayed into the rough on the par5 no 15 , going for the green in two , she pushed her iron shot wide to the right and short after she sculled her third shot over the green , her fourth shot ran past the hole and rolled off the front of the green from there , she failed to get up and down and made a short putt for 6 that was just losing focus and not concentrating on what i had to do , creamer said at that moment , i was probably trying to be too aggressive it was a very long day i lost focus near the end the scorecard shows it i was anxious out there creamer said when that she becomes nervous , she tries to take deep breaths and take her time before hitting shots , but she did not always follow her own advice she made several quick swings that sent her ball off line still , creamer was able to leave the golf course knowing that only one shot separated her from the top of the leader board she said she could picture herself there at the end of sunday s round i feel very prepared , creamer said it s in anybody s hands right now
a masterpiece of indirection and pure visceral thrills , david cronenberg s latest mindblower , a history of violence , is the feelgood , feelbad movie of the year the story of a seemingly average american family almost undone by cataclysmic violence , the film takes place in a surreal and mercilessly brutal land , anytown , usa , that has been repeatedly soaked in blood only to be repeatedly washed clean the great kick of the movie or rather , its great kick in the gut comes from mr cronenberg s refusal to let us indulge in movie violence without paying a price the man wants to make us suffer , exquisitely mr cronenberg also wants us to have a good time , and it s this tension between cinematic pain and pleasure that helps make a history of violence such a sensational moviegoing experience the film , which hinges on an upstanding citizen and reluctant mystery man , tom stall \( brilliantly played by viggo mortensen \) , takes it as an article of faith that we , the multiplex allegiant , have been longreared on the ways and means , giddyups and brutalizing downs of the action movie decades of mainlining blockbusters have , for better or perhaps for worse , inured us to the image of bulletchewed bodies and the poppoppop of phony weapon fire for the contemporary movie connoisseur , film death is now as cheap as it is familiar to which mr cronenberg quietly says , oh , yeah \? loosely adapted by josh olson from the 1997 graphic novel by john wagner and vince locke , the film opens with two men exiting a motel room the younger man \( greg bryk \) is dressed in a tshirt and jeans the older \( stephen mchattie \) wears the black suit of a funeral director and a beelzebub vandyke although it s day , probably morning , each also wears the scowls and sagging expressions of men who have long been hard at work and back to work they go the older man heads to the motel office to check out while the younger drives their latemodel convertible a few dusty yards when the older man returns , he sends the younger one to fetch water they 're almost ready to hit the road , but , first , there is killing to do there is a lot of killing in a history of violence , none more troubling than the first murder , which takes place inside that motel office turned charnel house in its outrageous brutality , this inauguration into the spectacle and entertainment of death signals that mr cronenberg s film is n't the usual bloody cinematic joy ride there is , it soon emerges , nothing usual or routine about a history of violence , which at first plays like a stock genre picture \( or an outtake from pulp fiction \) , only to grow progressively freakier and hairraisingly nasty a master of conflicting , contradictory moods , mr cronenberg has a history of turning genre , particularly horror , inside out and upside down , and he applies his cool intelligence and prodigious craft to the action movie like a french deconstructionist moonlighting as john woo the killers ultimately get theirs , as monsters almost always do in hollywood movies , receiving their villainous comeuppance from a figure of outwardly impeccable rectitude and gentleness tom stall happily married with a sexy , adoring wife , edie \( maria bello \) , and two charming children , the teenage jack \( ashton holmes \) and a towheaded pipsqueak named sarah \( heidi hayes \) , tom runs a diner straight off the yellowing cover of a saturday evening post in a town as cozy and sleepy as one perched on an old studio back lot here , the townsfolk greet one another with a smile and a wave , and youngsters share ice cream sodas like mickey and judy there is n't a walmart or mcdonald s in sight no boardedup storefronts , no toxic waste dumps , no despair , no bums , no bad men although the sign above the front door of stall s promises friendly service , these villains receive something altogether different when they enter the diner early one evening in a furiously paced scene that tears a hole in both the character and the town s pacific facades , mr cronenberg establishes that he can outgun mr woo and then some with a sensationally choreographed shootout the encounter leaves both desperados dead mr cronenberg lingers on one man s ripped away face for a few squirmingly uncomfortable seconds and tom is declared an american hero the media descends in short order as do three men \( including ed harris \) whose sunglasses , black town car and toughguy accents suggest we 're not in kansas \( or hollywood \) anymore , but somewhere north of david lynch s mulholland drive and far west of lars von trier s dogville like both those films , a history of violence explores the myth and meaning of america \( or at least a representative facsimile \) through its dreams , nightmares and compulsive frenzies but where mr lynch invariably imbues the violence in his films with eroticism , mixing in lipstick with the blood , and mr von trier has recently let didacticism get the better of his ideas , mr cronenberg plays it cool he knows that movie violence turns us on we kiss to the bangbang there s something undeniably exciting about tom s heroic actions , so much so that they effectively produce a veritable contact high , first spurring his son to stand up to a bully and , a while later , inspiring some intensely rough sex that will leave his wife covered in abrasions but there is something irredeemable and soulkilling here , too a history of violence might have easily been called a history of america , but it would sell both mr cronenberg s art and his purpose short to reduce this film to an ideology while transparently set in smalltown america \( ontario passing for indiana \) , the sheer unreality of the hamlet initially makes it clear that this story is not taking place in the here and the now , but in a copy of the world that looks would n't you know it a lot like a movie mr cronenberg , a canadian , is taking aim at this country , to be sure but he is also taking aim at our violenceaddicted cinema , those seductive , selfheroicizing selfjustifications we sell to the world perversely , though , the more violent this film becomes in time , the blood flows all the way to philadelphia the more real tom and his family seem he kills , therefore they are that sounds far grimmer or at least more relentlessly grim than this shrewd , agile , often bitingly funny film plays ornamented with ghoulish comedy \( a live bait sign posted at a murder site \) and superbly acted by all the principals , including , in a nice surprise , william hurt , who delivers a beautiful showboat of a performance late in the film , a history of violence finds mr cronenberg at the top of his form few directors working today know more about the erotics of screen violence than this filmmaker , who can make your head spin and your pulse quicken with a single edit fewer directors still bother to acknowledge that the canard it s only a movie is not only an article of bad faith , but also a deceptively comforting one movies , mr cronenberg understands , make meaning they entertain , therefore we are a history of violence is rated r \( under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian \) it has several intense and bloody fight sequences , some adult sex scenes and strong language a history of violence opens today nationwide

volunteer as a college student , she has been active in the republican party she also happens to be one of the biggest mississippibased winners of federal contracts for hurricane katrina recovery efforts to some contract watchdogs , this could be an example of how the federal government responsibly reached out to give a piece of the billions of dollars in federal hurricanerecovery work to a small mississippibased company owned by a latina mrs barbour , 39 , who was born in guatemala but now lives in jackson , miss , is certified by the united states small business administration as a disadvantaged smallbusiness owner but the 64 million in contracts received by her company , alcatec llc , have also elicited questions about possible favoritism federal records show that the company has won at least 10 separate contracts from the federal emergency management agency or the general services administration to install and maintain showers for relief workers and evacuees , to deliver tents , and to provide laundry equipment the most valuable were awarded in september and october without competitive bidding , the records show according to a review of federal contracts awarded since hurricane katrina , her company ranks seventh in total contracts out of 88 mississippibased concerns that have received deals worth 100 , 000 or more this case should be scrutinized to ensure those awards were based on merits and ability to return value to the american taxpayer rather than favoritism to a politically connected contractor , said scott amey , general counsel at the project on government oversight , a nonprofit watchdog group in washington mrs barbour , as well as spokesmen for fema and for governor barbour , all said in interviews tuesday that mrs barbour s family and political links to the republican party and the governor , as well as president bush , did not play a role in her selection for the work the governor had no knowledge whatsoever of rosemary even receiving that contract , said pete smith , mr barbour s press secretary mrs barbour s husband , charles barbour , who is a member of the hinds county board of supervisors in jackson , is the son of governor barbour s oldest brother governor barbour , a former lobbyist in washington and chairman of the republican national committee and a longtime ally of president bush , is part of the extended family , mrs barbour said and the two families see each other on social occasions mrs barbour said she was a delegate to the republican national convention in new york in 2004 and served as the hispanic coordinator for president bush s reelection campaign in mississippi her company , named after her two children , allen and camille , was started in 2000 after she had run a laundry service

where her husband also works as a spokesman and director for special services lt col doril sanders , a spokesman for camp shelby , whose supervisor is mr barbour , said he could not provide any information about the circumstances of the contract award to alcatec mrs barbour said any business she had secured , with camp shelby or fema , had been based on merit we are just a normal business trying to build my american dream , mrs barbour said nicol andrews , a fema spokeswoman , said alcatec had been hired based on a recommendation from the gsa , which tries to award disaster relief work to businesses owned locally or by socially or economically disadvantaged executives the health of the community has a lot to do with how actively involved local businesses are , ms andrews said to date , she said , alcatec has been paid about 750 , 000 for services , none of which to her knowledge has drawn any complaints the showers are at camps set up along the mississippi coast , in communities devastated by hurricane katrina the sign at the entrance of the pass christian camp says the village , est 2005 , but residents say it is more informally known as tent city besides providing the showers themselves , which are set up in an old tractor trailer , the contract with the federal government also involves providing water and power to the showers , which operate each day from 6 am to 10 pm several residents interviewed on tuesday said the showers half designated for women and half for men seemed fine get up and get to work , every day , said anthony jones , 43 , who has been cleaning up debris those showers , you ca n't beat them mrs barbour would not give a specific reply on tuesday to the question of how many employees her company has , saying the number was less than 50 and perhaps fewer than 10 the telephone at her office was answered as quikinternet , a business that mrs barbour says she operates as a franchise out of jackson , miss tommy quattlebaum and ron fears , who were helping to maintain the shower operation at pass christian , said that as far as they knew , none of the staff at the site actually worked for alcatec , but rather were contractors mrs barbour said anyone was welcome to examine her contracts for signs of favoritism none of my contracts , none of my status , none of my certifications from the federal government have been a result of me asking for their help , she said , referring to her husband and the governor
on valentine s night , people stepped in out of the rain and made their way up the stairs to the acorn theater on west 42nd street layers of wet clothing were peeled back to reveal couple after couple , settling in for the shared intimacy of a play about men and women romance was in the air and then the play started the revival of hurlyburly , which is moving to the 37 arts complex , where it begins performances on april 4 , is hard to take your eyes off of , with ethan hawke s slowmotion implosion serving as both spectacle and revelation but with a stage dominated by motormouthed misogynists who seem to think of women as some kind of stairmaster something they might want to exercise on , but not carry on a conversation with it is not a play that screams date night yet there they were , men and women , settled in for three plus hours , staring at atavistic , loathful and idiotic men fairly early in the play , artie , a smalltime entertainment producer in los angeles , finds a homeless waif in the elevator of his building you 're very desperate guys , right \? you can use her , he explains cheerily , bringing her by his pals eddie and mickey s apartment so i figured on my way to the studio , i 'd drop her by you can keep her like a care package , you know the overflowing male bilefest could be seen as a oneoff , an encore production of a west coast setpiece from 1984 that combined show business pathology and men behaving badly except a look around town suggests that male dysfunction is providing much of the dramatic grist in the current season by any fair count , there are a lot more than 12 angry men working the stages of manhattan downtown at the lucille lortel theater , neil labute s fat pig just closed yesterday , having played to ready crowds who queued up to watch a handsome young business executive fall for a woman who is perfect for him , give or take 50 pounds and the intrusive opinions of his socalled pals fat pig delivers a compelling combination of curdled male chauvinism and consuming weakness , all in one messy package romance , which opens on tuesday at the atlantic theater , features jerks of another sort in a broadlydrawn allmale courtroom farce by david mamet as they argue about world peace , homosexuality and religion , they engage in epic namecalling , none of which could possibly be rendered here in april , mr mamet s glengarry glen ross , the bertext of males trapped by their fears and battered by their peers , will be revived at the royale theater and on march 10 , this is how it goes , a play by mr labute starring ben stiller in the middle of an interracial love hate triangle , will begin a run at the public theater so what gives \? is the island of manhattan becoming the theatrical equivalent of the one in lord of the flies , where not only will boys be boys , but they will be unrepentant jerks , displaying a predatory , even mercenary , cruelty \? maybe angry white guys are getting their turn on the stage , after years of dominating the am radio dial true , the men in these plays fall apart in very different ways in fat pig and hurlyburly , they often undermine each other as they array themselves in juxtaposition to women exwives , exgirlfriends romance and glengarry , meanwhile , are more like allmale firefights , where it is kill or be killed but these plays and several others find dramatic purpose and destiny in the darker regions of the male psyche the boorishness and misogyny of the men in these plays seem to be at the core of their identity they are the sum of their pathologies and not their good intentions and rather than being softened or blunted by the intervention of others which is often the case in plays about groups of women those pathologies are stoked to extreme by the very people whom these characters are supposed to view as friends dude , you 're the one who evoked a biblical thing earlier so take a glance at noah all that flood he did n't pair up the apes with the antelopes , right \? it s one of the many laws of nature run with your own kind carter , speaking to his friend tom in the play fat pig , about why he should not be dating a woman who is overweight i think that it could be something that is cycling itself out , mr labute said two of the plays in question were written 20 years ago and now another generation of younger writers is coming along and is nearing the same place there is a lot of interest in seeing the remains of a relationship rather than the blossoming of one , he continued a lot of love stories are a fascinating terrarium of weakness the preponderance of plays that seem willing to examine the underside of the male mind might be seen as a swing of the cultural pendulum now that sex and the city is in syndication and desperate housewives has dominated network competition , perhaps the plays are the male equivalent of a chick flick but women tend to be the ones to buy theater tickets , and yet they have turned out to see works that would seem to confirm their worst nightmares about the men they think they know as a playwright , i have always hoped to give people a window into something they might not normally have an opportunity to see , said david rabe , who wrote hurlyburly they never get to see inside the locker room it sheds a certain light , in part by its extremity in the instance of hurlyburly and fat pig , women are human jewelry at best , used for adornment , or at worst , literal repositories of whatever the men wish to drop in in the mamet plays glengarry and romance women are absent , irrelevant the subject of women might be flicked at in the tumbling , scabrous discourse among the men on the stage , but it is clear that if life is a struggle and it usually is when mr mamet is doing the writing it is a battle fought almost exclusively among men so this broad is always here , you know what i mean \? what is she , a chair \? phil , speaking of donna in hurlyburly a generation ago , hurlyburly and glengarry glen ross exposed men s cruelty and carelessness to shocking effect a new wave of plays has followed , but now a cleareyed look at men in their coarsest state seems less daring something has gone on in the last 20 years that has helped 'hurlyburly , ' mr rabe said it got its share of respect when it came out , but people kept the play at arm s length the current embrace of the play has startled me perhaps , he said , what used to be seen as sort of quirky and aberrant is now seen as commonplace people seem to know that men like this actually exist in the instance of hurlyburly , the male characters bond with one another in toxic ways by sharing drugs , sexual partners and their addled takes on life , while tom , the leading man in fat pig , is a decent sort of guy who succumbs to male vanity and to peer pressure those kinds of characters , that brand of notsofriendly competitiveness , seem less farfetched in the age of reality tv some have suggested half seriously that after years of plays about aids and minorities , plain old white guys had been theatrically marginalized hey , maybe straight white guys are the new minority , said paul rudnick , the playwright who wrote jeffrey and the most fabulous story ever told gay people and women and racial minorities have all had their plays and maybe white men are beleaguered and in need of plays i mean , nobody likes to be left out in the sensitivity sweepstakes which might be , he suggested , why some of the current crop of maleinflected , heterosexual plays deliberately go over the top and stay there it is all so alpha , so cold and unfeeling , mr rudnick said it is a certain form of male vanity to say , 'how awful can i be and still get a date \? ' it is a kind of warrior pride but neil pepe , the artistic director of the atlantic theater company , which was cofounded by mr mamet , said he has not noticed a trend , seismic or otherwise mr pepe is currently directing romance , mr mamet s sprawling human farce played through the prism of warring males in a courtroom from my perspective , he said , the trend is purely coincidental i really do n't see anything larger than that when you are choosing plays , you look for great plays that people want to see , not particular themes the play that we are working on makes fun of some male relationships , but it also has something to say about the justice system , about political correctness , about the peace process what the expletive is that \? a catholic with a volvo the defendant speaking to his attorney , who has identified himself as an episcopalian in the current crop of plays , friendship between men turns out to be a kind of plastic explosive that can blow someone up from a very intimate distance that dynamic takes on added resonance given the fact that a war is on it may , for instance , make audiences more receptive to mr mamet s suggestion in glengarry that the dogeatdog , jobeatman motif was truer than anybody wanted to admit and while it may be a long walk from the theater to national politics , manly men warts and all seem somehow more palatable than they once where men in the audience may feel implicated by what they see , but they may also feel that their boyish shortcomings look like misdemeanors next to the mayhem men wreak on themselves and others during the course of the plays for their part , women may be happy to listen in on men , who for once do not have lockjaw when it comes to their feelings if anything , it is just the opposite once ethan hawke s eddie opens up a vein in hurlyburly , it seems as if he may never stop and though these plays relegate women to secondary or nonexistent roles , do n't expect any feminist protests helen , a woman of a certain size , is nominally a pig in fat pig , but it is clear 10 minutes into the play that she is the only character who has any real claim on humanity the women in hurlyburly are marginalized at every turn , but in the end , it is the bimbo passed around like a bowl of popcorn who seems to have some clarity about who these men really are second prize is a set of steak knives third prize is you 're fired blake , the sales manager in glengarry glen ross even longtime broadway producers whose plays had unusually substantial female characters have no problem with productions driven by the disaffection of males usually , we have 12 angry men sitting on the aisle of various plays , said the producer elizabeth i mccann i think that whatever brings people into what seems like a good night at the theater is worthwhile , although the great playwrights like edward albee , tennessee williams and august wilson tend to write more broadly and managed to nail both genders elaine stritch , who has spent a long career entrancing audiences as well as sitting among them , sees no mystery in the appeal of men working out their issues in front of one i think that anything dramatic about half of the species is bound to be interesting , she said if you count men as interesting , and i certainly do , honey , there s no reason a play about them would not be worth watching
once , visitors to the international swimming hall of fame could walk in the door and step onto the starting block mark spitz dived from to win six of his seven gold medals in the 1972 olympics they could watch clips of his races , see his olympic uniforms and have their pictures taken next to a wax figure that spitz joked looked more like the singer robert goulet but the hall of fame , in fort lauderdale , fla , fell on hard times in recent years its displays were deteriorating , its finances were a shambles and a burglary in december cost it much of its most valuable memorabilia so none other than spitz is stepping in to help as part of a sweeping reorganization designed to save the hall , spitz will become chairman of a new board the legacy of our sport was in jeopardy , spitz said friday in a telephone interview from his home in southern california i think it s time to be past that responsibility , to get something happening in a positive way last year , spitz was one of 20 olympians who were so angry with the state of the hall that they asked to have their memorabilia removed this helped force the resignation of the hall s chief executive , sam freas when the new chief executive , bruce wigo , took over in midmay , he enlisted the help of a corporate turnaround specialist and persuaded the 21member board to resign and give him special authority to appoint a new one that is the kind of drastic move that gets attention in business circles , and luring spitz , whose goldmedal haul made him a national icon , turned heads in the sports world people get old and die , but corporations and nonprofits get a chance at new life , said wigo , the former head of usa water polo and the father of wolf wigo , a threetime olympian in water polo this place is worth saving but convincing spitz , now 55 and a successful businessman , was not automatic spitz has done his share of motivational speaking and corporate appearances , but he has stayed out of sports administration circles and largely avoided olympic politics last year , he made an appearance at the united states olympic swimming trials to support michael phelps s quest to break his record of seven gold medals in an olympic games spitz believed it would help the sport \( phelps ended up with eight medals , six of them gold \) it also readied spitz to lend his name to another cause i think if you had asked me 10 years ago , i might have had a different answer , he said but timing is everything , and all of these things happened now i'm honored that somebody thought that i could help turn this around the hall of fame endured dwindling attendance as its displays grew outdated wigo said its endowment , once 1 million , had shrunk to about 400 , 000 because a lack of fundraising and sponsorship had forced the museum to tap it for everyday expenses when the museum was burglarized last december by a maintenance worker , it seemed to hit rock bottom a suspect was arrested and the memorabilia , which had been sold , was located but under florida law , the museum is required to buy back the merchandise from people who bought it in good faith the museum is in the position of not being able to afford its own items , which include the legendary swimmer johnny weissmuller s olympic medals after wigo became chief executive , he decided to call for help from the sports and business worlds he turned to a longtime friend , dennis carey , a consultant for the executive search firm spencer stuart carey helped recruit a new board for tyco international after a corporate scandal forced out its chief executive during a onehour conference call , carey convinced the hall s directors that they needed to step down he then started working to persuade spitz to lead a new board carey , a former swimmer and a son of a swim coach , will be on the new board i think it s a good thing , said john hendricks , who served on the former board we had lost our way the honorees were upset and they should have been the ceo had lost his credibility hendricks , a double gold medalist for australia in the 1956 olympics , said he was impressed with wigo s and carey s plans for the future , starting with the selection of spitz he would bring a tremendous amount of recognition to the hall , hendricks said he would be a wonderful addition spitz said he wanted to see stiffer standards for selection to the hall , an increase in fundraising and sponsorships and the modernization of the displays to make them interactive and childfriendly this time around , spitz will be far more than a wax figure
tehran , may 24 it is an election as contradictory as iran itself the frontrunner is a pillar of the islamic revolution now cast as the man who can curb the excesses of hardline clerics and improve relations with the country s bogeyman , the united states indeed , this politician , ali akhbar hashemi rafsanjani , a former president and selfstyled freemarketer , cloaks himself in the trappings of a reformist as carefully as he wears his tailored bluegray clerical robes but in an interview , one of a series he is giving to promote his candidacy , mr rafsanjani sounds less than conciliatory he says the united states is not a democracy , and demands that it make the first concession before relations improve like all senior officials , he steadfastly defends iran s right to develop nuclear technology there is only a veneer of democracy in the united states , and we have a real democracy , he said , brushing aside suggestions that iran s election rules unfairly favor the hardliners who control much of the government election laws are so complicated in your country that people have no choice but to vote for one of the candidates who are with one of the two parties mr rafsanjani , 70 , may best embody the absurdities of the election , on june 17 , even if defending iran by attacking the united states is a favorite tactic of any official dodging questions about domestic issues political and social change is so popular that all candidates adopt the vocabulary and style of reform the archconservative mayor of tehran even showed up to register as a candidate in a remarkable , highly fashionable pink shirt yet none of the eight candidates allowed to run want to alter what many here see as their central problem all power rests in the hands of an unaccountable , supreme religious leader who can overrule elected officials at whim hence iranians are expected to avoid the polls with the same zeal with which they flocked to them in the past two elections , when they arrived full of hope that their votes would produce real change this is particularly true given that the guardians council , an unelected watchdog group , first eliminated , then reinstated the main reformist candidate only after the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , appealed to the council to give voters a choice the reinstatement of this reformist , mustafa moin , and of another independent candidate signaled that the fate of any candidate remained in the hands of the ayatollah aside from mr rafsanjani , the remaining candidates hoping to succeed president mohammed khatami include one moderate cleric and four former senior officers in the revolutionary guards , whose loyalty to the supreme leader is unquestionable in this lineup , mr rafsanjani is viewed as a compromise figure the least distasteful conservative to the liberals and the most liberal among the conservatives at times he might be described as the most hated man in iran blamed for ills ranging from corruption to the inability of reformers to push through even mild political change then again , many iranians wonder if his religious and revolutionary credentials might lend him sufficient influence to confront the supreme leader , a friend and rival they would like to see him as president , but they do n't want to vote for him , said nasser hadian , a political scientist one rival candidate , mehdi karoubi , a centrist cleric and former speaker of parliament , laid out mr rafsanjani s past democratic failings in a widely circulated letter he attacked mr rafsanjani for not defending candidates rejected by the guardians council in previous elections , for allowing the intelligence ministry to dabble in the economy , and indirectly for the deaths of dissident intellectuals during his presidency from 1989 to 1997 , killings later traced to intelligence agents aides to mr rafsanjani concede that their candidate sometimes lost confrontations with the conservatives , but suggest this time will be different because he wants to polish his legacy his political stock had fallen so low by 2000 that he failed to win a parliament seat mr rafsanjani believes that we have to provide people with a better life , better education , more welfare , better urban life , and eventually these changes will lead to a bigger change , breaking the obstacle of tradition and the clergy , said mohammad atrianfar , a rafsanjani adviser and editor in chief of the daily shargh mr khatami thought he could do it more directly and that s why he somehow failed the direct approach in iran is n't a very good approach because somehow the government rejects this approach by disqualifying candidates , weakening the parliament and supervising the press the mere fact that mr rafsanjani gave an interview to the new york times his first and has spoken to a few other foreign news organizations is a sign that he seeks to convince voters that his reach stretches far beyond iran the reformists' main props during the past eight years were the crushing election victories that swept mr khatami to power in 1997 and 2001 though he loosened the social climate , supporters were disappointed by constant assaults on civil liberties , like the shuttering of some 100 newspapers ayatollah khamenei , who already controls the military , the judiciary and the staterun television and radio , is suspected of seeking to control the presidency next , after effectively defanging parliament last year by eliminating all reformist candidates a combination of apathy and anger appears particularly rampant among the 66 percent of iran s 70 million people who are under 30 a huge share of the 48 million eligible voters are expected to deny the government its traditional attempt to use a high turnout to argue that all iranians support clerical rule the interior ministry has been issuing veiled threats that any formal boycott attempt would be considered a crime , so iranians avoid the word people are tired of lending a democratic face to this regime , said abdullah momeni , a student leader they do n't think the regime will offer any kind of fundamental change to bring democracy yet mr rafsanjani s camp thinks it can appeal to this constituency mr atrianfar reels off numbers like any ward boss he said about twothirds of iranians wanted some manner of reform , with almost half of them seeking complete constitutional change only 10 percent like the status quo the 10 percent , which others describe as up to seven million hardcore conservative voters , are likely to support mr rafsanjani , not least because he is the main cleric left in the race mr atrianfar suggests that mr rafsanjani can sway some voters in other reformist camps in his hourlong interview on monday evening , held in a stunning former royal palace of pale green marble in downtown tehran , mr rafsanjani did not go so far as to suggest reestablishing ties with washington but after detailing a long list of domestic and regional ills caused by the united states , he ventured that it was time to retire the past it is not a priority for us , but the current state is not reasonable either , he said , repeating the demand he made as president that the first step should be the release of some 11 billion in iranian assets frozen since the american embassy in tehran was seized for 444 days right after the revolution mr rafsanjani is a staunch supporter of iran s developing its nuclear capacity for electric power , medical applications and other uses , but says he opposes nuclear weapons that contrasts with a sermon at a friday prayer in 2001 , however , in which he suggested that just one nuclear bomb could solve the problem of israel s threatening the region with its own nuclear arsenal on social issues , considered a key among the mass of young voters , he says the government should get out of people s private lives even islam says one should not interfere in the private lives of people , he said there is one cornerstone that he would not change the enforcement of the hijab , or headcovering , for all women tehran has been rife with rumors that mr rafsanjani , who holds the religious rank of hojatolislam , one step below ayatollah , would find a way to make hijabs voluntary we are muslims and we enforce islamic law , which is also in our constitution , he said in terms of the economy , mr rafsanjani said he would like to reduce greatly the 44 percent of the economy in public hands \( others put the government s share as high as 85 percent \) recent decisions to overturn contracts signed with turkish companies to improve iran s overburdened cellphone network and run its new international airport were a mistake , he said mr rafsanjani s critics and they are legion accuse him of repeating old themes and note his difficulties in challenging the radicals when president he proved unable to unify the currency exchange rate , for example , and lost several battles with the conservatives over who would serve in his cabinet among voters , discussions after friday prayer in isfahan , south of tehran , produced varied results a retired elementary school teacher said mr rafsanjani was the only candidate who could strengthen the economy , while a young clerical student said eight years was enough and the country needed a younger man reza jaedi , 24 , was slouching through isfahan s main square in a bright yellow shirt , the colorful clothing and his long hair both favorite forms of silent protest i'm not going to vote for anyone because it s just a show , he said this one comes and this one goes and nothing changes
when johannes wieland gave his dance company no name but his own just that , johannes wieland it may have been the only egodriven act of his career more typically , this postmodern choreographer , whose austere dances suggest both physical and psychic violence , operates like a disappearing act mr wieland s small , feisty company will appear at the citigroup theater thursday through saturday in a program featuring two pieces new to new york , artificial and reverse , as well as excerpts from coma , a work in progress mr wieland , still a fluent mover at 37 , will perform in none of them when he does dance , it s usually in a brief solo piece , his actions the equivalent of whispers and shadows , his head shying away from the spectator s gaze in rehearsal and conversation , he is the gentlest of creatures , solicitous of everyone s wellbeing he looks like an ascetic monk in a 15thcentury flemish painting , and his presence is so unemphatic as to be on the verge of vanishing mr wieland s choreography for his group , however , tells a different story the work is obsessive , nakedly so , and that is crucial to its power it s lean and mean , often threatening , usually enigmatic and occasionally bizarre still , though the dances are generally abstract , with an architectural structure that evokes the bauhaus , they are not infernal machines rather , they serve as conduits for emotional atmosphere , revealing contemporary urban life laid bare the perilous landscape , the harsh terms of survival , the repressed feeling about to explode , the unraveling relationships , the numb perseverance the movement vocabulary of these pieces has a ballet base because mr wieland trained as a classical dancer and because ballet is the lingua franca among today s concert dancers but a slew of other modes adds to the picture , such as contact improvisation , in which bodies moving at full throttle cantilever unpredictably off one another to achieve , fleetingly , improbable feats and configurations every move is a metaphor in membrane , when the dancers slither in and out of glossy black windbreakers their own and their partners' , even if the partners are still wearing them the viewer is clearly meant to think of the term second skin and then think further on how such personal armor can be penetrated in a wieland piece , even the d cor is metaphoric time and again , the dancers operate in and around lighted boxes that read easily as cages , cells for solitary confinement or vitrines offering tempting wares for sale \( the dancers keep their faces impassive , which only intensifies their sensuous allure \) mr wieland will tell you his dances are conceptual , sprung from ideas that , he says cavalierly , may be more or less apparent in the outcome the dances tell you that their maker is heavily invested in how things look even mr wieland s most menacing stage pictures remain handsome so here is a choreographer primarily interested in thoughts which are , by definition , invisible and in sights that can be effectively freezeframed contrary to usual choreographic practice , music and motion \( motion , that is , for its own visceral sake \) take second place dance is just my medium , mr wieland concurs a tool a threehour working session on the segments of coma reveals material that seems far from finished mr wieland allows himself to create \( and then modify \) slowly , meditatively , in collaboration with his dancers , keeping every possible option open his aesthetic procrastination is worthy of jerome robbins , who was famous for holding onto myriad variations on a passage before making his final decision but mr wieland has a keen eye and a commitment to his vision that gives his slowly arrivedat choices the air of inevitability a runthrough of the coma segments in the session s last 15 minutes , suddenly looks performanceready physically confident and laden with halfhidden meanings it s vivid , too a passage with splitsecond dressing , stripping and simulated shooting reiterated , then run in retrograde comes across like a raymond chandleresque film noir mr wieland has been something of an escape artist , elusively slipping from one mode to another he was born in germany , where his father was a fourthgeneration physician and his mother came from a musical family \( this dual heritage , he proposes , accounts for his meticulous analytical inclinations on the one hand and his artistic leanings on the other \) he studied dance ballet , primarily in hamburg , then earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in amsterdam his career first took him back to germany and then to lausanne , switzerland , where he was a principal dancer for maurice b jart the yearlong stint with the b jart company was his glory period as a performer , but it was marred by personal problems earlier , over a span of eight months , he had experienced the death of five close relatives , including his father and a sister he thought he had pieced his life together again , but in switzerland , he says , he felt events catch up with him he decided to make a radical change he emigrated to the united states , enrolling at the tisch school of the arts at new york university , where he earned a master of fine arts degree his choreography terse , strange pieces attracted attention even before he graduated in 2002 that same year he formed his company since then , mr wieland s work , performed in newdance spaces , has received positive attention from the new york times , the village voice and dance magazine it generated recognition abroad as well , notably , a kurt jooss prize in 2004 , commemorating that early innovator in modern ballet the award gave mr wieland financial encouragement and the opportunity to show his winning work shift on a program that included two pieces by pina bausch still , despite his gifts and his early acclaim , mr wieland s future remains precarious , as is true for all but the most

milwaukee , june 6 randy johnson had expected so much more from himself by now victories dominance and the highest respect from his new teammates that s what made it so tough for johnson to stand at his locker monday night and talk about his 43 loss to the milwaukee brewers , a mediocre team with a lineup he should have blown away johnson fell behind by 30 early , regrouped in the middle innings while the yankees tied the score with a threerun fourth , but gave up the goahead homer to junior spivey , a former arizona teammate , in the sixth given the feebleness of the yankee offense lately , johnson presumed he had lost the game when spivey s homer landed in the leftfield seats he was right the yankees managed only four hits and lost for the seventh time in eight games after geoff jenkins ran down derek jeter s bid for a gametying double in the ninth i do n't know what to say , other than i'm not pitching as well as i thought i would be at this point in the season , said johnson , 55 with a 407 earned run average i feel things are there , but it s just not happening things are n't happening for the yankees , either they finished the game with none of the egregious fielding or baserunning mistakes they had been making on this trip , but still could n't get a clutch hit when they needed it milwaukee misplays led to two of their three runs , and the yankees went 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position even when milwaukee starter doug davis walked the bases with nobody out in the fifth , the yankees could n't take the lead jorge posada struck out , and jason giambi grounded into a double play after that , no other yankee reached base until the ninth , when bernie williams drew a leadoff walk from reliever derrick turnbow williams advanced to second on a wild pitch , but the yankees could not drive him home robinson cano worked the count full , but struck out swinging on a 95mileanhour fastball tony womack pinchran for williams and stayed put as pinchhitter ruben sierra tapped out to third then jeter sent a liner to deep right toward the line , only to have jenkins reach out and snag it on the run i have no idea what he was doing over there , but he looks like a genius now , said jeter , who had two hits after sitting out two games with a chest cold seven games into this 12game trip , the yankees have won just once and have been outscored by 3519 they sit seven games behind baltimore in the american league east we 're fighting it , no question about it , yankees manager joe torre said about his hitters if i said we were going up there very confident and very relaxed , i 'd be kidding myself we 're just going to have to find ourselves , create a good streak and go with it johnson seeks the same thing though posada praised johnson s stuff his fastball topped out at 98 mph and his slider was much sharper johnson did n't want to hear it he lost , and frustration is n't the most apt term for the way he feels it s beyond that , said johnson , who struck out eight in six innings i expect a lot out of myself i think everybody does i came here to win ballgames for this team , and it has n't happened at the rate i want it to happen why not \? johnson said he could n't remember hitters capitalizing on his mistakes as often as they have this year i do n't think i 've struggled as much with my location , johnson said it s not like i do n't have my stuff i just feel like i'm not getting away with a fastball over the plate , or with a hanging slider they 're getting hit a lot more often johnson trailed only eight pitches into the game , after brady clark s leadoff single and a double down the thirdbase line by jeff cirillo carlos lee singled in another run on the 16th pitch then cirillo s homer leading off the third made it 30 inside pitch kevin brown reported left shoulder soreness from his fall covering first base in the fifth inning sunday it s hurting me enough that i probably should go get it checked , brown said through the team s public relations director , rick cerrone joe torre did not immediately know what tests were planned for brown , but he said chienming wang would fill in if brown could not make his next start , on friday tom gordon described his arm problem as a sore right biceps , but said that he could pitch i think we 've gotten control of it , gordon said in tampa , jaret wright \( strained right shoulder \) played catch from 90 feet he is at least a week away from throwing off a mound
keith b neilson , the owner of an engineering company in mystic , has been fascinated with flying since he was a toddler , and captivated by the exploits of the doolittle raiders since he was a preschooler the first airplane model he built was a b25 , the same kind the raiders took into battle in world war ii , and until he was a teenager he wanted to marry someone who looked like phyllis thaxter , the actress who played the lead female role in thirty seconds over tokyo , about the doolittle raid in 1942 mr neilson has learned his fascination is not unique the greater mystic chamber of commerce will be host to the 2005 doolittle raiders reunion thursday through sunday in groton , new london and mystic mr neilson is chairman of the reunion , which is taking place in new england for the first time hotels in the area are fully booked , and there are people coming from as far away as china and japan dozens of businesses have signed on as sponsors , and it s been difficult keeping track of the people who have volunteered to do everything from set up for book signings to cleaning up after the dinner we 've talked to people from about 30 states who are coming , mr neilson said a year ago , when i first started planning this , i got a call from a woman in michigan who asked where they were going to be she made her reservations immediately , because she wanted to be at the same hotel i never expected it to get this big the chamber has been inundated with requests from groups that want to be host to raiders' functions lt col william p shea , commander of the connecticut national guard 1 , 109th aviation classification repair activity depot in groton , will greet nine raiders who are expected to attend when they arrive on thursday the raiders will be introduced to a unit that was among the first to deploy to the iraq war the opportunity to meet these great americans is just phenomenal , particularly our soldiers , this generation s warriors , getting to meet these soldiers of the greatest generation , colonel shea said the raid , the first american strike against mainland japan in world war ii , is named after the army air forces officer who led it on april 18 , 1942 , thenlt col james h doolittle eighty men in 16 b25 medium bombers flew off the decks of the aircraft carrier hornet , knowing they could not return to the ship because it was not large enough for their planes to land the raiders were supposed to land at an airstrip in china none of them made it there 11 of the fiveman crews bailed out over china when they could not find the airport , one crew crashlanded in a rice paddy , three crashed into the water off the china coast and one landed in the soviet union of the 80 men , three were killed jumping from their aircraft , and eight were captured by the japanese three of them were executed oct 15 of that year thomas g casey , business manager for the doolittle raiders \( 17 still survive \) , said the men entertain proposals from groups around the country that want to be host to the reunion every year , and look not only at the setting but at proposals to use the event for fundraising for a local purpose in connecticut , the reunion is expected to generate 5 , 000 for local scholarships when they sent in their presentation last year , i read it at the reunion in tucson , we looked over the demographics of the community , we looked over the things that they wanted to do , and it was no question about it , it was a 100 percent vote that we would celebrate the 63rd in mystic , mr casey said there were two other programs on the table that were completely dismissed because the mystic offer was so inviting southeastern connecticut is known primarily as a sea services area , for the presence of the naval submarine base in groton and the united states coast guard academy in new london but jeweldeen \( deen \) brown of montville knows firsthand that the navy played an important role in the raid as well he was a radioman on the uss trout , one of two submarines that , along with 15 navy ships , escorted the hornet deep into enemy waters this will be his first opportunity to meet the men he helped to protect most of us had just gone through pearl harbor , and we wanted to hit back , mr brown said doolittle s raiders might not have known it at the time , but every one of us was riding with them in spirit it was a great morale booster for the american people dr walter p doolittle , a preston veterinarian and reunion committee member , who is a distant cousin of the raid s namesake , said while joint services operations are normal today , the doolittle raid was one of the first major collaborations between the army and the navy this is the biggest national event ever to come to groton , dr doolittle said glenn m wilson , director of groton utilities , a sponsor of the event , said he hopes the reunion sparks greater appreciation for the military , particularly this year , when the region is at risk of losing a large part of its economy in the 2005 base closure process some analysts consider the groton submarine base to be at risk richard cole , 89 , colonel doolittle s copilot on that fateful day , was at the february event in groton announcing that the mystic group had been awarded the reunion i had chills when i had the opportunity to introduce deen brown to dick cole , and have in front of me 50plus submarine veterans and world war ii pilots , mr wilson said looking out into that audience , there was n't a dry eye , including the 60some high school kids who were there as one of the high school kids put it , you do n't often get a chance to meet someone who made history bridget a linicus , owner of a stonington insurance company and the reunion administrator , said there will be a combination of public , private and paid events perhaps the most celebrated of the private events will be the goblet ceremony , where the raiders will toast their departed comrades the paid festivities begin with a reception at 6 pm thursday at the city of groton municipal building , which will cost 25 a ticket , and the free public events start friday with an event from 11 30 am to 1 pm at leamy hall on the grounds of the coast guard academy ms linicus said that when she agreed to take the job she expected it be about 15 hours a week it s kind of taken over my life , ms linicus said i'm putting in 35 or 40 hours a week , at least but it s also the most exciting event i have ever worked on people are so thrilled this is happening here information on

chicago in this month of retro baseball , with references to 1959 and 1917 and all those dates in ancient history , the white sox had another blast from the past last night not only did scott podsednik hit a ninthinning home run to give the home team a 76 victory , but the white sox capitalized on some good fortune around home plate , just as they did all the way back on oct 12 of this year once again , only 11 days apart , a decision at home plate helped turn a game around for the white sox make it clear , there is no conspiracy , probably not even rampant ineptitude , just bizarre coincidences here on the south side of chicago maybe it s shoeless joe , said brad ausmus , the quickwitted houston catcher , who is hip enough to appreciate the possibility that the ghost of the disgraced joe jackson from the 1919 black sox team is contributing some poltergeist moments around home plate in the home half of the seventh , after the playing of god bless america and take me out to the ball game , the sox got lucky , just as they had against the angels in the american league championship series this time , a pitch appeared to glance off the bat of jermaine dye of the sox , the ball landing in foul territory dye later admitted that the ball hit his bat , not his hand , saying , i'm not going to tell the ump it was foul the umpire , jeff nelson , ruled that the ball had hit dye s hand , sending him to first base loading the bases with two outs , in fact that brought up memories of what transpired when aj pierzynski more or less stole first base against the angels on oct 12 , right here in sweet home chicago this time paul konerko of the sox hit a grand slam that gave the sox a tworun lead the astros fought back to tie the score in the top of the ninth , but then podsednik connected off brad lidge , the astros' closer talk about blasts from the past it was lidge who surrendered albert pujols s shocking threerun homer to turn the fifth game of the national league championship series the astros survived that , but their fans have to wonder if they can survive this jolt there is nothing deeper afoot here than two strange plays at home plate , for a franchise that has known some pleasant summers but no joyous octobers since 1917 this october is turning nuts statues in grant park are wearing white socks fans wear sox outfits on the red line train or shopping on michigan avenue this sense of destiny at least at home ruined a strong outing by houston s andy pettitte in his selfdeprecating way , pettitte sometimes acts as if he were not one of the central figures in a dynasty that won four world series in five years with the yankees his pal roger clemens , the psychological batman to pettitte s robin , left saturday night s game after only two innings with a tight hamstring , and nobody is sure if he will pitch again this fall , or ever pettitte , now tied for second with 11 world series starts behind whitey ford , who started 22 , was hurt by sloppy fielding but hung on game for six innings andy pettitte pitched exactly as you 'd expect , ausmus said pettitte was gone when the game turned around , the same way the game turned on oct 12 when pierzynski appeared to have struck out for the final out of the ninth inning the angels' thirdstring catcher , josh paul , not exactly game sharp , rolled the ball to the mound without tagging pierzynski , who seemed to divine that the umpire , doug eddings , had ruled the ball had hit the dirt pierzynski , the opportunist , feinted toward the dugout and then dashed to first and was safe joe crede then drove home the pinchrunner with the winning run the angels , scattered all over the world , are still reeling dye did not try to sell being hit on the hand last night i judged by his reaction , ausmus said and what was the reaction \? none , ausmus said dye stepped tentatively toward first base , without wringing his hands or writhing on the ground in pain , the way any good method actor would have done i 'll take my base , dye said later phil garner of the astros came out to argue , but nelson declined to ask the other umpires for help , saying it was his call then konerko made the joint rock with his grand slam the umps make tough calls and they get most of them right , ausmus said dye did not score a run we still could have gotten konerko out in some years , perhaps the astros would have gotten konerko out but this is 2005 , and maybe shoeless joe jackson is out there somewhere , making amends with a jinx highly localized at home plate on the south side sports of the times email geovec nytimescom
wando , south korea after park pil soo s second child was born nine years ago , he followed national family planning entreaties to limit families to two children by undergoing a free , governmentsponsored vasectomy then , in april , mr park took advantage of a new policy , and had the vasectomy reversed , also at the state s expense he and his wife , yang eun hwa , 36 , are now trying to have a third child after decades of promoting smaller families , south korea like several other asian countries facing plummeting birthrates is desperately seeking ways to get people to have more babies in south korea , the decline has been so precipitous that it caught the government off guard policies devised to discourage more than two children , like vasectomies and tubal ligations , were covered under the national health plan until last year this year , the plan began covering reverse procedures for those two operations , as well as care for a couple s third or fourth child i 'd been thinking about getting the operation for a while , but was concerned about the cost , said mr park , 37 , who runs the samsung electronics store in this seaside town on the southern shore of the korean peninsula in south korea , as in japan , taiwan , singapore and hong kong , quick economic growth and social changes have produced disturbingly low birthrates that are transforming their societies and threatening their economic strength in this ethnically homogenous nation , as in japan , there is no support for the kind of immigration that has increased birthrates in some western nations , including the united states in the next two or three years , we wo n't be able to increase the birthrate , said park ha jeong , a director general in the health ministry but we have to stop the decline , or it will be too late young couples in seoul and other cities are choosing to have few babies , but the low birthrate has hit rural places like wando county hardest within less than a decade , it has transformed south korea s rural landscape , shuttering schools , shrinking class sizes , setting off villagewide celebrations for the rare birth of a baby growing up here , park pil soo has watched family sizes shrink to fewer than two children from as many as eight , and wando s population decreases year by year people have grown richer here at his samsung store , residents began buying airconditioners four years ago , and they expect television sets in each room and a refrigerator just for kimchi people now want a higher living standard instead of children , he said , as he and his wife attended to customers on a recent saturday wando s was the first local government to supplement the national health insurance to make reverse vasectomies and tubal ligations entirely free so far , five men and two women have had the surgeries , said hwang dae rae , the county official who came up with the idea and regularly calls the couples to inquire about possible good news \( none has been reported so far \) ms hwang acknowledged that the new policy would not solve the low birthrate problem , which , here and in the rest of asia , is rooted in women s rising social and economic standing in the past , women thought it was their obligation to have children , but not anymore , she said still , she said , the new policy is symbolic of the change in the national government s approach , whose longtime , singleminded focus on small families had put social pressure on south koreans choi hyung soon , 40 , one of the two women to undergo a reverse tubal ligation , now wants a third child after she had had two sons in her 20 s , she underwent a tubal ligation because it seemed the right thing to do the campaign at the time was to have only two children , she said , at a barbecue restaurant she runs here so one day a lot of my friends in the neighborhood decided to go have the operation , and i went along i felt it was a foolish decision south korea began aggressively promoting family planning in the 1960 s , fearing that overpopulation would impede its economic growth slogans at the time warned south koreans , who averaged six children per family , that they would become beggars without family planning even in the 1980 s , slogans declared that even two are a lot successful family planning , coupled with changing mores , led the birthrate to drop below the ideal population replacement level of 21 in the 1980 s and then more precipitously in the mid1990 s now on average a south korean woman will have 119 child in her lifetime a rate lower than japan s birthrate of 128 , comparable to taiwan s 122 , and higher than hong kong s 094 mr park , of the health ministry , said the government committed itself to raising the birthrate only last year we should have started these policies in the late 1990 s , but we had been focused on decreasing the birthrate for 40 years and it was hard to change directions , he said but some of the measures aimed at reversing the trend have done little more than suggest the government is still out of step with the times a campaign earlier this year urged women to have at least two children by joining the 123 movement have one child in the first year of marriage and a second before turning 30 it ended after many young women and men , who have been delaying marriage until their late 20 s or later , said the campaign s expectations were unrealistic in this age mr park said the government was considering new measures to tackle some of the biggest reasons cited by couples for not having children , including the high costs of afterschool education and the lack of day care the government also wants to give tax breaks to couples with several children and encourage paid maternity leaves local governments are not waiting , though in april , seocheon , a west coast county whose population has declined from 150 , 000 in the 1960 s to 65 , 000 , began giving out bonuses for babies 300 for the first or second child , 800 for the third some villages have n't heard babies crying in 18 years , said lee kwon hee , the county deputy chief at the masan elementary school , the population of 56 students is less than a tenth of what it was in the 1970 s back then , pupils were packed together so that schools had what were called bean sprout classrooms , said kim deok sang , the principal nowadays , masan s students have to join those at the two nearest schools for sporting and other events there was some good news , though , in at least one corner of seocheon county last winter , the village of seokdong celebrated its first newborn in four years twins , in fact , born to lee ji yun , 28 , and her husband , park dae soo , 32 their 4yearold daughter had been the last child born there the young couple own 10 cows and farm potatoes , rice , garlic and chilies although the county gave them a total of 1 , 100 for the twins , they emphasized that the cash incentive played no role in their decision mr park said he doubted that the bonus would bolster the birthrate his wife , a nurse who stopped working when the twins were born , nodded if i had n't had twins , i would have kept working , she said , citing inadequate medical and day care the government should look at this society s fundamental problems , her husband said , instead of just handing out money
after three years of unemployment , allen gruenhut finally landed a job as director of human resources for a company in the stone business on long island his age , 53 , worked against him in his long hunt for work , he contends , and so did the sixfigure salary he earned at his last job , in banking they would not take me seriously at job interviews when i said i would be happy with a lower salary , mr gruenhut said jackie ellenwood , 31 , is still without a job she worked for three travel agencies over 13 years , until her last job , in allen park , mich , ended in a layoff nine months ago the industry is shrinking in response to more internet bookings and cutbacks in corporate travel so ms ellenwood is looking for work elsewhere and studying to become a nurse , confident that health care will continue to expand in an aging america i'm going to stick to my nursing courses , ms ellenwood said , even if i get a job the experiences of mr gruenhut and ms ellenwood help to explain why many of the nation s unemployed are still struggling to get back to work not since world war ii has longterm joblessness the percentage of the unemployed out of work for six months or more been so high for so long after a recession has ended the current trouble falls most heavily on people trapped by the shifting sands of the economy today , the unemployment rate is relatively low at 52 percent and overall hiring has started to pick up again , particularly for younger workers coming out of college and professional schools but the presence of middleaged women and better educated whitecollar workers among the longterm unemployed has increased there are just not new jobs being created in the things these people did before , said andrew stettner , a policy analyst at the national employment law project and coauthor of a study of longterm unemployment we are firing fewer people than we did in 2001 and 2002 , but we are not hiring many people either , and that cuts off the exit route out of unemployment at the same time , the incidence of longterm unemployment among the usual victims of earlier eras less educated bluecollar workers who often lost their jobs in production cutbacks has fallen several factors seem to be contributing to the rise in longterm unemployment the swelling cost of companypaid health insurance is inducing business to be less aggressive in its hiring , said mark zandi , chief economist at economycom , a research group based outside philadelphia the baby boomer bulge working its way through the labor force also plays a role as this large group of workers ages it becomes harder for some who lose their jobs to find new work suited to their skills and the bursting of the hightech bubble stranded thousands of workers who are finding it difficult to shift quickly to other fields while job creation has accelerated lately , to an average of 240 , 000 additional jobs a month since february , it remains well below the pace of previous recoveries it looks like employers are very hesitant about the future of the economy , said lawrence f katz , a labor economist at harvard it may be that we will fall into another weak economic period before we get a good recovery and really robust hiring after world war ii , when traditional industries dominated the economy , the usual pattern was for longterm unemployment to surge during recessions and die away quickly as recoveries took hold that changed during the early 1990 s and is even more evident in the current recovery , which began in november 2001 rather than subside as growth resumed , longterm unemployment as a share of total joblessness continued to rise , according to the bureau of labor statistics it peaked 17 months ago at 233 percent and has only gradually tapered off since then , to 212 percent in april structural changes in the economy and productivity improvements , reflecting the ability of companies to achieve higher output with fewer or the same number of workers , mean that even growing businesses no longer need to dip as much into the pool of displaced workers for example , toyota motors of north america , whose sales are rising more rapidly than other automakers in the united states , is holding back on hiring although its plants are operating flatout its payroll , said dennis cuneo , a senior vice president , has grown by only 600 jobs this year all of them at newly opened plants to a total of just over 32 , 000 employees existing factories continue on two shifts a day overtime and reconfigured work schedules help to squeeze out more production , without adding third shifts and the hiring that the additional shifts would require we are reluctant to bring people on immediately , mr cuneo said we are going to wait and see what we can still get from improvements in productivity if the demand is sustained , there will come a point where you have to add a shift other concerns play a role in the reluctance to hire , which in addition to driving up the longterm unemployment rate , drives down the number of people willing to actively seek a job and thus participate in the labor force sixtysix percent of the working age population was in the labor force in april , down from 667 percent at the start of the recovery that is 16 million missing people , enough to raise the unemployment rate to 62 percent from its present 52 percent if they all showed up many of those who have stayed in the labor force , seeking work , may be people who were laid off for a long time before they were willing to accept a new job that pays less employers , on the other hand , are reluctant to hire those who once earned a higher salary the fear is they will shift to better jobs at the first opportunity that is the story of mr gruenhut , who earned a sixfigure salary as senior vice president for human resources at cr dit agricole indosuez in new york , until his job there ended in 2002 in subsequent job interviews , mr gruenhut said they thought that even though i said i would be happy with a lower salary , i would be out the door as soon as there was an uptick in the job market that happened at least a dozen times i could n't convince them mr gruenhut , who has an mba from new york university and lives in east meadow , spent 30 years in banking but the implosion in financial services , as he puts it , dried up jobs , forcing him to look elsewhere as he branched out , his age worked against him i did not get face time for plum jobs , he said and when he did get interviews , his weight sometimes worked against him finally , an acquaintance told him about an opening for a chief of human resources at the innovative companies , which is based in hauppauge and sells marble and granite for construction he clicked with the chief executive , mr gruenhut said , and he went to work at a sixfigure salary that was considerably lower than the one he had earned at cr dit agricole by that time , he had lost 46 pounds , to just under 200 if you think about it , mr gruenhut said , if you have age and overweight and silver hair , which people were telling me to dye , those are blockades to landing the job that you want ms ellenwood had none of these issues , nor mr gruenhut s education right after graduating from high school , in 1992 , she went to work for a travel agency , booking hotel reservations and airline tickets for corporate clients by the time she lost her most recent job , at get travel last august , she was earning 670 a week she spent months trying to land similar work at another agency without success until the spring of 2004 , she said , we were very busy it was really stressful , call after call , and then the calls went down to pretty much nothing we would sit in the office for an hour or two without the phone ringing her unemployment benefits ran out after six months , but she is living in dearborn with her fianc , an employed engineer , and that has given her the means to pursue a nursing degree at a community college while she studies , she hunts for work my bottom line is that i do n't want to work in fast food , she said but even that vow could be broken , she added , if that is finally necessary to pay the bills
the rivalry has not always raged as fiercely and as consistently as it has the past decade in 1992 , for example , the yankees finished in a tie for fourth place , 20 games from first , while the red sox finished seventh and dead last in the twodivision format , 23 games from the top the red sox that year were no better than fourth after may 11 the yankees stood no higher than fourth after june 5 where was the rivalry then \? were the players fighting fiercely to stay out of last place \? were the fans screaming over the fight for the cellar \? no and no not many memories from that season remain no aaron boone home run , no dave roberts stolen base no comeback from a threegamestonone deficit no american league pennant , no world series spot at stake the rivalry was so lowkey , no one even whispered 1918 , let alone chant it vociferously relations were so mild then that no one on the red sox even thought of calling the yankees the evil empire that would n't happen for another decade why should we bother recalling 1992 \? it was the last time before this week that the yankees versus the red sox opened a season unlike this week , when they played their first game that season at yankee stadium on april 7 , the yankees and the red sox were not playing for the first time since they completed a historic postseason series the year before , 1991 , the red sox finished in a tie for second , seven games from first , the yankees fifth , 13 games further back no playoffs for them that year i believe for those two years there was a downturn in the rivalry , said scott sanderson , who pitched for the yankees those two seasons we were really bad the year before that was one of the years george was on his leave of absence sanderson , now a player agent , referred to george steinbrenner s suspension for paying a selfdescribed gambler 40 , 000 for damaging information on dave winfield , the yankee star with whom the owner was feuding it was steinbrenner s ban that led to what the yankees have become , which , in turn , helped rekindle the rivalry with the red sox steinbrenner , on the eve of his suspension in 1990 , named gene michael the general manager , and michael changed the way the yankees operated his changes led to the yankees' decade of dominance , though they have slipped in the postseason the past four years the red sox were so impressed with the job michael did in new york that they thought of hiring him as their general manager after the 2002 season steinbrenner , though , would not hear of it and refused to give the red sox permission to talk to michael , who remains a highly paid yankee super scout but in 1992 , neither the red sox nor the yankees were worthy of being part of a meaningful rivalry obviously , it s different this year with what happened last year in the playoffs , sanderson said , and both teams could be the best in baseball so they 're fighting right from the beginning to be the best in the game rivalry or no , the first game against the red sox in 1992 was special , said sanderson , who was the yankees' starting pitcher that was buck s first game as manager , and i wanted to be able to hand him the ball after the game and congratulate him , sanderson said , talking about buck showalter sanderson gained a 43 victory over roger clemens , and the yankees won the second game of the series as well between that season and this , the yankees and the red sox started the season against every other team in their division as well as every team in the west and two teams in the central but not each other nevertheless , the schedule maker has drawn some criticism for having the yankees and the red sox open this season it s well past their turn , said katy feeney , major league baseball s senior vice president in charge of scheduling it s been a long time since the red sox and the yankees have opened against each other they 've opened against every other team in the division furthermore , feeney said , the schedule was drawn up before the middle of last season the collectivebargaining agreement stipulates that a tentative schedule has to be submitted to the union by july 1 this was well before we knew they would be playing each other in the league championship series , feeney said teams' fortunes change , even from the end of one season to the beginning of the next , but both of these teams seem well fortified for another season and perhaps postseason of scrapping with each other for division dominance for that reason , critics also cite the fact that the teams play six games , or just about a third of their season s complement , in the first 12 days in 1992 , the teams opened with a twogame series , then did n't face meet again until june 15 this year s schedule eliminates most of the backtoback series , feeney said , but it did n't in this case the teams play the second game of this threegame series this afternoon the red sox would like to view the game as a second opening and hope to play up to the ability they demonstrated not in the first opener sunday night but in the last four games of last october s series
knowing that each day is a different game and can produce different results , the yankees bravely showed up at yankee stadium last night for their game with the boston red sox but they could n't entirely forget the red sox' 17run , 27hit attack a day earlier for one thing , in the early innings against mike mussina , the red sox acted as if they were still playing saturday s game david ortiz whacked a tworun home run in the first inning , and edgar renteria and ortiz cracked basesempty home runs on consecutive pitches in the third manager joe torre wisely removed mussina after the third inning with the red sox ahead , 52 , and boston went on to win , 72 for another thing , some of the statistics in the daily package served as reminders of the saturday afternoon massacre the pitching statistics , for example , showed that the yankees' opponents had a 290 batting average , and a quick check of the column revealed that no other pitching staff had an average that high as a means of comparison , last season , when the yankees were n't supposed to have a very effective staff , the opponents' batting average was 271 , and six other teams had averages that were just as high or higher the yankees were also revealed to be the only team whose hitsagainst total began with a 5 the 27 hits the red sox amassed saturday raised that total to 503 the next highest total , 464 , belonged to the tampa bay devil rays the red sox added 14 hits to the total last night here s one statistic that was n't listed the yankees had allowed 1331 runners per nine innings \( that number rose to 1341 last night \) only the devil rays \( 1452 \) and the kansas city royals \( 1380 \) had put more runners on base per nine innings on the basis of earned run average , the way teams are listed in the statistics tampa bay \( 540 \) and kansas city \( 561 \) were the worst , with the yankees at 452 the yankees , then , can be grateful for one development their pitchers have been more effective than the devil rays' and the royals' once all of those runners have reached base torre put the matter into what he believed was the proper perspective runs concern me , he said before the game hits do n't concern me there have been some pretty good pitchers who gave up hits and won ball games not to interrupt , but just to set the record straight , none of those pitchers work for the yankees now i 'd much prefer they make you hit the ball as opposed to walking people , torre continued that bothers me because you do n't get a chance to get somebody out you do n't like to give up 10 , 12 hits a game , but i do n't worry about that yet the way carl pavano and mussina pitched during the weekend , torre had plenty to be concerned about of the 24 runs the red sox scored the past two games , home runs produced 13 of them contrary to torre s preference , the carnage might not have been as brutal had paul quantrill and mussina walked those boston batters instead of tossing them home run pitches if we do n't pitch to our capabilities , you play into their capabilities , torre said last night after the second beating this game holds no mystery for anybody everybody knows how to pitch against everybody the trick is to be able to do it the way to get people out is to pitch effectively , and we have n't done that mussina had pitched effectively in his previous five starts , but he went into this game naked all the weapons i had the last four , five starts , he said , the ability to throw breaking balls for strikes , throw fastballs in and out , i did n't have any of that today it s tough to pitch against any lineup , let alone theirs , without any weapons , and i did n't have any according to elias sports bureau figures , the yankees have three of the most prolific 18 pitchers at allowing runners to reach base kevin brown is sixth at 1451 per nine innings , pavano 11th with 1392 and mussina 18th with 1330 brown , however , is at least headed in the right direction his season performance can be divided in two parts in his first four starts , all of which he lost , he allowed 1688 baserunners per nine in his last four starts , all of which he won , 1224 batters reached base per nine permitting about four and a half fewer batters to reach base each game obviously has helped brown jaret wright , a yankees starter , has been on the disabled list for more than a month with an ailing shoulder , but in his four starts he contributed to the staff s high ratio allowing 47 batters to reach base in 19 2 3 innings , wright averaged 2150 runners per nine the red sox , meanwhile , were not in position to take any bows for their effective pitching their earned run average , 477 , was higher than the yankees' era their opponents' 273 batting average was third highest , and their baserunner ratio of 1324 was fourth worst but david wells , who had a 1411 ratio , stymied the yankees last night , limiting them to six hits \( three after the first inning \) and walking no one in eight and a third innings the yankees starters would do well to copy their old teammate s performance
baltimore , dec 5 the man convicted of being the ringleader in arsons that heavily damaged expensive new houses in a subdivision in southern maryland last december was sentenced on monday to nearly 20 years in prison judge roger w titus of federal district court also sentenced two codefendants to more than seven years each and ordered the three defendants to pay nearly 33 million each in restitution the fires , set before dawn on dec 6 , destroyed 10 unoccupied houses and heavily damaged 16 others at hunters brooke , a 319house subdivision in indian head , about 25 miles south of washington words simply do not come to mind to adequately describe how horrific this crime was , judge titus said as he sentenced the ringleader , patrick walsh , 22 , of fort washington , to the maximum penalty under federal guidelines , 19 years and 7 months a federal jury convicted mr walsh in september of 35 counts of arson and one count of conspiracy to commit arson the fires caused no injuries , but delayed movein dates for dozens of families and raised suspicions of racism among hunters brooke homeowners , most of whom are black homeowners have pointed to racist statements that prosecutors have attributed to three of the five defendants , all of whom are white , and racial incidents in the area since the fires none of the five men arrested in connection with the arsons have been charged with a hate crime , and prosecutors declined to say why , citing the coming trials for the two remaining defendants prosecutors portrayed mr walsh as a man fascinated by fire who had masterminded the arsons to gain notoriety for his fledgling gang , based in waldorf , and who had worried aloud about blacks moving into hunters brooke judge titus also sentenced aaron l speed , 22 , of waldorf , who had worked as a guard with a security company hired to protect the development , to 8 years and 4 months jeremy d parady , 21 , of accokeek received 7 years and 3 months mr speed and mr parady had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit arson as part of a deal with prosecutors mr parady admitted that he had singled out the development because many homebuyers are black , and mr speed made racist statements to investigators , according to court documents the remaining two defendants , roy t mccann , 23 , and michael m everhart , 21 , both of waldorf , are scheduled to stand trial in february the arsons , prosecutors said , were federal crimes because they interfered with the interstate activities of the subdivision s builder , the lennar corporation , based in miami
herb williams stepped in where lenny wilkens recently stood , and the differences were evident williams is considerably taller , his voice deeper and his hair more abundant but as williams donned a new title and paced the sideline at madison square garden yesterday , there was little else to distinguish the knicks' new era from the one that just abruptly ended a day after wilkens stepped down as head coach , the knicks wandered through another afternoon of general dysfunction and lost to the milwaukee bucks , 10196 despite the change in leadership , the knicks remained two steps slow on defense , were too often uncooperative on offense and lacked any sense of cohesion between the baselines so their seasonworst losing streak is now six games , their january record is 110 and there is no reason to believe the slump will end anytime soon having completed the soft part of their schedule , the knicks \( 1723 \) embark on a difficult ninegame stretch in which they will play six games against the nba s best teams williams is preaching a thematic shift , from offense to defense , but wilkens tried that , too it is not clear whether a simple change in voice will change the players' commitment too early to tell , said jerome williams , the backup forward all of the knicks' existing handicaps remain allan houston and tim thomas rested nagging injuries yesterday , leaving herb williams with the same patchwork rotation that struggled under wilkens the knicks were good enough offensively , getting 33 points from stephon marbury , 20 from jamal crawford and 14 from mike sweetney but they fell apart , almost predictably , in the final minutes michael redd , the bucks' leading scorer and one of the league s top shooters , was left alone in the corner for a 3pointer that pushed milwaukee s lead to 9689 with 541 seconds left after crawford answered with a 3pointer , the knicks let zaza pachulia slip in for a putback dunk to seal the game i thought our rotations , our perimeter defending and our rebounding hurt us , herb williams said , listing essentially every critical part of the game wilkens was widely regarded as an offensiveminded coach , but he was given a roster of offensiveminded players among the knicks' regulars , only jerome williams and kurt thomas are known for defense herb williams s mission is to coax the rest of the roster into joining them lenny coached his way , williams said he was in the league for 20 , 30 years it worked for him , he was very successful i had the opportunity to play under some coaches that are very defensiveminded , with pat riley , don chaney , so i'm going to get things a little bit more toward defense williams made only a few tactical changes while standing near , rather than sitting on , the bench he put trevor ariza in the starting lineup , figuring he was a better defensive match for desmond mason , who scored 22 points anyway late in the game , the knicks played long stretches of zone defense , a rare look for them but marbury unintentionally identified the knicks' main problem when he addressed the difference between wilkens and williams we basically did the same things today we did n't do anything different true enough , the knicks were afflicted by the usual bad habits nazr mohammed was quickly in foul trouble crawford launched most of his scoring attempts early in the shot clock none of the knicks' guards could stop anyone off the dribble and on the knicks' first possession in a haunting encore to wilkens s sad finale marbury had to hurl a desperation shot as the shot clock ran out on friday night , on the knicks' final possession , marbury and crawford passed the ball back and forth as the shot clock expired seconds later , the houston rockets scored the winning basket , and wilkens s career here was done in the 24 hours between his first practice as head coach and his first game , williams took phone calls from patrick ewing and other former knicks teammates they wished him luck , though he probably will need much more than that he is the knicks' fourth coach in five seasons and has been assured only that he will have the post through this season that s new york , williams said of the constant change i think the pressure here is more intense and there s more attention on winning games , and it can change at any time , at any moment as a player , i understood that , and as a coach , i understood that when things do n't go well , either you try to make trades or you try to do something a little different but the pressure s always been there rebounds tim thomas , hampered by a strained right hamstring , suited up but did not play thomas has struggled all season , even when healthy , and his starting job could be in jeopardy under herb williams i thought he was one of our best perimeter defenders , so when he gets back healthy and he gets on the court and gets time in , he 'll show me if he wants to play or not , williams said all that s up to tim , and he knows that trevor ariza , 19 , is believed to be the youngest starter in knicks history
tort reform , the bush administration s answer to the problem of high medical malpractice costs , makes sense from only one aspect the political the genius of tort reform , which focuses on putting a cap on the awards from malpractice suits , is that it offends only one bigmoney lobbying group trial lawyers , who are important financial supporters of the democratic party meanwhile , it helps or holds harmless republican special interests in the insurance , drug and health care industries the only problem is that it hurts the hapless patients who suffer grievous harm at the hands of incompetent doctors we hold no brief for the current medical liability system , which does a poor job of compensating most victims of medical malpractice an authoritative study of thousands of patients in new york state found that the vast majority who were harmed by medical errors or negligence never filed suit , whereas the vast majority of those who did file suit were not actually harmed by negligent doctors some studies suggest that , once a suit is filed , the courts do a reasonably good job of sorting out who deserves compensation , while other research has found that juries are swayed more by the severity of a plaintiff s injuries than by evidence of negligence but in a medical system that is coming under increased fire for failing to deliver consistent quality in hospital care , it is clear that only a small number of people are being compensated for malpractice the problem with the president s approach , which would limit noneconomic damages to a paltry 250 , 000 , is that it would punish many of those most deserving of compensation if there is a problem with frivolous lawsuits , that is best addressed by raising the hurdles for filing a malpractice suit , perhaps by requiring an expert judgment on the merits of a case before it can proceed through the courts but surely 250 , 000 hardly makes up for the physical and emotional damage done to people who have suffered total paralysis , permanent blindness or severe brain injury because of medical errors instead , congress ought to consider requiring guidelines for judges and juries to help determine what compensation is reasonable in a given circumstance similar guidelines could help ensure that punitive damages are high enough to deter bad conduct 250 , 000 would hardly amount to a wrist slap politicians endorsing tort reform say a crisis of escalating malpractice insurance premiums is forcing doctors out of business the extent to which this is an actual problem is murky insurance companies have substantially raised premiums for malpractice coverage for doctors in highrisk specialties like obstetrics and neurosurgery in some states , leading at least some doctors to curtail their services , retire or move the white house laments that patients in some areas are thus forced to travel long distances to find , for example , obstetrical care but when the government accountability office visited five of the hardest hit states in 2003 , it found only scattered problems and was unable to document widescale lack of access to medical care most states that are burdened with high premiums have already set their own caps , generally at more reasonable levels than those proposed by the president it would seem more useful to consider making it harder for insurance companies to gain rate increases the best response , one that would benefit the public in general , would be to weed out the small number of negligent doctors responsible for generating most of the malpractice awards none of the tort reform proposals deal with the underlying need to identify harmed patients and provide them with fair , prompt compensation experts have suggested a number of approaches , including special health courts with judges trained to deal with malpractice issues , required mediation , mandatory reporting of errors by doctors and prompt offers of compensation but there is a lot of uncertainty about what would work best although the administration has been sponsoring some projects to reduce medical errors or speed the resolution of claims , these have faded behind the fullcourt political press to impose tort reform instead of fixating on an idea that would do little to solve anything but the health care industry s desire for fewer big court awards , congress should push for a wide range of demonstration projects aimed at solving the malpractice problem by actually cutting down on malpractice

many of the city s messiahs are based on long annual performance traditions , but when it comes to history , none can beat the oratorio society of new york the group was founded in 1873 , before carnegie hall was even a twinkle in andrew carnegie s eye its singers performed under tchaikovsky s direction at the hall s opening in 1891 , and since then the oratorio society has sung handel s messiah at carnegie every year except one \( in 1960 , when demolition of the hall seemed imminent \) it returned on monday evening for this year s performance but beneath the veneer of unbroken tradition , this amateur chorus had a turbulent year capped by the death in may of its longtime music director , lyndon woodside , who had led the oratorio society since 1973 monday s performance , described as the first in 40 years without mr woodside , was dedicated to his memory fortunately , the group seems to be in good hands with kent tritle , a respected choral director and organist who has been appointed guest conductor as one glimpse at the stage made clear , mr tritle is at least respecting the oratorio society s tradition of giant proportions more than 200 names were listed in the program , and the singers stood eight rows deep it was as if a small city had been recruited to tell good tidings to zion with a group so large , mr tritle rightly emphasized precision and clarity while still leading the work s grander moments with a wiry intensity there was some slippery intonation as the night wore on , especially among the sopranos in the work s more excitable moments , and the overall polish could not be mistaken for that of a professional ensemble but this was still a vibrant and deeply human performance , made exciting by the sheer heft and depth of the chorus s sound raymond mase provided a dignified trumpet solo the vocals soloists sharla nafziger , soprano mary phillips , mezzosoprano rufus m ller , tenor and philip cutlip , baritone sang respectably and the westchester philharmonic orchestra worked diligently if not always immaculately there were things to nitpick but with such a vigorous showing from an allvolunteer chorus at the heart of the evening , that felt like missing the point judging by the audience s swift ovation , you could say this messiah hit its intended mark
when sydney pollack shot his new thriller the interpreter on location at the united nations , he did not do so on the fourth floor of 800 second avenue that is hardly a surprise the place is not accustomed to the limelight the fourth floor of no 800 , a sturdy office building that is protected by concrete flower boxes and sits on the corner of 42nd street , represents a rare pocket of international officesharing in the ostentatious world of diplomatic missions known formally as the joint office for commonwealth permanent missions to the united nations , it is the place where gambia might borrow the fax machine belonging to the solomon islands , which might be wondering whether to split a cab downtown with the maldives on a recent thursday morning , a minicrisis was brewing on the floor , but it was not of the diplomatic kind some of the phones were down we 've called verizon , nadine adjodha , secretary to the ambassador of samoa , said to janet grace john , the general receptionist to the floor ms john replied , i called st lucia , and their phones are dead , too the joint office , which has beige walls brightened by occasional posters from its mainly tropical inhabitants , formally came into being 20 years ago these days , 10 nations from three regions the pacific , the caribbean and africa have their un missions there , and for some countries these offices serve as their embassies to the united states and canada as well the only nation on the floor that is not entirely made up of islands \( or a sids , a small island developing state , in un language \) is gambia unsurprisingly , it was their only new yorker , a brooklyn dentist named lamuel stanislaus , who was the driving force behind this solution to the rent problems of these small nations dr stanislaus , 85 , served as grenada s permanent representative to the united nations from 1985 until his retirement last year as soon as i got there , i could n't understand how you had such a number of small states operating in such an uneconomical manner , dr stanislaus said in the pricey precincts of midtown , those poor countries were toughing it out on their own , paying rent on separate offices dr stanislaus first approached the organization of eastern caribbean states with the idea of a shared space , but it turned him down \( this month , st vincent , one of the first countries dr stanislaus pitched his idea to , will finally join the joint office now they feel the crunch , dr stanislaus said with some satisfaction \) in the end , it was the commonwealth , the organization of nations of the former british empire , that agreed to the stanislaus plan the commonwealth s largest donors , countries like britain , australia and new zealand , would pay the rent for the shared office , while the tenants would pay other expenses so the tenants get a break on rent as well as the efficiency of shared services there is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come , said dr stanislaus , who is writing his memoirs , which he hopes will give a good , good picture of dentistry and diplomacy on the same morning that the phones failed , most of the ambassadors agreed that cost and convenience were the main benefits of the arrangement , which allows them to share a conference room , a reception area , a library and copying machines it is very hard , said ambassador mohamed latheef of the maldives no matter how small a mission is , it requires a minimum amount of facilities when we joined up , there were a lot of savings just down the hall , ambassador crispin greyjohnson of gambia agreed all of these things you would normally have to break your head worrying about , someone else deals with them , he said , referring to the receptionist and to tania laumanulupe tupou , the floor s manager , who is from tonga ambassador ali'ioaiga feturi elisaia of samoa , noting that tiny missions often shared their notes because none could attend every un meeting , added , i ca n't imagine what life would be like without it the joint office is about more than shared facilities its tenants also have shared interests beyond the struggle against what mr greyjohnson calls the problem of smallness the difficulty in having any presence in international diplomacy these countries jointly grapple with specific troubles global warming is one , with many of the states facing the prospect of losing islands and coral reefs to rising sea levels and temperatures securing beneficial trade treaties is another , as is the continuing struggle against natural disasters grenada , for instance , suffered about 1 billion of damage last september , when hurricane ivan destroyed 90 percent of the island s buildings in december , both the maldives and the seychelles were hit by the tsunami banding together will not cure these troubles but it helps the moral support is there for one another , said mr latheef of the maldives , which lost more than 100 lives during the tsunami and suffered extensive damage to a third of its 1 , 191 islands we are small , we cannot offer anything else
paris the coordinated bombings of popular tourist areas in bali , almost exactly three years after similar attacks there , signal that an outbreak of democracy in the muslim world will not necessarily be enough to destroy al qaeda s viral movement or even to diminish its reach if anything , the entrenchment of democracy has weakened indonesia s willingness to fight terrorism the country s minorityled democratic government , whose very survival requires the support of islamic parties that range from the militant to the mainstream , has spent the period between the two bali attacks waffling in its response to terrorism for fear of alienating these muslim parties and a largely antiamerican populace such lack of resolve augurs ill for american efforts to promote democracy as an antidote to terrorism elsewhere in the muslim world president susilo bambang yudhoyono insists that the terrorists responsible for saturday s bombings will be hunted down the previous president made similar protestations following the 2002 bombings but only six weeks ago , an indonesian court reduced the jail time of abu bakar bashir allegedly the spiritual leader of jemaah islamiyah , al qaeda s main ally in the region and those of 18 others convicted for their roles in the 2002 bombings although bashir was implicated in a jemaah islamiyah plot to overthrow indonesia s previous government , and despite independent testimonies from senior jemaah islamiyah operatives in american and indonesian custody that he approved the bali bombings and other terrorist operations , he will soon walk free after just 26 months in custody the day of the court s decision , i conducted an interview with bashir at jakarta s cipinang prison he was surrounded by acolytes , including the bombers who struck a jakarta shopping mall and the philippine ambassador s residence the speaker of indonesia s parliament , along with many muslim leaders , including moderates , had previously visited bashir to show solidarity with this victim of pressure and interference by the united states and australia but there can be no doubt that bashir is a very extreme thinker who inspires deadly actions at 66 , bashir is lanky and bespectacled , with a strong voice , an easy laugh , and an air of vulpine gentility his family , like osama bin laden s , traces its roots to the hadramawt region of yemen he explained that it was america and australia , in collaboration with israel , that actually planted the big bomb that killed so many people those indonesians convicted of the earlier bali bombings had in fact used only small bombs to warn that drugs and other western excesses would n't be tolerated nevertheless , i call those who carried out such actions all mujahid , or holy warriors , bashir said their attacks , he insisted , were selfdefense against western predations in the muslim world bashir expounded a radically new interpretation of islam no deed is nobler than jihad none if we commit to jihad , we can neglect other deeds nor is there any end in sight to what bashir sees as an intractable clash of civilizations according to the koran , he explained , it is destiny for muslims to fight jews and christians until the end of time westerners must be destroyed unless they accept islamic government he claimed he had recently sent a letter to president bush pointing out that because of this destiny , the west s battle is pointless and unwinnable asked if he were the leader of jemaah islamiyah , bashir smiled that was n't proven at my trial , he replied in fact , indonesian intelligence has authenticated a 1998 letter to regional jihadi leaders , in which bashir and another figure associated with jemaah islamiyah claimed to be acting on bin laden s behalf to advance a global jihad against jews and christians nonetheless , president yudhoyono has said that he cannot submit legislation to parliament proscribing jemaah islamiyah because there is insufficient proof that the group exists at the same time , he warns that more terrorist attacks may come that seems more than likely , to judge from the accounts i received from selfproclaimed mujahedin in java and sulawesi they report that jemaah islamiyah has set up a suicide squad to conduct large actions against western interests , over the objections of some group members who reprehend killing civilians it cannot possibly be in the indonesian government s interest to continue to shelter an organization with such violent intentions but the country s officials may have concluded that it is even riskier to support american policies according to the latest survey conducted by the pew global attitudes project , indonesian views of the united states , which were largely favorable before the invasion of iraq , plummeted to 15 percent favorable right after in pew s june 2005 survey , 80 percent of indonesians feared that the united states would attack their country fortunately , the pew figures also reveal positive trends that suggest another way forward for the united states and its allies in three years , indonesians' support for suicide bombing has declined from 27 percent to 15 percent , and confidence in osama bin laden is down from 58 percent to 35 percent i if one american policy can be correlated with improvements in indonesian attitudes toward the united states , it is aid for tsunami victims in aceh the pew polls suggest that , largely because of the american role in tsunami rescue and relief , indonesia is now one of the few nations where a majority believes that american actions sometimes consider other nations' interests since that time , support for combating terrorism has doubled to 50 percent , as indonesians focus on the dangers they face rather than on distaste for american policies these polls indicate that popular sentiment remains volatile , and that the antiamericanism that helps drive jihadism is not necessarily permanent but it would be a mistake to presume that the tide of history will simply carry countries like indonesia toward democratization and away from militant islam groups like jemaah islamiyah , which promote equal economic opportunity , as well as social and political advancement through educational achievement and personal piety , hold real appeal for citizens in this part of the world to compete with that appeal , muslim governments must address the often frustrated aspirations of their bulging youth populations as for the west , in order to win its conflict with jihadism , its leaders must creatively endeavor to buck the tide of history rather than simply pretend to ride it after all , that is the way our own democracy was born oped contributor scott atran , a research scientist at the national center for

captain jack is an atypical movie star a blind chihuahua rescued from a shelter , he does not have a blist celebrity owner or a craving for tacos and he can be a bit cantankerous , according to his companion , deborah tallent he did n't like me at first , until i gave him a piece of chicken , she said but on the internet , jack is one wellknown dog , the star of a minor motion picture called capt jack the movie it s available on clipshack , one of a new generation of videosharing sites that offer camcorder coppolas and cellphone scorceses a place to upload videos and make them available to friends , family members and the world at large users of the sites , like ms tallent , say that they offer a simpler alternative to sending large video files by email , burning them onto a dvd or posting them on a personal web site and , if users opt to make their videos publicly available , they can be viewed and commented on by a wider audience the entrepreneurs who have started companies like clipshack , vimeo , youtube and bliptv are betting that as consumers discover the video abilities built into their cellphones and digital still cameras , and get better at editing the oftenlengthy video from their camcorders , they will be eager to share video on the web while most of the services are free today , the entrepreneurs eventually hope to make money by selling ads or charging fees for premium levels of service sharing video on the web is still a new notion a lot of people have n't really come to terms with the idea that they can publish their own video online , said jakob lodwick , the founder of vimeo , based in manhattan for the longest time , video has always been connected to a physical tape or a disc there are still a lot of people who are n't even comfortable sharing their photos online yet but many early users of videosharing services have encountered frustrations with other means of distribution ms tallent , who lives in marina del rey , calif , said she had tried posting videos directly on her personal web site , but that was cumbersome , and she ran afoul of her internet provider s limits on file size paul krikler , who works for an investment bank in manhattan , got tired of creating dvd s for his family members so they could enjoy videos of mr krikler s 10monthold son , benjamin , chortling at the camera or being fed making dvd s would 've been a less frequent process , mr krikler said using clipshack , i can put up a couple new clips on a saturday or sunday every week , and people can go in and see new clips on a monday mr krikler chooses to allow only his circle of friends and family to view his videos , and says there are about 50 people in that group , including one friend in australia he shoots the videos using a digital camera from canon that is designed mainly to take still pictures , and sends the videos to clipshack users of the services can upload cin ma v rit directly from the camera , or painstakingly edit the videos using software like imovie from apple or windows movie maker from microsoft some services , like phanfare , charge a monthly fee , and most , with the exception of google video , limit the size of videos none of the sites should be considered a reliable sole archive for personal video , however , since many do not allow users to download their original file once it has been uploaded and there is always the possibility that a site may vanish overnight at least two sites , bliptv and ourmediaorg , promise more permanence by uploading a copy of each video submitted to the internet archive , which is run by a san francisco nonprofit organization whose mission is longterm preservation of digital material graham walker , who posts his travel videos to ourmediaorg , views that as a benefit some of his videos made during a trip to tibet capture the changes in that country as china exerts a greater impact on its culture with your video in the internet archive , you feel that you 're leaving something for the future , said mr walker , a video producer who lives in prague of course , some people may not want that , he added do you really want your new girlfriend to find all the videos you made when you were with your old girlfriend \?

in the first agreement of its kind , home box office has entered into a deal to allow the public broadcasting service to replay three original hbo films after they have completed a monthlong run on hbo s premium cable channel the idea , according to chris albrecht , chairman of hbo , is to make the series of films on topics of public interest biological warfare , genocide and aids available to a much wider audience pbs will produce panel discussions to accompany the films we stood back and said 'we have these three films relating to issues in the news or on topics of much importance in the world today , ' mr albrecht said , and we came up with the idea of taking them to pbs hbo , a unit of time warner , charges viewers a subscription fee to receive its programming , and generally steers clear of involvement with free , overtheairwaves broadcast television we are taking some risk in doing this , from the point of view of our brand if people say to themselves , 'here we are paying for hbo for something we can see later on free television , ' mr albrecht said but he said hbo stood to gain much more from its association with the publicinterest content in the films and the subsequent discussions plus , he said , hbo will get wider exposure for films that otherwise would be available to only about a third of homes with televisions and even if our subscribers have seen the films on hbo , they will not have seen the symposiums that will be on after them on pbs , mr albrecht said pbs viewers who do not currently subscribe to hbo might also get an idea of what they are missing they may decide that this is a cool brand , he said in the past , hbo has sometimes screened films in theaters before a television run , usually in an effort to qualify them for academy awards which several have won indeed , one of the three films going to pbs , yesterday , will be the official entry from south africa in the foreign film category at this year s oscars hbo has also occasionally sold its films in syndication to local television stations after about a year s play on hbo hbo is being backed in this new effort by the council on foreign relations , which is sponsoring a screening of the first film , dirty war , for invited guests in new york and is supplying several participants for a panel discussion that will follow richard n haass the president of the council , said that his group , which had participated in previous hbo projects , had agreed to offer support because these are serious films about serious issues he added , the films are n't spinach , though this is also good television , but it s good television that forces people to think dirty war , a fictional account of an attack by a terrorist group that releases a socalled dirty bomb in central london , will have its first run on hbo beginning jan 24 a month later , on feb 23 , pbs stations will have a onenight broadcast of the film , accompanied by a panel discussion on the topic of biological warfare , which pbs will produce the network hopes to include numerous authorities on the panel and has invited tom ridge , the former secretary of homeland security the second film , sometimes in april , deals with the 1994 incidents of genocidal atrocities in rwanda it was written and directed by raoul peck , an awardwinning filmmaker , and stars idris elba of the hbo series the wire , and the actress debra winger hbo will first present that film in march , and the pbs broadcast and panel discussion will follow a month later the third film , yesterday , about a young african mother with aids , has not yet been scheduled by hbo the broadcast on pbs will again come after hbo has presented the film for about a month mr albrecht said the films were offered to pbs free , other than the costs of producing the panel discussions we went in and pitched the idea to them and they were thrilled jacoba atlas , the senior vice president of programming for pbs , said the hbo proposal came totally out of the blue after we looked at the films we decided these were excellent films that deserved to be seen by a wider audience , ms atlas said it was very gracious and very generous of hbo to donate them to us stephanie aronson , a spokeswoman for pbs , said the organization was pleased to broadcast hbo films , but she said pbs would be contributing as well the panel discussions make it more pbsesque , she said after the films have their single broadcasts on pbs , they will revert to hbo , which can continue to distribute them on its channels , through videoondemand and as dvd s hbo , of course , does not work under the same limitations on content and language as public broadcasters but mr albrecht said the movies in question will have little problem moving over to the more strictly controlled pbs he said only one scene in dirty war had to be extensively reedited it is a scene in which people exposed to a biological agent are forced to strip quickly it s the least titillating scene you can imagine , mr albrecht said but because of concerns about recent crackdowns by the federal communications commission on any form of nudity , pbs asked that the scene be edited there are no issues with any scenes in the other films , mr albrecht said , and none of the three contained any language that had to be excised
toulouse , france , sept 22 soaring oil prices pose an obvious threat to the airlines but they are giving a temporary lift to the fortunes of aircraft manufacturers because of a demand for more economical planes , the new chief executive of airbus , gustav humbert , said thursday the higher the oil price , the greater the demand for more fuelefficient aircraft , said mr humbert , a german engineer who took the helm of airbus , the european plane maker , in june we should encourage airlines to buy new aircraft to replace those which are 15 or 20 years old airbus and its rival , boeing , are enjoying a bumper year for orders of new planes , propelled in part by their competing midsize , longdistance aircraft , the boeing 787 and the airbus a350 boeing , in particular , has successfully promoted the 787 for its fuel efficiency mr humbert made his remarks in an interview with reporters at airbus headquarters here he also struck a more conciliatory tone toward boeing , with which it is embroiled in a bitter trade dispute over what boeing contends are improper subsidies airbus receives from european countries to develop new planes we would like a negotiated solution rather than a litigated solution , mr humbert said , alluding to the lawsuit that the united states has filed against the european union with the world trade organization mr humbert s predecessor , no l forgeard , said airbus would not negotiate with boeing if the dispute escalated into a lawsuit but mr humbert said the two companies should try to settle the dispute because protracted litigation would damage both of them it does not lead anywhere , he said we are not afraid of litigation , only the effects of litigation still , he reiterated airbus s contention that boeing receives improper aid in the form of tax breaks , research grants from the pentagon and state subsidies from japan , which is supplying components for the 787 and he said airbus was confident that it would receive a requested 145 billion euros \( 176 billion \) in launch aid for the a350 from britain , france , germany and spain we cannot live in a situation in which the 787 gets lots and lots of aid , and the 350 gets none , or much less , mr humbert said he said he expected airbus to obtain formal approval to build the a350 at a board meeting next month of its parent , the european aeronautic defense and space company , or eads that could coincide with the approval of aid from the european governments airbus said it had 140 orders and commitments for the a350 , which will seat 253 to 300 passengers john leahy , the chief commercial officer of airbus , said he would book a total of 200 orders by the end of 2005 boeing has 263 orders and commitments for the 787 , and says it is in negotiations to sell hundreds more as a result , boeing may surpass airbus in annual orders for the first time in several years by airbus s count , it has 417 orders for all types of aircraft , while boeing has 629 airbus , which was once dwarfed by boeing , has savored what has at times been its comefrombehind lead on thursday , mr humbert played down the possibility of falling back into second place this is not the end of the world , he said airbus has other worries , not least a sixmonth delay in the delivery of its new superjumbo jet , the a380 it was forced to shut down its assembly line in toulouse from may to the middle of august because staff members were overtaxed by the demands of carriers to create customized cabins airbus tried to recruit additional engineers , but said it could not find enough the customers were all shouting , which is good because that means they really want the aircraft , said charles champion , a chief operating officer of airbus , who is in charge of the a380 program airbus said it would deliver the first a380 to singapore airlines late in 2006 it will have to pay singapore and other carriers steep penalties for late delivery , but it would not give a detailed estimate airbus has 159 orders for the a380 , though demand has been slow in the last year despite that and the rising fuel prices the mood at airbus these days is bright mr leahy said it was possible that in 2005 , the industry would break its record for orders 1 , 631 in 1989 mr humbert cautioned that any windfall from the oil market would be fleeting , since high fuel prices erode the finances of airlines and the broader economy , including air travel the spate of bankruptcy filings by united states carriers , he added , could hamper future growth if the oil price stays at this level , or goes even higher , mr humbert said , then we do n't only have a problem with air travel , we have a huge problem with our international economy
following is a transcript of president bush s state of the union address , as recorded by the new york times as a new congress gathers , all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege we have been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve and tonight that is a privilege we share with newly elected leaders of afghanistan , the palestinian territories , ukraine and a free and sovereign iraq two weeks ago , i stood on the steps of this capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all this evening i will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world tonight , with a healthy , growing economy , with more americans going back to work , with our nation an active force for good in the world , the state of our union is confident and strong our generation has been blessed by the expansion of opportunity , by advances in medicine , by the security purchased by our parents' sacrifice now , as we see a little gray in the mirror , or a lot of gray , and we watch our children moving into adulthood , we ask the question what will be the state of their union \? members of congress , the choices we make together will answer that question over the next several months , on issue after issue , let us do what americans have always done and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren first , we must be good stewards of this economy and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely america s economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation in the past four years , we 've provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes , overcome a recession , opened up new markets abroad , prosecuted corporate criminals , raised homeownership to its highest level in history and , in the last year alone , the united states has added 23 million new jobs when action was needed , the congress delivered , and the nation is grateful now we must add to these achievements by making our economy more flexible , more innovative and more competitive , we will keep america the economic leader of the world america s prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government i welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline i will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation , makes tax relief permanent and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009 my budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results , or duplicate current efforts , or do not fulfill essential priorities the principle here is clear taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely , or not at all to make our economy stronger and more dynamic , we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century under the no child left behind act , standards are higher , test scores are on the rise and we 're closing the achievement gap for minority students now we must demand better results from our high schools , so every high school diploma is a ticket to success we will help an additional 200 , 000 workers to get training for a better career by reforming our job training system and strengthening america s community colleges and we will make it easier for americans to afford a college education by increasing the size of pell grants to make our economy stronger and more competitive , america must reward , not punish , the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs small business is the path of advancement , especially for women and minorities , so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest jobcreators from junk lawsuits justice is distorted , and our economy is held back by irresponsible class actions and frivolous asbestos claims , and i urge congress to pass legal reforms this year to make our economy stronger and more productive , we must make health care more affordable and give families greater access to good coverage and more control over their health decisions i ask congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda , with tax credits to help lowincome workers buy insurance , a community health center in every poor county , improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs , association health plans for small businesses and their employees , expanded health savings accounts , and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need to keep our economy growing , we also need reliable supplies of affordable , environmentally responsible energy nearly four years ago , i submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation , alternative sources , a modernized electricity grid and more production here at home , including safe , clean nuclear energy my clear skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens and my budget provides strong funding for leadingedge technology from hydrogenfueled cars , to clean coal , to renewable sources such as ethanol four years of debate is enough i urge congress to pass legislation that makes america more secure and less dependent on foreign energy all these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs , but they are just the beginning of our duty to build the prosperity of future generations , we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time year after year , americans are burdened by an archaic , incoherent federal tax code i have appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom and when their recommendations are delivered , you and i will work together to give this nation a tax code that is progrowth , easy to understand and fair to all america s immigration system is also outdated , unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country we should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families , and deny businesses willing workers , and invite chaos at our border it is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs americans will not take , that rejects amnesty , that tells us who is entering and leaving our country , and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists social security one of america s most important institutions , a symbol of the trust between generations , is also in need of wise and effective reform social security was a great moral success of the 20th century , and we must honor its great purposes in this new century the system , however , on its current path , is headed toward bankruptcy and so we must join together to strengthen and save social security today , more than 45 million americans receive social security benefits , and millions more are nearing retirement , and for them the system is sound and fiscally strong i have a message for every american who is 55 or older do not let anyone mislead you for you , the social security system will not change in any way for younger workers , the social security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time social security was created decades ago , for a very different era in those days people did not live as long , benefits were much lower than they are today , and a half century ago , about 16 workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits our society has changed in ways the founders of social security could not have foreseen in today s world , people are living longer and therefore drawing benefits longer , and those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades and instead of 16 workers paying in for every beneficiary , right now it s only about three workers , and over the next few decades , that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary with each passing year , fewer workers are paying everhigher benefits to an everlarger number of retirees so here is the result thirteen years from now , in 2018 , social security will be paying out more than it takes in and every year afterward will bring a new shortfall , bigger than the year before for example , in the year 2027 , the government will somehow have to come up with an extra 200 billion to keep the system afloat , and by 2033 , the annual shortfall would be more than 300 billion by the year 2042 , the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt if steps are not taken to avert that outcome , the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes , massive new borrowing , or sudden and severe cuts in social security benefits or other government programs i recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off but those dates are n't so distant , as any parent will tell you if you have a 5yearold , you 're already concerned about how you 'll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road if you 've got children in their 20 s , as some of us do , the idea of social security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter and it should not be a small matter to the united states congress you and i share a responsibility we must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of social security once and for all fixing social security permanently will require an open , candid review of the options some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees former congressman tim penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages during the 1990 s , my predecessor , president clinton , spoke of increasing the retirement age former senator john breaux suggested discouraging early collection of social security benefits the late senator daniel patrick moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated all these ideas are on the table i know that none of these reforms would be easy but we have to move ahead with courage and honesty , because our children s retirement security is more important than partisan politics i will work with members of congress to find the most effective combination of reforms i will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer we must , however , be guided by some basic principles we must make social security permanently sound , not leave that task for another day we must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes we must ensure that lower income americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement we must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement and we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual , so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future as we fix social security , we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers and the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts here is how the idea works right now , a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the social security benefits of today s retirees if you are a younger worker , i believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account , so you can build a nest egg for your own future here is why personal accounts are a better deal your money will grow , over time , at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver , and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from social security in addition , you 'll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account , if you wish , to your children or grandchildren and best of all , the money in the account is yours , and the government can never take it away the goal here is greater security in retirement , so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts we will make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds we 'll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden wall street fees we 'll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement we 'll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once , but rather paid out over time , as an addition to traditional social security benefits and we will make sure this plan is fiscally responsible by starting personal retirement accounts gradually and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time , eventually permitting all workers to set aside 4 percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees , because you already have something similar called the thrift savings plan , which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly based investment funds it s time to extend the same security , and choice , and ownership to young americans values our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society so many of my generation , after a long journey , have come home to family and faith , and are determined to bring up responsible , moral children government is not the source of these values , but government should never undermine them because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society , it should not be redefined by activist judges for the good of families , children and society , i support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable , we must strive to build a culture of life medical research can help us reach that goal by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities , and i thank the congress for doubling the funding of the national institutes of health to build a culture of life we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity , not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others we should all be able to agree on some clear standards i will work with congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts , and that human life is never bought and sold as a commodity america will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious , aggressive , and always ethical because courts must always deliver impartial justice , judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law , not legislate from the bench as president , i have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are well qualified to serve on the bench , and i have done so the constitution also gives the senate a responsibility every judicial nominee deserves an upordown vote because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion , we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of america our government will continue to support faithbased and community groups that bring hope to harsh places now we need to focus on giving young people , especially young men in our cities , better options than apathy , or gangs , or jail tonight i propose a threeyear initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs , and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to atrisk youth , which involves parents and pastors , coaches and community leaders , in programs ranging from literacy to sports and i'm proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our first lady , laura bush because hiv aids brings suffering and fear into so many lives , i ask you to reauthorize the ryan white act to encourage prevention , and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease and as we update this important law , we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases , africanamerican men and women because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice , we need to make sure americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice in america we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit so we are dramatically expanding the use of dna evidence to prevent wrongful conviction soon i will send to congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases , because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side national security our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an america that is safe from danger , and protected by peace we will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy and chief among them is freedom from fear in the three and a half years since september the 11th , 2001 , we 've taken unprecedented actions to protect americans we 've created a new department of government to defend our homeland , focused the fbi on preventing terrorism , begun to reform our intelligence agencies , broken up terror cells across the country , expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack , improved border security and trained more than a half million first responders police and firefighters , air marshals , researchers , and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer , and we thank them all our nation , working with allies and friends , has also confronted the enemy abroad , with measures that are determined , successful and continuing the al qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders , but many of its top commanders have been removed there are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists , but their number has declined there are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction , but no longer without attention and without consequence our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many and intimidate us all , and we will stay on the offensive against them until the fight is won pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror , and i thank the congress for providing our servicemen and women with the resources they have needed during this time of war we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory other nations around the globe have stood with us in afghanistan , an international force is helping provide security in iraq , 28 countries have troops on the ground , the united nations and the european union provided technical assistance for the elections , and nato is leading a mission to help train iraqi officers we are cooperating with 60 governments in the proliferation security initiative , to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials we are working closely with the governments in asia to convince north korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions pakistan , saudi arabia and nine other countries have captured or detained al qaeda terrorists in the next four years , my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time in the long term , the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder if whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred , they will be the recruiting grounds for terror , and that terror will stalk america and other free nations for decades the only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror , and replace hatred with hope , is the force of human freedom our enemies know this , and that is why the terrorist zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the evil principle of democracy and we have declared our own intention america will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the middle east and beyond , with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world the united states has no right , no desire , and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else that is one of the main differences between us and our enemies they seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression , in which a tiny group of brutal , selfappointed rulers control every aspect of every life our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations , with governments that answer to their citizens , and reflect their own cultures and because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors , the advance of freedom will lead to peace that advance has great momentum in our time , shown by women voting in afghanistan , and palestinians choosing a new direction , and the people of ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president we are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty and in the coming years , we will add to that story the middle east the beginnings of reform and democracy in the palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure tomorrow morning , secretary of state rice departs on a trip that will take her to israel and the west bank for meetings with prime minister sharon and president abbas she will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful , independent democratic state to promote this democracy , i will ask congress for 350 million to support palestinian political , economic , and security reforms the goal of two democratic states , israel and palestine , living side by side in peace is within reach , and america will help them achieve that goal to promote peace and stability in the broader middle east , the united states will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror , while we encourage a higher standard of freedom hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from morocco to jordan to bahrain the government of saudi arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future and the great and proud nation of egypt , which showed the way toward peace in the middle east , can now show the way toward democracy in the middle east to promote peace in the broader middle east , we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder syria still allows its territory , and parts of lebanon , to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region you have passed , and we are applying , the syrian accountability act , and we expect the syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom today , iran remains the world s primary state sponsor of terror , pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve we are working with european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing , and end its support for terror and to the iranian people , i say tonight as you stand for your own liberty , america stands with you our generational commitment to the advance of freedom , especially in the middle east , is now being tested and honored in iraq that country is a vital front in the war on terror , which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in iraq , so we do not have to face them here at home and the victory of freedom in iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror , inspire democratic reformers from damascus to tehran , bring more hope and progress to a troubled region , and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren we will succeed because the iraqi people value their own liberty , as they showed the world last sunday across iraq , often at great risk , millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new transitional national assembly a young woman in baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day , and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote she said , hearing those explosions , it occurred to me the insurgents are weak , they are afraid of democracy , they are losing so i got my husband , and i got my parents , and we all came out and voted together americans recognize that spirit of liberty , because we share it in any nation , casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility for millions of iraqis , it was also an act of personal courage , and they have earned the respect of us all one of iraq s leading democracy and human rights advocates is safia taleb alsuhail she says of her country we were occupied for 35 years by saddam hussein that was the real occupation thank you to the american people who paid the cost but most of all to the soldiers eleven years ago , safia s father was assassinated by saddam s intelligence service three days ago in baghdad , safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country and we are honored that she is with us tonight the terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy , and will continue to attack it yet the terrorists' most powerful myth is being destroyed the whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces , they are trying to destroy the hopes of iraqis , expressed in free elections and the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the iraqi people we will succeed in iraq because iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom and to write their own history as prime minister allawi said in his speech to congress last september , ordinary iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible that is the natural desire of an independent nation , and it also is the stated mission of our coalition in iraq the new political situation in iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country at the recommendation of our commanders on the ground , and in consultation with the iraqi government , we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable iraqi security forces forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure as those forces become more selfreliant and take on greater security responsibilities , america and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role in the end , iraqis must be able to defend their own country and we will help that proud , new nation secure its liberty recently an iraqi interpreter said to a reporter , tell america not to abandon us he and all iraqis can be certain while our military strategy is adapting to circumstances , our commitment remains firm and unchanging we are standing for the freedom of our iraqi friends and freedom in iraq will make america safer for generations to come we will not set an artificial timetable for leaving iraq , because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out we are in iraq to achieve a result a country that is democratic , representative of all its people , at peace with its neighbors and able to defend itself and when that result is achieved , our men and women serving in iraq will return home with the honor they have earned right now , americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world , often taking great risks on my orders we have given them training and equipment and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every american proud the volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle , unwavering in loyalty , unmatched in honor and decency , and every day they are making our nation more secure some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries , and this grateful nation will do everything we can to help them recover and we have said farewell to some very good men and women , who died for our freedom , and whose memory this nation will honor forever one name we honor is marine corps sgt byron norwood of pflugerville , tex , who was killed during the assault on falluja his mom , janet , sent me a letter and told me how much byron loved being a marine , and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror she wrote when byron was home the last time , i said that i wanted to protect him like i had since he was born he just hugged me and said 'you 've done your job , mom now it s my turn to protect you ' ladies and gentlemen , with grateful hearts , we honor freedom s defenders and our military families represented here this evening by sergeant norwood s mom and dad , janet and bill norwood in these four years , americans have seen the unfolding of large events we have known times of sorrow , and hours of uncertainty , and days of victory in all this history , even when we have disagreed , we have seen threads of purpose that unite us the attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom s power to change the world we 're all part of a great venture to extend the promise of freedom in our country , to renew the values that sustain our liberty and to spread the peace that freedom brings as franklin roosevelt once reminded americans , each age is a dream that is dying , or one that is coming to birth and we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born the abolition of slavery was only a dream , until it was fulfilled the liberation of europe from fascism was only a dream , until it was achieved the fall of imperial communism was only a dream , until one day it was accomplished our generation has dreams of its own , and we also go forward with confidence the road of providence is uneven and unpredictable , yet we know where it leads it leads to freedom thank you , and may god bless america
women may possess a hidden cache of stem cells in the bone marrow that constantly replenish the ovaries with new eggs , a new study suggests the idea contradicts longestablished scientific dogma that holds that a woman is born with a complement of eggs that must last throughout her reproductive life the theory , proposed by researchers at the massachusetts general hospital , would , if confirmed , have major implications for fertility treatments , but at present it has many critics the researchers , led by jonathan tilly , report in this week s issue of cell that the cache of germline stem cells in the bone marrow send cells via the blood stream , to the ovaries , which signal to the marrow when new supplies are needed their work depends mostly on experiments with mice but they also cite cases where women have received bone marrow transplants after chemotherapy and unexpectedly conceived the result , the researchers suggest , of receiving a new supply of oocytemaking cells from the new bone marrow the new theory , if true , would reinforce the view of the bone marrow as the ultimate repository of the body s regenerative powers blood cells are known to be renewed from stem cells in the marrow , as are those of bone , cartilage and fat , and some researchers believe the heart is also replenished from the marrow dr tilly s team would now add the reproductive system to this list he is exploring whether a similar system may exist in men to replenish the spermmaking stem cells of the testes but the idea has not yet won acceptance among other researchers in the field at the annual meeting in quebec this week of the society for the study of reproduction , dr tilly debated his theory with david albertini of the kansas university medical center dr albertini said the general reaction of his colleagues to dr tilly s theory was overwhelmingly negative dr tilly , however , said that although dr albertini had canvassed several laboratories working on the problem , none had reported any results disproving the theory there was nothing presented that refuted our work , dr tilly said dr tilly s work has been published in two leading scientific journals whose reviewers presumably advised that the research had merit in an article in nature last year , he argued that there must be some source from which new oocytes are generated after birth in the article in this week s cell , he writes that he has tracked down this apparent new source of oocytemaking cells to the bone marrow no other scientist has yet published work confirming the nature result dr tilly said it was still early for anyone to have repeated the complex experiments as for the general reaction to this theory , he said , there is a level of skepticism by some , but we have cohorts of colleagues who believe in the work , so it depends who you ask in his new work with mice , dr tilly has shown that cells from the bloodstream of a donor mouse will home in on the ovaries of a recipient mouse whose oocytes have been destroyed but he has not yet accomplished the final stage of showing that the donated cells , which he believes are oocytes , can be fertilized and generate baby mice this experiment will take several months to do properly , he said dr kutluk oktay , an expert on reproduction and fertility at the weill cornell medical center in new york , said that the amount of evidence presented in the cell article was pretty compelling to me , and that the skepticism of other researchers was to be expected , given that a longstanding dogma was being overturned dr tilly s theory , if correct , would have far reaching implications for the treatment of infertility , for instance through techniques to stimulate the bone marrow into stepping up production of oocytemaking cells a press release issued by the massachusetts general hospital quotes dr tilly as saying , we may be ushering in a new era in the clinical management of female infertility and menopause dr albertini characterized that statement as hyped beyond belief dr oktay , on the other hand , said that if dr tilly s work can be extended to people , we might be looking at an end to menopause as we know it right now
gen william c westmoreland , the army artilleryman and paratrooper who failed to lead united states forces to victory in vietnam from 1964 to 1968 and then made himself the most prominent advocate for recognition of their sacrifices , spending the rest of his life paying tribute to his soldiers , died monday night in a retirement home in charleston , sc , his son , james ripley westmoreland , announced the general was 91 westy , as he became known while a west point cadet , led fastmoving artillery battalions in world war ii and became a paratrooper as the army prepared in the 1950 s for the new kind of war he would face in vietnam there , he presided over a vast buildup from 16 , 000 troops when he arrived to more than 500 , 000 in 1968 , when a devastating communist offensive caused president lyndon b johnson to lose confidence in the strategy and replace the general though he was dogged by antiwar protestors and denounced as a war criminal when , as army chief of staff from 1968 to 1972 , he tried to speak on college campuses , after passions cooled general westmoreland led a march of vietnam veterans to their memorial in washington in 1982 and , tearfully , a gathering of 200 , 000 veterans in chicago in june 1986 he never understood the war as a vietnamese nationalist struggle against french and later american domination ho chi minh and his communist successors believed they could outsuffer and outlast those they saw as foreign invaders supporting a puppet south vietnamese regime general westmoreland believed that hundreds of thousands of american troops could root out the communist insurgents and enable freedom and democracy to grow in vietnam , but that washington lost its nerve , and lost the war had president johnson changed our strategy and taken advantage of the enemy s weakness to enable me to carry out the operations we had prepared over the preceding two years in laos and cambodia and north of the demilitarized zone , along with intensified bombing and the mining of haiphong harbor , the north vietnamese doubtlessly would have broken , he wrote in his memoirs instead , as he saw it , the united states in the end abandoned south vietnam president richard m nixon did not take decisive steps to win , and after most united states troops withdrew in 1973 after a ceasefire , communist tanks rolled into saigon \( now ho chi minh city \) in 1975 despite the final failure of the south vietnamese , the record of the american military services of never having lost a war is still intact , general westmoreland wrote his firm jaw , bushy eyebrows and ramrod military bearing made the sixfoottall william childs westmoreland the very image of a general , though he said he learned from an early encounter with a softspoken major named omar bradley that there was more than one way to command in later years , he often spoke to veterans' groups , his son said , getting to all 50 states that became , in effect , his raison d' tre , mr westmoreland said in a comment quoted by the associated press he did have a point of view on vietnam , but he did not speak about that he was not trying to justify anything a bright early career general westmoreland s rise to command in saigon came after an early career that caught the eye of senior officers who later became influential during the kennedy administration , notably gen maxwell d taylor , who was commanding the 82nd airborne division in sicily when they first met in 1943 and later influenced president john f kennedy s thinking on counterinsurgency warfare the general was born on march 26 , 1914 , near spartanburg , sc , where his father was a cottonmill manager who later became an investment banker his paternal ancestors included soldiers who had served during the revolutionary war and with the confederate army , but after graduating from high school in pacolet , he went to the citadel , the state military college , in 1931 his father wanted him to study law after graduation , general westmoreland wrote in his memoir , a soldier reports \( doubleday , 1976 \) but instead , james f byrnes , an influential family friend , secured for him an appointment to west point , which he entered in 1932 explaining to an uncle who had been with lee at appomattox that he was going to that same school that grant and sherman went to , he felt better after his uncle replied , that s all right , son , robert e lee and stonewall jackson went there , too he graduated with the class of 1936 and at fort sill , okla schofield barracks in hawaii and fort bragg , nc , led a leisurely life of the field artillery officer formal dinners and dances , horse shows and polo \( at a time when artillery pieces were still horse drawn \) at fort sill , he first met the daughter of the post executive officer , katherine \( kitsy \) van deusen , 9 years old at the time they were married in 1947 and had three children a daughter , katherine stevens westmoreland a son , james ripley westmoreland ii and another daughter , margaret childs westmoreland general westmoreland s wife and children survive him he went to north africa in 1942 as a lieutenant colonel in command of the 34th field artillery battalion , part of the ninth division , which went to sicily and later landed in normandy , but not in the first wave on june 6 , 1944 he was the division s chief of staff when the division entered germany and was decorated for his actions in a battle at the rhine crossing at remagen , but suffered no injuries somehow none of the enemy s shells had my number , he wrote returning to fort bragg after the war , he commanded a parachute infantry regiment for a year and then , under another commander influential in his later career , maj gen james m gavin , became chief of staff of the 82d airborne division , remaining there for three years general westmoreland went to korea in 1952 as commander of the 187th regimental combat team and later clashed with a division commander who ordered him to withdraw one of his battalions from a hill where it was engaged with chinese communist forces the general complied only under protest transferred to the pentagon in late 1953 , he ran the army s manpower office , a perch from which he observed the eisenhower administration s struggle with a decision whether to rescue stranded french paratroopers in vietnam at dien bien phu with troops or even nuclear weapons the french were left to their defeat , and vietnam was split in two in 1954 , with ho chi minh s communists in charge of an independent state north of the demilitarized zone at the 17th parallel and their adversaries struggling to reorganize south of it , with american help the difference in the later american commitment was that the stigma of french colonialism was removed , general westmoreland wrote later , though the north vietnamese communists and their followers would not agree general taylor made him secretary of the army general staff in 1955 , and three years later , he took command of the 101st airborne division in fort campbell , ky , moving to west point as superintendent in 1960 as vice president , johnson went there in 1961 to deliver the commencement address , telling the cadets he was confident that their class would nail the coonskins to the wall the following year , gen douglas macarthur told them , your mission remains fixed , determined , inviolable it is to win our wars that was general westmoreland s mission when he was chosen by the johnson administration a few months after president kennedy s assassination to go to vietnam as deputy to the united states military commander there , gen paul harkins , and replace him in june 1964 as a full fourstar general replacing general harkins with westy , robert s mcnamara , then secretary of defense , wrote in his book in retrospect \( times books random house , 1995 \) , helped to signal president johnson s determination to increase the effectiveness of us policy and operations in indochina as head of the united states military assistance command in vietnam , general westmoreland decided that far more american combat involvement was necessary to enable the struggling south vietnamese military to resist the more disciplined and organized communists at the beginning of 1964 , there were only 16 , 000 american military advisers in south vietnam political instability in saigon , the general wrote in his memoirs , made escalation vital 'a pandora s box' the overthrow and killing of president ngo dinh diem of south vietnam in a coup by officers in november 1963 , the general wrote , had opened a pandora s box of political turmoil seriously deterring effective prosecution of the war and leading directly to the necessity of introducing american troops to fight if south vietnam was not to fall after the announcement that american destroyers in the gulf of tonkin were attacked by north vietnamese gunboats in august 1964 , the american buildup followed , with the number of ground troops climbing to 470 , 000 in 1967 the general had gained approval for the buildup because american troops seemed to be winning most of their battles with the north vietnamese and the communist guerrillas in south vietnam the idea was to use superior american force , supported by overwhelming air bombardment and artillery fire , not to seize or hold territory but to kill enemy soldiers in their jungle redoubts american forces often went into these battles in helicopters , withdrawing the way they had come but leaving many to wonder why ground won with such difficulty could be surrendered with such ease driven by requests from mr mcnamara and the white house , body counts seemed to show that the strategy was working , that more communist troops were being killed than americans but american casualties rapidly mounted into the thousands , at a time when the military draft meant that not only volunteers but young men off the streets could be sent to risk their lives in the jungles as protests against deepening american involvement mounted , general westmoreland warned that encouraging the enemy in this way could cost american lives yet , he said in a speech in new york city in april 1967 , the end is not in sight , and he added , in effect , we are fighting a war of attrition then he flew to washington to ask for still more reinforcements to bring united states forces up to 550 , 500 , the minimal essential force , or 670 , 000 , the optimum the request shocked johnson , who asked , where does it all end \? mr mcnamara asked how long it would take to win as general westmoreland recalled his answer , it was with the optimum force , about three years with the minimum force , at least five no decision had been made when the communists launched an offensive during the tet lunar new year festival on jan 31 , 1968 they blasted into more than 100 cities and towns , occupied hue for 25 days , and even fought their way into the grounds of the american embassy in saigon washington s optimism about progress shattered clark m clifford , whom johnson had put in charge of examining the troop requests and who later succeeded mr mcnamara as secretary of defense , had turned dove and defeatist , general westmoreland later wrote , and the president had lost his stomach for the battle johnson announced he would not run again for office in 1968 , and told the general he was appointing him army chief of staff he should ignore press speculation that he had been kicked upstairs , the president told him , but it was true the men met in the white house in the midst of riots that had started after the assassination of the rev dr martin luther king jr and afterward flew over the embattled capital while fires were still burning it looked considerably more distressing than saigon during the tet offensive , general westmoreland observed president richard m nixon pursued a different strategy after he took office in 1969 while washington spared the bombs and the enemy talked but said nothing and agreed to nothing except the shape of the conference table , the war went on for four more years of american involvement , general westmoreland later wrote that is hardly anything to claim credit for when general westmoreland was promoted to army chief of staff , he was succeeded in the vietnam command by gen creighton w abrams jr , a fellow member of the west point class of 1936 general abrams departed from general westmoreland s way of operating he emphasized measures to strengthen the south vietnamese military s capability to do battle , and deployed american forces around cities and in other populous areas back in washington as the army chief , general westmoreland oversaw efforts to adjust the army to the postvietnam period gen bruce palmer jr , who served with general westmoreland in vietnam and washington , wrote in his book , the 25year war \( the university press of kentucky , 1984 \) that the army benefited greatly from general westmoreland s leadership in the pentagon , but that the general was deeply hurt by the slights accorded him by nixon administration officials , who rarely consulted him on vietnam affairs when general westmoreland was not chosen as chairman of the joint chiefs in mid1972 , he retired and moved to charleston he made a foray into south carolina politics in 1974 , running for the republican gubernatorial nomination , but was defeated in the primary by state senator james b edwards , a conservative veteran of many years of republican politics after the campaign , the general told supporters i was an inept candidate i'm used to a structured organization , and this civilian process is so doggone nebulous an inconclusive libel suit in 1982 , general westmoreland filed a 120million suit against cbs over a documentary , the uncounted enemy , which he claimed accused him of misleading johnson and the public about the war while he was in command in vietnam the suit came to trial in 1984 in federal district court in manhattan eighteen weeks of testimony ensued , in which some senior american officers who had served under general westmoreland in vietnam contended that he had been influenced by political rather than purely military concerns in reports about enemy strength that were sent to washington when he dropped the suit early in 1985 , he said he had come to believe that the trial , involving complex legal issues , was a nowin situation for him in a statement at the time , cbs declared that it did not believe that general westmoreland was unpatriotic or disloyal in performing his duties as he saw them the general said that he interpreted that statement as a victory and that it constituted an apology for what the program had charged but cbs called that interpretation invalid and continued to contend that its documentary was accurate as the soldier prays for peace , he must be prepared to cope with the hardships of war and to bear its scars , the general wrote in his autobiography the quotation was a paraphrase from a speech by general macarthur in a striking coincidence , it was also in 1982 that the vietnam memorial was dedicated on the mall in washington , one of the first events at which thousands of vietnam veterans felt they could openly claim a salute from the american people though the crowds were smaller than organizers had hoped , general westmoreland , characteristically , was there this is an expanded version of the obituary published in some copies yesterday correction july 30 , 2005 , saturday an obituary on july 20 about gen william c westmoreland , who commanded united states forces in vietnam from 1964 to 1968 , misidentified a world war ii position held by maxwell d taylor , a senior officer who eventually helped advance westmoreland s career when the two first met , in 1943 , taylor , a future chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , was division artillery commander of the 82nd airborne , not division commander 1 3 1 3
the last leg in the marathon effort to close indian point , the nuclearplantthatprobablywo n't , revved up tuesday night with about 175 people gathered at the town hall here they came to hear robert f kennedy jr , the chief prosecuting attorney for riverkeeper , the environmental group that has done so much to clean the hudson and would love to shutter indian point the meeting was part pep rally , part comingout party for the group s final strategy before i go into what that is , let me say that if the effort to close the plant seems to have lost urgency somewhere along the way , it s not you though the issue was of broad concern after the 2001 terror attacks , the concern was not deep enough to have the plant simply photoshopped off the map back then there was bipartisan agreement on indian point riverkeeper and state assemblyman richard l brodsky , both stalwart opponents , were quick to point out how many local politicians across the party spectrum were calling for decommissioning problem was , new york s three most powerful politicians gov george e pataki , a republican , and senators charles e schumer and hillary rodham clinton , both democrats were not chiming in with that collective voice although they occasionally expressed concern about various aspects of the plant s operation , none ever called for its closure that , says jim steets , a spokesman for entergy , is because the governor and the two senators are apparently not as gullible as others might be about the hazards and complaints they also are probably painfully aware of two other factors emphasized on tuesday by mr steets \( whose company owns indian point \) demand for power is on the increase , and the region has no other ready power alternatives though there has been talk of everything from wind power to a giant extension cord from upstate , nothing has been decided on and there is no central decision maker when the federal government ratified indian point s widely ridiculed evacuation plan in 2003 , shuttering the plant became even less likely the county is now spending several hundred thousand dollars to study issues like whether the plant can be converted to gas , an idea that earns derision from some the plant is privately owned , said george oros , minority leader of the county legislature , so it would be like telling mcdonald s you want them to turn into a kentucky fried chicken and it s not like the county can do it when we ca n't run an amusement park and do n't have the money to keep the hospital afloat this is the atmosphere in which riverkeeper has announced its new effort to close the plant , admitting that this is its last chance it wants to force the federal government to deny operating licenses , which must be renewed for one reactor by 2013 and the other two years later riverkeeper s lobbying effort is focused on the passage of local antilicensing resolutions which could ultimately bring pressure to bear on the nuclear regulatory commission , the agency that issues the licenses another possibility the state could demand that by the time of relicensing , the plant install a new cooling system at at cost of hundreds of millions of dollars , this would be prohibitively expensive for entergy and might forestall relicensing altogether whether this will reignite the debate or amount only to a brief resurgence in interest is unknown but it is all too well known that new licenses , once bestowed , would be good for another two decades if they successfully apply , our campaign is effectively over , said alex matthiessen , executive director of riverkeeper \( with so much at stake , the group has begun criticizing mrs clinton and mr schumer \) during the pep rally , mr steets stood in the back of the room , ready with counterarguments he said that entergy would most probably apply for relicensing in 2008 five years before the first deadline but he gave the slightest bit of wiggle room by not committing absolutely if there is hope for mr kennedy and the small , dedicated band who gathered on tuesday , it is that eliot spitzer , now running high in the polls for the governor s office , came out for decommissioning maybe he will win , and the two senators will eventually follow his lead drawing \( drawing by nancy doniger \)
baghdad , iraq , july 5 gunmen ambushed the senior bahraini and pakistani diplomats in separate attacks as they drove through the capital on tuesday , spurring pakistan to announce the withdrawal of its ambassador from iraq even as insurgents tried to undermine the new government by striking at muslim envoys , iraqi politicians made some progress on writing a new constitution , in an effort to give iraq political legitimacy in a meeting , shiite and kurdish politicians accepted 15 sunni arabs who had been chosen to increase sunni representation on a constitutional committee in the attacks on tuesday , the bahraini diplomat , hassan malallah alansari , was struck in the right hand by a bullet and taken to a hospital , while the pakistani ambassador , muhammad yunis khan , escaped unharmed , though a car in his convoy was raked by bullets the ambushes came three days after the top egyptian diplomat here was kidnapped as he drove alone through western baghdad insurgents appear to have begun an organized campaign to drive muslim diplomats out of iraq as the american and iraqi governments are pressing arab countries to send ambassadors here and upgrade their diplomatic ties the militant group led by abu musab alzarqawi , the jordanian fighter , said in an internet posting late tuesday that it had kidnapped the egyptian diplomat , ihab alsharif the message said mr sharif was abducted by the hands of our mujahedeen , and he is under the control of the mujahedeen the group made no immediate demands at least 10 iraqis and one american soldier died in other guerrilla attacks on tuesday the meeting of the constitutional committee ended a brief impasse that had developed because a few committee members had tried to disqualify some of the sunnis because they might have been senior baath party officials in theory , sunni arabs will now have more say in the constitution , though it is unclear how representative these politicians are of other sunnis and whether they will be able to work smoothly with the committee the white house had been urging the 55member committee , which before tuesday had only two sunni arabs on it , to be more inclusive , in hopes of politically coopting the sunniled insurgency the relocation of pakistan s ambassador to amman , jordan , from baghdad after the attack comes as a blow to the bush administration s efforts to win more international backing for the american and iraqi enterprise here pakistan has been president bush s most crucial ally in the war in afghanistan , and the presence of its ambassador here lent an important show of support to iraq from a crucial muslim nation we are watching the deteriorating security situation in iraq very closely , and ambassador khan has been relocated to jordan , a pakistani foreign ministry official , muhammad naeem khan , said in a telephone interview in islamabad it s a temporary measure , solely to ensure the safety of our ambassador it will be reviewed as soon the situation improves he added that the pakistani embassy would remain open in baghdad mr khan was assigned to his post three months ago though pakistan has full diplomatic ties with iraq , predominantly sunni arab nations have yet to upgrade their missions here to that status in late june , egypt and jordan said they planned to strengthen ties , after secretary of state condoleezza rice

names the committee agreed with sunni leaders last month that the constitution would only be drafted by consensus but mr hamoudi said tuesday that consensus did not mean unanimous approval as long as

the rise of american democracy jefferson to lincoln by sean wilentz illustrated 1 , 044 pp w w norton company 35 this enormous book by sean wilentz has been in the works a long time , and the results are nothing less than monumental an oldfashioned account of the rise of democracy during the first half of the 19th century , it is a tour de force of historical compilation and construction that more than justifies all the articles and monographs on antebellum politics written by historians over the past several decades wilentz , the daytonstockton professor of history at princeton , has drawn extensively on these secondary sources and on his own research he has brought it all together into a clear and generally readable narrative coming in at just over a thousand pages , the rise of american democracy is one of the longest works of history to appear recently , and this at a time when most histories and biographies are getting shorter , presumably because of our reduced attention spans wilentz makes no concessions to his readers' patience he has filled his book with an extraordinary multitude of details about nearly every conceivable aspect of antebellum politics , both at the state and federal levels of course , since context is everything in history , excessive detail of this kind warms a historian s heart , though whether anyone except a few scholars and informationhungry graduate students will have the stamina actually to slog through such an enormous work remains to be seen awesome in its coverage of political events , this is a long , long read wilentz s first book , chants democratic \( 1984 \) , was a celebrated study of the rise of the working class in the early republic , an especially appropriate subject for a scholar known for his devotion to liberal causes and the democratic party this new book is an outgrowth of that earlier work , but it is not likely to receive similar acclaim from the scholarly left for it very much runs against the flow of current academic trends most historians today , especially those writing about the period wilentz is concerned with the period of the early republic from jefferson to lincoln are interested in what they call the new political history they seek to transcend the usual stuff of politics elections , parties and the political maneuvering of elite white males in government and to provide a history that views politics through the lenses of race , gender and popular culture so they devote themselves primarily to the symbols and theatrics of politics the various ways common people , including women and blacks , expressed themselves and participated in the political process , whether in parades , costume or drinking toasts these historians believe culture trumps policy and power they explicitly reject any sort of narrative of dead white males bringing about the triumph of democracy within the twoparty system this , however , is the very subject of wilentz s book wilentz is well aware of the new political history indeed , elsewhere he has expressed his contempt for it , assailing it as filled with bargain basement nietzsche and foucault , admixed with earnest american dogoodism , that still passes for 'theory' in much of the academy in opposition to the fashionable emphasis on culture , he wants , he says , to highlight the independent existence and importance of politics however significant social and cultural developments were to the american people in the early republic , these developments , he claims , were perceived primarily in political terms as struggles over contending ideas of democracy from the late 19th century to our own day we are apt to see economics , society or culture as the ground for politics and political institutions but , wilentz says , for the people of the early republic , politics , government and constitutional order , not economics , not society , not culture , were still the major means by which the world and the men who ran it were interpreted he therefore feels justified in making this inyourface challenge to the new political historians and in writing this oldfashioned narrative by focusing on men like jefferson , jackson and lincoln , however , he does not mean to say the presidents and other great men were solely responsible for the vicissitudes of american politics , since ordinary americans had a profound influence on the exercise of power but just as political leaders did not create american democracy out of thin air , so the masses of americans did not simply force their way into the corridors of power leaders were always important it is a fact of life , he writes , that some individuals have more influence on history than others , even if they cannot make history as they please conceived as a narrative , his book , wilentz explains , can be read as a chronicle of american politics from the revolution to the civil war with the history of democracy at its center , or as an account of how democracy arose in the united states \( and with what consequences \) in the context of its time his huge work is divided into three sections , each a goodsized book in itself the first \( almost 200 pages \) , entitled the crisis of the new order , on the jeffersonians the second and the heart of the book \( 340 pages \) , entitled democracy ascendant , on the jacksonians and the third \( 270 pages \) , entitled slavery and the crisis of american democracy , on the coming of the civil war these sections are bounded by a prologue and an epilogue the rise of democracy , wilentz points out , was not a given from the outset it developed piecemeal , by fits and starts , at the state and local as well as the national level it emerged , he says , through a constant struggle among different groups that cut across distinctions of wealth , power and interest \( though they often claim the same democratic ideals \) in order to demonstrate this struggle , wilentz takes us through all the national elections \( and some of the state ones \) , the presidential administrations , many of the congressional bills passed and defeated , and much of the complicated political maneuvering of the period this accumulation of detail nicely recaptures some of the contingency of daytoday politics that the participants experienced along the way wilentz offers some beautifully drawn and concise vignettes of important events like the antislavery printer elijah lovejoy s martyrdom , the amistad affair , the dorr rebellion of dissidents in rhode island and john brown s raid that are better than many booklength accounts we can get some idea of where wilentz is coming from by noting the book that seems to have most influenced him arthur schlesinger jr s pulitzer prizewinning history , the age of jackson before schlesinger s book appeared in 1945 , wilentz writes , historians thought of american democracy as the product of an almost mystical frontier or agrarian egalitarianism but schlesinger , reflecting the new deal perspective of the time , toppled that interpretation by placing democracy s origins firmly in the context of the founding generation s ideas about the few and the many , and by seeing democracy s expansion as an outcome of struggles between classes , not sections the age of jackson , wilentz says , located the origin of modern liberal politics in the belief of jefferson and jackson that the demands of the future , in schlesinger s words , will best be met by a society in which no single group is able to sacrifice democracy and liberty to its own interests in 1945 , the interest group schlesinger was most worried about was what he labeled the business community or the capitalists although wilentz is too sophisticated to posit something as crude as the business community , he nevertheless believes that some sort of class struggle lay behind the politics of the antebellum period in other words , he writes as a good liberal , but an oldfashioned new deal one like schlesinger in 1945 , he wants in 2005 to speak to the liberalism of the modern democratic party by suggesting that the race , gender and cultural issues that drive much of the modern left are not central to the age of jackson , wilentz seems to imply that they should not be central to the future of the presentday democratic party a s he was for schlesinger , andrew jackson is wilentz s hero jackson s presidential victory in 1828 , he writes , marked the culmination of more than 30 years of american democratic development in fact , wilentz may help to recover the descriptive rubric the age of jackson , which has fallen out of favor since schlesinger wrote his book in his account of the politics of the time , wilentz includes all the usual personalities and anecdotes the eaton affair , the clashes with calhoun , the bank veto and he generally comes down on the side of jackson and the jacksonians he even makes credible jackson s radical monetary actions , including the bizarre policy of removing all the federal government s specie deposits from state banks and placing them in the treasury vaults , where they would have little effect on the money supply or the economy in 1957 , bray hammond , in his pulitzer prizewinning study , banks and politics in america from the revolution to the civil war , severely criticized jackson s banking and monetary policies , suggesting that they were backed by state bankers and others who wanted a free hand in running their commercial affairs but wilentz shows that jackson , unlike jefferson , was no promoter of laissezfaire economics instead , his antibank policies were devised to keep private interests , particularly speculative and business interests , out of the government the key to jacksonian politics , wilentz says , was a belief that relatively small groups of selfinterested men were out to destroy majority rule and , with it , the constitution the jacksonian democrats assumed that politics and government institutions remained the primary locus of power , and that power was to be used to protect the majority of producers farmers , mechanics and other workers in the society from a nonproducer elite composed of bankers , speculators and other moneyed men if they did not invent democracy , he writes , the jacksonians did make this way of thinking the basic credo of american liberal democracy there s a hint in all this history that the presentday democratic party might greatly improve its bearings by going back to its jacksonian roots these days , most historians would not look to jackson for anything worthwhile indeed , modern scholars have bashed jackson nearly as much as they have jefferson , picturing him as a raging fanatic , a passionate slaveholder and a violent indianhater who removed native americans to the transmississippi west and created the trail of tears this sort of criticism did not exist 60 years ago schlesinger never even mentioned indian removal in the age of jackson in fact , he has no entry for indians in his index unlike schlesinger , however , wilentz confronts the issue head on , offering a generally impartial account nor does he deny the many contradictions and dilemmas of jacksonian egalitarianism , especially on racial matters and slavery he concedes , for example , that the jacksonians celebrated the expansion of white suffrage in some of the northern states in the 1830 s , giving the vote even to white aliens , at the very time they were taking the franchise away from free blacks who had voted for a generation or more \( mostly for federalists and whigs \) wilentz also admits that the jacksonians tolerated slavery and were friendlier than their opponents to efforts that would widen its spread but he denies the charge of some historians that this made the jacksonians a proslavery party in short , he makes no attempt to hide the flaws of either jackson or the jacksonian democrats he does , however , provide as powerful a defense of jackson and jacksonianism as we are likely to get in this day and age wilentz insists that the various recent interpretations of the jacksonian era contain only partial truths these are the studies that emphasize an entrepreneurial consensus over economic conflicts that believe religion , ethnicity and other cultural issues drove jacksonian politics that contend the jacksonian democratic party was an alliance of slaveholders and racists eager to clear out the indians in order to make the imperial republic safe for slavery and that depict jacksonianism as a movement of subsistence farmers and urban workers resisting capitalism all of them , he says , slight the dynamic and unstable character of the democracy s rise and development , and the primacy of politics and political thinking in the conflicts of the era and none of them can take away from the fact that the jacksonians created the first mass democratic national political party in modern history wilentz is especially anxious to distinguish the jacksonian democrats from the whigs the democrats , he writes , were economic radicals intent on creating a hardmoney currency regulated by the federal government by contrast , the whigs believed in a creditandpaper , boomandbust economic system moreover , he denies the claim of some historians that the whigs were the optimistic party of active government and the democrats the pessimistic party of laissezfaire if anything , he says , the opposite was true to wilentz the whigs resemble the republicans of today as long as the whigs appeared to be the party of the rich and privileged , he says , they would never win a national election but in 1840 they reinvented themselves as the party of the people for the whigs to purport to represent the people , wilentz says , they had to talk more like the people , or how they thought the people talked so they stressed american exceptionalism , denied the existence of classes and with a combination of calculation and improvisation mastered the art of popular flattery , repackaging their message in order to bamboozle the public the whigs even had their own boy genius , the 43yearold insidermanipulator thurlow weed the whigs , wilentz writes , were especially successful in reorienting debates along ethical and cultural lines that cut across differences of wealth and class if they could have conceived of gay marriage , they would have used the issue good democrat that he is , wilentz cannot quite believe that the whigs in 1840 \( any more than the presentday republicans \) truly represented the majority of the people the democrats were natural democrats , the whigs artificial ones the democrats never doubted that they were the constitutional party of the sovereign people thus it was only a matter of time before the fraudulence of the whigs would be exposed it was the issue of slavery that finally destroyed the whig party \( although slavery broke the democrats apart , it did not destroy them \) a merica s politicians tried from the beginning to table the explosive issue of slavery to bury it , postpone it and hope against hope that it would just go away but it would not disappear by the 1840 s the manysided conflicts over american democracy , wilentz says , came to focus on thefate of slavery by then it had become increasingly clear that the freelabor north and the slaveridden south had developed two very different systems of democracy while those two systems often appealed to the same ideals and values , and were linked through the federal government and the national political parties , they were fundamentally antagonistic despite the leaders' attempts to suppress these antagonisms , by 1860 the conflict could no longer be contained , as a democratic election sparked southern secession and the war that would determine american democracy s future it is one of the many ironies of american history that the wildfire spread of democratic politics in both the north and the south eventually made it impossible to solve the problem of slavery peaceably to learn how the triumph of democracy nearly destroyed the united states , this book is a good place to start gordon s wood is the alva o way university professor and professor of history at brown university his most recent book is the americanization of benjamin franklin
the street vendor looked both ways before he whispered , i have the real ones in my car , down the street he left and brought back what he initially claimed were the latest louis vuitton handbags , hidden in a black plastic trash bag i should get 200 , but for you , i 'll make it 180 , he said the vendor , at the corner of 59th street and fifth avenue , near the plaza hotel , was insulted when the deal , for a cheap imitation of the real thing , was turned down but these are the real copies ! he argued new york city s street vendors sell many things , from souvenir photographs of manhattan s skyline and beaded slippers made in india , to cellphones and fake silk ties , to african wooden masks and the cr me de la cr me imitation designer handbags and sunglasses most of the designer accessories , and nearly all of the watches , are barely disguised knockoffs of famous brands the more fakelooking , law enforcement officials say , the more legal occasionally , the vendors offer something out of the ordinary like handmade leatherbound journals from italy , selling for 20 to 30 on a table outside balthazar , the soho restaurant on spring street near the corner of broadway a block away , doron tvizer sells , for 10 , necklaces and earrings he makes of shell and brass street vending in new york is as old as pushcarts but now , buying from manhattan s vendors has grown increasingly chic , especially among young people although there are no official numbers of shoppers or total sales vendors are not required to report such figures city officials and regulators agree the number of street vendors has grown exponentially , the sellers have diversified their wares and business is booming traditional retailers , especially the department stores , are not thrilled by this development but live with the vendors , who tend to set up tables just outside store doors street vending is big business , said marshal cohen , chief retail analyst for the npd group , a market research firm in port washington , ny , and vendors can be better than department stores at spotting the trends not only that , the vendors are sometimes more flexible , he said if the stores are sold out of , say , pink handbags , they 're out of luck for the season but the vendors can get stuff airshipped from china in a week in 1979 , the city capped at 853 the number of licenses for nonfood vendors for an annual fee of 200 another 1 , 704 vendor licenses are held by military veterans , who are not required to pay fees and there are the first amendment vendors who sell artwork , books , records , cd s and even baseball cards they also pay no fee and need no license the business must be lucrative there are now 3 , 133 nonveterans waiting for a license to become available , according to jonathan mintz , the acting commissioner in the department of consumer affairs many more vendors operate illegally , officials say success is contagious while the police try to clamp down on unlicensed vendors , the outdoor sellers are getting bolder and the customers just keep coming we definitely came here for the street vendors , said jessica wilson , 22 , a store clerk from chicago , in new york on vacation this time we came for sunglasses not all are great , but some are good , and i always bargain ms wilson was paying 25 for fake chanels many shoppers know the score most of the goods are copies of whatever is hot in handbags , eyewear and jewelry but that s the point buyers relish the idea that for 25 they can get a passable copy of a handbag that would cost 250 if they bought the real thing or a lot more c'mon , the street vendor with the black trash bag said , this is a copy of an 8 , 000 bag standing at the corner of 46th street and broadway , jessica davenport , 19 , a tourist from toronto , had just bought a pashmina scarf for 5 well , it s supposed to be pashmina , she said with a laugh her friend , jordan deketer , also 19 , was wearing some rings he had bought several days before they turned my fingers green at first , he said , but now they 're fine the vendors' youthful customers are not all tourists kaila clark , 14 , from harlem , was shopping with her mother in the theater district the most popular thing out there are chanel and louis vuitton bags , dvd s and knockoff baseball caps , kaila said although there are street vendors in other places chicago , san francisco , washington and toronto all have a significant number new york is known for the variety of its merchandise there are no statistics on how much is sold by street vendors try asking waiters how much tax they pay on your tips , said philip reed , chairman of the city council s consumer affairs committee mr reed estimates that hundreds of millions of dollars of goods are sold each year mr cohen , with the npd group , agrees there s at least 100 million of business done right on the street , he said yesterday the city s comptroller , william c thompson jr , estimated in a report he issued last year that the city loses 1 billion in tax revenue because of trafficking in counterfeits , but the numbers in the study were later criticized by a local columnist as inflated regardless of the amount , most city officials agree that the vending community does not pay its fair share of sales taxes mr reed is trying to bring order to a system he calls chaotic by proposing a vendor overhaul bill that would limit the number of vendors to six on a block but would also expand the number of streets on which vendors can show their wares i'm not against the vendors , he told one right outside his office near city hall but he complains that the situation including too many illegal vendors and too many arcane regulations that no one understands must be revamped while he holds hearing after hearing five so far he says the number of vendors , especially the illegal ones , is growing the police throw up their hands , mr reed said there is virtually no enforcement the street vendors congregate in a handful of the most popular neighborhoods for tourists 125th street in harlem the corners surrounding bloomingdale s at 59th street and lexington avenue around bergdorf goodman at 57th street and fifth avenue in the theater district in the west 40 s soho up and down broadway near spring street , and along canal street between broadway and west broadway the goods come from a variety of distributors almost all of the handbags , hats , photo frames and sunglasses are made in china on friday and saturday mornings , it is not unusual to see vendors lining up near a truck in the theater district to receive shipments of goods many vendors say they get their merchandise in long island city , queens or from outlets in brooklyn like traditional retailers , street vendors buy at wholesale prices and mark them up the vendor outside bergdorf s wanted 35 for an obvious knockoff of vuitton s newest plasticcoated canvas bag , the one with the cherries on it without much bargaining , he came down to 25 , but would not budge from that i paid 17 , he said the bag with the cherries , an imitation of the limitededition vuitton bag by the artist takashi murakami , may or may not be legal to sell , according to city officials in general , the legality of a knockoff depends on how similar it is to the authentic item even a bag without the trademark lv or a watch with kolex instead of rolex is not necessarily legal while each case is different , company lawyers say , a series of court decisions has produced guidelines for which imitations might be considered counterfeit , and therefore illegal , and which are considered legal interpretations in one sale , a street vendor told a customer that if she paid 5 more , he would include the label , a small black fabric strip with kate spade on it he brandished the label , and a glue gun \( on may 24 , the united states house of representatives passed a bill that would make illegal the mere possession of these labels even without the handbags to go with them manufacturers of luxury goods hailed the legislation , which must still pass the senate \) chanel sunglasses are another popular item they are wraparound , with the interlocking c on each side of the lens , and usually sell for 10 , two for 15 \( the real ones sell for 285 and up \) some customers revel in the idea that some of the stuff is stolen , that it fell off the back of the truck that almost never happens virtually none of the items sold are authentic , but many tourists , young and old , do n't seem to care some of the outoftowners do not even know which designer is being knocked off who s this supposed to be \? asked judy einbinder , a retired advertising saleswoman from san francisco , holding up a knockoff marc jacobs lime green handbag with two pouch pockets in the front , with metal clasps it s \( unintelligible \) , the vendor at 57th street and lexington mumbled what \? ms einbinder asked loudly mcjacobs , the man muttered again , looking around mac jacobs , ms einbinder explained proudly to the woman next to her , who nodded sagely twentyfive dollars , said the vendor did the fact that selling these fakes might not be legal matter to the customers \? kaila s mother , jacqueline thompson , said she was somewhat bothered that the artists and musicians who made the cd s and dvd s were not getting their fair percentage , and the young tourists from toronto said if they knew the vendors were selling illegally they would not be buying but ms wilson , the shopper from chicago , said she did n't particularly care whatever , she said keeping her eye on the vendor , who was making change i'm not the one who s going to get into trouble about 10 blocks north in soho , andra millian , a doctor from austin , tex , who specializes in chinese medicine , was buying a fauxsuede belt for 10 we ca n't get this stuff in texas this belt would look really cool and very cute over a little skirt dr millian , too , was undaunted by the questionable legality of the goods everyone has their little business , she said this is n't hurting anyone , and anyway , i do n't live here retail executives those who run their businesses from the limestone and concrete edifices designed to lure customers into paying the maximum amount for heavily taxed goods not surprisingly disagree to james j gold , bergdorf s chief executive , the vendors are an eyesore they crowd the sidewalk , they impact the flow of traffic , he added robert burke , a vice president there , said the biggest problem was not that the vendors were stealing customers it s hardly going to impact our manolo business , he said loftily no , the biggest problem is navigating around them for many shoppers , mr burke continued , it is a question of integrity , not just money luxury is offered at all levels , and many different price points from a piece of chocolate to a handbag , they must have the very best that s made that satisfaction ca n't be replaced by frauds the traditional retailers may complain , but some say that , in the end , vendors do not affect their business it might be affecting the discounters or the novelty stores , mr cohen said if you shop on the street , you know it s not real , you know it s going to fall apart , that it s disposable you 're buying for the fun of it the vendors also have a tense relationship with the police across from city hall , james b williams had just gotten a ticket from a policeman he said my table was too long , he complained mr williams sells cellphones and cellphone accessories with other vendors on the street we all try to work together , he said we 're all out here making a living how s business \? i do pretty good , not great , but enough to survive i'm the sole support of my youngest children

a twostep , or maybe just one it became clear again last night that this is not a president with happy feet at the constitution ball , president bush told the crowd , i love my wife , laura , and i'm hoping to have a dance with her , maybe for the first time in four years on cue , the band began to play i could have danced all night and the president shuffled with his wife in a circle for exactly 30 seconds then it was on to the next gala as at all the parties , the guests in strapless gowns and gleaming tuxedos were lining up at cash bars for drinks and at a photo op where they could be snapped in front of an inaugural seal not all that different from a high school prom photograph dismay about the security lines was a constant , with women in opentoed dancing slippers wondering why they had to wait more than an hour to pass through the security checks , especially when their tickets cost up to 5 , 000 but no republicans wanted to be quoted complaining about too much security the commander in chief ball , honoring the military , was the standout event it was filled with men in uniforms , rather than tuxedos , dancing with women whose gowns did not all come from expensive boutiques the first president bush and barbara bush took to the stage early in the evening and said it was the only dance they would attend the elder mr bush said they were the proudest parents in the world that ball was the last stop of the evening for their son , who was scheduled to appear shortly before 11 pm but he dispatched with the other balls so quickly that he showed up more than an hour early he did n't linger by 10 03 he was back at the white house , presumably with his dancing shoes none the worse for wear for ball admission , everyone s special once upon a time , it is said , washington s elite craved admission to the inaugural ball anyone who is anyone is here , said theodore roosevelt s daughter alice , and a lot of people who are no one try to get in as well but that was in an age when there was one inaugural ball now there are nine balls for tens of thousands of people , a triumph of egalitarianism that does not thrill some washington power brokers offering an inaugural ball ticket to a georgetown socialite is a bit like offering an upper east sider the chance to spend new year s eve in times square we had to go when clinton was inaugurated and i can tell you they are all cattle calls , said melanne verveer , who was hillary rodham clinton s chief of staff in the white house i went to an inaugural ball once , said justice stephen g breyer of the supreme court they 're terrible i 'd rather be home in bed the other guy returns to his seat more than a few eyes this week were on senator john kerry , who attended the inauguration and sat next to senator tom harkin , the influential iowa lawmaker who supported howard dean in his state s caucuses the eve of the inauguration was the bittersweet anniversary of mr kerry s turnaround victory in iowa and he made a surprise appearance at a gathering of his former iowa staff at a capitol hill bar , the hawk and dove he was still in the role of his party s standardbearer yesterday when he released a statement saying , i 'll be ready to reach across the aisle anytime we can work in good faith to make our country stronger the white house may not be so quick to accept his gesture during the inaugural festivities andrew h card jr , the president s chief of staff , told cnn that mr kerry s vote against condoleezza rice for secretary of state was petty politics but last night , at least , mr kerry was out of the glare a big family dinner was planned the prudent speech is always a winner a week before mr bush s inaugural speech was delivered , rick shenkman had a good idea of what he would say professor shenkman , a historian at george mason university and editor of the history news network web site , had concluded that inaugural addresses sound so much alike because america has a civil religion that forces presidents to recite tenets from a national template first cast at the time of the founding fathers professor shenkman helpfully published a scorecard for the speech , a list of the recurring themes in previous addresses sure enough , by our count , yesterday s speech touched on seven of the themes deference to god america s mission to spread freedom , democracy and peace around the globe america as an example for the world commitment to tolerance requirement for national unity faith in the people s wisdom and worship of the founding fathers two other themes on the list were the idea that the president is the instrument of the people \( which mr bush left unsaid \) and the requirement that americans make sacrifices while mr bush praised the sacrifices made by soldiers , he did n't explicitly call on the public to make sacrifices an omission that did not surprise professor shenkman before the speech , he predicted that mr bush would leave out that particular tenet as he reasoned on tuesday , ca n't call for sacrifice with all those tax cuts when texans party , oil meets water let us now praise all things texan , except their new cocktail in the third , and reportedly the largest , such migration since 1989 , texans descended on washington this week they brought an armadillo and alligator from the fort worth zoo , which were on display at the black tie and boots ball wednesday , as was a wild array of texasflag ties , hats , necklaces and cummerbunds worn by the 12 , 000 guests the president appeared long enough to get in a dig at a fellow texan , asking whether tom delay , the house majority leader , was present if he is , he did n't get a very good seat , mr bush said , looking out at the crowd for mr delay he had another crack for

bundaberg , australia , june 18 when dr jayant patel accepted a surgical post at the municipal hospital here two years ago , it was a big relief to this farm town , which has had trouble finding and keeping doctors dr patel was a professor of surgery at the state university of new york at buffalo in the 1980 s , and he came highly recommended by several doctors in oregon , where he had also worked but almost immediately , after he declared a patient to be stable when in fact the patient was brain dead , at least one nurse worried about his competence before long , nurses were hiding patients from him one doctor ordered that dr patel not operate on any of his patients , after he saw him perform an operation without anesthesia an anesthesiologist nicknamed him dr death on monday , the state government commission of inquiry here will open a new round of investigation into whether dr patel , an american citizen educated in india , is responsible in any way in the deaths of 87 patients not least , it wants to know how dr patel was hired without anyone doing so much as a google search on his name such a search would have disclosed , as it did this year for a brisbane reporter , that dr patel had been disciplined in new york and oregon , and that he admitted errors to the oregon authorities after a review of the cases of 79 of his patients , 3 of whom died from surgical complications dr patel has returned to oregon , with a businessclass ticket paid for by the hospital , though it is not clear that he remains there his case is reverberating in australia and the united states , raising questions about how the medical profession regulates its doctors , especially those who evade troubled pasts by moving from state to state or country to country the commission recommended on monday that dr patel be charged with manslaughter and murder , saying that when an impostor pretends to be a medical practitioner , and kills a patient whilst attempting a surgical procedure , a murder charge is warranted dr patel s lawyer in portland , ore , stephen houze , called the recommendations outrageous , noting they came after just two weeks of testimony dr patel has not been charged with any crimes , he said if he eventually is , it is hard to imagine how he could get a fair trial in australia , mr houze said , adding , we have very grave concerns about this drumbeat of incessant and prejudicial publicity that is saturating all of queensland , and indeed all of australia he said he had met in portland this week with representatives of the queensland government , who had a letter for the doctor mr houze said he told the officials that dr patel was not a fugitive , and that he was in constant contact but he did not say where he was starting monday , the australian commission will hear from former patients and the families of deceased patients so far , the principal testimony has come from toni ellen hoffman , head nurse in the intensive care unit during dr patel s tenure in testimony bolstered by the hospital s director of medicine , ms hoffman told the commission that dr patel had performed numerous esophagectomies , operations to remove a cancerous growth on the esophagus , for which the hospital did not have followup facilities dr patel , she testified , retorted that he was bringing in half a million dollars a year in revenues for the hospital \( queensland hospitals are reimbursed for such operations \) ms hoffman said that patients had died because dr patel refused to transfer them to the better equipped hospital in brisbane that in many cases , a patient s surgical wounds came apart and that he routinely refused to perform ct scans on cancer patients , so that they were operated on when other treatments would have been better week after week , ms hoffman said , she witnessed troubling episodes she registered her concerns , in email messages , letters and orally , with her supervisor , the nurse s union and hospital administrators she was told it was a personality problem , she testified she could not go to the local newspaper , because the queensland state health department bars employees from talking to the press then in july 2004 , a man was brought to the hospital after being crushed by a camper van at first , dr patel said the patient , des bramich , was not in such serious condition that he needed to be taken to brisbane then , he said mr bramich was too ill to move mr bramich died dr patel screamed at patient s wife not to cry , ms hoffman wrote in notes of a meeting she then sought with hospital officials mr bramich s 9yearold daughter watched her father die , she added this was the final straw she laid out her concerns and asked for an independent audit the next month , the hospital chose dr patel as its employee of the month it was like a big slap in the face , she said more patients died finally , when the hospital was offering dr patel a new fouryear contract , in march of this year , ms hoffman , with considerable trepidation , contacted a queensland state legislator the legislator made a statement in parliament , which allowed the case to come to light ms hoffman was vilified , as doctors and politicians rallied to dr patel s defense it s an absolute disgrace that dr patel has been forced to leave his job , said the president of the queensland branch of the australian medical association bundaberg hospital has lost a surgeon when it could ill afford to do so at first , most bundaberg residents did not believe the allegations either , lucy ardern , editor of the bundaberg news mail , said in an interview now people do , she said , noting that circulation had increased noticeably , as residents try to follow the scandal the turning point came when a veteran investigative reporter at the brisbane courier mail , hedley thomas , did his google search , typing in jayant patel when he called the hospital and health department officials for comment , mr thomas said he was told that it was the first they knew of the disciplinary actions in new york and oregon now oregon medical authorities , too , are coming under criticism that they moved too slowly in 1989 , dr patel went to work in portland for kaiser permanente , jim gersbach , a spokesman for the nonprofit health care company , confirmed he was voted teacher of the year , in 1991 and 1992 , and he received one of the distinguished physician awards in 1995 but by mid1998 , questions about dr patel s work from fellow surgeons led kaiser to conduct a peer review and to bring his case to the attention of state authorities we then hired consultants to investigate that case , said dr joseph thaler , chairman of the oregon board of medical examiners we acted in 2000 to restrict his license the board s findings focused on four botched operations three of the patients , ages 65 to 83 , immediately developed complications and were returned to surgery for internal bleeding all three died the other patient , a 59yearold man with hernia symptoms , had to have a second operation to correct a colostomy that dr patel had performed backwards , according to the board s findings the board prohibited the doctor from doing operations involving the pancreas or liver , and required him to get a second opinion in complicated surgical cases dr thaler said that the board sent notice of its decision to three national databases all should be readily accessible to officials in australia , he said this april the board finally inactivated dr patel s license dr patel left kaiser in 2001 mr gersbach , the spokesman , would not say if he was asked to leave dr patel resigned , he said he took with him at least six recommendations , most from fellow kaiser doctors it gives me great pleasure to recommend jayant patel , wrote one doctor from kaiser another wrote that dr patel had above average knowledge of surgery and very high moral standards all were written after he had been disciplined in oregon through kaiser s public relations office , none of the doctors who wrote the letters would comment but mr gersbach noted that before dr patel was hired by kaiser , we also received favorable letters of recommendation from his employers in new york state there , in january 1984 , after an investigation and hearing , a state board declared dr patel guilty of medical fraud , negligence , incompetence and unprofessional conduct after he was found to have filled in medical histories for patients he never examined he was reprimanded and censured , and his license was suspended for six months the suspension stayed during a threeyear probation the punishment was routine it was n't anything drastic , dr william c heyden , who served on the hearing committee , said about the case he had n't done anything evil to anybody he had n't killed anybody or anything the reprimand did not stop dr patel from becoming an assistant professor of surgery at suny buffalo , and the director of surgical education at millard fillmore hospital after his troubles in oregon , dr patel tried to resume practice in new york but the medical conduct board concluded that he could be criminally prosecuted for what he had done in oregon rather than face prosecution , dr patel surrendered his license he began looking abroad and contacted a medical recruiting firm in sydney , wavelength consulting , which had been asked by the hospital in bundaberg to help find a surgeon wavelength , which was paid roughly 10 , 000 , relied on the documents submitted by dr patel at that time an 'internet search' was not considered a recognized or reliable tool for checking a doctor s history , the company said in a statement after the scandal erupted we , too , were deceived correction june 20 , 2005 , monday a picture caption yesterday with an article about a doctor under investigation by the australian authorities in the deaths of 87 patients used a misspelled given name in some copies for the intensive care nurse who testified against him she is toni ellen hoffman , not tony
one of the men tried to stab a young mexican woman he had forced into prostitution in new york , using the jagged edge of a bottle he had broken over her head another forced his girlfriend to have an abortion , saying it was necessary so he could keep selling her to men in brooklyn and queens a third told his own wife that he would kill her family back in mexico if she did not continue to service more than 20 men a night such were the accounts prosecutors were preparing to present yesterday in brooklyn federal court in what they said was one of the federal government s largest sextrafficking cases in the united states but the evidence was so overwhelming , said lawyers for the three young mexican men who were charged , that all three pleaded guilty to all 27 counts against them the prosecutors' filings and the men s emotionless descriptions of their business preying on vulnerable mexican women offered a glimpse yesterday into one of the city s netherworlds , a harrowing place most new yorkers never see i smuggled these women to new york from mexico so they could engage in prostitution , one of the men , josue flores carreto , 37 , told judge frederic block , through an interpreter his brother gerardo flores carreto , 35 , added , i assaulted them physically for disobeying my orders in reference to the prostitution jobs prosecutors said the third man , daniel perez alonso , 26 , wrote that his job of luring young women was like recruiting fillies for a race the three men , all of them slightly built , could be sent to prison for more than 30 years they pleaded guilty , their lawyers said , hoping for leniency the prosecutors , daniel r alonso and anne milgram , described the carreto family s business as a sprawling operation with roots in the central mexico town of tenancingo , stretching as far back as the late 1980 s consuelo carreto valencia , the mother of the two brothers who pleaded guilty , is being held in mexico on related sex trafficking charges in mexico and new york , prosecutors said in a filing , family members would recruit young , uneducated women and girls from impoverished areas of mexico and use some combination of deception , fraud , coercion , rape , forced abortion , threats and violence to compel them to prostitute themselves the three men said yesterday that they gave none of the money earned from the prostitution to the women the prosecutors identified eight women who had been forced into prostitution , but said they knew of many more as prosecutors described it , the path to sexual slavery usually began with seduction and sometimes included marriage there were , at the beginning , gifts , including chocolates , a stuffed teddy bear and roses some women were told they would have jobs in new york restaurants or laundries one of the women the prosecutors described was 17 when she met josue carreto at a pastry shop in tenancingo soon , prosecutors said , she had married him and had a child but , they said , she was only one of four women who bore his children and were forced into prostitution with threats , beatings and coercion the investigation of the carretos began in the summer of 2003 , the prosecutors said , when someone filed a complaint at the united states embassy in mexico city , saying members of the family were forcing young mexican women into sexual slavery in new york in january 2004 , federal agents raided two apartments used by the family in corona , queens , where they found condoms , advertisements for prostitution services and five young mexican women at least until yesterday , the prosecutors said , josue carreto did not acknowledge that he had done anything wrong from a brooklyn jail where he awaited trial , they said , he called a young mexican woman he had never met some 60 times the calls were secretly recorded he told her she interested him , the prosecutors said he sent her money he asked her to wait for him he called her the queen of my love his last call to her was last month
on a steaming august afternoon in washington , dc , a few years ago , two friends and i busted out of class oops , work early , and headed for maryland s eastern shore for blue crabs and cold beer we were baking as we sat in traffic on the black leather seats of my convertible finally , we got to the chesapeake bay bridge and paid the toll , and neil slipped a disc into my cd player the first familiar piano chords sounded the screen door slams mary s dress waves if you stick to 61 miles per hour , it takes exactly 4 minutes 49 seconds to drive over the bay bridge , the same time it takes bruce springsteen to get through thunder road , the opening song on the world s best driving album , born to run bruce rereleased born to run this week , 30 years after it first came out over the years , i 've driven thousands of miles to bruce , but none so sweet as on that day we went over the bay bridge to thunder road halfway across the bridge , the temperature dropped 10 degrees , to 88 , and that s when bruce got his guitar and learned how to make it talk it was the perfect pause in the middle of an anthem , a chance to look out at the sailboats dotting the bay , at all the other washington escapees cruising in search of tomorrow my car s out back if you 're ready to take that long walk from your front porch to my front seat the door s open but the ride it ai n't free shailagh and i had our arms up in the air maybe celebrating just the thrill of singing with the boss as we barreled across the last part of the bridge bruce said , i'm pulling out of here to win , and we played imaginary pianos with him on that last trill that leads into clarence clemons s saxophone we were on the eastern shore proper and in a completely different place , psychologically , than when we drove past that tollbooth i got the 30thanniversary box set on tuesday , the day it came out , and spent the next three hours watching the two included dvd s on a laptop at work \( research , of course \) but my favorite part listening to my beloved born to run cd all over again i could n't do in the office everybody on 'born to run' is out , or trying to get out , bruce says on the dvd that s the underpinning no kidding so i slid my new cd into my portable player and headed out , walking through downtown manhattan but i was also in my car once more , cruising over the bay bridge helene cooper
faced with a court order and unyielding demands from the families of victims , the city of new york yesterday opened part of its archive of records from sept 11 , releasing a digital avalanche of oral histories , dispatchers' tapes and phone logs so vast that they took up 23 compact discs for the first time , about 200 accounts of emergency medical technicians , paramedics and their supervisors were made public , revealing new dimensions of a day and an emergency response that had already seemed familiar in details large and small , the accounts of the medical personnel uniformed workers who were often overlooked in many of the day s chronicles , but were as vital to the response and rescue efforts as any others provide vivid and alarming recollections they spoke of being unable to find anyone in authority to tell them where to go or what to do nearly from the moment the first plane struck the world trade center , they had little radio communication as their leaders struggled to set up ordinary procedures for a mass casualty incident , the crisis gathered speed by the minute with the lines of command sundered , many of those interviewed said , they became their own bosses they found themselves shepherding crowds away from the towers , serving as trauma counselors , bandaging people inside a bank lobby , and packing their ambulances with the dazed , the bleeding , the burned as scores of city and private ambulances arrived , an orderly system for treating patients never developed some medical triage centers were set up blocks from where the injured were leaving the towers a medical chief arrived at the main fire command post and found the chief of the fire department cursing his nonfunctioning radio a team of medics told how they tried to treat a firefighter , daniel suhr , who had been hit by a woman falling from one of the towers , but realized he had no vital signs and had catastrophic injuries nevertheless , they continued to work on him , carrying out hopeless resuscitation efforts , in deference to two shocked firefighters who accompanied him in the ambulance they kept yelling , 'danny , danny , danny ! ' said richard l erdy , an emergency medical technician who treated firefighter suhr another paramedic recalled seeing one of his colleagues , carlos lillo , helping patients , staring at the north tower and breaking into tears mr lillo s wife , cecilia , worked there she survived he did not the newly released records capture a moment in history as seen through thousands of eyes , and as told in hundreds of voices some halting , some confident , almost all disbelieving no single document could be definitive about an event that swept across so many lives , but the release of these accounts one cd alone encompassed more than 12 , 000 pages of oral history transcripts begins to fill in major parts of the day s history the oral histories were gathered in 2001 on the instructions of thomas von essen , who was fire commissioner on sept 11 the new york times sought copies under the freedom of information law in early 2002 , but mayor michael r bloomberg s administration refused , leading to litigation earlier this year , the state court of appeals ordered the release of most of the materials eight families of people killed at the trade center , represented by the civil liberties lawyer norman siegel , joined the suit to seek the release since then , the interest has grown , and the fire department has sent cd s to 460 families today we are one step closer to learning what happened on 9 11 in nyc where we excelled , where we failed , said monica gabrielle , whose husband , richard , died in the south tower in particular , the records released yesterday provide the most detailed view yet of the operations of the emergency medical services , which became a division within the fire department in 1996 i just think a lot of people do n't realize what we , ems , went through , alan cooke , an emergency medical technician , told interviewers for the fire department a spokesman for the department said major changes had been made since the terror attacks there has been vast improvement in communications , said the spokesman , francis x gribbon there is no question that ems personnel are more prepared today to handle a largescale emergency in this city in his 64page oral history , zach goldfarb , who had just finished an overnight tour of duty as the citywide chief of operations when the first plane struck , said that even the deaths of some medical workers were overlooked in the tally and recognition of the responders who died the fire department lost 341 firefighters , officers and a deputy commissioner in addition , two paramedics employed by the department died , bringing its total losses to 343 but chief goldfarb said six emergency medical responders from private hospitals also died we keep talking about the losses on this job from an ems standpoint and we say there were two , carlos lillo and ricardo quinn , chief goldfarb said there were six other ems professionals that died in this incident on our mission he said the emergency medical network was a hodgepodge of voluntary hospitals and voluntary ambulances and commercial ambulances he added but you know what \? they all came in to do our mission and i think that they need to be recognized as such , and i think it s a disgrace to us that we 're not counting the names of these six dead people in his account , chief goldfarb said he decided not to report to the south tower , as ordered , believing that it was too hazardous to cross west street finding about 30 paramedics and emt s on west street , he sent them into the world financial center a few minutes later , the south tower collapsed mr quinn , who died , had originally been among those 30 people as the ems workers set out for the trade center that morning , more than a few went without being called still others decided to make extra preparations among them , chief james martin recalled the lack of supplies after the 1993 bombing of the trade center i filled the car up with several bottles of water , and i brought my little radio charger , chief martin said knowing that the new 3 , 500 radios were out there but we did n't have chargers for them , i threw that in chief goldfarb had written a report on the 1993 response , and he worried about the effects of merging the medical service into the fire department just a month before sept 11 , 2001 , he had spoken with a fire chief about the 1993 attack i told him , for reasons i wo n't go into now , the response would be very different if we had to relive this thing , different not necessarily in a positive way , chief goldfarb said in his oral history so here we are four weeks later and we were actually living it lt rene davila was one of the first officers to arrive on the scene , unsure if his agency had done any preplanning now that it was part of the fire department in any case , he said , he did not relish being in command you know you see that guy on '911' or something like that , and he s a hero or something and he s a big shot or whatever , lieutenant davila said well , i was given the opportunity to be that guy , and i immediately did not want it he shouted himself hoarse , he said , trying to ensure that patients were not simply loaded into ambulances but were triaged that their injuries were evaluated and that the most seriously hurt were taken care of first john rothmund , an emergency medical technician , spoke of the trouble finding any supervisors no brass , he said so me and my partner tried to find authority figures , and there was really none around improvisation , not routines , became the order of the day arriving at the corner of west broadway and vesey street , a paramedic , manuel delgado , saw part of an airplane crush the front of a police car he and a doctor drove a bleeding police officer to nyu downtown hospital , then returned eventually to a triage area on the north side of the trade center there was just a stream of people running , running , running , and basically at this point our triage was , if you 're walking , keep walking , and if people are being carried or people were falling , we would move forward , mr delgado said they collected a badly burned woman in a red dress , he recalled , then a man who had serious burns over most of his body he was carried out halfway and i guess collapsed or someone dropped him and just ran , mr delgado said we picked him up and started bringing him out he continued we had more patients than we had ambulances we were stuffing four and five people in an ambulance at this point i mean , it was just to get people out of there with minimal treatment there was nothing you could do the demands of the moment consumed every bit of the attention of the medical workers once you got there , i did n't even notice the time , lt patrick scaringello said could n't tell the time the relations between city and private ambulance services , always tense , were also badly strained by the surge of ambulances that came to the scene actually , the biggest downfall to this whole thing was probably the communications with the private ambulances , said justin lim , an emergency medical technician they had no clue what to do a radio system that enabled the private hospitals and their ambulances to communicate with other city emergency agencies had been tested during the preparations for y2k the millennium but the project languished , according to hospital officials \( the city now hopes to better integrate its medical service with the other responders , in part by having the dispatchers for each agency work side by side two new buildings , at a cost of 1375 billion , will open next year , according to gino menchini , the city s technology commissioner \) with the collapse of the south tower , the first to fall , at 9 59 am , any semblance of an orderly system vanished inside a bank on broadway and murray street , medical crews were treating people they all panicked and they all stampede out , said felipe torre , a medical technician we followed out , because everybody was wanting to get out the walls shook and then we felt it at a triage area on the corner of west and vesey streets , a medical technician , faisel abed , worked for an hour on patients , until the collapse of the south tower with the grace of god , we had gotten all the people out of there , he said a group of the medical chiefs met , in part by chance , outside the embassy suites hotel in the world financial center and went into the lobby to set a new plan for control but when they tried to communicate the plan to the entire force , they could not contact the dispatchers i think that probably the biggest impression i got out of this whole thing was this is probably as close to being in an infantry unit that gets overrun , said joseph cahill , a paramedic we are scattered everywhere nobody knew where anybody was nobody knew who was in charge it really felt for a moment that i was in 'apocalypse now , ' where martin sheen goes 'where is your co \? ai n't that you \? no uhoh ' the first fatality among firefighters had been firefighter suhr , hit by the falling woman as the paramedics who brought him to the hospital headed back to the trade center , a nun and an emergency room doctor climbed into the ambulance as they drove , they encountered an emergency medical technician walking toward them out of a cloud of smoke the buildings were now down and he was holding his helmet they asked where his partner was , and the wandering medic responded that he had left him i'm looking for my father , he explained he was in the world trade center we said , 'why do n't you get in the back with us \? ' recalled soraya o 'donnell , an emergency medical technician online the sept 11 records the complete set of the fire department s oral histories , a log of some of the emergency calls it received , and audiotapes of the agency s dispatchers deploying companies that morning are on the web nytimescom sept11
charleston , sc , oct 6 eddy curry , still a heart patient but not yet a knick in good standing , was sitting thursday morning , intently watching his wouldbe teammates run fastbreak drills in a college of charleston gymnasium dressed in black warmup gear and white sneakers , and accompanied by his trainer , tim grover , curry was no more than a spectator in a baseline seat albeit the largest spectator in the gym , and certainly the most scrutinized the knicks were still waiting for test results to determine the health of curry s heart , and for some of his medical records to arrive from chicago team officials had expected to conclude their evaluation by thursday , but instead announced that it would take another day so two days after the league approved the trade that sent curry from chicago to the knicks , and three days after the teams agreed to the deal , curry remained in paperwork limbo he was also off limits though he chatted briefly and amiably with a couple of reporters , curry was not permitted by the knicks to answer questions we 're still waiting for some tests to come back , said the team president isiah thomas , who said tuesday night that results would be back by wednesday afternoon i misspoke the other day because of the jewish holidays , i guess there was some slowdown in some of the process , in terms of getting some doctors available we 're also waiting for some more information to come from chicago hopefully , this will be resolved soon under nba rules , the physical examinations of all five players in the trade must be completed by 6 pm friday the deadline can be extended if both teams agree thomas said he hoped that everything would be resolved before then and that curry would be cleared to practice with the knicks friday afternoon until all of the traded players have passed their physicals , none are permitted to practice with curry idle and under a gag order , others were left to speculate on his mindset and his health , and the issues that cloud his career he s just real relaxed and having fun , said knicks guard jamal crawford , one of curry s closest friends and a former teammate of curry s on the bulls he s happy to be here asked if curry was worried about his status , crawford said , if he is , he s not really showing it jerome james , who most likely would be curry s backup at center , said the team gave him a nice , warm welcome , a knick welcome i'm happy to have him here , james said his presence here has even raised the expectations on this team a little higher curry s future in the nba has been engulfed in controversy since the spring , when he was found to have an irregular heartbeat and an enlarged heart some doctors believe he is at risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , or hcm , an abnormal thickening of the heart muscle that has proved fatal in athletes the bulls benched curry , a promising 22yearold center , for their final 19 games , including the playoffs , last season as a precaution on the advice of one of the nation s leading experts on hcm , dr barry maron , the bulls asked curry to take a dna test curry refused , and the bulls fearing that his life could be at risk if he played vowed to bench him for the 20056 season the stalemate ended with this week s trade , and the burden shifted to the knicks for the second time in three days , thomas expressed confidence that the knicks were doing everything possible , short of a dna test , to assess curry s health thomas also said for the first time that he expected the knicks' doctors to consult maron , adding that curry had been examined by some of the best doctors in the world asked if he was worried about the worstcase scenario that curry , if he had hcm , could die on the court thomas said , i know so much has been written and so much has been said , but until we actually know , i do n't allow myself to really go down that road the curry case is being watched closely by other teams and by league officials we are monitoring the situation , said tim frank , a league spokesman but it s not appropriate for us to comment further at this time it is believed that the league s monitoring process includes league doctors independently evaluating curry s test results yet for john paxson , the bulls' general manager , nothing short of the dna test could mitigate the concern that curry could die on the basketball court no one could assure me that that could never happen , paxson said thursday in a telephone interview from his office in deerfield , ill i wish eddy well i just know that from my standpoint and from the chicago bulls organization and all the people here , we would rather go winless than to risk what we could possibly have risked here the knicks' philosophy backed by another expert who examined curry , dr david cannom is that even the dna test is not conclusive cannom and his associate , dr charles pollick , believed the enlargement of curry s heart was caused by a benign condition known as athletes' heart and was not lifethreatening cannom assured them that eddy had no greater risk than anybody in the nba , said curry s attorney , alan milstein the knicks believe they can assess curry s health through alternative testing but the knicks were apparently the only team willing to make that gamble no team offered curry a contract this summer when he was a restricted free agent and , according to paxson , no other team offered to trade for curry i had several teams tell me they were n't interested because they were scared about his health , paxson said assuming curry is cleared medically , the next challenge would be to get him in basketball shape he has not played since march 28 curry spent the offseason in chicago , working out at hoops the gym , which is run by grover , curry s trainer and the former trainer to michael jordan friends said curry ran and lifted weights , but because he was not under contract , he was not permitted to participate in scrimmages there thomas said he spoke with grover , who assured him curry had worked hard every day he has n't taken a day off , thomas said grover told him conditioningwise , he s done everything that he s asked him to do he has n't played live basketball , because you ca n't simulate that curry , a native of the chicago area , grew up a bulls fan and wanted to stay there but thomas said curry was very happy about the possibility of being on the knick team his attitude has been great throughout all of this , thomas said it s been a very probably troubling time for him but for the most part , his attitude has been great rebounds antonio davis returned to chicago on thursday , and the knicks appeared to begin to set the stage for his possible release davis , acquired in the eddy curry trade , went home to be with his wife , whose mother is having surgery but davis has also made it clear to the knicks that he was unhappy with the trade he was really down last night , said coach larry brown , who coached davis in indiana brown seemed ready to oblige davis if he wants to be waived to return to chicago i do n't want to stand in the way if he does n't feel comfortable , brown said i 'd be disappointed , but you do n't want somebody that does n't want to be here if the knicks cut davis , they will still have to pay him the 14 million left on his contract , or reach a buyout agreement isiah thomas sounded reluctant to do so he really has no choice , thomas said this is n't charity quentin richardson , jerome james and stephon marbury sat out both practices thursday , each nursing a strained left hamstring richardson and james have missed three consecutive sessions with only 12 players healthy and available , the knicks signed forward matt barnes , who practiced thursday morning
with all the shirts adorned with the solemn face of the argentineborn revolutionary che guevara being sold in the city s souvenir shops , one would think he had once adopted new york and not cuba as his home that thought not to mention that face puzzles some latins in manhattan whose families had no choice but to leave havana after the cuban revolution more than 45 years later , these exiles are still here , fidel castro is still there , and che is all over as fashion statement but a group of these cubanamericans whose politics range from liberal to conservative decided to make their own statement at the beginning of this year , members of the cuban cultural center , an arts group that usually sponsors exhibitions and concerts , adopted an independent library in cuba they chose one in las tunas , cuba , the felix varela independent library , which is named for a cuban priest famous for his work for immigrants and the roman catholic church in lower manhattan in the 1800 s the library itself , like some 100 others that have been founded since 1998 , offers cubans an alternative to the official media or staterun libraries they carry newspapers and magazines from around the world or books considered taboo by the regime like animal farm by george orwell i know firsthand what it is not having something interesting to read , said the jazz saxophonist paquito d'rivera , who left cuba in 1980 and who voted to adopt the library i know what it is like to have to hide to read something that the government calls subversive almost two years ago , about 11 independent librarians in cuba were among 75 dissidents , journalists and others arrested and given prison sentences of up to 28 years for essentially collaborating with enemies of the state most are still in jail , despite an international outcry although new york is home to magnificent libraries , worldclass publishers and fierce champions of free expression , the cultural center is the only group in the city so far to adopt an independent library they hope their action will send a dual message it s not just about sending whatever books we can , but we want the people in cuba to know they are not alone and that someone here recognizes what they are going through , said rafael pi roman , an anchor on channel 13 who belongs to the cultural group the dilemma is , we are doing this in a city where people have too often seen fidel castro as a romantic figure the main advocate for the independent libraries is robert kent , a reference librarian at the new york public library \( whose gift shop drew exile protests last year for selling watches emblazoned with che s face \) he visited cuba often in the 1990 s , and began taking books there , ultimately with the aid of some exile organizations his work recently led the cuban government to accuse him of being roberto x , a spy conspiring to assassinate a highranking official i'm still trying to figure out who s cashing all my cia paychecks , he said jokingly he is earnest , however , in insisting that librarians must defend intellectual freedom or risk tarring their reputation he and his supporters hope to persuade members of the american library association , a national group whose members issued a statement last year that expressed deep concern over the dissident arrests as well as over the united states embargo against the island while the group said the reasons for and conditions of the dissidents' detention should be fully investigated by human rights investigators , it did not urge the dissidents' immediate release you do n't throw people in the slammer for expressing ideas , said john w berry , the chair of the ala s international relations committee in this case it was complicated by cuban law and the notion that some of the dissidents were accused of accepting money and material from the us government in an effort that , in the cuban government s mind , was seen as undermining their government mark rosenzweig , a library association member who directs the reference center for marxist studies , an archive of communist party documents , said those arrested were political partisans in cahoots with the united states government these people were caught up in an unfortunate affair set up by the regime change experts in the united states , said mr rosenzweig , whose archive is in the same west 23rd street building as the communist party usa i ca n't say they got what they deserved , but they ended up violating the laws of the cuban state they were tried in trials which to the best of my knowledge conformed to the principles of cuban legality human rights groups like amnesty international and human rights watch which for years have been denied entry into cuba have no doubts about what happened in 2003 and have repeatedly called for the release of people they consider prisoners of conscience but they know that any criticism they make of the cuban regime will be countered by praise for cuba s gains in health and education cuba continues to violate the fundamental civil and political rights of a good many of its citizens , said william f schulz , the executive director of amnesty international usa yet there is considerable ambivalence about cuban political prisoners in general from those who are often traditionally advocates for human rights victims the members of the cuban cultural center have encountered those attitudes pablo medina said that until recent years he faced a frustrating response at the new school university , where he teaches creative writing the attitude there , a place which is traditionally known as a neomarxist enclave , was a reticence to look at the cuban question , he said it was difficult to open people s eyes or get anyone to listen to you he said the arrival of former senator bob kerrey as university president in 2001 signaled a shift at the college , which in the 1930 s became a haven for european scholars fleeing totalitarian regimes the response from others used to be 'i do n't know what is happening' or that economically the cuban people were better off , mr medina said but after the dissident arrests in 2003 , i got a call from kerrey asking what he could do so we gave the university in exile award to five cuban dissidents some members of the cultural group think that as more people in traditionally liberal circles begin to see what is happening in cuba s dissident movement , they will realize that the idea of opposition to mr castro goes far beyond old stereotypes of rightwing tropical exiles screaming for the cameras the group itself is nonpartisan , and its members range from liberal to conservative i have no idea what the politics are of anybody is in this room , mr pi roman said but none of us would say there should be human rights for cuba but not for those people who are on the other side none of us would have supported apartheid one thing is sure there is no hypocrisy if you are for human rights for some , you have to be for human rights for all
of all the things it s hard to imagine isabelle huppert doing dressing injudiciously , championing veganism , giggling her way through a pedicure the most unthinkable is willfully committing a crime against posture at 52 , ms huppert surely possesses the most regal carriage of any actress working today it provides the platform for the impassivity that has marked her film career for more than three decades in recent years , ms huppert has used this presence to portray characters with a perilously misguided idea of how much they can control to these women in highshouldered garments , lovers seem as governable as house pets until inevitable erotic atrocities bring that delusion to an end throughout her acting life , ms huppert has regularly appeared onstage in france this week she is to make her new york theatrical debut at the brooklyn academy of music , in the role of a woman who ca n't even pretend to a semblance of fortitude the play is sarah kane s 4 48 psychosis , \( 448 psychose in french \) and the nameless heroine has never had any misconceptions about her sexual sovereignty an account of a young woman s mental breakdown , the play is a meditation on the suicidal will , one made all the more harrowing by the fact that ms kane killed herself a few months after she wrote it , six years ago , at the age of 28 directed by ms huppert s friend claude r gy , psychosis requires the actress to remain onstage for its entirety , rarely veering from expressions of torment when desperation visits , the character says , i shall hang myself to the sound of my lover s breathing kane wrote the play in english , but the brooklyn academy s executive director , joseph v melillo , who is committed to bringing international work to his theater , wanted to commission the production of the play he had seen in paris , in which mr r gy had directed ms huppert in french this may test the patience of even her most ardent monolingual fans \( to prepare the audience , the academy went so far as to send a letter to ticketholders advising them that supertitles will be minimal \) typically , ms huppert has been drawn to characters who mute their despair rather than deliver it so unabashedly speaking of the play in a telephone interview from her apartment in paris last month , she said in some way , though , i feel i can totally be myself , even though there are so many limitations i'm still for two hours i can be angry , emotional , abstract it is as if i could be doing 100 plays in one evening while 4 48 psychosis is having its run in brooklyn , more familiar images of ms huppert will appear in counterpoint the play s arrival has occasioned a citywide tribute beginning on oct 17 , and running through nov 23 , the museum of modern art is offering a retrospective of her work that will open with her latest film , gabrielle , based on a joseph conrad story , and that will include a number of her films with claude chabrol , as well as otto preminger s 1975 rosebud , in which she is among a group of young welltodo women who are kidnapped by middle eastern terrorists a new book , isabelle huppert woman of many faces , is devoted to pictures taken by photographers as varied as robert frank , henri cartierbresson and peter lindbergh most of these pictures will be on view at an accompanying exhibition at ps 1 contemporary art center in queens that runs from oct 23 to dec 5 i'm very happy , ms huppert said of all the attention she is receiving in new york but when this sort of thing happens , it s best to have a certain detachment the day after 4 48 psychosis had its premiere in los angeles two weeks ago , ms huppert seemed in an incongruously cheerful mood speaking from her hotel room near the campus of the university of california , los angeles , where the play was presented , she said she felt that the first night had gone well , the audience having retreated into a deep and extended silence she did nothing to prepare herself for the role each evening , ms huppert said a few days later i try not to be too tired , she said i have no stage fright i 've had stage fright before but here i feel nothing i like doing it it demands more from the audience than it does from me in a way it s a hallucinatory experience my mind goes very far away the troubling qualities of the piece do not elude her there s a paradox between someone who kills herself and someone who seems to have such a feeling for life , she said one of the last lines is 'i have no desire for death , no suicide ever had' i see a little girl who almost wants to awaken the world , it s a shout it s a way to say , 'i die' it is not a selfcomplaint it s much more alive , aggressive , political i see the play as an act of rebellion when mr r gy decided to stage 4 48 psychosis he considered no other actress no one else , he said , could have done justice to its intellectual integrity the interpreting of the text requires more strength than vulnerability , he said the inner strength of a lucid and implacable confrontation with death and the strength to make the confrontation a public one intellectual integrity was not always ms huppert s m tier a child of the paris suburbs , she graduated from the city s conservatoire d'art dramatique where , as she put it , i was not a steady student and did not learn much she made her first film at the age of 16 and has made more than 70 since for many years , she has lived quietly on the left bank with her companion , ronald chammah , and her three children , a 20yearold , a teenager and a boy of 7 there is no window provided on her domestic life in the 160 pictures in the book virtually none reveal her as someone you might know , a mother you might see in the park , an acquaintance with whom you would have coffee she always seems above easy emotionalism , immune to trivial afflictions immune even to age she looks womanly at 25 and girlish in her late 40 s what the book captures most pointedly is the impression that ms huppert is someone who has never suspended herself in romantic longing when she loses her dominion over a lover on screen , she does n't wallow she dismisses him , extinguishes a rival or extinguishes herself when her handsome young student abandons her in the piano teacher , a 2001 film for which she won the best actress award at cannes , her character , erika , puts on a fulllength skirt , stretches her neck , efficiently removes a knife from her evening purse and inserts it into her chest ms huppert was not driven to acting by a passion for it , she said her relationship to her art seems paradoxical do i learn from it \? she said of her work no , i think what i expect from acting is more disappointing i see it as a form of narcissism , a source of selfexpression , a source of pleasure lots of actors will have you believe that there is something altruistic about acting , but there s nothing altruistic about it for me and i never learn anything about myself i'm too detached from my work but i do n't think you ever really learn anything about yourself you find some way to deal with reality , to cope , to enjoy life , but there s a blank hole about yourself , about your relationships i do n't think that ever goes away in her own case , performance helps fill the blankness i became an actress because there was something missing in me , she said something is always missing otherwise i 'd stop
spokane , wash , dec 7 seven months after a newspaper reported that mayor jim west , one of this state s most prominent conservative republicans , was a closeted gay man who had used his city computer to troll for sex with young men , nearly twothirds of voters here decided to oust him in a rare recall election , according to results released wednesday but while the ballot had only one name on it that of the 54yearold mayor , a former leader of the legislature the votebymail election was somewhat of a referendum on changing attitudes in spokane , while also upsetting the balance of power in this city of 200 , 000 people mr west , who will leave office on dec 16 , has a long history of opposing gay rights , and he once backed a measure to prevent gay men and lesbians from teaching in public schools there have been a lot of lessons out of this , to tell you the truth , mr west said at a news conference on wednesday it s helped me straighten out my personal life the scandal that brought him down has also prompted a long civic discussion about sexual orientation and privacy , and may have had the paradoxical effect of improving the lives of gay men and lesbians here it s been fascinating to watch how this turned out , said kevan gardner , a leader here of the pride foundation , which provides grants for gay programs the lesson a lot of people picked up was that lives lived in dishonesty are lives not welllived at the news conference , mr west said he planned to sue the newspaper , the spokesmanreview , that had aggressively reported on his secret life , hiring a computer expert to pose as a 18yearold high school senior who communicated with mr west through a gay chat room the conversations , which the newspaper published , revealed a man who was tortured about his sexuality the mayor said publishing the material had violated his privacy rights the newspaper said it set up the online ruse only after hearing rumors about mr west s offering city jobs in exchange for dates with young men later , an independent investigator hired by the city found that the mayor had violated city policy by using his office computer to download images and messages from gaycom , a web site mr west has not been charged with a crime not long after the newspaper revelations , mr west characterized himself as a brutally outed homosexual , but the city s gay residents were largely unmoved and shunned him with this election , we 're maybe a little closer to a day when everyone in this city can be honest about who they are , said bonnie aspen , a business owner who is active in gay and lesbian causes at the news conference , mr west said he had done nothing wrong as mayor i have no regrets as far as being mayor , he said i do have regrets for things in my personal life i wish those things had never occurred , and i'm embarrassed by them asked to elaborate , he said , it s none of your damn business mr west said he had not changed his positions on any of the antigay stands he took while serving as republican majority leader in the state senate except for one , when he backed a proposal to prevent gay schoolteachers in the recall campaign , mr west appeared to be a man without a constituency republicans and most business leaders who had backed him in previous campaigns supported the recall or were neutral mr west was invited to tell his story at a forum sponsored by gay leaders , but he turned them down the gay leaders say the forum , and similar discussions throughout the city , helped to dispel myths about being gay , while showing the hypocrisy of some politicians even though mr west lost much of the support of the city s leaders , they were cautious about trying to remove him , at first the recall was largely a result of a single mother , shannon sullivan , who started a petition drive and successfully defended the effort before the state supreme court i wanted my 9yearold boy to be proud of his mayor that s why i got involved , ms sullivan said the big guys with the money were scared to take him on asked about the sexual politics of the vote , ms sullivan said this should not be read as an antigay vote i would have been just as outraged had the mayor been trolling for 17yearold girls a prominent democrat , tom keefe , said that what had turned voters against mr west was the gap between his private life and his public statements this is a guy who used to use code words against his opponents , questioning someone s family values , mr keefe said in the end , what you had was a 54yearold man in a position of authority trolling the internet looking for casual sex with high school students the mayor has been fighting colon cancer , which has spread to his liver , and undergoes chemotherapy every two weeks some voters said they felt sorry for him mr west said wednesday that he had endured seven months of pounding , grinding me to dust , by the spokesmanreview but the newspaper s editor , steven a smith , said in an interview that the articles , and the vote , were not about a gay man in a conservative community the mayor s comments after the articles were published may have roused people to support gay men and lesbians here , while turning out the mayor , mr smith said when the mayor went on the 'today' show and said he took all those antigay positions because that s what his constituents wanted , that played very badly here , he said mr smith also defended the newspaper s use of a virtual surrogate he said it was similar to reporters' secretly tracking gary hart , a former presidential candidate , to determine if he was having an extramarital affair this is the cyberversion of hiding in the bushes , mr smith said
after years of investor activism , are shareholders winning or losing the struggle to be treated with the respect that company owners deserve \? a vote today by investors in pathmark stores may provide an answer the shareholders of pathmark , a supermarket chain in new york , new jersey and philadelphia , are voting on the purchase of a potentially controlling stake in the company by the yucaipa companies , an investment firm based in california yucaipa is run by ron burkle , a supermarket magnate who is better known as a major democratic contributor the 150 million deal will initially give mr burkle s company a 40 percent interest in pathmark , if it goes through but yucaipa would also receive warrants to buy additional pathmark shares that would increase the firm s stake to 60 percent pathmark s directors have recommended that shareholders approve the transaction under the proposal , yucaipa would buy its stake for about 7 a share none of the yucaipa money will go to pathmark shareholders it will go to the company , which will use it to spruce up some of the 142 pathmark stores , build new ones and pay down debt pathmark s stock closed yesterday at 860 if shareholders say yes to yucaipa , mr burkle s company will receive five board seats and will be in a position to prevent any future bidders from taking over the company yucaipa would also receive a fiveyear consulting contract worth 3 million a year , as well as the repayment of expenses up to 500 , 000 a year under the contract , yucaipa would provide advice to pathmark on corporate strategy , marketing and retail development the yucaipa bid is certainly a ray of sunshine for pathmark shareholders , who have endured some bleak years the company , which emerged from bankruptcy protection in september 2000 , said last week that it lost 21 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and that sales at stores open at least a year inched ahead just 01 percent from the same period in 2004 the stock hit a low of 350 last fall after the company repeatedly reduced its earnings projections but some pathmark shareholders question why the company s board continues to recommend the yucaipa deal over competing bids that are far higher and that would actually put money in its owners' pockets for example , one bidder , which the company has not identified , said it would pay 875 a share to buy pathmark outright this offer is backed by a financing commitment , pathmark regulatory filings have noted \( none of the bidders have identified themselves \) nevertheless , when they vote today , pathmark shareholders will not be allowed to choose the better of the various offers that have been made for the company rather they will decide to accept or reject the yucaipa transaction because they have been given so few details about competing bids for the company such as who is making them and how they would be financed pathmark s shareholders are being asked to trust that their board has done the necessary due diligence to arrive at the appropriate decision on the deal institutional shareholder services , an influential investor advisory firm in rockville , md , has advised its clients to vote against the yucaipa deal the firm said that pathmark s board had failed to provide the company s shareholders with adequate rationale for rejecting an apparently superior bid for the entire company in favor of the offer of a partial investment from yucaipa at a lower price it s never been clear to us that the board went through all the steps to ensure that they had the best bid on the table , said pat mcgurn , special counsel at iss there have been filings made in the last 48 hours talking about new bids coming in it s one of those situations where from our clients' perspective we wanted to indicate that the process should play out a little bit longer harvey m gutman , pathmark s spokesman , said the company was disappointed by iss s view the proxy contains full and complete information of the extensive process that we have conducted , he said , and we believe that the yucaipa transaction is in the best interests of the shareholders mr gutman declined to make pathmark directors available to discuss their recommendation that shareholders approve the deal among the reasons pathmark s directors have given urging shareholder approval of the yucaipa deal were the investment firm s generally successful record and the promise that stockholders would participate in any upside that might result from improved performance at the company in coming years the fairness opinion on the yucaipa proposal , provided by dresdner kleinwort wasserstein securities , did not address the relative merits of any alternative bids for pathmark but pathmark s board said that the 875ashare offer was not a better deal because it was unlikely to be completed for several months , while the yucaipa transaction could be done this month in addition , the board said that further documentation from the bidder s lead lender was needed under the terms of the yucaipa deal , pathmark s current management will stay on but the transaction , if it is approved by shareholders , will result in a change of control at pathmark , allowing its executives to cash in all their stock options the company did not disclose , however , the amounts its executives stand to receive from the options or from severance agreements that may be activated by the deal mr mcgurn called pathmark s disclosure on such matters inadequate he added that the results of today s vote could be seen as a barometer of the current state of shareholder activism ultimately , if pathmark is forced to delay this meeting or they do n't get adequate votes they will have gotten a strong message from investors that they did n't feel there was enough information upon which they could make a decision , mr mcgurn said that would be a warning shot across the bow for companies who think that if they approve a deal , their shareholders are n't going to question it
the international olympic committee voted yesterday in singapore to drop baseball and softball from the summer games starting in 2012 without adding replacements , shrinking the olympics for the first time since 1936 ioc members were asked to vote up or down on all 28 summer sports in the first such review of the competition a similar vote is scheduled to occur every four years after intense lobbying efforts by representatives of all the sports , many ioc members predicted last week that no cuts would be made but the voting produced several surprises not only did baseball and softball fail to make it they survived a push in 2002 by the ioc president , dr jacques rogge , to eliminate them but none of the five sports vying to replace them received enough votes for inclusion the change takes effect for the 2012 summer games in london we are now an olympics of 26 sports , rogge told reporters after the vote the move stunned supporters of two sports with american roots that had spread internationally since being included in the 1990 s it s devastating , said lisa fernandez , a pitcher for the united states team that won all three of softball s gold medals since the sport joined the games in 1996 we 're not like basketball or other sports that have other professional opportunities we thrive on our place in the olympics baseball , which became a medal sport in 1992 , was battling several negative perceptions with the ioc first , because major league baseball did not make its players available for the olympics , the competition never featured the best players in the world the lingering reluctance of mlb to institute strict drug testing was also a sticking point although a stronger testing program is now in place , it falls far short of olympic standards problems with doping in us baseball probably cost the sport dearly , john coates , an australian ioc member , told reporters in singapore the impact , however , will be felt more keenly in other countries cuba s baseball team is its olympic pride , winning three of the sport s four gold medals the united states team won the other , in 2000 , in an upset of cuba those who bear most of the blame are the owners of the professional leagues who refuse to free up their ballplayers to compete , carlos rodriguez , president of the cuban baseball federation , told the associated press in havana jose contreras , a pitcher for the chicago white sox who played for cuba in the 1996 and 2000 games , said cuba had a rich baseball tradition the people take great pride in the way their teams have dominated for so long in international play , especially in the olympics , he said through a translator major league baseball , though , will soon unveil the format for the world baseball classic , a 16team international tournament to be played before its regular season next march that would include the top players from each country softball had no such consolation the sport worked for 30 years to become part of the olympics since 1996 , the united states team has produced some of the biggest stars of the games and helped increase women s participation in the olympics , also one of the ioc s goals the main criticism was that the united states team was so dominant it went undefeated in the 2004 games but has received strong competition from australia and china i never heard anything about dropping men s basketball when the us was beating everybody by 40 points in 1992 , and look what s happened in 20 years we finished third , fernandez said our sport is growing internationally , too usa softball had tried to help expand the game , sending equipment to developing countries and welcoming international teams to play in the united states ron radigonda , the executive director of usa softball , said the number of nations playing softball had jumped to 127 , ranking softball 14th on the list of 28 sports on our merits , we thought we were ok , he said we had good attendance , great television viewership there are a lot of sports that would love to have our numbers the international federations had asked that the vote totals for existing sports not be released , so the margin of defeat remains a mystery just as surprising as the vote to oust two sports yesterday morning was the decision not to replace them in the afternoon squash , rugby , golf , karate and roller sports were up for consideration , and squash and karate reached a final round of voting rogge had urged the membership to include those two and proposed that they vote the final round by a show of hands but the members booed him , and he agreed to continue by secret electronic ballot the members then voted , 63 to 39 against squash and 63 to 38 against karate nobody was happy with the outcome in the morning nobody was happy with the result of the afternoon , dick pound , a senior ioc member from canada , told reporters
dale messick , a pioneering newspaper cartoonist who fought her way to the top of a man s profession by creating brenda starr , the glamorous redhaired journalist who fought her way to the top of a man s profession , died on tuesday in sonoma county , calif she was 98 she died after a long decline that began with a stroke in 1998 , her daughter , starr rohrman , told the associated press she had been caring for her mother at her home in penngrove , calif ms messick was born on april 11 , 1906 brenda starr was born in june 1940 an impossibly glamorous redhead , her appearance was inspired by rita hayworth her first name came from the most famous debutante of the day , brenda frazier , and her last name was chosen because she was the star reporter on the flash the brenda starr comic strip was a symphony of d colletage , good legs precariously balanced on highheeled shoes , and diorlike clothing that no woman would be likely to wear to a newspaper office during the war she was an ace reporter , chasing spies and other malefactors in cities and in jungles , fighting off sharks , giant squids and other ravenous animals , but selling war bonds , too her red hair was always attractively coiffed her eyes always glistened with tiny starbursts she found time for romance with her mystery man , basil st john , a lean , squarejawed hunk who wore an eye patch and whose only other defect was that he was dying of an exotic disease this frequently sent him to the jungle in search of a rare black orchid whose serum gave him temporary respite while he was away , brenda had more suitors than penelope , but she remained loyal to her true love brenda finally married basil in 1976 , whereupon he vanished again on another orchid hunt as for ms messick , she was married twice , to everett george and oscar strom , and both marriages ended in divorce she is survived by her daughter , from her first marriage , and two grandchildren of her heroine s profession , she once explained , she was already a reporter when the strip started , but she was sick and tired of covering nothing but icecream socials she wanted a job with action , like the men reporters had but ms messick knew little about the newspaper business and refused to learn about it , saying it might spoil her imagination brenda starr , reporter was sometimes criticized by journalists for its outlandish depiction of their profession in one strip , brenda brings a typed story to the flash late at night and hands it to a custodian , who somehow gets it into the next day s paper on another occasion , she finds herself in an airplane she cannot fly , so she parachutes to safety , somehow landing in front of her editor s window and , in perhaps the greatest breach of authenticity , she talks back to her managing editor ms messick hired other people to draw cars and other mechanical contraptions , animals and nature scenes but for four decades , only she drew brenda starr s face and body dalia messick , born in south bend , ind , spent two years in the third grade and two years in the eighth grade and did not get her high school diploma until she was 20 , and then only at the urging of her parents , cephas messick , a sign painter and vocational arts teacher , and bertha messick , a milliner her work inspired some of brenda s fetching hats ms messick changed her name to dale after she encountered discrimination against women entering the newspaper cartooning business she told norma lee browning of the saturday evening post brenda is the glamorous girl i wished i was she s what most women wish they were and what most men wish their women were , too she originally thought of her character as a girl bandit , but was talked into making her a reporter by an aide to joseph medill patterson , founder and publisher of the daily news of new york and head of the chicago tribunenew york news syndicate ms messick had started drawing comic strips in school after leaving school , she studied art for a summer in chicago and worked for greeting card companies there and in new york , continuing to work on her comic strips at night none were published until brenda starr was accepted by the syndicate after brenda starr appeared , ms messick dyed her hair red to match brenda s i am brenda starr , she would say to interviewers brenda starr was twice adapted for the screen , first as a 1945 serial with joan woodbury , and later as a feature movie starring brooke shields shot in 1986 , it was not released until 1992 , when it opened to dismal notices ms messick warned everyone she met not to see it however , over the years , there were brenda starr dolls and even a postage stamp with brenda s likeness on it , part of a series on 20 classic comic characters at its height , brenda starr appeared in 250 papers and is still syndicated by tribune media services ms messick retired from drawing the strip in the mid1980 s , and it was passed on to other artists , all women she said she did not like the way later versions of brenda starr looked in the 1990 s , she developed a new comic character called granny glamour , who appeared in a singlepanel cartoon in a publication for the elderly in california in her 80 s , she boasted of juggling three boyfriends simultaneously all three would n't make one good man , she told an interviewer , but at my age , you ca n't be too choosy
it is not a place you would normally expect to find a curator preparing for a major photography show at the metropolitan museum of art but a few summers ago , pierre apraxine was camped out on the third floor of a rambling town house on west 73rd street near central park , the headquarters of the american society for psychical research , a 120yearold repository of the paranormal whose founders included the philosopher william james in the world of photo collecting and scholarship , mr apraxine is nothing less than an institution for almost two decades , he served as the eyes , ears and auction proxy for the philanthropist howard gilman , who built a collection recently acquired by the met that is widely considered to be one of the most important in the world , thanks largely to mr apraxine s expertise and globetrotting tenacity on this particular day , however , mr apraxine was working in the service not of photography but of the sixth sense , of that great invisible interchange that the russian spiritualist mme blavatsky described as a kind of astral post office he had folded his lanky 6foot3 frame into a small , steel soundproof booth illuminated by a red lamp halves of pingpong balls were taped over his eyes and headphones hissing white noise were placed over his ears in a room nearby sat a fellow curator and friend , sophie schmit , who was given a randomly selected image on a piece of paper the goal was for mr apraxine , sealed in his chamber lulled into a deeply relaxed condition known as a ganzfeld state to receive the image that ms schmit was sending as it turned out , he performed fairly well , describing several images that corresponded to the ones ms schmit was holding \( in the interest of the research , the society asks that the images not be made public \) when the positions were reversed , with ms schmit in the chamber , the pair did even better ms schmit described with sometimes eerie accuracy the image he was mentally willing her to see none of this was particularly surprising to mr apraxine , who grew up on a family estate in estonia where supernatural goings on often seemed to be part of the natural course of the day according to stories his mother told him , a vaporous woman in white who may or may not have been the specter of an old aunt appeared regularly , sometimes fluttering over mr apraxine s crib she was a benevolent spirit , in that she was watching over me , he explained on the other hand , she did not like one of the maids and she terrified other members of the household , especially if someone was stealing she was a watchdog and does mr apraxine , 70 , a former fulbright scholar and a sterling product of a postenlightenment education , really believe this story \? or in things that go bump in the night \? during lunch recently at the met , he looked up from his plate and stared out into central park for a moment i have a formula , an answer for that that is readymade , he said i believe you can see a ghost , but that does n't mean i believe in ghosts he paused and elaborated i remain a noncommitted observer that s the best way to put it but mr apraxine has been a curious and openminded observer almost all of his life , consulting psychics , undergoing hypnosis , reading books and magazines about the paranormal and , once , visiting a voodoo ceremony in haiti so his involvement in organizing the show at the met the perfect medium photography and the occult , a fascinating survey of the ways in which photography has been used to try to prove the existence of the supernatural is more than just a professional or aesthetic exercise for him at the least , it is one of those coincidences mr apraxine says he decidedly does not believe in there is nothing accidental at least in my life , he says his early adult interest in occult photography grew out of his work as a collector , not a spiritual seeker , he said in the early 1970 s , when he began to work with gilman to build a worldclass photo collection , the strength of the gilman holdings was in 20thcentury work by photographers like walker evans and robert frank mr apraxine s mission was to start trolling backwards , buying good pictures from the 19th century , stretching all the way back to photography s infancy in the 1830 s to the surprise of both men , who had assumed that most of the best of 19thcentury photography had already been bought by museums , masterpieces were still for sale around the world , and many were being sold for what now seem to be laughably small sums as the collection deepened , occult photographs were simply another important piece of the field s history from the 1870 s through the 1930 s , the belief that cameras had the power to capture not just the visible and fleeting but also the invisible and ephemeral produced a huge body of images intended as almost scientific exhibits \( they also served as sales pitches for photographers offering civil war widows a last glimpse of a loved one \) the 120 pictures in the exhibition are by turns spooky , beautiful , disturbing and hilarious they are also , by and large , the visual records of decades of fraud , cons , flimflams and gullibility though there are also some pictures , like those produced by an eccentric chicago bellhop , ted serios , said to be purely from his thoughts , in the 1960 s , that have never been adequately explained we do n't consider it the real stuff , you know , said dr nancy sondow , president of the american society for psychical research , which lent several photographs to the show still , she added , i guess it s interesting from the standpoint of the history of photography the pictures are a window onto a bizarre , and almost forgotten , period of american and european history , when the camps of spiritualism and strict rationality battled it out on the front pages of newspapers the 1869 fraud trial of william mumler , a boston and new york photographer who was the first known practitioner of spirit photography , became a public spectacle the mayor of new york himself ordered an investigation into his practices , and pt barnum testified for the prosecution , speaking as the amazing randi of his day but mumler had many defenders his patrons included mary todd lincoln , who visited him after her husband s assassination she took away a photo that shows his ghostly form standing behind her \( mumler was acquitted at his trial , but discredited , suspected of manipulating photo plates \) spirit photography began in a typically american burst of entrepreneurship , and for this reason serious european spiritualists were slow in joining one wrote that while the united states had taken the lead in many things , it had also left us far behind in the invention of false rumors but the practice soon took off in france and england , and produced groups whose names seemed to be lifted right from the pages of hg wells or jk rowling the society for the study of supernormal pictures , the british college of psychic science , the occult committee of the magic circle by world war ii interest had peaked , but the exhibition makes clear that it has never really gone away the show includes some of the famous polaroid images produced by mr serios , who claimed to be able to project his thoughts onto film and whose work remains one of the best documented and most hotly debated cases in the field even today , fascination with the practice is widespread , aided by video technology and the internet just type the words ghost hunter into google and you can find thousands of examples of contemporary images purporting to show otherworldly emanations mr apraxine and ms schmit , who organized the show with three other curators , stressed that the only way to do such a show was to profess official agnosticism the authors' position is precisely that of having no position , or at least not in so manichean a form , they wrote in the exhibition s catalog but in a telephone interview from her home in paris , ms schmit conceded that a strong sense of what if \? was also a basic requirement if i had n't considered at least the possibility of it existing , she said , i do n't think i would have ever been interested in doing the exhibit that summer day at the american society for psychical research , where the two curators were sorting through the group s archives to find photographs for the show , they agreed to participate in the telepathy experiment not as a joke but as a sort of curatorial research assignment for extra credit we are very open , both us , to that kind of thing , she said indeed , for mr apraxine , it seems to have been at times more than just openness a charming but private man who combines old world elegance with an almost childlike enthusiasm , he tells of several encounters in his life that he has found hard to explain raised mostly in belgium after his family left estonia , he was sent by his family to ireland to learn english and one night sneaked alone into an abandoned house rumored to be haunted mr apraxine pronounces it hownted where he says he heard a clock ticking in a room with no clock and footsteps where there appeared to be nobody walking later in his life , in the 1960 s , on the advice of acquaintances who worked at the occult magazine plan te in paris , he went to see his first psychic , in the countryside near orl ans i wanted to see what my life would be like , he explained he recalled being nervous and feeling a little silly i was expecting to see someone clothed in robes with an owl on his shoulder , you know \? he said instead the man was wearing shorts , and in his backyard among the clucking chickens , using a pendulum as an aid , he foretold for mr apraxine all the salient points of my life and they all happened and mr apraxine said all this as matteroffactly as if he were discussing daguerreotypes later , after moving to new york , he regularly consulted another psychic in the west village and urged one of his reluctant friends to see her , too i wanted to destabilize his cartesian mind , he explained , smiling at this point in his life , mr apraxine said , he feels that many of his curiosities about otherworldly things have been satisfied , or have at least gone into hibernation for a while he reads less about the occult and has n't seen a psychic in years or , for that matter , a ghost \( he sent a followup email message to a reporter after the interview , just to make sure that he did not appear as inordinately apparitionobsessed i do not smirk at people who tell me of paranormal experiences , he wrote , but neither do i believe that the silhouette in a badly lit corridor is the ghost aunt dorothea coming back to spy on her husband \) in many ways , he said , the met exhibition did not develop as an outgrowth of his interests it simply became another way of working through them , an exploration he hopes that people who see the show may want to take , too i thought , 'maybe i will learn something by delving more deeply into this subject , ' he said , 'and maybe i will learn something about myself ' the perfect medium photography and the occult metropolitan museum of art fifth avenue and 82nd street , sept 27 through dec 31
as the focus at ground zero has suddenly veered to the freedom tower and the roughandtumble blame game involving its security redesign , the most vocal members of a powerful constituency the sept 11 , 2001 , families have seized the hour to be heard above the growing clamor of politicians , developers , architects , cultural administrators , community advocates and other lower manhattan stakeholders relatives of the 2 , 749 world trade center victims , and other interested parties , have until 5 pm today to formally express their concerns about the memorial s evolving design that witching hour officially halts the period of public commentary on a new round of amendments to the reconstruction effort s originally approved environmental assessment september s mission and several other family groups have objected to many of the announced amendments , among them reducing the number of pedestrian ramps into the memorial to two from four they say that this would recreate the claustrophobic experience of fleeing from the twin towers , and that it would pose a hazard if the projected 2 , 000 visitors per hour had to exit in an emergency at least eight of the dozens of tradecenter groups have blitzed hundreds of families with email messages encouraging them to make sure that the families' voices are heard , as one of the entreaties put it we feel it s now or never , said the executive director of the world trade center united family group , anthony gardner , whose brother , harvey joseph gardner iii , died in the north tower people are putting egos aside and we 've come together again , because we feel the memorial concerns are being ignored originally the memorial was the heart of the site , and now it s getting less and less important the founder of september s mission , monica iken , whose husband , michael , died in the south tower , said that everyone is talking about the freedom tower , but the memorial is all that many of us will have of our loved ones , and it has to be done right kevin m rampe , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which is overseeing the project and the publiccomment process , said of the changes that the reason the number of ramps was reduced from four to two was that our consultants told us that was the best way to provide security there beyond that , he said , the importance of the trade center memorial has been undiminished and , he added , some of the family critics were using the environmentalcomment period as an opportunity to rehash issues that have been out there since the beginning some of the family groups insist on direct access to the tradecenter bedrock at the tower footprints , considering it sacred ground that offers the only connection to their loved ones , since the remains of 42 percent of the victims including those of ms iken s and mr gardner s relatives have not been identified current plans appear to require family members to traverse the spaces occupied by tourists and by graphic exhibits about sept 11 , 2001 we have plans that will allow people to have access to bedrock and the columns separately , said michael arad , the architect who designed the memorial we have met with the families every step of the way , he said , and we will continue to other design criticism from family groups centers around the streetwalls or heights of buildings facing the streets which , according to the proposed site changes , could be as high as 150 feet , a prospect that could be forbidding and unwelcoming to pedestrians , ms iken said , and could detract from the memorial , shadowing it to mr rampe , though , the streetwall height is exactly the same as across the street at the world financial center this was an aesthetic decision , he added , to make it correspond with surrounding architecture mr arad said , we are trying to give the memorial quadrant a strong definition , so it can be a counterpoint to the development around it important elements of the memorial design are now under intensive study in richmond hill , ontario , just north of toronto there , a consultant to the memorial design team has constructed a fullscale mockup of one corner of one of the voids water troughs at the upper level empty into a pool below , in a test of one of the most critical elements of the memorial the walls of water that will cascade down all four sides of each enormous void architects are experimenting with ways to reduce noise , splashing , freezing , blowing and clogging the public commentary process that ends today is made mandatory not only by new york state environmental law , but also by the department of housing and urban development , which has awarded 278 billion in grants to the development corporation for the rebuilding effort the development corporation has the authority to choose among the comments it receives some 400 arrived by yesterday and the power to enact the changes it sees fit the publiccomment process is not a meaningless exercise , mr rampe said , pointing out that the original plan was altered in many respects , including the access to bedrock and the preservation of trade center remnants at the towers' footprints the family members are highly diverse , and some said that none of the disparate and sometimes fractious sept 11 groups could speak for all the families in regard to progress at ground zero we never thought it would be smooth sailing , and i think that a lot has been accomplished on the site , said paula berry , a member of the families advisory council on the whole the lmdc has done an incredible job , and they have made great effort to be transparent but frederic m bell , executive director of the new york chapter of the american institute of architects , echoed charges of some of the family activists in saying that the development corporation has not put out enough public information for the public to weigh in the lmdc garnered input early on , he added , but that has diminished , and there is not enough public discourse on how the project has evolved his organization has filed an entry in the publiccomment process mr rampe has rejected any extension of the publiccomment period , as some family groups requested but to mr bell the comment period ends when people stop commenting so the comment period never ends in keeping with that reality , some family members are also taking issue with longknown aspects of the project plan , including the prominence of the cultural buildings that , they say , encroach on the memorial we 've ended up with a memorial that s underground , with a museum that s hovering over the site , said mary fetchet , the founding director of voices of sept 11 , who lost her son , bradley , in the south tower families are also concerned that visitors will be confused by the international freedom center you 're going to think that s the 9 11 museum , said edie lutnick , executive director of the cantor fitzgerald relief fund because the program planned for the center will not be purely commemorative , some say it does not belong there she and others suggest moving the cultural institutions into the bases of the commercial buildings on the site you 've got 10 million square feet of unrented office space , ms lutnick said put it there the development corporation has said this is not under consideration ms fetchet said she would urge gov george e pataki to take a leadership role and scrutinize what s being done to the memorial if the memorial fails , she added , the governor fails

benhur by far the most stirring and respectable of the biblefiction pictures ever made , the new york times film critic bosley crowther wrote of benhur on the occasion of its new york release on nov 18 , 1959 the key word in crowther s review is respectable an adjective carefully chosen to characterize this prestigious mgm production , directed by the highly respectable and , by then , twotime oscar winning director william wyler by hiring wyler , a filmmaker known for his intelligent theatrical adaptations \( the letter , 1940 \) and films about social problems \( the best years of our lives , 1946 \) , mgm hoped to restore some dignity to a genre that had known its greatest triumphs thanks to the enthusiastic vulgarity of alessandro blasetti and the inimitable cecil b demille the wild orgy sequences , spectacular battles and scanty costumes that had defined demille s biblical epics since the great showman made his first ten commandments in 1923 would be banished from this highclass work of art wyler s film would be about human relationships in particular , the friendship turned to hate between judah , prince of the jewish house of hur \( mr heston \) and messala \( stephen boyd \) , the boyhood friend who returns to jerusalem as a roman tribune and military enforcer the magnificently produced fourdisc version of benhur that warner home video is releasing today ably advances that claim to respectability it s an exhaustive , almost scholarly textural compendium , with a gorgeous , crisply detailed new twodisc transfer of the 1959 film \( working from the original 65milllimeter negative , the engineers have returned the film to its status as one of the widest widescreen films ever made , with an image almost three times as wide as it is high \) it also has a solid transfer of the 1925 silent benhur , directed by fred niblo and starring ramon novarro a pair of documentaries a 2005 production featuring current hollywood figures like george lucas paying tribute , and scott benson s highly informative 1993 documentary , benhur the making of an epic round out the fourth disc , which also includes some revealing screen tests \( including one hilarious alternateuniverse sequence featuring leslie nielsen as messala and cesare danova as benhur \) and various trailers used over the years whatever your feelings about the film \( and mine are certainly mixed \) , the dvd deserves a place in any library of hollywood wyler s mission was to turn the historical spectacle of the 1925 benhur into something more psychologized and emotionally intimate to that end he employed the talents of a fledgling scriptwriter , gore vidal , whose name does not appear in the final credits but who may have written a majority of the final film , though memories conflict mr vidal has said that he sought to justify the passionate hatred between messala and benhur by implying that the roman had been romantically involved with his childhood companion , and that his anger was also the anger of a lover spurned mr vidal says he passed on his idea to both wyler and boyd , who apparently agreed to play it that way , but mr heston was kept in the dark it is true that the characters and relationships are much more plausible and dramatically developed in the 1959 version , but at a cost one highlight of the 1925 film is carmel myers s performance as a roman courtesan a highly demillean figure decked out in feathers and beads who is messala s mistress and parttime spy , sent to seduce benhur and sap his energies on the eve of the great chariot race the wyler film could have used some of her outrageousness and exuberance the great chariot race between benhur and messala the climax of the 1880 book by lew wallace as well as the great set piece of the theatrical adaptations and subsequent films remains a highlight of warner s restoration , which now reveals more picture information and background detail as conceived and staged by the veteran second unit director andrew marton and the legendary stunt coordinator yakima canutt , it remains a model of action filmmaking , with an adrenalinepumping sense of speed and danger that never violates spatial coherence \( see , as a counter example , the highway chase in the recent , dismal film the island \) the new benhur dvd is almost too good for its own good high definition or not , digital video is simply not good enough to register all the detail and depth of field of a 65millimeter image the crowd scenes that once revealed hundreds of individual faces are now a blur , and shots that once seemed to stretch infinitely into the distance , as when the roman legions arrive in jerusalem , now look puny a little imagination is needed to augment the pixel count but of course , it always is 3992 rated g more columbia westerns sony pictures home entertainment has released another batch of westerns from its columbia library , and while these films seem as arbitrarily chosen as ever \( the presence of japanese subtitles suggests they 're aimed primarily at sony s asian market \) , there are a couple of titles here of more than passing interest five of the new titles feature the enduring but perennially underestimated randolph scott , a tall , courtly southerner whose relaxed , amused attitude often hid the tormented soul of his characters this bunch includes two of the six films that scott made with the great noir stylist andr de toth \( man in the saddle , 1951 , and the stranger wore a gun , originally released in 3d in 1953 \) , as well as two pictures by studio functionaries santa fe \( irving pichel , 1951 \) and ten wanted men \( h bruce humberstone , 1955 \) they 're all enjoyable , but scott s personality is best framed by joseph h lewis s lawless street \( 1957 \) , an elemental , nearly abstract piece that pits an aging , disillusioned sheriff \( scott \) against a gang of corrupt local businessman a sort of internalized high noon sony , which seems to be progressing chronologically through its scott westerns , will eventually , one hopes , get to the five columbia pictures he made with the director budd boetticher at the end of the actor s career each is an absolute gem along for the ride here is the last frontier , a rarely seen 1955 film by another of the genre s masters , anthony mann mann s visual trademark is his use of jagged , mountainous terrains to express the inner anxieties of his characters , an effect that is here much enhanced by columbia s new transfer , which returns the film to the widescreen format in which it was shot victor mature , robert preston and anne bancroft star in this tale of adultery and indian raids like the other films in the series , it does n't show much evidence of restoration work , but at these prices \( 1494 list \) it s hard to complain none have been rated
mike port has spent only two and a half months in his job as major league baseball s vice president for umpiring , but he has quickly learned one lesson umpires , port said , care just as much about blown calls as diehard fans in game 2 of the world series on sunday night , the homeplate umpire , jeff nelson , ruled that a pitch had hit the chicago white sox' jermaine dye when replays clearly showed that the pitch had hit dye s bat and should have been a foul ball paul konerko followed with a grand slam , helping send the houston astros to a 76 loss certainly jeff felt that he got the call right , and i can assure you that , postgame , he was very disappointed to see that replays indicated otherwise , port said one thing i 've found out about these guys is that , figuratively , umpires live and die based on whether their calls are correct from what i 've seen , they take it very hard when it appears that they 're wrong nelson s call on dye was the latest disputed call in the postseason the white sox benefited in the american league championship series from a thirdstrike call that was ruled to be dropped , and a catcher s interference call that was not made port dismissed the idea that baseball should use instant replay , saying it could prolong games , among other reasons the people on the field are the ones who should decide the game , without getting too far afield in terms of technology , he said in the play involving dye , port said that since nelson believed he had made the call correctly , no other umpires needed to be consulted nelson was obviously the closest umpire to dye at the time i think some of the other guys felt jermaine kind of motioned with his hand , but jeff had the call , port said there was rain , and there was crowd noise , and the only guy in the ballpark who had that seat was jeff nelson ultimately , port said , the play was a judgment call by nelson , who did not know he was wrong until he saw the replay after the game podsednik s bat to hall the white sox' scott podsednik donated his bat from game 2 to the hall of fame podsednik hit a gameending homer with the bat but was happy to give it up it s an unbelievable honor , he said i never grew up thinking of anything even close to something like this happening to have a bat of mine go into the hall of fame is pretty special just do not expect podsednik to forget what kind of player he is he has two homers this postseason after hitting none in the regular season , and he is not expecting another in houston i'm checking the lines and seeing how the ball s rolling before i check the dimensions of the outfield here , he said close shave for astros the astros returned to minute maid park with a new look their scruffy playoff beards were shaven , though a few players kept their goatees the executive decision came down to brad ausmus , jeff bagwell said , referring to the astros catcher that was the reason we lost two games , because we had beards otherwise , we would have been fine guillen offers an apology white sox manager ozzie guillen said he would seek out the astros' craig biggio to apologize for the behavior of a white sox fan who biggio said slapped his wife , patty , and ran away during a game in chicago the guy that did it , he should be brought to biggio , guillen said i told the police , 'do n't put him in jail , bring him to me in the dugout' but hopefully that wo n't happen again photo astros manager phil garner questioned the umpire jeff nelson after he ruled that jermaine dye was hit by a pitch in the seventh inning sunday \( photo by elsa getty images \)
anaheim , calif , july 23 robinson cano is distracted he is sitting at his locker earlier this week in arlington , tex , talking with a reporter while the baltimore orioles' sammy sosa is batting in a game on tv he s from my hometown , cano explains the minnesota twins' catcher sets a target , low and away slider , cano predicts do n't swing ! sosa strikes out on a slider cano , the yankees' rookie second baseman , is making baseball seem easy he is 22 years old , but his baseball intellect and acumen are surprisingly refined the yankees would not have signed tony womack to a twoyear contract over the winter had they known cano would be this good this soon you knew in spring training he was going to be a special player , manager joe torre said but you could never imagine him coming up here and being able to seize the opportunity the way he has cano , who is from the baseball cradle of san pedro de macoris in the dominican republic , displaced womack a month into the season soon after that , general manager brian cashman declared him off limits in potential trades torre has batted him second , between derek jeter and gary sheffield , every game this month entering saturday night s game against the angels , cano was batting 309 with 7 homers and 36 runs batted in he has more extrabase hits , 29 , than jeter , jason giambi and jorge posada he has also been slick in the field luis sojo , the infield coach , called cano one of the three best second basemen in the league none of it surprises cano , the son of a former major leaguer , who acts and plays as if he belongs it s the same game , he said i play the way i used to play i do n't try to put pressure on myself cano s father , jose , pitched in six games for the houston astros at the end of the 1989 season he also pitched for several years in taiwan and mexico , where robinson watched him play a few times on the trip to texas , a japanese reporter gave cano two photographs of his father pitching for the astros cano excitedly showed them to alex rodriguez , and also to vernon wells sr , an artist whose son is a star outfielder for the toronto blue jays cano commissioned wells to paint a portrait of him with three people his father and two hall of famers , jackie robinson and rod carew cano is named after jackie robinson , and torre has compared cano s hitting style to carew s there are n't as many lefthanded hitters that can get on the high ball , torre said like carew , torre went on to explain , cano keeps his swing level , even on high pitches the comparison is not perfect carew was a singles hitter , and cano has more power torre predicted that cano could hit 20 to 30 home runs a season he s sneaky right now , but he s going to get stronger , torre said he s just 22 years old , so he s going to fill out when cano signed with the yankees in 2001 for a 150 , 000 bonus , it was a dream come true cano had spent his first three years of high school in newark , and the yankees were his favorite team he went to one game at yankee stadium , sitting in the upper deck behind home plate darryl strawberry hit two home runs that day , cano remembered , but his favorite player was bernie williams cano wore williams s no 51 in the minor leagues , and the glove he uses in games still has 51 stitched on the outside first of all , it makes me feel old , but nonetheless flattered , williams said you get to play for a number of years , and you do n't realize how much of an impact you have on young players until you 're confronted with something like this cano said he had other influences alfonso soriano , who is also from san pedro de macoris , sought out cano at the yankees' minor league complex after he signed with the team and took him to dinner soriano was traded to the rangers last year , but the two chatted amiably at second base during the rangers series soriano sensed that cano was comfortable my first time in new york , it was unbelievable for me , soriano said i think it s the same for him there s not too many people that can play in new york like him i think he s very happy he s enjoying the moment right now when soriano played for the yankees , the infield coach willie randolph worked with him constantly to improve his defense cano had 11 errors entering saturday s game , the most on the team jeter and rodriguez each have 10 but his basic defensive skills are more polished there s not much to work on with this kid , sojo said he s got everything maybe his concentration he s got to concentrate and be focused , but i'm not saying he s not he makes the plays the yankees shifted cano to third base in june 2004 , when the kansas city royals were trying to trade carlos beltran and wanted a third baseman in return cano did not understand the move until a coach told him the reason cano said that he generally ignored trade rumors , but that he did notice when the yankees signed womack in december asked how he reacted , cano laughed and said i always say , 'god , he s the one who knows better' i was going to keep working hard like i always do , and you never know what s going to happen the yankees lost 15 of their first 26 games , and they decided that womack had become a defensive liability cano was batting 333 at class aaa columbus , and the yankees promoted him to be a starter cano made a costly error in his second game and was 2 for 23 after a week the yankees stuck with him because he did not seem overmatched it was the attitude of the kid , sojo said i was a rookie before , and you get frustrated but instead of getting frustrated , he said , 'ok , i'm going to hit' the hits have come more often lately cano had a 420 average during an 11game hitting streak he carried into saturday s game he knows he has the talent , williams said it seems like he just goes out there and has fun
in the end , the mets had a better season than the yankees yes , the yankees won yet another division championship and the mets only tied for third place in their division , but the mets still had a better season that assessment will not make george steinbrenner happy , but why should he be unhappy about what i think when he has been made miserably unhappy by the people he pays exorbitantly to win \? they 're the ones who are responsible for yet another postseason failure i only watched steinbrenner , the yankees' principal owner , was characterized yesterday as being very , very disappointed , as well he should be , considering he paid those guys 203 million \( and that does n't include manager joe torre s 6 million salary \) and got one round of the playoffs for his money the yankees are slipping into the atlanta braves' world the braves have won 14 consecutive division championships , the best streak ever , but only one world series the yankees have won eight division titles in a row , the secondbest streak ever , with four world series championships but none in the last five years both teams were knocked out of the postseason in the first round this year , but the comparison of the teams ends there the yankees were supposed to finish in first place and did , but they clinched their expected spot on the nexttolast day of the season the next day , the red sox finished the season with the same 9567 record the yankees had , but the yankees were awarded first place because they had won the season series between the teams the braves , on the other hand , won in a tougher division \( all five national league east teams finished 500 or better \) and won with a vast assortment of rookies in key roles the yankees had one rookie , robinson cano not that the yankees have the minor league talent to stock their team with rookies , but would they have edged the red sox with an array of rookies \? the braves played with the 12thhighest payroll in the major leagues , 75 million quick , class how many times does 75 go into 203 \? manager bobby cox did not have a lineup of cleanup hitters , as other teams have described the yankees when the braves sustained injuries , they did n't fill the holes by acquiring players and their contracts from other teams they called up another rookie , whom cox inserted into the lineup and watched produce the best part of the yankees' season was the work of the pitchers who replaced their injured starters no one expected aaron small , shawn chacon and chinmien wang to pitch as well as they did they , not randy johnson or mike mussina , saved the yankees' season steinbrenner disappointed \? he has a right to be he paid johnson and mussina a combined 34 million , and they pitched a combined five and twothirds innings in games 3 and 5 of the division series the angels won both games steinbrenner paid alex rodriguez 207 million he batted 133 \( 2 for 15 \) and did n't drive in a run before the final game of the division series , torre was asked to compare this team with the teams that won the world series we had a different type of lineup , he said we had more of the type of lineup probably that the angels have , where guys are n't known for their power we have more of a powerladen ball club now than we had in those years when you get to postseason play , it s not how far you hit it it s how often you hit it the yankees hit 253 in the series , the angels 275 when the angels dumped the yankees in the division series in 2002 , they amassed 56 hits in four games their hitters were relentless after game 5 of this series , mussina , who gave up a 20 lead and five runs in two and twothirds innings , talked about how the angels got to him by doing small stuff small stuff wins games a lot of times in the postseason , he said if the yankees are n't capable of playing that type of game , maybe they should find some players who can generate playoffwinning baseball there must be room in that 203 million payroll for such players but steinbrenner needs his fix of allstars he went awry in the early 1980 s , stocking the team with multiple stars at the same positions , and maybe he has done it again or perhaps torre has to challenge himself and figure out how to manufacture runs with his existing lineup rather than sitting back and waiting for his power hitters to unload steinbrenner willing , brian cashman or his replacement as general manager could make his offseason priority the acquisition of an angelstype hitter or two cashman s contract expires at the end of the month at the moment , his return seems to be more up to him than to steinbrenner as much speculation as there will be about torre , who is owed 132 million for two more years , steinbrenner has n't made any noise internally about firing him but then , the yankees' playoff body is barely cold the yankees won half a dozen fewer regularseason games than they did last year , fewer than 100 for the first time in four years , and they did n't advance as far in the postseason the mets won a dozen more games than they did last year and finished one place higher they have more work to do to become a playoff team next year a lot of work , in fact but the mets can feel better about their season , and they can feel good knowing they are headed in the right direction the yankees are running in place , and it s not the place the team or steinbrenner wants to be

add to the painful postmortems of 9 11 this week s disclosure that federal aviation officials were more lulled than alarmed by a steady stream of intelligence warnings about osama bin laden in the months before the terrorist attacks as with numerous other intelligence failures uncovered by the sept 11 commission , the warnings dozens of them were not deemed specific enough to provide adequate defenses at the nation s airports , according to federal aviation administration officials in 105 intelligence reports received during the five months preceding the attacks , osama bin laden or al qaeda were mentioned 52 times , according to the commission , which faulted the faa for not doing enough to heighten security these latest details were contained in a chapter of the commission s final report that was withheld by the bush administration for months , heavily censored and then released to the public only after eric lichtblau printed details in the times they point to the cornucopia of intelligence that was flowing through federal bureaucracies without benefit of an authoritative analysis to pinpoint the looming threat the faa got the reports through a 24hour liaison it maintained with the central intelligence agency , the federal bureau of investigation and the state department it s not clear from this latest report , or at least the portion the white house thought fit for public consumption , whether those agencies passed on the warnings to the white house it is clear that none of those agencies connected the dots in time that s a familiar , grim lesson , but , sadly , americans should not conclude that it has been taken to heart the problem of stovepiping rival intelligence gathering conducted without effective coordination by the 15 national spy agencies still awaits a firm hand to bring order from bureaucratic chaos if anything , fresh mischief is afoot as the pentagon is lately reported to have created specialized overseas espionage teams , thereby angering the cia , while the fbi is reported to be recruiting foreigners as overseas spies , further raising cia hackles still , no one s in charge the newly created post of national intelligence director is supposed to rein in these agency rivalries but the job remains vacant eight weeks after president bush signed the intelligence overhaul law that he reluctantly accepted after the 9 11 commission pressed congress for reform one prime candidate , robert gates , a former director of central intelligence , has already declined consideration for the job which has been so whittled down by backroom deals in congress that it strikes many washington insiders as thankless as now configured , it involves refereeing disputes between the pentagon and civilian spy agencies , minus the full powers the director needs to hire and fire and to control the disparate agencies for all his earlier reluctance , it will take president bush to step up and embrace the intelligence reform law with enough conviction to attract a topflight director willing to serve the nation and take on defense secretary donald rumsfeld his choice will then need the backing of the president s moral and political authority otherwise , the nation s intelligence shield threatens to slip even further
catherine grant could do nothing but roll her eyes when she paid the 975 for her trip from grand central terminal to chappaqua early tuesday morning it was march 1 , the day the latest metronorth fare increases went into effect , and commuters across the region were grumbling but ms grant said she had even more to complain about she takes the 53minute ride a couple of times each week to get to her job as a nanny this past week was no different her status as a reverse commuter was unchanged but as of tuesday she started paying the peak price , which meant a fare increase of 275 , or nearly a third more no one has been spared an increase , but the amounts vary from 5 percent to 15 percent the riders hit hardest are those who buy single tickets into westchester from manhattan during the morning rush hour none of them have ever before paid peakhour prices the reason for metronorth s decision to shift them to peak fares is clear their payments are expected to generate an additional 900 , 000 annually for the financially pinched agency , according to marjorie s anders , a metronorth spokeswoman , who added that the heaviest increase affects about 1 , 300 regular riders ms grant s response , once she was seated aboard the 8 50 am northbound train it s just ridiculous , really she had already taken a halfhour subway trip from her home in the bushwick neighborhood of brooklyn they 're killing the poor people shrugging as if defeated , she added we have to get work not like we got any other choice as the number of new york city dwellers who work in the suburbs has increased in the last several years , transit officials say the number of reverse commuters has nearly doubled in 2003 , the number traveling to white plains from manhattan in the morning came close to the number who made the opposite commute correspondingly , since 1994 , 15 northbound trains have been added during the morning rush hour , ms anders said we 've added a tremendous amount of services there , she said although a certain number of the reverse commuters work in large office complexes in cities like white plains , stamford and other suburban cities , there also seem to be many who work in lowwage jobs like housekeeping mta statistics show that the median income of those who commute into the city from westchester is about 152 , 000 , nearly three times more than that of passengers who work in the northern suburbs george haikalis , president of the institute of rational urban mobility , a manhattanbased rider advocacy group , described the increase as really rough , particularly for the people who are buying single trips , because they are not working the full week or have trouble anteing up the full monthly fare about 40 percent of riders who say they use the trains to commute everyday still buy individual tickets instead of monthly passes , ms anders said but while acknowledging many commuters' reluctance to buy numbers of rides in advance , she said , i think a lot of people do n't realize how much money they would save if they were buying the monthly or weekly passes during the first few days of the increase , mta officials were stationed near ticket booths at grand central to encourage regular riders to buy monthly passes and calculate how much money they would save in the switch as ms anders put it , we intend to make a lot of converts last fall , at a poorly attended earlyevening mta hearing for riders at the county center in white plains , few if any people complained about the effect the proposed increase would have on reverse commuters but as mr haikalis pointed out , time and location are convenience factors that for most working people prohibit attendance at such meetings a lot of the question of price is related to the amount of screaming and yelling you 're going to get , he said they have less time to scream and yell , so why should anyone be concerned william henderson , associate director of the mta s permanent citizens advisory council , defended the fare decision , saying transit officials had had to weigh customer demands against budget realities of course you 're affecting the people who can least afford it , he said , but by the same token , that number of commuters is growing , and metronorth needs to be in the position to recover some of the costs of the added service yet upsetting as the heavy increases have been to singleticket purchasers , the milder increases have annoyed regular commuters each morning , fern daves takes new jersey transit to manhattan from her house in hoboken , then gets the subway to grand central , and finally takes a metronorth train to her job with a manufacturing company in white plains her monthly transportation costs usually run about 400 , she said i have n't done the calculations on the increase yet , she said , hurrying down the stairs to catch her last train i'm too nervous to see what it amounts to still , her allegiance to mass transit is unlikely to be shaken by the time you figure gas , parking and insurance , this is still better than having a car photos signs advertise the fare increase at the metronorth train station at fordham , where many reverse commuters board \( photographs by george m gutierrez for the new york times \)
to the editor re a short history of deanism , by david brooks \( column , feb 5 \) it is puzzling that mr brooks finds howard dean s national network of supporters , the newly dominant educated class , to be worsening the problem of a decline in the broad \( fraternal \) participation in civic affairs last week i attended one of more than 800 democracy for america gatherings held that night all over the country \( democracy for america grew out of dean for america , dr dean s campaign group \) while none of us wore coonskin caps or recited a secret pledge , we spent the evening not only discussing politics , but also sharing stories about families and friends and enjoying this chance to spend time with a diverse group of people bound by a common interest there were just five of us sipping tea in that kitchen a veteran of world war ii , three middleaged neighbors and a 20something who works for a software company but i 'd say \( politics aside \) that we were far more eclectic a group than you 're apt to find at your local elks lodge or rotary club i even think ralph kramden would have felt perfectly at home john vh dippel piermont , ny , feb 5 , 2005
mike wallace has hearing aids in both ears , a pacemaker that ticks like the signature stopwatch on 60 minutes under his ribs and an artery in his right leg that had to be flushed not long ago by an angioplasty as he approaches his 87th birthday , on may 9 , he has had so much cardiac maintenance done imagine a vintage bentley that s turned over its odometer that some replacement parts themselves in need of replacement , including a stent inserted over a decade ago in his left leg but although his doctors have been pressing him to schedule that procedure , mr wallace has been delaying , claiming there is no room on his calendar and no wonder last month , he interviewed kate hudson , goldie hawn and kurt russell for 60 minutes this week , he will travel to mississippi to talk to morgan freeman on may 3 , he says , he will interview russian president vladimir v putin in moscow so much for retirement though cbs announced two years ago that mr wallace was cutting his 60 minutes workload in half , he has had 11 original reports on the air since september , including a tough session with jose canseco about steroid use in baseball if you add updates to previous pieces about johnny carson , yasir arafat and bernard kerik , his story count for this season inches close to a full year s work \( 20 segments \) on 60 minutes and its weeknight counterpart why , as he closes in on 90 , can he not just walk away \? i would n't know what else to do , mr wallace responded from behind his desk at 60 minutes , natty in a herringbone jacket , black knit tie and matching pocket square , the hudson river sprawled behind him mr wallace has plenty of company in his nonretirement on march 31 , abc news announced that ted koppel \( 65 \) would leave both nightline and the network in december he joins tom brokaw \( 65 \) and dan rather \( 73 \) , who decamped as anchors of the evening news in december and march respectively they were preceded by barbara walters \( 73 \) , who , after a quarter century , stepped down as a coanchor of the primetime news program 20 20 in the fall their goodbyes were trumpeted in network press releases and news articles as representing the end of an era each of them was supposed to enter a kind of twilight period one in which new stars would take over but for those who looked carefully , there was a disclaimer , albeit in fine print none of the socalled departees expressed any interest in actually stepping away from viewers' tv screens , or dwelled on the word retirement in their farewell remarks instead , they emphasized their intention to continue contributing to their respective networks , or on competing channels thus mr wallace and ms walters remain stars , jetting across the globe and landing choice interviews , with the tacit approval of their bosses \( ms walters is still cohost of the morning gabfest the view , and does a half dozen primetime specials a year \) mr rather remains a fulltime correspondent at cbs news , on the lowrated but nonetheless primetime program 60 minutes wednesday mr brokaw all but disappeared from the airwaves for four months so as not to overshadow brian williams , his successor \( mr williams , 45 , has managed to retain the lion s share of mr brokaw audience \) but mr brokaw has at least three onehour specials in the works for primetime in the near future their continuing work stands in contrast to the departures of chet huntley \( from nbc in 1970 \) and walter cronkite \( from cbs in 1981 \) , neither of whom appeared much thereafter oddly , the senior journalists may be lingering on television precisely because of their networks' desire to attract younger audiences all of the network news divisions are desperate to capture the 18to34 set their current audiences are literally dying off but none has yet figured out how to create the next generation of anchors which may take quite some time while the potential news stars of tomorrow people like anderson cooper on cnn , bob woodruff on abc and mika brzezinski on cbs are being groomed , they do not \( with the possible exception of mr williams \) have the star power of the familiar faces of news past in contrast to the days when mr brokaw , mr rather and ms walters climbed to the pinnacles of broadcast television , their successors must somehow distinguish themselves in a universe of several hundred cable channels and countless internet news sites , as opposed to just three networks whose signals were easily attained through simple antennas they must also persuade today s viewers who are far more skeptical than their parents about what they see and read that they can be believed so the senior generation has become something of a placeholder , keeping the network franchises together until the arrival of new faces and strategies what has changed is the kind of journalism the senior crowd is producing those who have become accustomed to seeing mr rather interview heads of state including saddam hussein may have been surprised to see his cozy sitdown with the actor bruce willis \( mr rather has said he has several big investigative projects in the works \) mr brokaw will be seen later this year in several primetime documentaries on nbc including , he said , one on the middle east and another on evangelism but viewers' first postanchor glimpse at him was on the discovery channel last sunday night , when he provided a scientific epilogue at the conclusion of a disaster movie called supervolcano mr wallace has kept his story count high partly by forsaking investigative pieces for profiles , which often require only one or two interviews meanwhile , mr koppel has loudly announced he is looking for work since he and abc failed to reach agreement to extend his contract after it expires in december he had been offered the lead role on the sunday program this week , two executives said , but turned it down mr koppel and his longtime executive producer , tom bettag , have said they will seek to ply their services elsewhere on their wish list are such outlets as national public radio and hbo in a sense , the senior statesmen of television news are typical of their generation americans are living longer and healthier lives , and the age of retirement is being stretched in companies across the country but many americans who have been lingering past 65 in far less glamorous jobs have often done so because they cannot afford to retire that is hardly the case in network news , where mr wallace , mr rather , mr brokaw and ms walters have long earned multimilliondollar annual salaries instead , this group may find the attention , competition and , yes , the prospect of making millions of dollars more too intoxicating to forsake while emphasizing that she was speaking only in general terms , brenda berger , a psychologist and psychoanalyst who was a producer at abc in the 1970 s , said that people who have worked in network television news around the clock , and around the world might have had difficulty developing the hobbies or interests that would give them an expanded sense of self when the cameras go off but that s just a piece of it , said dr berger they are also superstars , so their self is confirmed by the exultation of millions of viewers their self is confirmed by huge salaries by stats like ratings by interesting and varied work it s like , 'what can compete with that when you are thinking of giving it up \? ' don hewitt , who was the executive producer of 60 minutes for more than three decades at least until he retired , under pressure , last year at age 81 put it a different way when you 've been living in the sunshine all your life , you do n't want to move to the shade mr brokaw declined last week to reflect on his life in semiretirement , saying he felt it inappropriate to speak in the immediate aftermath of the announcement by peter jennings that he would take temporary leave of world news tonight to be treated for lung cancer but in an earlier interview , in the days leading up to mr rather s retirement last month , mr brokaw acknowledged that he had found himself twitching as big news broke and he had no role to play the tsunami and the baghdad elections were very hard for me , he said he added that he had taken some solace in no longer being a flyby grandfather during the iraqi elections , he visited with his daughter and her two children in florida and in his documentary work i'm spending a lot of every day on nbc news projects , he explained as mr brokaw adjusts to the rhythms of longerform work , ms walters and mr wallace have continued to land the splashy , emotional , newsy interviews they are known for one morning late last month on good morning america just after a cohost teased a coming segment on age blasters , described as exciting new products that help you to turn back the clock and look younger than you have in years ms walters , filling in for the vacationing diane sawyer and charlie gibson , conducted a live interview with robert blake even saturday night live took notice of her longevity last week on weekend update , the same segment in which gilda radner first spoofed her speech impediment as babwa wawa 30 years ago 'the view' cohost elisabeth hasselbeck gave birth wednesday to a baby girl , intoned tina fey , the mock anchor and barbara walters has reportedly already harvested the baby s soul so she can continue to live forever a spokeswoman for ms walters , alyssa ziegler apple , said she was too busy to be interviewed for this article in person and off camera , mr wallace , his hair still full and his skin tan , does occasionally show his age he tends to slap his creased forehead and close his eyes tightly when trying to remember something like which of his former wives he credits with keeping him on a strict , agedefying menu of nuts , raisins and fish \( for the record , it was lorraine , his third wife , from whom he was divorced in the mid 1980 s he has been married to his current wife , mary , his fourth , for nearly two decades \) but on camera , mr wallace remains agile in ways that cannot be attributed to editing during his 60 minutes interview with mr wallace , for example , mr canseco suggested that he had injected mark mcgwire , a former teammate on the oakland athletics , with steroids on two occasions mr wallace was dubious i'm just repeating what you say in the book , mr wallace said 'i would often' often , not twice 'inject mark ' suddenly , mr canseco was backpedaling i think it was more we 'd inject ourselves , mr canseco said i think i injected him , and this was a long time ago , once or twice a few weeks later , during an interview in his office , mr wallace was asked if he could foresee a time when he might slow down or even stop he responded with visible indignation would you \? later , on the phone , he added a caveat he would stop , he said , when my toes turn up
four volunteer boy scout leaders from alaska were accidentally electrocuted yesterday afternoon as they set up camp on the first day of the scouts' national jamboree at fort ap hill , va , the organization said the four victims , all adult men , were killed between 4 30 and 5 pm at their camp at the military base , gregg shields , a spokesman for the boy scouts said two other scout leaders and a contract worker were injured and were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment , mr shields said their conditions were not released by the authorities last night neither mr shields nor brian wolfe , a spokesman for rappahannock electric cooperative , the electric company that provides powers for the base , offered any details of how the accident happened bill haines , the executive of the western alaska council of the boy scouts , which covers about 80 percent of the state s scouts , said the men had been among eight leaders selected from a field of 20 to accompany about 80 scouts from troop 711 , in the anchorage area these are just the cream of the crop , mr haines said from his home in eagle river , alaska these people sacrifice time and energy because they care about kids you could n't ask for a better group of people it s just a tragic loss two of the men had accompanied their sons on the trip , mr haines said one man who died had two sons at the jamboree , a quadrennial event the other two men were lifetime scouters , he said , whose sons had been in the organization when they were younger mr haines said that none of the names of the dead would be released until all the families were notified the son of one man works here in town and i had to tell his son because his mother s out of town , mr haines said that was very difficult any time you lose a father it s very tough , and with scouting your family tends to be tighter to the father because you do a lot with him the scouts arrived yesterday at fort ap hill , an active military base where temperatures reached about 100 degrees for the jamboree , a week of outdoor recreation including scuba diving , archery and allterrain biking busloads of scouts and troop leaders scampered around from morning to evening yesterday , receiving their camp assignments , pitching tents and setting up eating areas the accident caused a power loss that left some areas of the camp without electricity for 30 minutes as counselors were brought in to speak with the campers , a spokeswoman for the scouts , renee fairer , said , our thoughts and prayers are with the families after news of the accident broke , families called the jamboree in a panic to make sure their children were unharmed , ms fairer said she said she was not aware of any parents' withdrawing their sons from the jamboree president bush was scheduled to address the scouts there tomorrow evening , mr shields said mr haines , who knew all four of the electrocuted men , said that as of last night , there were no plans to bring the alaskan scouts home the troop was moved to another part of the base the three sons of the dead men would return to alaska , he said the troop left anchorage last week and began a tour of the washington area before going to fort ap hill , which lies about 90 minutes south of the capitol it s a good opportunity for the kids to get down to the lower 48 , mr haines said to raise money to cover the 2 , 500 cost of the trip , the scouts sold popcorn , held car washes and did extra chores at their homes the leaders each paid 1 , 250 out of their own pockets , mr haines said one of the men killed had recently moved from alaska to ohio , and decided only last week , on a visit to attend the 50th anniversary celebration of the western alaska council , to attend the jamboree when space opened up he had been in scouting for 25 years , mr haines said this was his first jamboree gov mark warner of virginia issued a statement saying the accident would be investigated thoroughly in alaska , over the sound of his doorbell chiming as he fielded calls about the accident , mr haines said the jamboree would not be the same for his troops for some years everybody knows them , he said of the dead men it s going to be a huge loss for this council they were some of the best leaders that we had
hartford , nov 28 leaders of the democraticcontrolled legislature said on monday that they had reached an agreement on what would be the nation s most farreaching campaign finance reforms , prohibiting political contributions from lobbyists and contractors , among others , while creating a new system for financing campaigns with state money yet even as the democrats vowed to pass legislation as soon as wednesday on the contentious issue , which has loomed all year , they also said that they had not completed a bill for public scrutiny right now we just have bullet points , said donald e williams jr , a democrat who is the senate president pro tempore the house republican leader , robert m ward , said that the details would probably contain loopholes favoring the democrats gov m jodi rell , a republican who has pressed for reforms since the regular legislative session last spring , said she was pleased with the majority party s support of most of my original reforms , which i have been pushing for the past six months but she added , of course , they do n't yet have a bill , and i must review the actual language to make certain that everything they say is in there is actually in there if the announced agreement raised questions , it also appeared to give solid momentum to proposals that earlier this year had divided the house and senate , including when the new rules would take effect and what roles political action committees would play in campaigns leaders of reform groups , including connecticut common cause , the league of women voters and the connecticut citizen action group , stood with the democrats to urge passage of the measure in a state still recovering from scandals that dominated the final year in the administration of mrs rell s predecessor , john g rowland the scandals that led mr rowland to resign on july 1 , 2004 , and later led to his pleading guilty to a federal conspiracy charge , centered on gifts he received from people doing business with the state and prompted a series of attempts at reform in areas ranging from state contracting laws to campaign finance jeffrey b garfield , the executive director and general counsel of the state elections enforcement commission , whose office could gain expanded powers and increase to 21 employees from 14 under the proposal , said he was encouraged there s no question that passage of the bill would make connecticut no 1 in the country in campaign finance laws , mr garfield said james a amann , a democrat who is the house speaker , said the agreement essentially eliminates special interest money from the political process while some other states ban contributions from lobbyists and contractors , and others offer public financing , none do both , said democratic leaders , who provided a chart titled campaign finance reform strongest in the nation arizona and maine offer public financing but not the same restrictions that connecticut is considering south carolina bans some of the same donations but lacks public financing under the proposal , beginning in the 2008 election cycle , candidates for governor , other state offices and the legislature would no longer be able to accept contributions from lobbyists or contractors , as well as those made by corporations through purchases of advertising space in socalled ad books , which are typically distributed at fundraisers lobbyists would also not be able to raise money from their clients political action committees would not be allowed to raise money from lobbyists , contractors and ad books , and they would have new restrictions on how much they could give to candidates contributions to political parties would be restricted , and the parties would be limited in how much they could give candidates the restrictions would apply whether or not candidates choose to participate in a new statefinancing system candidates could opt to pay for their campaigns largely with money from a new citizens election fund , which would be financed with money the state collects each year in unclaimed personal property , such as abandoned bank accounts connecticut currently takes in about 20 million annually through unclaimed property , and initially would need about 16 million to 17 million to pay for the campaign fund , said senator williams if candidates choose to have the state fund their campaigns , they first must raise money through contributions of 100 or less to meet a qualifying threshold , which changes depending on the office being sought a candidate for governor , for example , would have to raise 250 , 000 to receive 125 million for a primary race and 3 million for a general election a candidate for the state s house would have to raise 5 , 000 to receive 10 , 000 in the primary and 25 , 000 in the general election under the proposal , candidates who forgo state financing would be able to accept larger individual donations the limit for governor would increase to 3 , 500 from 2 , 500 senator donald j defronzo , a democrat who helped shepherd versions of the proposal through committee and a summer working group , said the higher limits for those not taking state financing were necessary because prohibiting lobbyist , contractor and adbook contributions could significantly reduce the pool of contributors mrs rell , who is running for a full term in 2006 , has set strict selfimposed restrictions that go beyond what the democrats proposed on monday for 2008 in addition to those prohibitions , she has said she is refusing contributions from political action committees several aspects of the democratic proposal were unclear mr ward , the house minority leader , questioned whether union campaign drives , including large phone banks , were being given special leeway under a part of the proposal that would allow political action committees to provide limited inkind services nonetheless , andy sauer , the executive director of connecticut common cause , which has pushed for reform all year , said he completely supported the proposal
washington , nov 15 the senate voted on tuesday to press the bush administration to provide more public information about the course of the war in iraq as lawmakers of both parties made it clear they wanted chief responsibility for securing the country shifted to the iraqi government within the next year lawmakers voted 79 to 19 for a republican plan to seek new quarterly reports on matters like the number of iraqi troops ready to take the lead in combat operations the proposal expressed the senate view that 2006 should be a period of significant transition to full iraqi sovereignty but the senate rejected , by a vote of 58 to 40 , a democratic proposal to require the bush administration to project dates for a phased withdrawal of troops should conditions allow while the practical consequences of the bipartisan vote on the republican proposal may be limited and largely symbolic , the willingness of most senate republicans to join with most democrats to prod the bush administration on the war represented new determination to distance themselves from the white house in the face of dwindling public support for operations in iraq for the first time , said senator joseph r biden jr of delaware , senior democrat on the foreign relations committee , our republican colleagues have joined democrats in listing and insisting on a clear iraqi strategy from this administration , a schedule to achieve it and real accountability president bush , asked during a news conference in kyoto , japan , about the congressional action , said on wednesday that he was more than happy to provide congress with more regular updates on iraq i appreciated the fact that the senate rejected an amendment that would have taken our troops out of iraq before the mission is complete , he said , a reference to the democrats' attempt to set a deadline for withdrawal he said he viewed the language that passed as consistent with the administration s strategy , and insisted anew that the only reason we wo n't succeed would be if we lost our nerve the proposal , part of a broad annual pentagon policy measure approved 98 to 0 , came as senators also sought greater influence in setting american policy on the treatment of terror detainees and their access to courts , matters congress has largely ceded to the administration the detainee provisions , if enacted into law , would essentially codify the military court system established by the white house for enemy combatants at guant namo bay , cuba by 84 to 14 , the senate approved a bipartisan compromise that would allow the guant namo prisoners to challenge in federal court their detention as enemy combatants and to appeal automatically any convictions and sentences handed down by military tribunals in excess of 10 years the deal retreated from a senate vote last week that would have cut off the detainees' access to the federal courts , but it would still prevent those being held from asking the courts to intervene in treatment and prison conditions the senate positions on iraq policy , detainee rights and an earlier approval of a provision banning cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees known as the mccain amendment were expected to complicate negotiations over military policy with the house , which included none of those proposals in its own pentagon measure and the administration has already encouraged the house leadership to resist the provision on torture in a separate senate military spending bill white house officials said on tuesday that the administration would be willing to provide additional information sought by congress we have always welcomed a regular dialogue with congress , said dana perino , a white house spokeswoman we agree that progress is being made by both the military and civilians in iraq the progress is extraordinary and should not be drowned out by partisan politics in washington senator bill frist of tennessee , the majority leader and a sponsor of the iraqi policy approved by the senate , sought to frame the approach as one of cooperation with the white house it is not a change of policy , said mr frist , who called the approval of his plan an absolute repudiation of the democratic push for possible withdrawal dates but the main opposition for the policy proposal came from republicans who said it put too many constraints on the administration , was a step toward a timetable for withdrawal , was ill timed because mr bush is out of the country and had been prompted mainly by political anxiety about the impact of the war on next year s midterm elections i think it speaks to a bit of nervousness about public perception of how the war is going in terms of '06 elections , said senator lindsey graham , republican of south carolina , one of 13 republicans who joined 6 democrats in opposing the proposal and to be honest with you , the war is going to be going on long after '06 i'm more worried about getting it right in iraq than the '06 elections though the competing proposal from senate democrats was rejected , most of them backed the republican leadership s plan and hailed its approval as a new recognition by the senate that bush administration policy on iraq had been misguided the united states senate said the policy must change staying the course will not do , said senator harry reid of nevada , the democratic leader it was a vote of no confidence on the president s policies in iraq senator john w warner , republican of virginia and the chairman of the armed services committee who wrote the proposal based on a democratic plan , said the push on the iraq policy was not meant as criticism of the administration but was a signal to the iraqi people we have done our share , mr warner said now the challenge is up to you in the measure , the senate says its view is that american forces should not remain in iraq any longer than required and that the administration needs to explain to congress and the america people its strategy for the successful completion of the mission in iraq the bill also requires a new quarterly report from the administration , though it provides no penalty for noncompliance among the topics to be covered in the report are efforts at reaching a domestic political settlement in iraq , training of iraqi security forces , the status of iraqi police forces , the ability of the iraqi government to direct domestic security forces and a schedule for meeting conditions that would allow a transfer of security responsibilities and , ultimately , a withdrawal of troops the vote on the legal rights of detainees ended days of intense negotiations after the senate voted last week to block their access to the courts , an action that drew opposition from a variety of human rights and legal advocacy groups who saw it as an affront to the constitution mr graham , the author of the original plan , said the new approach could protect both the bush administration s objectives for holding and trying the detainees and the rights allowed of those being held the compromise allows every detainee under our control to have their day in court , he said but other lawmakers were highly critical senator arlen specter , republican of pennsylvania and chairman of the judiciary committee , said the senate was meddling with fundamental rights without sufficient review these are weighty and momentous considerations that go far beyond the detainees at guant namo , mr specter said an effort to reject the graham provisions on court access by senator jeff bingaman , democrat of new mexico , failed on a 54to44 vote in the aftermath of the votes on the legal rights of detainees , human rights groups expressed disappointment , acknowledging that the compromise was an improvement over last week s decision but saying it still limited the jurisdiction of the courts it is certainly past time for congress to get involved in the issue of detention at guant namo , said elisa massimino , washington director of human rights first but congressional involvement should mean more than simply endorsing the administration s deeply flawed processes like the military tribunals and combatant status review tribunals encroaching on the rule of the courts does not solve the problem , and in fact makes it worse
knock at room 18 on the fourth floor of 559 west 22nd street and an old man in a watch cap stumbles to the door what am i doing here \? he asks , answering the question with a question i'm dying here , he says his name is george ullrich and , according to his own account , he has been dying here for almost 30 years he lives in a small room , 10 feet deep by 10 feet wide , and in rooms all down the hallway , a piece of the city s history is slowly dying with him , one old man at a time there is bob zillard , on the third floor , whose chosen company these days is a six pack of beer there is dennis bolger , around the corner , who , because of hernia problems , can rarely get off the couch there is mr ullrich himself , who spends his days reading books on hieroglyphics and ancient greek and then there is kevin none of his neighbors know his last name who roams the streets in a baseball cap and white beard half as long as his arm these men are the last remaining tenants in no 559 , a building that , like the neighborhood itself , has been swept by major change west 22nd street , from 11th avenue to the west side highway , has been transformed from warehouse space to art galleries , from auto body shops to coffee bars where once there were stevedores , there are now italian tourists wellheeled women walk expensivelooking dogs in the way of these things , the first floor of no 559 will soon become a glassandbrushedsteel bar and lounge called opus 22 where fancy liquor will be served to the cocktail set the second floor is an art gallery named the proposition where the current exhibition is titled systems appearances dogma taboo art s not my thing , said mr ullrich , who is 71 years old places change , but people do n't people just get old mr ullrich and his fellow tenants recall a different sort of neighborhood , a place of corner bars and broken windows , a place where the rents were so cheap that sailors could pay for six months upfront and then head off to sea there are more important matters in the world than the four old men living out their lives in a building that has changed around them their story does not concern the war or the economy , but here it is nonetheless their building went up in 1889 as a rooming house for longshoremen who once plied the docks a short block to the west it overlooks pier 63 and sits around the corner from the old headquarters of the international longshoremen s association , whose onetime president , joseph p ryan , was a model for the labor boss of on the waterfront there is not much interaction between the old men and the art on the second floor it would seem that a chair made out of tape measures or a video installation of a young woman doing pushups in a miniskirt are not much to their taste ronald sosinski , the gallery s director , said he saw the old men in a comingandgoing sort of way on the stairs and found them harmless , often full of humor he opened the gallery in 2000 at a time , he said , that everybody had to come to chelsea it was just not a question anymore still , he seems to recognize the uniqueness of a building where the art he sells can cost 10 times what the tenants pay in rent it s probably the only building like this around anymore , mr sosinski said and it may be in its last moments , too the landlord is alan frank , who says he is content to have the men around mr frank presents himself as a lover of the old ways and charges his tenants the generous rate of 300 a month as landlords go , he is the sensitive sort the cruel twist is that these guys were left here living among the yuppies and the galleries , he said all their haunts have disappeared the coffee shop the old mexican restaurant the little drugstore i have a certain amount of sympathy for them living in an area that s not familiar to them anymore in two or three more years , with attrition , they 'll probably be gone , he says , adding that he has no plans to toss them out if i have nothing to do with it , i 'll be happy as for the old ways , he , too , remembers the old bar on the first floor , a place named catch 22 or slavo s or joey s , depending on whom you ask its nickname was the bucket of blood , said mr frank , suggesting that the stevedores and sailors who used to gather there often got out of hand the first time he set foot in the place , a sign on the bar reminded the patrons management is not responsible for women left overnight from the former owners , mr frank said , there were tales of thanksgiving dinners served to the salts upstairs at little or no cost it should be said that mr ullrich , mr zillard , mr bolger , 62 , and the elusive kevin never worked on the docks they are , respectively , two retired teamsters , a firefighter and a military veteran , all lucky enough to have found cheap lodgings in rooms they secure with padlocks whenever they go out the rooms themselves are much as one might imagine , or worse the furniture is spartan the paint peels off the wall in continentshaped flakes an odor of cat urine hovers in the hall each of the men arrived in his own way mr bolger s former home burned down mr zillard was a bachelor mr ullrich was drawn by the cheap rent as for kevin , his neighbors say he could not survive anywhere else loneliness is often an old man s native state , and the halls here are filled with artificial voices from the radio , the turntable , the television set a decade ago , there were 20 tenants some moved out , some were asked to leave death has claimed the rest mr zillard , 74 , attributes his own longevity to drinking beer , never whiskey he has outlived two generations of bartenders at his favorite haunt , peter mcmanus cafe , at 19th street and seventh avenue as for the family life , he says he missed the boat thirty years ago he met a girl on the subway her name was kathleen clark he got her name but not her address he has been looking for her ever since i got an icebox there i put my six packs in , he said that keeps me company enough i 'll probably die here , he went on , waiting for them to paint
do n't ask nick denton , publisher of gawker media and its growing list of popular web logs , about his empire people come up to me as if it s witty and say , 'how is the empire going \? ' mr denton said , which is pretty pathetic do n't ask him about his business plan , either he says he never had one the only reason he formed the company , he said , was to make his network of blogs which includes gawker , the flagship chronicle of manhattan news and gossip fleshbot , the thinking person s diary of smut and about 10 other titles more attractive to advertisers it does n't help with readers , he said it s actually a disadvantage , because it looks corporate at a time when media conferences like les blogs in paris two weeks ago debate the potential of the form , and when businessweek declares , as it did on its may 2 cover , that blogs will change your business , mr denton is withering in his contempt a blog , he says , is much better at tearing things down people , careers , brands than it is at building them up as for the blog revolution , mr denton put it this way give me a break the hype comes from unemployed or partially employed marketing professionals and people who never made it as journalists wanting to believe , he said they want to believe there s going to be this new revolution and their lives are going to be changed for all of the stiffarming and disdain that mr denton brings to the discussion of this nonrevolution , however , there is no question that he and his team are trying to turn the online diarist s form ephemeral , fastpaced and scathingly opinionated into a viable , if not lucrative , enterprise big advertisers like audi , nike and general electric have all vied for eyeballs on gawker s blogs , which mr denton describes as sexy , irreverent , a tad elitist and unabashedly coastal he says that there is no magic behind gawker media , his threeyearold venture based in new york to his mind , it is built around a basic publishing model but like it or not in the overheated atmosphere of blogomania , mr denton , 38 , remains one of the most watched entrepreneurs in the business if his reluctance to be interviewed is theater , it is deft theater a british expatriate and former financial times reporter , mr denton is tall , slim , and saltandpepper handsome , with the slightly embarrassed air of someone who invested in the dotcom boom and came out unscathed \( he made millions in two previous ventures including a company called moreover technologies , an online news aggregator that presaged the twitchy , checkthisout linking that now make blogs de rigueur reading for desk jockeys worldwide \) striding toward the unadorned thirdfloor tribeca loft that is the closest thing to a gawker nerve center , mr denton reiterated , in a polite , sometimes halting staccato that often fades into a string of inaudible syllables , that he would not discuss money he declined to say if gawker was profitable , or how much he paid gawker s dozen or so bloggers editors , as the company calls them he fired up a marlboro light and , hustling across canal street , chattered obliquely about overhead \( minimal in the blogging business \) , libel \( always a concern \) and fred durst in march , mr durst , the limp bizkit front man , sued gawker , among other sites , for linking to a sex video in which he appeared honestly , though , we do n't know why you 're so mad at us , gawker s editor , jessica coen , sneered in a march 4 entry the situation is really rather simple someone sent us a link to a video of your penis , we went into shock , and we shared it with the world for about two hours then we wept , found god , took a hot bath , and removed the video from our site mr durst eventually dropped the suit a grueling climb led to the quiet , whitewashed loft space where a few gawker media hands including lockhart steele , the company s managing editor , and gina trapani , the editor of one of the company s newest blogs , lifehacker were plucking away at laptops \( gawker shares the space with another blogger , maxwell gillinghamryan of apartment therapy \) mr steele , who joined the company in february , is the den mother for gawker s farflung collection of bloggers and is in near constant communication with them throughout the day via instant messenger about half of the editors live in new york the rest are distributed around the country in california , mark lisanti edits defamer , the los angeles counterpart to gawker , and in colorado , brian d crecente edits one of the newer sites , kotaku , dedicated to video games in new orleans , john d'addario edits fleshbot , while ana marie cox covers political gossip from washington on wonkette each editor is under contract to post 12 times a day for a flat fee , mr steele said \( gawker has two editors and now posts 24 times a day \) it is best to have eight posts up before noon , if possible , to keep readers coming back , he said the editors scan the web for the best tidbits readers , and apparently even published authors , send in tips when a gawker site highlights articles from , say , the wall street journal or the new york times , it is likely , both mr steele and mr denton said , that the article s author sent an email message to gawker pointing out its existence \( this reporter s naivet about this process was met with gentle laughter \) site traffic is a particular obsession gawker draws just over a million unique visitors a month fleshbot , the most popular site , lures nearly twice that number , and gizmodo , a site dedicated to gadgets , roughly 15 million all editors can earn bonuses if they manage to generate spikes in traffic say , with a link to the latest paris hilton crisis or fred durst s anatomy ms trapani s hourbyhour traffic statistics serve as the desktop image on her computer it s extremely fast paced , she said it s a lot of output some days it s overwhelming without a doubt other days it goes really smoothly if i get some good reader tips and there s something great going on like mr denton , she was careful not to discuss specifics of gawker s business , including how much its editors are paid but a published interview with mr steele earlier this year provides some insight bloggers are paid a set rate of 2 , 500 a month , he told a digital journalism class at new york university taught by patrick phillips , the editor and founder of i want media , a web site focusing on media news when asked in the class if the company was in the black , his response was straightforward it is profitable , mr steele said we 're very small , have no overhead , no office space everybody works from home and you heard what we pay our writers nick founded gawker very specifically with the idea of starting a whole bunch of blogs in very niche topic areas , hire freelance writers to write each of them , hopefully draw a lot of eyeballs and then sell advertising around it he had the idea that no one site would probably ever make a fortune but if you have 10 sites each making 75 , 000 a year , then , ok , maybe it s not like cond nast money , but it s a nice little business mr denton chafed at the mention of mr steele s interview he said it was misreported and was supposed to be off the record mr phillips said that no such arrangement existed , and that the posted interview was an exact transcript from a recording of the session whatever the circumstances , for those quivering about the revolutionary potential of blog publishing , or wondering what makes ventures like gawker tick , there could n't have been a plainer explanation the simplicity of the model may be why mr denton is alternately guarded and dismissive of all the hype surrounding blogs he seems to recognize that he is not up to anything particularly trailblazing , and that it s only a matter of time before others catch on competitors like jason calacanis s weblogs , with its network of more than 70 consumer and niche blogs , are already copying the gawker model the idea of grouping the blogs , mr denton said , was to give the company an air of respectability the only reason we 're listed as a group at all is for advertisers , he said advertisers treat gawker titles more seriously because it s part of a group in other words , gawker speaks their language it has a publication schedule and can traffic in digital marketing babble like frequency capping \( how often an advertising spot runs \) and skyscrapers \( tall , thin ads \) such familiarity with the ways of madison avenue makes a difference in the world of blogs , where marketers still fear to tread , said jill griffin , who is now a senior vice president and group account director at media contacts , the interactive division of the media planning group of havas earlier , when she was a digital strategist at the marketing firm omd , ms griffin was one of the first advertising executives to bring bigname clients to blogs including absolut and ge to gawker i think it was in mid2003 , ms griffin said it was just myself and some friends and business associates in the professional advertising community we just started reading gawker because we thought it was a hoot she said that after realizing that they were all single , young , wellpaid and casting their gaze on this fertile space , she thought , we 've got to get on that on the gawker sites , cpm rates the cost for every 1 , 000 times an ad is presumably seen by visitors can run anywhere from 4 for a small , buttonsized ad to 50 for exclusivesponsorship ads , in which an advertiser helps underwrite the debut of a new gawker site \( sony did this for gawker s blog lifehacker \) mr denton says that a clear line is drawn between news and advertising , and that so far none of the companies buying space on the sites including the times auto section , which advertised on the car blog jalopnik have ever tried to influence content the editors are expected to write a thankyou to our sponsors at the end of each week , although this is typically done sarcastically for example , thanking advertisers for keeping the staff wellstocked in crack cocaine it goes beyond any kind of question of church and state or journalistic ethics that the whole editorial tone of the gawker sites is absolutely wrapped up in the notion of take no prisoners , mr denton said it owes nothing to anybody , and if one ever started compromising that , it would be grim but others have begun to wonder if the brand itself is a form of compromise stowe boyd , president of corante , a daily online news digest on the technology sector , suggests that there may be something lost when networks like gawker media and weblogs turn blogs into commodities , churned out for a fee , owned by an overlord and underwritten by advertisers they 're pursuing a very clear agenda and they 've done very well with that , mr boyd said of gawker but they 're just an old media company in new media clothes , and i still maintain that they are missing part of the point the point , mr boyd said , is that blogging is unique because of its spontaneity and individualism , and that bloggers , like dancers and sculptors , are most interesting because they are pursuing their muse the editors on gawker are talented , entertaining and informative , mr boyd said , but also indistinguishable from any freelance writer , with no ownership of what they produce these people are hirelings , he said what they are cranking out are the 700 words they signed on to produce other critics of the blog movement wonder whether the hoopla over the commercial viability of blogs particularly as publishing ventures is overstated blogs primarily excel at marketing and promotion for companies or individuals , mr phillips of i want media said i think blogging can catapult unknown writers , and it can give them a platform if they 're talented but as a standalone business , i think the jury is still out on that mr denton , who says that no one , least of all him , is becoming rich publishing blogs , would seem to agree with that notion it s not about the money , he said or about corrupting the art of the blogger if someone is saying that we publish according to a routine of at least 12 posts a day and begin in the morning and if someone is sick we replace them , then i plead guilty , he said we believe in regular posting schedules but he also says that nothing he is doing prevents other blogging models from taking shape , or independent bloggers from logging on and doing what they have always done some of my own favorite sites are ones that have no consistency beyond the wit and charm of the writer , he said there s room for both and there is , apparently , a ceiling on gawker s expansion last month , the company started sploid , a drudgelike headline news blog with a tabloid look , and mr denton says two more titles are planned for the short term , although he would not be specific about the particular consumer itches he 'll be scratching this time having covered everything from blackberries to beltway gossip , it s hard to imagine what else looms , but he said writers had already been lined up that will bring the number of titles to 14 , and mr denton indicated that 17 seemed a good stopping point , if for no other reason than that is the number of titles published by cond nast he also plans to reintroduce gawker s blog of blogs , called kinja a service that even mr denton says was rather badly deployed and even more awkwardly explained in its original form a team of programmers has been working for the last two years to revamp the service , which allows users to explore and scan their favorite blogs in one place the new version will be ready in about a month so , onward goes the nonrevolution if you take the amount of attention that has been devoted in the last year to web logs as a business and something that s going to change business and compare that with the real effect and the real money , it s totally disproportionate , mr denton said , in the same way all the coverage of the internet in the late 90 s was out of whack there are too many people looking at blogs as being some magic bullet for every company s marketing problem , and they 're not , he added it s internet media it s just the latest iteration of internet media
the 22nd running of the breeders' cup world thoroughbred championships will not be short on horses or on global reach 22 of the 117 competitors that were preentered yesterday were from outside the united states but what will be missing from the eight races to be run oct 29 at belmont park for a total purse of 14 million are some household names triple crown stars like the kentucky derby winner giacomo and the preakness and the belmont stakes champion afleet alex are nursing injuries and ghostzapper , the 2004 horse of the year and the reigning breeders' cup classic victor , has been retired to the life of a stallion the afternoon will not be without star power , however , and perhaps most important for horse racing enthusiasts , each race promises a full field of 14 these are the hardest races in the year to win , said the trainer todd pletcher , who will saddle eight horses in four races one of them will be ashado , who will try to defend her title in the 1 million distaff horses get injured , and that s part of the game , pletcher said but the ones who are showing up are the very best out there you really ca n't find any slouches in this bunch the most eagerly awaited races may be the juvenile for 2yearold colts and the sprint , which feature two undefeated horses first samurai has won all four of his starts in impressive fashion and may be the colt to end the socalled juvenile jinx none of the 21 previous 2yearold winners have come back to capture the kentucky derby the next may but first samurai , the son of giant s causeway , was bred to relish the mileandsixteenth distance as well as the derby s mileandaquarter route he s the best 2yearold i 've ever been on , said jerry bailey , the hall of fame jockey , who has mounts in all eight races you dream about a horse like this coming along lost in the fog is already a star and is the prohibitive favorite in the sixfurlong , 1 million sprint a 3yearold colt , lost in the fog has earned more than 889 , 000 , winning 10 races on eight tracks in arizona , california , florida and new york no competitor has been closer than a length and a quarter to lost in the fog at the wire this could be the best contingent from europe to travel to america on breeders' cup day ouija board will come from england to try to win the filly and mare turf race for the second year in a row , and six european horses have a chance to capture the 2 million mileandahalf turf marathon two european horses have preentered for the afternoon s marquee race , the 4 million classic at a mile and a quarter , despite never having raced on the dirt the irish champions stakes victor , oratorio , a 3yearold , and starcraft , a 5yearold new zealandbred horse who has won group 1 races in england , france and australia still , the american threesome of borrego , rock hard ten and saint liam are heading into the race after impressive performances borrego galloped home a fourandahalflength victor in the jockey club gold cup at belmont park rock hard ten won his fourth consecutive victory in the goodwood at santa anita the probable favorite , however , is saint liam , who ran off with the woodward stakes last month at belmont we 've got a chance to improve a lot off that race , said richard dutrow jr , the trainer of saint liam we 're ready to go out there and fight for bailey , who has won 14 breeders' cup races , the most by a jockey , bringing saint liam home first would be a fitting end to a lucrative afternoon he will probably be on three other favorites first samurai , ouija board and shakespeare , who will also put a perfect record \( 50 \) on the line in the turf race saint liam has been as impressive as anyone , he said rock hard ten and borrego look legit he should be on the lead or in a stalking position , and i know he can run
the field across from our neighborhood elementary school was always a little scruffy , the grass patchy in places , the bleachers and fence rudimentary but the locals appreciated it anyway neighbors with lawn chairs spent summer afternoons there , tanning and reading the weekend paper children drifted by for pickup ballgames dogs could chase frisbees without plowing into the street the lack of overhanging trees and wires made the field a perfect site for kite launchings , too but last year , and please pardon my sounding like a joni mitchell song , the bulldozers arrived the montclair board of education turned the field , not into a parking lot , but into an upgraded athletic facility , an expanse of vivid synthetic turf with permanent field markings , a big scoreboard , a new fence and a padlock the 70 or so high school girls who play field hockey can use it , and so can other high school teams , as well as organized sports leagues and camps that carry liability insurance the rest of us are unwelcome i know some neighbors were unhappy about this my husband grumbled that the fence , 10 feet tall , looked more appropriate for a maximum security prison a couple across the street disliked all the officialness we did n't mind the kids romping around out there , the husband said now it s practically an olympic stadium down the block , my neighbor christine used to take her twins to the field to play but the last time they walked over , carefully skirting the edge of the fake turf to sit in the new bleachers and take in a lacrosse practice , some guy a coach \? a parent \? christine was n't sure objected he said 'what are you doing here \? you ca n't be here go away she said i did n't argue i went away interestingly , none of us protested to anyone official we can see how celebrated jock culture has become in suburban towns , where the desire for healthy minds and bodies mingles with the obsession over healthy college applications we did n't have to tune into that summer show on the bravo cable network , sports kids moms dads , to witness consuming commitment to athletics we just had to look around so it seemed futile to protest that , somehow , humans managed to play games on real grass and dirt for centuries if artificial turf has n't invaded your town yet , it probably will soon it s been increasing every year , says boyd sands , executive director of the new jersey state interscholastic athletic association , making it sound like a plague it s moving through central jersey and heading south west essex and livingston and east orange have synthetic fields toms river has three rutgers stadium has swapped its grass for a surface called fieldturf and , because synthetics get hot , installed an accompanying irrigation system watering fake grass ! this is a great country but fake fields are more vulnerable than they look , apparently they can be damaged , the local school business administrator , dana sullivan , tells me soda gum they 're flammable so we lock them , and unfortunately that does cut down on their use by the public but the board felt we needed to protect the investment when the investment hits 653 , 000 , as this one did , you can see her point it seems a bit churlish to complain , anyway do n't we want high school kids to have fine new fields that are easier to maintain , stand up to multiseason use and give field hockey balls a truer bounce \? the benefits of athletic participation are extensively documented , especially for girls i suppose it s a happy development , therefore , that in the past decade the number of kids playing high school sports in new jersey is up nearly 20 percent among boys , and more than 37 percent among girls all those scholarathletes have to practice someplace in fact , the girls' varsity field hockey team that plays on what was once our neighborhood field won the league championship last fall , and then the state sectionals go , mounties ! but while the players and their parents shoulder a lot of the direct costs of sports the shoes and equipment , the lessons and camps , the hours spent shuttling players to practices and games the rest of us also make sacrifices , and not simply in our role as taxpayers we 've lost the easier pace of a time when late afternoons and weekends could be unstructured , when recreation could be spur of the moment , when everything did n't always have to be so terribly organized we 've lost a community where kicking a ball around does n't require filling in paperwork and carrying insurance to reserve a slot on thursday afternoon week after next we 've lost a communal backyard with scrubby , but genuine , plant life we 've lost our field drawing \( drawing by nancy doniger \)
fernando ferrer faced a torrent of criticism yesterday for telling a police union last month that the 1999 shooting death of amadou diallo was not a crime participants at a convention organized by the rev al sharpton accused mr ferrer of flipflopping and turning his back on an issue crucial to many blacks the reaction to mr ferrer s appearance yesterday at a candidates' forum at the national action network convention makes it increasingly difficult for mr sharpton to endorse him in the democratic mayoral contest mr sharpton has said he will announce his decision as early as monday one man at the forum , james snead , 66 , told mr ferrer that he had voted for him in the 2001 mayoral race and would not vote for him again mr ferrer was prominent in protesting the killing of mr diallo and supported the criminal indictment of the four officers who were later tried in the case and acquitted why would you support some police sergeants that 90 percent of do n't even live in the city of new york and do n't even vote in the city of new york , mr snead said , his voice rising and now you appease them and you turn your back on us \? as members of the crowd clapped and yelled out , that s the truth , and keep it real , mr snead shouted , now i'm going to have to say it to you you 'll never get my vote in life another man , john foust sr , 63 , a retired police officer who said that he had submitted himself to arrest to protest the shooting because he believed it to be a crime said , now i want you to explain to me how you can tap dance around the question as to its not being a crime mr ferrer s answers that he had spoken carelessly and that the acquittal of the officers involved did not make the shooting right did nothing to mollify the restive audience of about 65 when mr foust asked him again if he thought the shooting was a crime , mr ferrer began , you know , i'm not a lawyer , and the room erupted in laughter , with one woman calling out , he s a robot the dustup came after a week in which mr ferrer has tried to explain himself to black leaders and voters at the same time , mr sharpton , whose endorsement is considered critical for a segment of the black electorate , has been weighing a decision on whom if anyone to endorse in the race with the exception of c virginia fields , the manhattan borough president and only black in the race , none of the candidates appeared prepared for the questions they received and found themselves running into problems related to the specific concerns of the audience but the audience reactions to gifford miller , the city council speaker , and anthony d weiner , a united states representative , did not have nearly the emotional intensity that was focused on mr ferrer and mr sharpton , who saved his warmest introduction for ms fields , did little to smooth things over for mr ferrer at one point , mr sharpton approached mr ferrer at the microphone , saying that he knew there was a lot of concern over the diallo statements and asking if mr ferrer believed the officers should have gone to trial when mr ferrer , pinkcheeked , said that he had said all along that they should have , mr sharpton said , but you know you ca n't go on trial unless you 're charged with a crime , and the audience burst into laughter and applause later , mr sharpton told reporters that in that moment he had been seeking clarity mr sharpton has had a strained relationship with mr ferrer and his camp since the end of the 2001 mayoral race while mr sharpton s endorsement was considered an essential element in mr ferrer s finishing first in the democratic primary , it was ultimately viewed as a liability in the runoff against mark green after mr green won that race , there was a sense within the sharpton camp that mr ferrer had walked away from his relationship with mr sharpton and reached out again only when the next mayoral contest was in sight because mr sharpton is a polarizing figure among many white voters , his endorsement may be considered a doubleedged sword for a general election , political consultants say , but it is often considered crucial for winning a certain segment of the black vote in the city from the beginning of this race , mr sharpton has signaled his reluctance to get on board with mr ferrer initially , he announced he was endorsing councilman charles barron , who planned to run for mayor but then he dropped out before the race actually began now mr sharpton s aides say he has been leaning toward ms fields mr sharpton , who may decide to sit out the primary entirely , said that he had not yet made a decision , but that he would follow the lead of the membership of the national action network , his looseknit civil rights organization but there seemed little doubt that the leadership of that organization would not only oppose endorsing mr ferrer , but would oppose his candidacy should he win the nomination the anger in the room was strong and personal obviously , i was listening to him , listening to the concern of a lot of people that lead us in this organization , mr sharpton said after the forum that will have a lot of bearing on what decision we make this weekend
a young bicyclist opened fire with a silver handgun near an upper east side housing project two weeks ago , and tenants say he might no longer be at large if they had been able to shoot back with security cameras according to the police , the man fired five shots on 94th street and first avenue in the early afternoon before pedaling away residents of the project , isaacs houses , which is bordered by first avenue , franklin d roosevelt drive and east 93rd and 95th streets , say a witness heard the shots and saw two men fleeing the gunfire through a playground at the project even though the city budgeted 150 , 000 last year to install more surveillance cameras at isaacs houses , they are not yet in place some residents say the cameras could have helped solve the shooting by capturing images of the two fleeing men , who have not come forward there s no doubt in my mind that it would have at least helped , said rose bergin , the president of the stanley isaacs tenants association , and i also believe if people had known there were cameras , they would have thought twice before doing the shooting last fall , ms bergin walked the grounds of isaacs houses with a contractor and new york city housing authority representatives to choose camera locations resulting plans called for at least one camera to be trained on the area where the two men fled , she said city councilwoman eva moskowitz , who secured the money for cameras , accused the housing authority of dawdling on the project they are slow as molasses , she said , and i feel pretty strongly that these projects are pretty simple to do in response , howard marder , a housing authority spokesman , said the project was actually somewhat complex because of the need to evaluate a variety of camera designs for different uses and to acquire and install the closedcircuit equipment if there was any apparent delay , he said , it s because we wanted to make sure it was done properly as part of a 65 million project to install digital security cameras in 12 housing projects , mr marder said , 10 cameras will be installed in each of the two isaacs buildings that have none one isaacs building received cameras last year the installation of the cameras will begin at the beginning of october and will be completed before the end of the year , he said it s not like we 're sitting on the money doing nothing the cameras cannot arrive too soon for isaacs residents , who expressed concern at a public meeting last wednesday that many people who do not live in isaacs have been congregating there ms bergin , of the tenants association , said isaacs residents feared that the men who fled the shooting might retaliate people are sitting out there with their kids there s a sprinkler system for kids , she said but they say , 'this is n't over ' john freeman gill
new orleans , nov 21 at one bank branch , vandals whacked futilely at a vault with what must have been a crowbar at another , looters worked over an outdoor cash machine , stripping its plastic molding and exposing the metal and wire innards but never reaching the stack of bills locked inside after smashing through a glass door , the intruders took a sledgehammer to the cinderblock wall housing the bank vault they bashed a hole large enough to crawl throughif not for the thick steel plate on the other side these are some of the depressing scenes that met alden j mcdonald jr , the chief executive of liberty bank and trust , the largest blackowned bank in new orleans , as he toured the eastern half of the city in early november this vast stretchencompassing the 9th ward , the 7th ward and new orleans eastis home to most of liberty s customers as well as the bank s headquarters prior to hurricane katrina the visit was in part a field trip to inspect the moldy , stinking remains of bank branches hit hardest by flooding and looting but mainly mr mcdonald was on a scouting expedition here , in the predominantly black , eastern half of new orleans , he was searching for signs of activity that might justify the reopening of some of liberty s six closed new orleans branches the bank is operating only two of its eight new orleans branches , both located in the western half of the city mr mcdonald found little cause for optimism nearly three months after the storm , reconstruction of the new orleans economy is turning out to be slower and more complex than many people first thought basic services like electricity , water and sewer are still lacking in large swaths of the city , including the new orleans east neighborhood , home to four of liberty s eight new orleans branches the new orleans school district optimistically said it would open a small number of its schools by the start of november , but that deadline has passed without any action residents from lowlying areas await word on the city s plans for their neighborhoods meanwhile , toxic mold clings to everything it touches and permeates the air , sickening even occasional visitors looted buildings have yet to be cleaned up and wrecked structures yet to be leveled because there are not enough workers to haul away the debris and some businesses , including liberty , are trapped in limbo as they try to negotiate settlements with insurance companies depending on the settlement , i 'll clean up or i 'll tear it down , mr mcdonald said liberty s slow progress returning to new orleans , despite mr mcdonald s best efforts , is the wider tale of the crescent city and just as liberty is dependent on the local economy s rebirth , the city needs liberty to write commercial loans and home mortgages to start the painstaking rebuilding progress mr mcdonald , who is chairman of the new orleans chamber of commerce and serves on the commission the mayor appointed to devise a rebuilding plan for the city , is never quite sure if he is helping his bank or his city , in large part because they are often one and the same anything we do to get people back in town helps my bank , he said anything we can do to help new orleans get back on its feet helps me as mr mcdonald drove the streets of the 7th ward , a workingclass community of bungalows where he grew up , he found only scant traces of life there were almost no people on the streets for blocks on end , and virtually no cars traversed thoroughfares that would normally be crowded at midday so instead he pointed at skeletons businesses liberty had helped to underwrite and that , since katrina , have been boarded up , and homes the bank financed that are now sitting unoccupied this here was my customer base , and it s just gone , he said he shook his head , and his normally sleepy eyes bulged in disbelief it is a phrase and look he would repeat a halfdozen times during a threehour excursion , as if still trying to bend his brain around the immensity of it all more than half the journey was spent crisscrossing the streets of new orleans east in the city s northeast quadrant if anything , this corner of new orleans , where the city s black middle class and professional class was concentrated , offers a picture even more disheartening than the lowincome 7th ward in select pockets of the city , such as uptown and the west bank , where two liberty branches have reopened , lights blaze in windows at night and restaurants and bars along major thoroughfares are sometimes so packed that one must hunt for a nearby parking space yet if life in communities such as uptown once again spool by in technicolor , life in new orleans east still plays out in black and white there s something ghostly about the area that , prekatrina , was home to about 90 , 000 people trees still lean on collapsed rooftops yellow insulation bleeds out of homes gutters sit at odd angles , like fractured limbs everywhere , cars sit at whatever angle the floodwaters left them virtually all of new orleans east is still without electricity homes and businesses still have no drinkable water or working toilets and will not for a minimum of six months , according to the city s sewerage and water board the only people in evidence are crews of men in hard hats , dressed in jeans and hooded sweatshirts and wearing bandanas across their faces , banditstyle when people talk about the city repopulating , it s all in uptown new orleans , it s on the west bank , it s in the quarter , mr mcdonald said none of this is repopulated the bad news for liberty is also good news the bank will not have to spend the cash it does not have to fix boardedup branches in the eastern half of the city , nor will it need to dispatch the personnel it does not have in a tight labor market to staff outposts in deserted parts of town liberty s branches in the eastern half of the city lay in ruins the floors are still strewn with broken glass desks and chairs and dead plants , all of them coated with a thin film of muck , lie toppled over the bank s operations center , a bunkerstyle building in new orleans east that had formerly housed liberty s main computer and paper files , is another disaster the building took water almost to the roof , and now it is unsalvageable , mr mcdonald said in far better shape is the bank s main headquarters , a sixstory glass box located a few blocks from the operations center that building , which liberty had occupied for less than six months prior to katrina , suffered both wind damage and flooding , but little damage above the first floor we were all set to move our computer center on to the third floor but mr mcdonald never finished the thought instead he shook his head and chuckled last month the bank spent 500 , 000 on a new mainframe computer he sees loss everywhere in the eastern part of the city , so what s another halfmillion dollars \? to stop the mold from spreading inside the bank s main offices , liberty is spending 1 , 500 a week on fuel to operate an emergency generator that blows dry air into the building mr mcdonald has not taken similar steps to save his own home in lake forest estates , a pricey section of new orleans east his was a handsome brick house complete with a swimming pool , an exercise room and twocar garage before it was flooded by at least four feet of water instead of trying to gut the home , as a small percentage of his neighbors are doing , he has given it up as destroyed it is no wonder a dark , evillooking mold has taken over the walls , and the home still smells as if bathed in fetid swamp water we 'll retrieve whatever we can and start over , said mr mcdonald , 62 , who is married with three grown children mr mcdonald had one additional stop to make after leaving new orleans east liberty runs a small branch inside a supermarket in the gentilly neighborhood he had heard that the grocery store was planning on reopening by midnovember that branch suffered little damage , so he figured on assigning a team of four people to run it the same number that had worked there prior to katrina but that was before stopping by the store and driving around the neighborhood , a middleclass enclave just south of lake pontchartrain he saw an occasional car in a driveway he spotted a gardener working on someone s front lawn but mainly he saw a community still in stasis large sections were flooded , and parts were still without electricity who s going to bank here \? he asked there are small signs of life , but it s spotty it s spotty at best by trip s end , he decided he would dispatch one person to that branch if he dispatched anyone at all articles in this series are examining the struggle by the liberty bank and trust company to

come sept 1 , debtladen americans everywhere can find out what creditors really think of them on that date , residents of the northeast will be able to order free copies of their credit reports by logging on to annualcreditreportcom people on the west coast got access last december and the availability has been rolling eastward since but a credit report , in all its mindnumbing detail , is not what most people will be looking for they want the quick snapshot of their creditworthiness they want the fico score , and it s not free fico is short for the fair isaac corporation , which created the score just as any collegebound student knows that his or her sat score determines whether an ivy league or a community college will be welcoming , the fico score tells how eagerly creditors will give you money the threedigit number from 300 to 850 is used by mortgage brokers , credit card companies , retailers and auto dealers to determine how much you can borrow and at what interest rate the higher the score , the better you need to know that number , but you should not obsess about it that can be hard , though , because the credit agencies and fair isaac would very much like you to monitor it closely andy jolls , a vice president for fair isaac , said , the more people who know about it the better that is certainly true for fair isaac , a minneapolis company that last year sold 7062 million worth of financial data to companies that want to sort out the deadbeats over the last four and a half years , it has sold more than 10 million scores to consumers at 45 each revenue generated from the company s myficocom web site jumped 33 percent , to 32 million last year the fico score , invented in 1988 , has in a very short time become the single most important indicator used by lenders to predict whether you will repay your debt the company used to cloak the score in secrecy , but in recent years it has become quite open about its prized possession the score , it says , is largely based on just two factors history of paying off debt and credit utilization , or the amount of debt you have in relation to your credit limits fair isaac measures this , along with three other factors , applies an algorithm to compare that data with the payment patterns of millions of other americans and generates the fico score any number below 500 and you are a financial pariah get above 750 , where 40 percent of americans are , and the credit card companies will never stop plying you with offers so , of course , you want to know what your score is it is human nature to want to know that you , with your fico of 816 , rank in the top 3 percent of americans if your mortgage broker does not share it with you free of charge , by all means , buy it fair isaac and each of the credit bureaus will be glad to sell versions of it to you \( it does not come with any credit report , free or otherwise \) here s the first rub the credit score you get is not really the score that a lender will use fair isaac sells a variety of scores aimed at various markets its computers slice the data it purchases from credit bureaus any number of ways for clients some scores calculate the odds of a bankruptcy filing , while others help a collection agency predict the likeliness one will make good on a debt some lenders even have their own algorithm to generate a proprietary score there are thousands of options and creditors choose which one they want , says maxine sweet , vice president for consumer education at experian , one of the three major credit agencies in fact , fico uses experian data to generate the score that is very similar to what the majority of mortgage lenders ask for , but experian also sells a version to consumers called score plus you can also obtain a credit score called empirica from transunion , and one called beacon from equifax , that closely approximate the fico score all the numbers are different , but are not supposed to vary much you really only need to look at one score but myficocom and each of the credit agencies not so subtly urge you to buy more with a variety of products , including some that will give you constant updates of your score if you are checking your credit report three times a year as you should , watching your score change every few weeks is complete overkill they also urge you to buy products to improve your scores it is not unlike the way kaplan , a unit of the washington post company , or princeton review inc exhort people to improve their sat or gmat scores it s a nice analogy , mr jolls said the difference , he says , is that not everyone goes to college and most people in this country use credit but does everyone need to obsess over this score \? suze orman , the financial health evangelist , says they do she sells a 50 product on myfico that tells you how improve it the advice is sound , but the truth is , nearly the same advice is found free elsewhere on the myfico site \( where the orman package has real value is a feature to check your credit report for errors and automatically generate letters to the credit bureau to correct them \) my advice is targeted to people who are broke , said ms orman , whose latest book is titled , the money book for the young , fabulous and broke these are the people who need to get their scores up
every day , dr arleen sharpe of dobbs ferry , ny , sees patients who need a flu vaccine but cannot have one because her office received fewer than half of the 800 doses it ordered for a large family practice of 10 , 000 patients on long island , dr hilton silver , a pediatrician in port washington , was reassured when he placed his vaccine order that there would be more if he needed it but now that he has run out , with youngsters still in need of boosters , he cannot find any they told us there would be no shortage , that the problem last year was resolved , he said in middletown , nj , dr roger m thompson , who heads a group of 22 doctors , is frustrated that shopping centers have offered vaccines while many physicians , himself included , received only part of their order or none at all my partner s inlaws get their flu shot from a car wash , and you do n't even have to get out of the car , he said officially , there is no widespread shortage of flu vaccine this year , only distribution and delivery problems , according to the united states centers for disease control and prevention dr jeanne m santoli , deputy director of the immunization services division of the agency s national immunization program , said that at least 78 million doses of influenza vaccine have been distributed an amount that is close to the highest we 've had but dr santoli acknowledged that some providers did not get what they needed , largely because one manufacturer made far fewer doses than it had originally projected at the same time , there is mounting frustration among physicians that the healthy corporate employee or costco shopper is getting a shot while many of the sick and elderly , whom the cdc considers a priority , are not all of my young patients are getting it through their wall street firms , which i think is a little ridiculous , dr sharpe said i saw at least three patients today whom i wanted to give a shot to it s very upsetting one of the challenges in sorting out the supply issues is that no agency tracks who gets what we 've heard a lot of concern , but much of it is anecdotal , dr santoli said we have n't had a systematic assessment by all accounts , the problem is not nearly as dire as last year , when one of the major makers of flu vaccine had to withdraw its shots from the market over contamination concerns that same manufacturer , chiron , had problems again this year and lowered its estimated production by almost half , dr santoli said another factor affecting family doctors and pediatricians is the rise of the mass vaccinators or community vaccinators health care companies and organizations that buy huge numbers of doses for distribution in workplaces , bigbox stores and nursing homes the feeling among some doctors is that the vaccine manufacturers favor these big customers over the family practices michael mastromonica , director of pharmacy services for costco , agrees this year , costco teamed up with maxim health systems , a corporate health services company , to administer 250 , 000 flu shots to customers across its more than 300 stores in the united states when you 're buying four million of anything , you get priority over someone who s buying 100 , mr mastromonica said however , len lavenda , a spokesman for sanofi pasteur , the largest influenza vaccine maker in the united states , said his company did not have a preference for the large providers , who received less than 10 percent of the company s vaccines the retail and workplace providers also note that many people they serve would not otherwise seek out a shot and they say that they adhere to federal guidelines reserving the vaccine for highrisk groups until late october and they have faced supply problems , too maxim announced in early november that it was canceling its remaining retail flu shot clinics because of distribution challenges however , the company says it will continue to fulfill its commitments to corporate clients in october , senators hillary rodham clinton , a democrat of new york , and pat roberts , a republican from kentucky , introduced legislation that they said would strengthen the flu vaccine delivery infrastructure among the provisions is a tracking system to determine on a countybycounty basis the amount of vaccine available for distribution in midnovember , the cdc director , dr julie l gerberding , acknowledged that many americans were frustrated that they could not find a flu shot , but gave assurances that more vaccine was coming many doctors say they are still waiting organizations that represent physicians in new york and new jersey conducted surveys early last month and found that a majority of doctors were still waiting on the bulk of their orders but in a nov 30 survey of 310 doctors by the medical society of the state of new york , 55 percent said they had not received all of the vaccine they had ordered of those , 34 percent said they had not received any in another survey , the new jersey academy of family physicians , which represents 1 , 600 family doctors and medical students , found in november that 46 percent of respondents said they were either considering or had already decided not to distribute flu vaccines next year what really stands out is that a number of physicians have grown so weary of the difficulty of obtaining vaccine from year to year and the position it puts them in with their patients , said ray saputelli , the academy s executive vice president we 're not suggesting that flu vaccine not be offered in retail establishments , he said but if it s not available in the doctor s office , you 've eliminated one of the most important places where patients can expect to find a vaccine dr santoli of the cdc said doctors were likely to continue to receive late shipments , and she urged patients to check with their physicians in the coming weeks
east rutherford , nj bruce c ratner may be a real estate mogul , but he is a rookie nba owner in the next few days , i suggest that he hop in a limousine with jason kidd and take a long ride and a lesson in ownership 101 from one of the greatest point guards in nba history last night , kidd handed out 16 assists most of them to vince carter as the nets put themselves in position to claim the final nba playoff spot with a 10483 victory over philadelphia the nets , left for dead by many including me tied cleveland for the eighth and final eastern conference playoff position , and the nets have the tiebreaker edge over the cavaliers if the nets make the playoffs , ratner will be the beneficiary of his first unearned miracle as a league owner there s hope , kidd said last night that s like having the carrot in front of the rabbit you want to at least have something out there now , anything can happen this has to be one of the most emotionally challenging seasons in kidd s 11year nba career he turned down entreaties from the san antonio spurs and stayed in the swamp with the nets he thought he would be coming back to a team that reached the nba finals in 2002 and 2003 and the conference semifinals in 2004 ratner , who wants to move the franchise to brooklyn , tore out the guts of the franchise when he allowed kenyon martin to get away shrewdly , the nets did this after kidd committed to return challenging , yes , kidd said seems like i 've been through this before , in dallas with the change of ownership , when you have some young talent , then all of a sudden you sell a team and it goes in a different direction we felt we had the core that s what happens with new management he added the business of basketball sometimes gets in the way as a professional , you just continue to go out there and do your job you can rant and rave all you want , but you have a job to do , and that s to go out there and win basketball games obviously , ratner is n't all thumbs in middecember , with mounting criticism by fans , the news media and some players , ratner untied the hands of the team s president , rod thorn , and allowed the nets to acquire carter and his contract from toronto i was n't that excited about vinsanity because he did n't seem to be excited about basketball kidd seems to have rekindled carter s passion for the game yesterday , in a game the nets desperately needed , carter scored 43 points kidd really does want to win a championship he had knee surgery over the summer and worked tirelessly to return to full strength this is something the new breed of owners may not fully understand about their players the owners make their money in microchips or automobiles , and they have a hard time understanding that what drives the worldclass athletes they own is a desire to win ratner may well view his players , his employees , the way he views parcels of land and buildings they have no feelings , no emotions , none worth considering in any event martin was a parcel of land that became expendable ratner might have underestimated how the loss of martin affected kidd a prime piece of property i love to play , kidd said no matter what the business side of it is , you ca n't be upset , as an employee i just want to push my owners and management to be the best they can be ratner watched kidd guide the nets to their 40th victory of the season with philadelphia closing in , kidd had backtoback assists , extending the nets' lead to 8772 after a 76ers turnover , kidd set up a basket that extended the lead to 8972 finally , kidd s turnaround jumper in the lane gave the nets a 9174 lead and helped put away the game kidd will make the hall of fame as a player will ratner make the hall of fame as an owner \? or will he be another in a series of nets owners who grab the nets like a hot potato , juggle the franchise , move it , then hand it off \? this is what we do n't know about ratner is he as committed to being a great nba owner as kidd is to being a great nba player \? as much as they want me to be the best that i can be i'm going to work on my game , kidd said i want them to work on theirs where do owners work on their game \? in the boardroom , kidd said the mind , being able to do certain things i'm not asking for a rabbit out of the hat as much as they want to hold us responsible , i want them to do what they have to do to do their jobs because i care just as much as everybody in this locker room that s why we 're in the position we 're in ratner should take that long ride with kidd this spring he obviously knows about building buildings , but his 32yearold point guard might teach him a thing or two about building a franchise
officer michael forman of the suffolk county police department told departmental doctors in april 2003 that he had hurt his wrist while on duty , and for the next two years he continued telling them that the injury was too painful for him to drive a patrol car , county officials said yesterday the injured wrist , however , did not prevent him from responding to more than 200 calls as a volunteer firefighter in bethpage , in nassau county , and later as chief of the bethpage fire department , according to the officials , who announced yesterday that they had arrested officer forman on charges of grand larceny and defrauding the county of more than 250 , 000 , which he collected in taxfree workers' compensation officer forman , 39 and a 13year police veteran , had been assigned to patrol the third precinct in brentwood and received nine awards for exceptional police work , police commissioner richard dormer said it s not a happy day for us when we have to arrest an officer , he said during the time officer forman was collecting workers' compensation , fraud investigators from the police department , the suffolk county district attorney s office and the state s workers compensation board videotaped him driving a bethpage fire department vehicle and wielding a pole saw as he lopped branches from a tree at his nassau county house , district attorney thomas spota said two days after one doctor s visit , he was videotaped driving his fire chief s vehicle while responding to nine emergency calls , mr spota said during the two years he was collecting workers' compensation , officer forman was either certified or recertified as a rescue scuba diver and as a class a firefighter , the highest certification for a volunteer to maintain the class a certificate , he would have to undergo annual testing to show that he was fit enough to stretch hoses , raise ladders , use heavy tools to break down a door and carry out search and rescue operations , commissioner dormer said he also answered more than 200 emergency calls after reporting his wrist injury , the police said the wrist injury was the 12th lineofduty injury officer forman reported since his hiring in october 1991 , commissioner dormer said , adding that none were life threatening suffolk officers with lineofduty injuries receive their full salaries and benefits , tax free , for as long as they are incapacitated the county is selfinsured , so those benefits come directly from the county the 250 , 000 that officer forman received included the value of his benefits officials were unable to say how much of that represented wages this officer s actions made a mockery of a system designed to protect legitimately injured police officers , commissioner dormer said , adding that his field auditing bureau , which investigates complaints of disability and workers' compensation fraud , received a tip from a department doctor that mr forman might have been malingering mr forman pleaded not guilty on tuesday in county district court in central islip and was released without bail by judge paul hensley five calls to various officials at the bethpage fire department , including mr forman s office , were not returned
we are in the midst of a remarkable washington scandal , and we still do n't have a name for it leakgate , rovegate , wilsongate none of the suggestions have stuck because none capture what s so special about the current frenzy to lock up reporters and public officials the closest parallel is the moment in monty python and the holy grail when members of a mob eager to burn a witch are asked by the wise sir bedevere how they know she s a witch well , she turned me into a newt , the villager played by john cleese says a newt \? sir bedevere asks , looking puzzled i got better , he explains burn her anyway ! another villager shouts that s what has happened since this scandal began so promisingly two summers ago at first it looked like an outrageous crime harming innocent victims a brave whistleblower was smeared by a vicious white house politico who committed a felony by exposing the whistleblower s wife as an undercover officer , endangering her and her contacts in the field but if you consider the facts today , you may feel like sir bedevere where s the newt \? what did the witch actually do \? consider that original list of outrages the white house felon so far karl rove appears guilty of telling reporters something he had heard , that valerie wilson , the wife of ambassador joseph wilson iv , worked for the cia but because of several exceptions in the 1982 law forbidding disclosure of a covert operative s identity , virtually no one thinks anymore that he violated it the law does n't seem to apply to ms wilson because she apparently had n't been posted abroad during the five previous years the endangered spies ms wilson was compared to james bond in the early days of the scandal , but it turns out she had been working for years at cia headquarters , not exactly a deepcover position since being outed , she s hardly been acting like a spy who s worried that her former contacts are in danger at the time her name was printed , her face was still not that familiar even to most washington veterans , but that soon changed when her husband received a truthtelling award at a nation magazine luncheon , he wept as he told of his sorrow at his wife s loss of anonymity then he introduced her to the crowd and then , for any enemy agents who missed seeing her face at the luncheon but had an internet connection , she posed with her husband for a photograph in vanity fair the smeared whistleblower mr wilson accused the white house of willfully ignoring his report showing that iraq had not been seeking nuclear material from niger but a bipartisan report from the senate intelligence committee concluded that his investigation had yielded little valuable information , had n't reached the white house and had n't disproved the iraqniger link in fact , in some ways it supported the link mr wilson presented himself as a courageous truthteller who was being attacked by lying partisans , but he himself became a democratic partisan \( working with the john kerry presidential campaign \) who had a problem with facts he denied that his wife had anything to do with his assignment in niger , but senate investigators found a memo in which she recommended him karl rove s version of events now looks less like a smear and more like the truth mr wilson s investigation , far from being requested and then suppressed by a white house afraid of its contents , was a lowlevel report of not much interest to anyone outside the wilson household so what exactly is this scandal about \? why are the villagers still screaming to burn the witch \? well , there s always the chance that the prosecutor will turn up evidence of perjury or obstruction of justice during the investigation , which would just prove once again that the easiest way to uncover corruption in washington is to create it yourself by investigating nonexistent crimes for now , though , it looks as if this scandal is about a spy who was not endangered , a whistleblower who did not blow the whistle and was not smeared , and a white house official who has not been fired for a felony that he did not commit and so far the only victim is a reporter who did not write a story about it it would be logical to name it the notagate scandal , but i prefer a bilingual variation it may someday make a good trivia question what do you call a scandal that s not scandalous \? nadagate oped columnist email tierney nytimescom

for more than 30 years , major college football teams have been labeled division ia by the national collegiate athletic association , distinguishing them from division iaa teams , which play a lowercost , and lowerprofile , version of the game in time , exacting membership standards were established for universities to stay in division ia , including a requirement that every team average at least 15 , 000 in home attendance or be relegated to division iaa at the end of last season , that regulation should have caused the expulsion of several universities that did not meet the attendance cutoff but at a meeting this week , the ncaa division i board of directors will most likely save those programs by repealing or drastically modifying the requirement talk of changing or eliminating the requirement has set in motion a series of related proposals to change other rules , including permitting more games between ia and iaa teams to count toward eligibility for bowl games and to do away with the designation iaa these proposals , and a measure to allow a 12th regularseason game in college football , make up a weighty agenda for the division i board of directors , who are to meet tomorrow in indianapolis it could be a pretty energetic meeting , robert hemenway , the board chairman , said and i 've learned not to predict how the board will act in the future , any of the 117 division ia teams with an attendance problem may simply be allowed to buy enough tickets to its own games at a substantial discount to reach the 15 , 000 minimum it would not matter if anyone actually used a ticket to sit in a seat the key statistic would be 15 , 000 in paid attendance it s more than unseemly , it s dysfunctional , said scott s cowen , the tulane university president and a member of the division i board of directors it could lead to a lot of unintended consequences , with schools doing things that are not in keeping with the spirit of college athletics cowen supports eliminating the attendance requirement entirely hemenway , president of the university of kansas , said i think a lot of institutions view the attendance requirement as a pain in the neck it s too hard to control with so many variables like the weather and there is gamesmanship with the attendance figures now a private donor can buy up all the tickets to the last home game just to make sure you 're over the minimum kent state , which plays division ia football , averaged slightly more than 10 , 500 for six home games last season carol a cartwright , the kent state president , is on the division i board of directors and has helped lead the discussion about altering the attendance requirement also on the 18member board is sidney mcphee , the president of middle tennessee state university , whose division ia football team drew fewer than 15 , 000 fans a game cartwright said some of us felt we were too vulnerable to something out of our control last year , we had some freakish weather on the day of two midseason home games , and our numbers went south after that we can exercise control over every requirement to be in ia , but it s unrealistic to think we can always manage our attendance i'm delighted my colleagues on the board have listened division ia football universities are required to outspend their 122 iaa counterparts in many ways , most prominently in the number of athletic scholarships that can be awarded \( 85 total in ia , 63 in iaa , although some iaa programs , like those in the ivy league , have none \) the payoff for ia institutions , in exposure by the news media and in possible multimillion dollar appearances in major bowl games , can be worth the investment , although an overwhelming majority loses money on football this has not stopped a significant number of universities from abandoning iaa football for ia in the last few years some leaders of iaa conferences say the watering down or elimination of the attendance requirement would increase the migration to ia and devalue iaa football so when the division i board of directors first began talking about changing the attendance requirement in january , a caucus of commissioners from iaa conferences persuaded the ncaa to propose a series of compromise measures meant to appease iaa members called the iaa enhancements , these proposals are on tomorrow s agenda next to the modification of the attendance requirement the first proposal calls for emergency ncaa legislation for the 2005 football season to allow ia football teams to apply one victory each season against an iaa team toward the six victories needed for eligibility to a bowl game the second proposal would allow one game against an iaa team a season to count toward the ncaa minimum of five home games a season for ia teams the third proposal would , in essence , do away with the ia and iaa designations a division i football program would instead be identified by whether it intends to go to a major bowl game or the 16team playoff culminating in the iaa national championship precisely what the two new divisions would be called is uncertain we just do n't want to be called iaa , said doug fullerton , commissioner of the big sky conference , one of the top iaa leagues in the nation even though it only applies to football , ia schools recruit against us and call our basketball teams and track teams iaa programs they 're not , but people and recruits might understand that better if we had a new term that was football specific if the other proposals are approved , the iaa institutions would benefit financially from playing more ia football teams , because the ia teams would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to iaa teams to be visiting opponents these are frequently lopsided games in favor of the home team , but the iaa teams would get a featured appearance on a big stage something useful in recruiting david berst , the ncaa vice president for division i and the staff liaison to the board , said he thought there was a consensus developing in the direction of approving each of the membership changes but interviews with several board members indicated divisions on the iaa enhancements on the proposal to do away with the name division iaa , hemenway , the chairman , said , i honestly do n't think it 'll happen fullerton said if the iaa proposals were not approved , iaa universities might lead a revolt to override the board s decision , something virtually without precedent in the ncaa berst said that if 30 universities wanted to override a board decision , it would go back on the agenda for the next directors' meeting in august if 100 member institutions want to override the decision , it is put on the convention agenda in january i think we could win an override , fullerton said we 've got more than 100 iaa schools , and i think some of the ia s would come with us football correction april 28 , 2005 , thursday because of an editing error , a picture caption yesterday with a sports article about the national collegiate athletic association s requirements for division ia football programs referred incorrectly in some copies to the site of a game that drew fewer than 15 , 000 fans it was kent state , not middle tennessee state
the darkness at ground zero just got a little darker if there are people still clinging to the expectation that the freedom tower will become a monument to the highest american ideals , the current design should finally shake them out of that delusion somber , oppressive and clumsily conceived , the project suggests a monument to a society that has turned its back on any notion of cultural openness it is exactly the kind of nightmare that government officials repeatedly asserted would never happen here an impregnable tower braced against the outside world the new design by david childs of skidmore , owings merrill is a response to the obvious security issues raised by the new york police department , specifically the tower s resistance to car and truck bombs the earlier twistedglass form , a pastiche of architectural visions cobbled together from daniel libeskind s master plan and various skidmore designs , lacked grace or fresh ideas the new obeliskshaped tower , which stands on an enormous 20story concrete pedestal , evokes a gigantic glass paperweight with a toothpick stuck on top \( the toothpicklike spire was added so that the tower would reach its required height of 1 , 776 feet \) the temptation is to dismiss it as a joke and it is hard not to pity mr childs , who was forced to redesign the tower on the fly to meet the rigid deadline of gov george e pataki unfortunately , the tower is too loaded with meaning to dismiss for better or worse , it will be seen by the world as a chilling expression of how we are reshaping our identity in a postsept 11 context the most radical design change is the creation of the base , which will house the building s lobby and some mechanical systems designed to withstand a major bomb blast , the base will be virtually windowless in an effort to animate its exterior , the architects say they intend to decorate it in a grid of shimmering metal panels a few narrow slots will be cut into the concrete to allow slivers of natural light into the lobby the effort fails on almost every level as an urban object , the tower s static form and square base finally brush aside the last remnants of mr libeskind s master plan , whose only real strength was the potential tension it created among the site s structures in the tower s earlier incarnation , for example , its eastern wall formed part of a pedestrian alley that became a significant entry to the memorial site , leading directly between the proposed international freedom center and the memorial s north pool the alley , flanked on its other side by a performing arts center to be designed by frank gehry , was fraught with tension it is now a formless park littered with trees the interior , by comparison , holds a bit more promise for the hopelessly optimistic visitors will enter from north and south lobbies , where they will have to slip around an interior partition set just beyond the revolving doors yet another concession to security concerns if the configuration of windows could somehow be improved , one could imagine , with some effort , a sealed cathedrallike room with heavenly light spilling down but if this is a potentially fascinating work of architecture , it is , sadly , fascinating in the way that albert speer s architectural nightmares were fascinating as expressions of the values of a particular time and era the freedom tower embodies , in its way , a world shaped by fear at a recent meeting at his wall street office , mr childs tried to deflect this criticism by enveloping the building in historical references the height of the tower minus its spire \( 1 , 368 feet \) matches the height of the taller of the former world trade center towers and is meant to reestablish a visual relationship to the nearby world financial center , which was exactly half that height the fortresslike appearance of the base was partly inspired by the strozzi palace in florence , the relationship between the base and the soaring tower by brancusi s bird in space sculpture but the tower has none of the lightness of brancusi s polished bronze form , let alone its sculptural beauty and the strozzi palace s rough stone facade is beautiful because it is a mask once inside , you are confronted with a courtyard flooded with light and air , one of the renaissance s great architectural treasures what the tower evokes , by comparison , are ancient obelisks , blown up to a preposterous scale and clad in heavy sheaths of reinforced glass an ideal symbol for an empire enthralled with its own power this obsession with symbolism extends all the way up to the tower s spire mr childs has long been itching to reposition the original spire , which , as mr libeskind envisioned it , had to be set at the edge of the tower to echo the outstretched arm of the statue of liberty in the new version , the spire rises out of the center of a tension ring mounted atop the building , an abstract interpretation of liberty s torch and a concept that , like mr libeskind s , has more to do with pandering to public sentiment than with any big architectural idea all of this could be more easily forgiven if it were simply due to bad design but ground zero is not really being shaped by architects it is being shaped by politicians soon after the new security requirements were announced , it became clear that the entire building would have to be redesigned that could have been seen as a last chance to repair what had become a confused master plan , one that had little connection , except in the minds of mr libeskind and governor pataki , to the original instead , the quality of the master plan has been sacrificed to the governor s insistence on preserving hollow symbolic gestures absurdly , if the freedom tower were reduced by a dozen or so stories and renamed , it would probably no longer be considered such a prime target fortifying it , in a sense , is an act of deflection it announces to terrorists do n't attack here we 're ready for you go next door photo an artist s rendering of the freedom tower , as redesigned to meet concerns about security it still reaches 1 , 776 feet , but now its base is a 20story concrete pedestal \( photo by skidmore , owings merrill llp , via reuters \) \( pg b1 \)
washington , june 13 the leaders of five african nations confronted president bush on monday about what they said was the slow pace at which the united states is releasing aid to poor nations , and got a pledge from mr bush to speed things up the presidents of botswana , ghana , mozambique , namibia and niger visited mr bush at the white house as part of the administration s effort to promote democracy and economic development in africa and to highlight the policies it has pursued to reduce poverty and disease there the leaders all of whose countries held democratic elections last year generally praised the united states for trying to do more to assist africa but they said they were disappointed that the administration had not done more to accelerate disbursements of aid through the millennium challenge account , the white house s primary channel for dispensing money to poor countries that show committment to democracy and sound economic policies until monday , only one country , madagascar , had won final approval for aid under the program on monday afternoon , the government approved a second country , honduras madagascar s deal , which was signed in april , qualifies it for 110 million in aid over the next four years honduras is eligible for 215 million over five years nicaragua and cape verde are on the verge of signing final agreements almost none of the money has been disbursed of the five nations whose leaders met with mr bush , two , mozambique and ghana , are applying for help under the program niger has yet to meet the conditions for eligibility botswana and namibia have income levels above the cutoff for participation in the program the african leaders complained bitterly about the slow pace of the talks and the disbursement of money , president festus mogae of botswana told reporters he said mr bush had assured them the united states would resolve the logjam one thing we discussed was the millennium challenge account , and i assured the leaders we will work harder and faster to certify countries , so that they can see the benefit of this really important piece of legislation and funding , mr bush said in remarks after the meeting
if you 've ever been to pylos or heard its fans talk about it , you know that one detail literally above all others defines it the clay s the thing it s what more than 1 , 000 unglazed pots attached to the restaurant s ceiling are made of they hang upside down , dramatic and seemingly perilous , drawing your eye and maybe even making you feel a little chicken this sky really does look as if it could fall this restaurant would never let that happen pylos has been put together with considerable care and operates with unusual grace , a conscientious ambassador of greek cooking and a standout in the east village , where the dining scene has improved over the last few years pylos \( pronounced peelohs \) , which roughly means things of clay , opened in 2003 , replacing a more casual restaurant called it s greek to me the seriousness of its intent is clear in its pedigree the owner , christos valtzoglou , hired diane kochilas , a widely recognized authority on greek cuisine , as the consulting chef her cookbooks are on display her full name is on the menu her first name is attached to one of nearly 20 mezethes , or appetizers diane s lightasair meatballs were not quite as light as air when i tried them , but they were considerably better than average meatballs more pliant , juicier a mix of beef and pork , they had been panseared in olive oil , and not a second too long they represented one of several surprising mezethes there was , for example , a vegetarian moussaka , made with artichoke hearts , caramelized onions and , in place of b chamel , a mix of melted cheeses there was also a roasted red pepper filled with a frapp of feta cheese , olive oil and a mix of peppers , some sweet and some hot both dishes were terrific , and both signaled pylos s determination to stand out from other greek restaurants by moving beyond lamb , whole grilled fish and stuffed grape leaves , all of which it served , none of which were its strong points pylos also musters a hipper ambience than greek restaurants usually attempt , the clay canopy playing a major role in that i was drawn here after a friend who designs theatrical sets said he considers it the prettiest restaurant he knows oversize , handsomely framed mirrors make it seem bigger than it is the contrast between exposed brick walls in the front and whitewashed walls in the back make what is essentially one long dining room feel like two entirely separate areas there s a large marble table in the back , with seats on one side , a service corridor on the other and wine bottles in the middle it functions as the bar , and lets solo diners feel fully integrated into the restaurant , not consigned to some antechamber to watch luckier peers penetrate a sanctum offlimits to them the thoughtfulness goes beyond the design diners are greeted with a bounty of warm pita triangles , with a dip that changes nightly , so repeat customers do n't get bored it might be a pur e of fava beans it might be a paste of sundried tomatoes it will probably be addictive pylos is a restaurant that comes fast and strong out of the gate and because it falters later on , not only with desserts \( often a rough patch for greek restaurants \) but also with entrees , you might consider ordering three mezethes per person and then calling it quits it would be enough , and odds are , judging from my visits , that most of it would be terrific whatever your strategy , you should not miss a starter of saut ed slices of haloumi cheese with saut ed grapes or another of fried zucchini and fried eggplant the vegetables had the lightness of expert tempura , and they were composed more delicately than you 'd expect , in ultrathin circles , layered like a cake a greek restaurant must ace grilled octopus , and pylos did , braising it before charring it , teasing from it a tenderness that octopus frequently resists it came with balsamic vinegar and capers pylos is mad for capers applied liberally to an otherwise typical greek salad , they seemed like eccentric , salty little cousins to the olives they dusted grilled dourade and grilled branzino , perking up fish that badly and sadly needed it among the entrees , which also included braised short ribs and braised lamb shank , roasted cornish hen and panseared duck , my favorites were two greek stalwarts , moussaka and pastitsio both benefited from b chamel sauces less heavy than such sauces can be , and both were pleasantly dizzy with cumin , cinnamon , nutmeg and allspice so the best strategy , upon further thought , might be two mezethes and one of these and greek yogurt with honey and walnuts , the best of the dessert selections these include ouzospiked chocolate mousse and a walnut cake as soggy as , and little more appealing than , a wet sponge pylos rewards adventurous wine drinkers with a long , allgreek wine list \( the restaurant does not serve liquor \) after a few glasses , the clay pots , more than three pounds each , become even more transfixing mr valtzoglou said he initially thought he would import pots from greece , but learned that a nonprofit group on his block taught teenagers to make pottery he contracted to get his reddishbrown pots from them they produced batches of only about 50 , no more often than once a week so the canopy grew slowly it grows still each pot is secured with heavy

washington , july 16 adm vern clark is stepping down next week as the longestserving chief of naval operations in a halfcentury , having spent five years revamping the fleet and trimming navy budgets in an unusual sacrifice to help pay the army s bills in iraq he has increased the navy s readiness , improved pay and benefits , accelerated the retirement of outdated ships , and submerged parochial navy interests as a team player on the joint chiefs of staff and what thanks does he get \? he has been pilloried by the shipbuilding industry and members of congress , and not just those representing districts with shipyards or navy ports within his own branch of the service and among retired officers , it is easy to find people who wish he had fought harder for the navy s share of the pie but he also got an unusual second term , granted by donald h rumsfeld , the most handson defense secretary in a generation even more important , he has been given much leeway in organizing , training and equipping the navy , a liberty that has been the envy of those leading the other armed services when confronted by critics who count success by the numbers and believe that only size matters , whether in ships , personnel or budgets , admiral clark says the friction proves that the system works the people that would criticize are again performing a specific role that they 've been given to play inside the system that we have , admiral clark , 60 , said in an interview looking back over his last five years a congressman that represents a district where they build ships , i expect them to speak strongly in support of their region and their shipyard and the economic imperatives that go with that and i decided that i was n't going to lose a lot of sleep about that admiral clark s tour as chief of naval operations has been bracketed by terror and war he took over in 2000 , just 11 weeks before a bombing off yemen ripped a hole in the destroyer cole and brought terrorism s threat to the navy then came the sept 11 attacks , which led into wars in afghanistan and iraq that still deeply involve his branch today in the two wars , navy aircraft flew a heavy percentage of the attack sorties , and sealaunched cruise missiles were let loose but the navy also adapted to new circumstances , especially in afghanistan , a country with no coastline navy seals continue to carry out special operations missions there , and the service s p3 orion , a propellerdriven aircraft designed to fly at low speed over the high seas searching for enemy submarines , has been just as useful in spotting insurgents crossing the scorching desert admiral clark s legacy is further complicated by orders from president bush and mr rumsfeld to transform his branch within the centralized , planned economy of the military budget he played his role on the joint chiefs of staff under newly defined rules , paying more than just lip service to the all for one , one for all concept designed to unite the four armed services into a more effective fighting force he paid by squeezing his own budget he answered the call for transforming the military into a leaner , deadlier and more agile force by trimming navy personnel so he could increase pay and benefits he made sure that only the most qualified were asked to remain by instituting a perform to serve program that winnowed reenlistments , even as the ground component barely reached its recruitment goals under his watch , activeduty personnel dropped by more than 20 , 000 people , to 362 , 488 as of friday from a high of 383 , 108 in 2002 admiral clark allowed the navy to shrink to 287 ships today from 315 in 2000 , and has even proposed retiring an aircraft carrier certainly among the crown jewels of the navy to save billions of dollars senators bill nelson , democrat of florida , and george allen , republican of virginia , are among those angered by that proposal they are trying to block the move with legislation requiring the navy to maintain at least a dozen carrier strike groups when we are at war , mr nelson said , this is not a time to reduce carriers mr allen added , now is not the time to do anything that will weaken our strategic military capability of responding quickly and decisively to project our power at the same time , however , admiral clark established a system that allows the navy to actually double the number of major warships that can be sent into battle quickly that system , the fleet response plan , compresses the lengthy maintenance cycles for carrier strike groups and redirects money to ready the fleet for war he also challenged navy culture with a seaswap experiment , leaving ships on duty longer than the traditional six months and rotating in fresh crews to operate them beyond these visible efforts , admiral clark worked on issues behind closed doors he broke the code of how to speak with mr rumsfeld , drawing on experience as commander of the atlantic fleet and director of the military s joint staff he also holds an mba , which helped him speak the bottomline language the defense secretary understands pentagon insiders say that only gen richard b myers , the chairman of the joint chiefs , and gen peter pace , the vice chairman , have a better line of communication with mr rumsfeld ask admiral clark how he did it , and he gives as an example the pucks , a packet full of flat circles and a book of classified computer rankings for every potential navy leader the system allowed him and mr rumsfeld to shift piles around a desk to plan assignments , education , training and promotions one of the reasons this has worked with rumsfeld is because of tools like this , admiral clark said in this book is the ranking of all officers in a competitive category , done on a computerbased decision software , that none of our people saw i show this to don rumsfeld , and he knows that this is n't vern pushing his cousin this is the collective wisdom and judgment of the senior leadership team of the united states navy admiral clark laughed when service on the joint chiefs of staff was compared to a realworld , highstakes version of the prisoner s dilemma , the theoretical exercise developed by economists and nuclear strategists the game lays out a situation in which members of a gang are arrested together but interrogated separately , and analyzes whether they will stick together for the benefit of all or cut private deals for their own benefit even within his own branch , admiral clark ended traditional equities that automatically divided money among submarines , surface ships and naval aircraft i told don rumsfeld in front of the chiefs that day that i was putting everything on the table that the united states navy owned , and that if we did n't need it that the taxpayers should n't have to buy it , and they should n't have to spend their money for stuff that was all about a bunch of us playing an ego game , admiral clark said i just refuse to be part of that and if anybody else decided they wanted to play like that , let them play like that , but i'm not accountable for them i'm accountable for me the question is how this emphasis on personnel and readiness will be managed by admiral clark s successors , beginning with the new chief of naval operations , adm michael g mullen , who is charged with building a navy for 2020 and beyond to that question , admiral clark holds the course he has set since 2000 where would we be today if five years ago i made shipbuilding my no1 priority \? where would we be \? admiral clark said we would n't have been ready when we got ready to go do iraq in the december meeting of '02 , dick myers turns to me and he says , 'vern , can i have four carriers \? ' admiral clark continued and one of the thrills of my life was , i said , 'yeah , dick , you can have eight if you want '

the small group of top government officials who read the president s daily brief , a summary of the most timely and critical intelligence on threats to the united states , told a presidential commission on intelligence that they find the highly classified document of little value , according to the commission s cochairmen the officials told the commission that they read the brief , known as the pdb , mainly for defensive purposes , charles s robb , a former virginia senator and governor , and laurence h silberman , a senior federal judge , said in an interview on friday they knew that was going to drive the president s schedule on a given day , and they had to be prepared for that reason , mr robb said i cannot recall any particular current or former official saying that they believed the pdb was in and of itself that valuable to them it was more of a defensive reading of the document the comments suggest that the grave shortcomings of the daily briefs before the iraq war , detailed as part of the commission s sweeping 601page indictment of the nation s intelligence agencies , have not been remedied despite efforts in recent months by the central intelligence agency to improve them asked about how the briefs have changed and whether they were still more alarmist and less nuanced than the underlying information warranted , as the commission concluded , the white house refused to comment questions about the commission s critique and how the process has changed , directed to stephen j hadley , the national security adviser , went unanswered his spokesman , frederick jones , said the white house did not want to discuss a privileged presidential document since taking over from condoleezza rice , mr hadley has said to his staff that he is disappointed in how prewar intelligence was handled and that he wants improvements but the white house s refusal to describe the changes to the daily brief left some experts inside and outside the administration wondering whether the system is different from the one the commission so roundly criticized it is a potent issue , because these days the briefs carry the latest intelligence on nuclear threats from iran and north korea , the activities of al qaeda and emerging threats elsewhere around the world the ninemember commission found that the quality of the intelligence agencies' reporting on threats suffered from the same shortage of reliable sources that plagued the reporting on iraqi weapons so the commission s finding that the pdb likely conveyed a greater sense of certainty than the data warranted is still very much a concern , mr robb and judge silberman said the quality of the brief may be particularly crucial in this administration because by the accounts of close aides and intelligence officials , president bush is extremely interested in what the spy agencies tell him he has been described by aides as asking frequent questions , sometimes calling in cia officers for direct briefings a senior intelligence official sits on the staff of the national security council to act as an intermediary , and to demand more information but none of that questioning pierced through the huge errors in the iraq intelligence , the commission concluded it said the briefs left an impression of many corroborating reports where in fact there were very few sources some administration officials say mr bush now demands to see some of the backup sourcing , but they could not say how often he hears dissenting views , and mr hadley s office would not comment on that issue mr bush receives an oral briefing each morning from 8 to 8 45 on foreign intelligence and domestic security the cia briefer is usually accompanied by the agency s director , currently porter j goss contrary to his image in some circles as a man with little appetite for detailed study , mr bush asked early in his presidency that the brief be expanded and delivered in a looseleaf notebook to include more than just the 10 to 15 pages of finished intelligence analyses on current topics the commission on the intelligence capabilities of the united states regarding weapons of mass destruction , as it is formally called , reviewed about two years of the president s daily briefs in the period before the americanled invasion of iraq in 2003 it found the reports were disastrously onesided , giving the president a daily drumbeat of sensational headlines they noted that mr goss has said that preparing , studying and delivering the daily brief takes as much as six hours a day although mr bush has said the newly appointed director of national intelligence , john d negroponte , will become his primary briefer , mr robb and judge silberman said they thought that would distract mr negroponte from his main task of overseeing the 15 intelligence agencies and coordinating their work the commission chairmen suggested that intense competition among the intelligence agencies and their divisions to get their own reports into the president s brief often skewed the document in response to the commission s searing criticism , the agencies have begun to defend themselves one former senior intelligence official said saturday that a littleknown secret of the commission s critique was that it borrowed heavily from the cia s own internal review of the iraqi weapons failure , conducted from july 2003 to may 2004 the official said that since the review was completed last year , the team of analysts and editors who compile the brief each night have tried to make changes along the lines the commission recommends headlines are less sensational and more neutral , the official said , and alternative views of other agencies are included more often but the former official said that taking a longerrange view of world developments , as the commission recommends , is not easy the daily mission eats your lunch , he said policymakers ask dozens of questions every day that have to be answered within 24 hours
san cerillo , peru the rev marco arana drove his beige pickup over the curves of a dirt road 13 , 000 feet high in the andes spread out below lay the yanacocha gold mine , an americanrun operation of mammoth open pits and towering heaps of cyanidelaced ore ahead loomed the pristine green of untouched hills then , an unmistakable sign that this land , too , may soon be devoured policemen with black masks and automatic rifles guarding workers exploring ground that the mine s owner , newmont mining corporation , has deemed the next best hope this is the roman peace the company has with the people they put in an army and say we have peace , said father arana as he surveyed the land where gold lies beneath the surface like tiny beads on a string yanacocha is newmont s prize possession , the most productive gold mine in the world but if history holds one lesson , it is that where there is gold , there is conflict , and the more gold , the more conflict newmont , which has pulled more than 19 million ounces of gold from these gently sloping peruvian hills over 7 billion worth believes that they hold several million ounces more but where newmont sees a new reserve of wealth to keep yanacocha profitable and to stay ahead of its competitors the local farmers and cattle grazers see sacred mountains , cradles of the water that sustains their highland lives the armed guards are here because of what happened in the fall of 2004 at a nearby mountain called cerro quilish for two weeks , fearing that the company s plans to expand yanacocha would mean quilish s desecration and destruction , thousands of local people laid siege to the mine women and children were arrested , tear gas was thrown , the wounded hospitalized after clashes with the police in the end , the world s no 1 goldmining company backed down father arana , who runs a local group formed to challenge the mine , helped negotiate the terms of surrender newmont withdrew its drilling equipment from quilish and the promised reserves from its books now , in large part because of the loss of quilish , the company says production at yanacocha may fall 35 percent or more in two years the forced retreat , a culmination of years of distrust between the peasants and the mine , was a chastening blow for an industry in the midst of a boom it underscored the environmental and social costs of the technologies needed to extract the evermorevaluable ore from modern mines and it showed how a rising global backlash against those costs was forcing mining companies to negotiate what has come to be known as social license if that boom was to go on but the history of yanacocha , pieced together in a sixmonth examination by the new york times and the pbs television program frontlineworld , is also an excursion into the moral ambiguities that often attend when a firstworld company does business in a thirdworld land gold miners say they have no choice but to go where the ore is they cannot choose the governments they deal with yanacocha shows how one company maneuvered in a country , peru , dominated by a secret web of power under a corrupt autocracy newmont gained undisputed control of yanacocha in 2000 after years of backroom legal wrangling behind the scenes , newmont and its adversaries a french company and its australian ally reached into the upper levels of the american , french and peruvian governments , employing a cast of former and active intelligence officials , including peru s ruthless secret police chief , vladimiro montesinos much of that armtwisting has been dragged into the light , in secret recordings by the spy chief the tapes , apparently intended to blackmail and manipulate peru s powerbrokers , surfaced in 2000 and led to the downfall of mr montesinos and the president he served , alberto k fujimori the tapes captured everything from plotting to fix elections to shopping bags of money being unloaded for payoffs in mr montesinos s office at the peruvian national intelligence agency they captured newmont s maneuverings , too in one audio recording , the no 3 newmont executive at the time , lawrence t kurlander , is heard offering to do a favor for mr montesinos now you have a friend for life , mr kurlander tells the spy chief you have a friend for life also , mr montesinos replies last year , a justice department investigation into whether newmont s victory resulted from bribing foreign officials was dropped after the peruvian government failed to cooperate fully and the statute of limitations expired , according to law enforcement officials familiar with the case the peruvian government investigated the yanacocha affair without bringing charges mr kurlander has agreed to speak out publicly about his meeting for the first time he says he regrets seeking out mr montesinos , now in jail charged with everything from corruption to gun running and drug trafficking but mr kurlander and newmont are adamant that no bribes were paid , nothing illicit done , at least not by them or their allies everybody involved on the american side , in the american government , that went to see him or spoke to him , asked for a level playing field , said mr kurlander , who retired in 2002 not a single person asked for him to influence the outcome of the case newmont s senior executives declined repeated requests for interviews for this article , though they did allow times reporters to make an extensive visit to the yanacocha mine but in a written statement , newmont said of its legal battle for the mine , we are satisfied that the company complied in all respects with applicable laws whatever the past environmental problems , newmont says yanacocha now meets all peruvian and international standards and the company says it is committed to gaining and maintaining the approval of the community still , to many of the local people , the continuing struggle for yanacocha evokes a tale of treachery nearly any peruvian school child can recite in 1532 , the spanish conquistador francisco pizarro captured the last inca emperor , atahualpa , in cajamarca , the provincial capital 28 miles from yanacocha the young inca , a god to his people , was held for months while he scrambled to amass a ransom enough gold to fill a room as high as his arm could reach he turned over his gold , expecting to be freed but pizarro killed him anyway living on water at first , people here saw possibility in the mine yanacocha black lake in the indigenous quechua tongue sits in one of the poorest agricultural regions of peru when yanacocha began its operations , we would only hear about how everyone was happy , father arana said the mine was going to bring jobs , improve roads no one thought much , he said , about the inevitable collisions the collisions began almost immediately in the andean peasants' universe , water is the heart of the land the people depend on it for their animals , for drinking , for bathing community life is organized around it but the mine lives on water , too the bits of gold here , so small they are called invisible gold , can be mined profitably only by blasting mountains , then culling the gold with vast quantities of cyanide diluted with similarly vast quantities of water it was not long before the peasants began to complain streams and canals were drying up , they said they were filled with murky sediment the water smelled foul but on the ledger books , yanacocha was a fast success the mine had started with 13 million ounces of reserves in the ground within a year , it claimed over 3 million it was the biggest foreign investment in peru everywhere we drilled and looked , there was gold , said len harris , yanacocha s first general manager dueling companies celebration soon gave way to strife a year before , a partnership had been formed to develop the mine newmont a peruvian partner , buenaventura and a french governmentowned company , bureau de recherches g ologiques et mini res \( brgm \) no partner had a controlling interest the world bank s investment arm , the international finance corporation , later took a 5 percent stake , hoping to promote development in a country plagued by economic chaos and roiled by a maoist insurgent group , shining path with the mine expanding and the guerrilla leader captured , brgm announced plans to sell a large part of its increasingly valuable stake to an australiabased company , normandy poseidon newmont , considering the involvement of another major mining company unacceptable , sued , arguing that the partnership agreement gave it and buenaventura first right of refusal on any sale twice , peruvian courts agreed then , in september of 1997 , the peruvian supreme court issued a startling ruling , agreeing to review a case newmont thought it had definitively won stunned and suspicious , the company called in mr kurlander mr kurlander , then 56 , had spent most of his life in government , as a prosecutor and as chief criminaljustice adviser to gov mario m cuomo in new york he later moved to corporate work and was recruited by newmont in 1994 he had no experience in mining , but in an industry known for its rough edges , he became a top newmont executive , valued for his political contacts and easy ability to walk between the halls of government and the corporate suite on his arrival in peru , mr kurlander says , he was told by newmont s lawyers and security chief that the french were behaving inappropriately in the litigation the mere fact that they were doing this , he said in an interview , was unseemly at best and corrupt at worst newmont , he said , was at a distinct disadvantage the foreign corrupt practices act forbids american companies to pay anything of value to a foreign official in exchange for a result by contrast , in 1997 , most european countries , france included , did not prohibit paying bribes the french ambassador to peru at the time , antoine blanca , said in an interview that no one connected to the embassy had ever offered bribes or otherwise acted improperly still , what emerges from documents and interviews with participants is a picture of three years of increasing pressure and intimated threats by normandy and the government of france in the peruvian press , the french ambassador insinuated corruption of the judiciary french government emissaries suggested to peruvian officials that there would be consequences if newmont was awarded the disputed shares normandy recruited patrick maugein , a wellconnected french businessman by phone , fax and letter , mr maugein placed newmont and buenaventura on notice that the dispute had become a matter of state the french , he warned , had every intention of fighting it to the bitter end mr maugein had ties to the french president , jacques chirac , and soon mr chirac wrote to president fujimori , urging a supreme court review and his personal intervention mr maugein declined to be interviewed for this article , but in a letter wrote that any allegations of illicit activity come from people who have been paid to make them from lima , in the days after the supreme court agreed to take the case , mr kurlander headed to washington to enlist help on the american side by the end of october 1997 , stuart e eizenstat , under secretary of state for economic affairs , wrote peru s prime minister to press for a fair and impartial hearing , according to documents released under the freedom of information act a politically tainted decision would adversely affect us investment in peru , he wrote on jan 5 , 1998 , peru s supreme court came back with a preliminary decision 3 to 2 for the french , one vote shy of victory as the peruvians prepared to assign two more judges to the case , mr kurlander says , he and buenaventura s chief , alberto benavides , appealed to mr fujimori soon after , mr kurlander said , the president s office sent word about the man to see spy chief s favor bank vladimiro montesinos s titles never matched his stature officially , he was counselor to mr fujimori and de facto head of the national intelligence service in reality , he was the secondmostpowerful man in peru rasputin , darth vadar , torquemada and cardinal richelieu rolled into one , according to an american army intelligence report the national intelligence service was also on the payroll of the cia , which gave mr montesinos a million dollars a year for his supposed help in combating the narcotics trade , according to former cia officials who approved the payments this was the man mr kurlander headed to see alone on feb 26 , 1998 while he says he knew that mr montesinos was an extremely bad man , he maintains that the extent of the government s corruption and human rights abuses were not well known at the time there was , however , one case he was aware of not long before , the fujimori government had seized the television station of a peruvianisraeli businessman , baruch ivcher , after it began broadcasting reports tying the intelligence chief to drug trafficking and corruption mr kurlander knew that publicity about the case was threatening to become a headache for peru s government as the secret tape rolls , mr montesinos says he is aware of mr kurlander s problems and is very glad to do whatever i can for you mr kurlander describes his own links to the intelligence community and how he has enlisted friends two former cia officials to assist him , because the french side has been acting quite strangely their conversation is interpreted by grace riggs , a lawyer and former lover of the spy chief who had a child with him soon mr kurlander raises the ivcher case mr montesinos assures him that the pursuit of mr ivcher is not an antisemitic persecution , and mr kurlander offers to help by lobbying his fellow jews in the united states and abroad tell him i going to help him with the voting , mr montesinos directs his translator he is well aware of the tricky practices of the french government , he says , making a joke about the french connection the reference , in english , gets the men laughing soon spy chief and executive are pledging friendship for life the spy chief then proceeds to discuss with another man , who has never been identified , the lawyers and judges who may need to be influenced the conversation is in spanish , which ms riggs does not translate finally , she tells mr kurlander that because he helps mr montesinos without expecting anything in return , the spy chef wants to do the same thing for you i appreciate that , mr kurlander replies amor con amor se paga , mr montesinos exclaims love is repaid with love washington is heard from still , mr kurlander says , he had doubts in the following weeks , nothing happened , he said i was very worried that we were lost in fact , the channel between mr montesinos and the americans was open and bustling peter romero , then assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs , acknowledged in an interview that he had twice called mr montesinos to show that the case was being monitored in washington he seemed to be a nice enough fellow , he recalled the compelling reason to get involved , he said , came from peruvian and american embassy officials who confirmed the direct involvement of president chirac and others at the top of the french government we wanted to ensure that that was neutralized , mr romero said two and a half years later , mr romero left government and was hired by mr kurlander as a consultant on peru for newmont , where he remained for 18 months on april 14 , six weeks after the montesinoskurlander meeting , the video cameras were rolling for a visit from the cia station chief , don arabian as the meeting nears its end , mr montesinos says he has been collecting information on the french attempt to influence the case and will not let them use extortion , blackmail and other gangster methods i'm not working with the telephones , but we will if necessary , mr montesinos says , an apparent reference to wiretapping we 'll sort out the technical support the men laugh mr arabian , who recently retired , declined a request for an interview on may 8 , the sixth supreme court justice voted in favor of newmont and buenaventura with the vote deadlocked , 33 , the court administrator appointed a final judge , jaime beltr n quiroga he was summoned the next day by mr montesinos a videotape shows the justice settled on the couch as mr montesinos talks about how , as a lawyer he , too , would normally keep a distance from events but in these cases , he says , one has to intervene directly mr montesinos avoids direct pressure as if we are imposing on you but reminds the judge that the case is a matter of national interest the united states is a key guarantor of coming deliberations over peru s border conflict with ecuador there is no discussion of payoffs , but the spy chief does question the judge about his professional ambitions the men reminisce well , doctor , you have a friend here , judge beltr n says my dear , jaime , then , a pleasure to see you , brother , mr montesinos replies , assuring his guest that he will soon be transferred to peru s constitutional court judge beltr n s vote was announced two weeks later newmont and buenaventura were awarded brgm s share at the purchase price set in 1993 1097 million when the final transfer was negotiated a year later , the stake was valued at more than five times that today mr kurlander says that whatever his reservations at the time about meeting mr montesinos , he went ahead because nearly everyone told him , if the french were to be stopped , he was the only one in peru who would dare to do it the transcript is terribly unfair , mr kurlander says , and leaves out a number of his statements that all he wanted was a level playing field mr kurlander s name has been attached to the meeting and his reputation harmed , he says , though he insists the meeting was no secret he says his newmont superiors and his partners in the benavides family were thoroughly briefed it was my government who recommended strongly that we speak with him , mr kurlander said at his home outside denver tell me what my option is at that point do i lay down and just fold , fold up and go home \? or do i fight for what i think is right and fair and just \? in an interview at his lima offices , mr benavides , now buenaventura s chief executive , insisted , we did n't know what mr kurlander was doing , and added that he did not learn about the montesinos meeting until the tape was made public several years later the mercury spill at yanacocha , year after year , the mine s geologists had kept striking gold and with every ton of earth sifted , it became ever clearer that the mine had not just ripped up the landscape it had remade the social architecture , too there were growing class divisions , between the many campesinos who had received wellpaying jobs yanacocha would eventually employ as many as 2 , 200 people , twothirds locals , full time , and up to 6 , 000 on shorterterm contracts and the tens of thousands more who had not people migrating to the region in pursuit of work brought overcrowding and rising crime in june 2000 , a truck contracted to carry canisters of mercury , a byproduct of mining , spilled 330 pounds of the poisonous metal over 25 miles of road around choropampa , 53 miles from the mine the villagers believed that the mercury was mixed with gold they scooped it up some took it home to cook on their stoves a world bank report later said the mine delayed reporting the accident to the national authorities and initially played down its seriousness to the bank in the end , the peruvian government fined the mine 500 , 000 the company says it has paid 18 million more a classaction suit has been filed against newmont in denver , charging that more than 1 , 000 people were harmed , some for life the extent of that damage has been in dispute from the start even so , the spill left deep psychic scars it became common mythology that mercury had killed newborn babies and caused cancer and other diseases , dante vera , a former peruvian interior ministry official hired in 2004 as an adviser to newmont , wrote in a report to company executives at newmont , it was becoming increasingly clear that the social turmoil was a business problem the spill , mr kurlander said in a speech a year later , served as a wakeup call for us soon , he was headed back to peru , to lead an environmental audit of the mine newmont kept the audit s results within the company , never acknowledging them publicly either to its shareholders or to the local people mr kurlander found a high level of mistrust of the mine but the 44 findings of mr kurlander s audit , which was given to the times , also confirmed many of the villagers' specific complaints that fish were disappearing and that lakes , streams and canals were being contaminated , at least one with cyanide one stream , quebrada honda , had 13 fish per kilometer in 1997 , but none by 2000 , the audit said thousand of tons of rock not processed for gold recovery were generating dangerous acidic runoffs in a letter after the audit , mr kurlander says that as the mine expanded , we eliminated many environmental safeguards that were in the construction and environmental management plans in all , he wrote to newmont s new chief executive , wayne murdy , the findings were so serious that they could jeopardize the mine s continued operation and leave senior executives subject to criminal prosecution and imprisonment mr kurlander s tough words came on the heels of another memo to mr murdy about the spill on jan 18 , 2001 , mr kurlander recommended that all the top executives , including himself and his boss , take cuts in their bonuses , of 50 to 100 percent , and that the punishment be made public mr kurlander singled out the company s environmental team , saying that despite public pledges , newmont had failed to adhere to american environmental standards to his disappointment , mr kurlander said , some bonuses were indeed reduced , but without public notice and much more modestly than he had recommended in a letter to mr kurlander three years later , mr murdy said the company had learned from the accident and the audit newmont , he said , spent 100 million to fix the environmental problems , including 50 million for a watertreatment plant and 20 million on two dams to prevent sediment from clogging streams and canals mercury is now shipped inside triplesealed , stainlesssteel containers and escorted by a convoy of cars to mr kurlander , the spill showed the folly of a company ignoring the people , particularly the people most set against the mine in a memo , he warned that with the mine sunk so low in the peasants' esteem , newmont would never be able to mine quilish we have come to this because we have been in denial , he wrote we have not heeded the voices of those most intimate with our mine those who live and work nearby it was less than a year after the audit that he retired the peasants protest the protests began not long after people began seeing the drilling machines up on the coneshaped hill above cajamarca quilish had long been on newmont s drawing boards last year , newmont mined three million ounces at yanacocha , its most profitable single source of gold but the more it pulls from the ground , the more it must replace to remain no 1 back in 2000 , the local government had passed an ordinance declaring quilish and its watershed a protected natural reserve but newmont had persuaded a peruvian court that it had the right to mine because it had acquired the concession years before in august 2004 , the machines moved in to many people , that was the final betrayal , said mr vera , the former newmont consultant he quit this summer , saying his advice had been ignored on sept 2 , deploying boulders , vehicles , anything they could find , hundreds of campesinos blockaded the narrow mountain road that runs from cajamarca to the mine several hundred armed officers , including 150 special operations police officers from lima , were sent in to guard the mine the first day was the most violent protesters were arrested , many of them women and old people , according to father arana s colleague , jorge camacho at times during the siege , the police used tear gas one man was shot in the leg the company kept the gold coming out of yanacocha , but only by helicoptering the workers in on sept 15 , there was a regionwide strike , with street demonstrations in cajamarca the message , on one of the blizzard of placards in town , was listen yanacocha cajamarca is to be respected the protests were organized by the peasants themselves , mr camacho and others say but the 43yearold father arana , son of teachers from cajamarca , had been nurturing the movement for many years , even before he founded his group , grufides , in the late 1990 s \( these days , it receives financial assistance from oxfam \) the campesinos call him father marco , and he is a devoted adherent of liberation theology and its doctrine of social activism for the poor he is not the easiest of men last spring , he met newmont s chief , mr murdy , on the sidelines of the company s annual general meeting in denver as the priest recalls it , mr murdy tried to be conciliatory , saying he lived by his mother s motto we are given one mouth but two ears to listen with father marco says he rebuffed the overture , replying , in the bible , there is a saying about some people have eyes that do n't see and ears that do n't hear as the siege ran on at yanacocha , the priest became a key negotiator between newmont , the peasants and the ministry of mines it was not long after the demonstrations in cajamarca that the company surrendered the machines came down from quilish at newmont s request , the ministry withdrew its permit , too what remains up on the mountain is a symbolic wall of mud and straw that the campesinos built to keep the miners at bay more gold needed standing down at quilish , with its 38 million ounces of reserves , has only intensified the need for new reserves the pressure feels like you 're laying track and knowing there s a locomotive right behind you , said the mine s exploration manager , lewis teal so newmont is looking elsewhere , in the highlands near san cerillo , where the jadegreen lagoons and peaty grasses act as a store of water for the peasants below many people there worry about the effects of a new mine which is why , after quilish , newmont is paying for the peruvian police units protecting the drilling team , said the mine s manager , brant hinze even so , mr hinze said , leaving quilish was the right thing to do the thing that the company did both newmont and buenaventura is listen to the communities , and they said this is something we want you to stay away from , he said newmont s peruvian partner , mr benavides , argued that exploration of quilish had not been abandoned , simply suspended we have the concession , and we have the land , he said he added i do not understand what social license means i expect a license from the authorities , from the minister of mines i expect a license from the regional government i do n't expect a license from the whole community still , the idea of social license is at the heart of the agreement that ended the siege if newmont hopes ever to mine quilish , it first must win the community s consent so to promote yanacocha s wellbeing and expansion , mr hinze has become the kind of mine manager he never imagined being he says he had asked for the job running yanacocha because of its sheer scale it s big , it s profitable , is how he puts it fifty years old , silverhaired and steely eyed , 6 foot 3 and 255 pounds , he is a man of scale himself his idea of recreation , he says , is riding his harley or swimming with hammerhead sharks now , he says , he spends 70 to 80 percent of his working time on social issues on a recent day , he ate roasted guinea pig at a lunch with a peasant group a few days later , he attended a ceremony celebrating a gift of 500 , 000 for a new road around san cerillo modern mining can coexist with cattle , agriculture and tourism , he told one gathering today we begin a new history for communities around here newmont says that it paid 180 million in taxes to peru s government last year , and that under a new law , half was returned to the cajamarca region but to its frustration , the company says , the local government has largely been unable to use the money to benefit the people and most of the people here remain achingly poor so the company , albeit ambivalently , has become something of a surrogate government it is contributing money for schools and clinics and building some small water treatment plants in the villages in all , the company says it will spend nearly 20 million this year on social programs water remains a divisive issue father arana and his allies argue that a new , everythreeweeks testing protocol is insufficiently independent the peasants continue to complain but company and local officials say there have been no environmental accidents at yanacocha in more than two years , and the mine says it manages its water to ensure there is enough for the community but the biggest issue is the one looming over every modern industrial gold mine what happens when the ore that lured the miners here is gone \? over 13 years , newmont has moved mountains for gold 30 tons of rock and earth for every ounce by the time it is through , the company will have dug up a billion tons of earth much of it will be laced with acids and heavy metals three years ago , after newmont acknowledged that 36 , 700 fish were missing from a river contaminated by the mine , the world bank hired an american geochemist , ann maest , to study the streams and canals flowing from the mine in the short term , she concluded , the water was safe for human use but long term , she said in an interview , the company s own tests show that all the components are in place for the huge piles of rock to leak acids that will pollute surface and groundwater the only preventive , she said , would be perpetual treatment mr hinze , who was recently appointed head of newmont s north american operations , insists that the company s plan for closing the mine will take care of longterm treatment and cleanup we plan on being here a very long time , he said newmont has yet to put aside money for longterm treatment , though it says it will comply with a peruvian government requirement due to take effect in 2007 but to pay for cleanups , the company needs to keep profits high to keep profits high , it needs to keep finding and mining more gold yet increasingly , the unmovable reality is that to keep mining more gold , it has to make peace with the people who will be here long after the miners leave mr hinze and newmont insist that that can in fact , must be done , even if some people may never be won over there will always be a level of mistrust , he said unfortunately , we ca n't please everyone mr vera , the former newmont consultant , is not so confident he says he sometimes thinks that the clash between the mine and the peasants is so fundamental as to be beyond even the best intentions mining negatively affects the andean cosmic vision of the unity of nature , he said the conflict cannot be settled with money mining generates resentments that are difficult to heal
when a firefighter dies , the men at his firehouse men with whom he has spent hundreds , even thousands of hours are almost invariably able to mutter only a stunned generality he was a great guy firefighters are ready for just about anything at a moment s notice , but never that , talking to a stranger at the door three firefighters became great guys yesterday and if the words spoken about them had an air of familiarity , it was because they had been said often before one was a lieutenant and father from malverne , ny , who worked two jobs so that his wife could raise their children another , a father of four young children including one named for the jersey shore town where he had met his wife had just passed the lieutenant s exam the third was a strapping man and a proud uncle who took his sister s children to his firehouse to meet santa claus they died yesterday from above , jumping from a burning building in the bronx , and below , perishing in a smoky basement in brooklyn as the deadliest day in the fire department since sept 11 finally darkened with nightfall , firefighters streamed into engine company 290 and ladder 103 in brooklyn , where firefighter richard t sclafani , 37 , had served when lt paul brown spoke of firefighter sclafani , he could have been speaking of all three of the men he was a good fireman , he said very knowledgeable he had a lot of special skills that he was able to teach the other guys he paused , and apologized i'm a little numb right now the same numbness had spread to a firehouse in the bronx , and to the quiet streets where the firefighters' relatives lived lt curtis w meyran , 46 , of battalion 26 , was the sole officer killed , and the oldest he joked that he felt like a dinosaur when he was promoted that and the 15 years he had spent on the job he met his wife , jeanette , at the gas station where he worked in 1981 they began dating , and married in september 1986 he bought the house on morris avenue in malverne , on long island , across the street from the one where he had grown up they had three children , dennis , 16 , angela , 10 , and danine , 6 in 1997 , firefighter meyran helped in the rescue of two little girls trapped in a burning basement in crown heights , brooklyn he recalled later , i heard a little wheezing and moaning maybe , you could n't see your hand in front of your face he found one child and took her outside years later , studying for the lieutenant s exam turned into something of a family affair lieutenant meyran had always worked a second job landscaping , construction , and carpentry so that his wife could stay home he did not have much time to read the books , so mrs meyran read them into a tape recorder , she said , livening up the dry manuals with long sections on every little procedure with little jokes she put notes in with his lunch , she said , like what s a 'rear egress \? ' it s a way out a safe exit there was none yesterday he jumped from a fourthfloor window , trapped above what witnesses said was an explosion of flame lieutenant meyran had not even been on the schedule this weekend , but he went in for an overtime tour he could n't sit still if his life depended on it he was like a rabbit , ricocheting all over the place , mrs meyran said yesterday his brother , glenn meyran , lives across the street , in the home where they grew up he called his brother the consummate father , adding , if he was saving people when he died , that s about as good as you can do the firefighter who died with him , john g bellew , 37 , of ladder 27 , had other plans when he graduated from manhattan college , his brother said he tried the business world , said the brother , danny bellew , himself a firefighter , along with a few cousins eventually , john bellew came around and joined the department 10 years ago he had worked with ladder 10 and engine company 23 he was a lifeguard when he was young , in the rockaways , and loved the beach he met his wife , eileen , on the jersey shore , in the town of brielle she was from pearl river , ny they married and put up a sign in the front yard of their home there the bellews , est 1995 he and his wife liked the little town where they had met so much , they gave their first daughter its name brielle , 6 , was the oldest of four children , followed by jack , 3 , katreana , 2 , and kieran , 5 months their father coached brielle s soccer team his brother struggled for words , and said , just say this he loved his family he 'll miss them as much as they 'll miss him across the street , a neighbor lowered her flag to halfstaff firefighter bellew had recently passed the lieutenant s exam , a friend said firefighter sclafani , of ladder 103 , lived alone in bayside , queens his mother , joan sclafani , and sister jo ann s family live on staten island , and he drove there often to visit his nephews , ages 4 and 2 but he never met his niece , born three weeks ago he brought the kids to his firehouse for christmas , said his brotherinlaw , joseph asch , 34 all my kids went , met santa claus he liked ladder 103 because it has long been considered a hot spot he recently got a puppy , named it mugsy and took it to work with him his passion was weightlifting he was in extremely great physical condition , said wally merecka , a firefighter who joined the department with firefighter sclafani in 1995 firefighter merecka s eyes were red , and he , like the lieutenant before him , struggled for words on a cold night he was very strong he was a good man , he said he shot straight from the hip the fire department said they were the 1 , 129th , 1 , 130th and 1 , 131st firefighters to die in line of duty
for months , the six episcopal priests in connecticut rebelling against their bishop s support for gay clergy members have presented themselves as defenders of the faith , loyal episcopalians who were facing suspension from their pulpits because they stood up for their beliefs but as the bishop of connecticut , andrew d smith , prepared to suspend the priests , he described them as local troops in a nationwide strategy by conservative episcopalians to secede and then establish a replacement church that would take the place of the episcopal church usa in the world anglican communion in an interview at his office in hartford on tuesday , the day after a meeting with the priests that seemed only to deepen the impasse , bishop smith said that the priests never had any intention of returning to the fold instead , he said , they were bent on kind of a 'please , go ahead and shoot me ' approach that would make him a villain and win them public support bishop smith said the priests were following a strategy laid out in a memo written in december 2003 by a member of the american anglican council , a group of orthodox episcopal parishes that includes those led by the six priests the memo laid out steps that priests can take to distance and then eventually sever themselves from the parent church the memo said the strategy would generate significant public attention and added that the church authorities , knowing well how conservatives could quickly become the 'victims' in the public mind , would be reluctant to discipline priests if you read that memo and then look at what happened there , there are a lot of similarities , bishop smith said one of the six priests , the rev christopher leighton of st paul s church in darien , called bishop smith s comments absurd all i can say is that that s not the playbook , father leighton said the decadesold rift within the episcopal church usa between conservatives and liberals widened dramatically in 2003 when the church consecrated a gay bishop , v gene robinson of new hampshire the vote was also condemned by the global anglican communion , which accused the american church of threatening the unity of the world church to pacify conservative parishes in dioceses where the local bishop supported bishop robinson , the american church offered to provide alternative bishops for those parishes the six churches in connecticut rejected bishop smith s plan for an alternative bishop as inadequate and stopped paying their diocesan dues last month , the diocese notified the six priests that they had abandoned the communion of the church and faced possible suspension and defrocking on monday , bishop smith and the six priests met in what the bishop called a final attempt to head off their suspension , but both sides called the meeting a disaster bishop smith said on tuesday that he most probably will have to move toward suspending the priests , but would not say when he has summoned the state s episcopal clergy to a meeting today in hartford to discuss the six priests his spokeswoman , karin hamilton , said that she did not expect the bishop to move against the priests today the strategy memo , written by a pennsylvania rector , the rev geoffrey chapman , on behalf of the american anglican council , was first made public in an article in the washington post in january 2004 the memo , which states as the council s goal a replacement' jurisdiction that is closely aligned with the majority of world anglicanism , recommends that churches first publicly announce that their relationship with their diocesan bishop is severely damaged ' it calls the church s offer of a temporary replacement bishop unacceptable the memo also recommends withholding diocesan dues and using the money for other works the six connecticut churches owed about 220 , 000 to the diocese for 2004 , but have remitted less than 8 , 000 , the diocese said in the next stage of the plan , the memo said , clusters of parishes should try to negotiate settlements to leave the episcopal church but keep their property father chapman said yesterday that he had overstated several portions of the strategy pretty decisively in the memo and that , in any case , none of the six connecticut priests affirmed it as a strategy , though he said they probably read it because it was so widely publicized father leighton said yesterday that bishop smith and the american church had abandoned communion by disregarding the biblical injunction against homosexuality nonetheless , he said he hoped to remain in the episcopal church
nearly nine years ago , bill parcells boarded a plane for new orleans carrying a reputation as perhaps the finest coach in the national football league he was taking the patriots to the super bowl in his fourth season in new england , after having won two titles with the giants but the week in new orleans did n't go very well parcells spent much of it ducking questions about whether he was about to quit and take over the jets new england s kickoff coverage usually a strength of a parcells team broke down , letting the packers' desmond howard run wild , and green bay won , 3521 parcells did not fly home with his team and never coached another game for the patriots he has not been back to the super bowl either as he comes home to giants stadium today with the dallas cowboys under his charge , it seems fair to ask a question that would have sounded silly during much of the last 20 years is bill parcells really a great coach \? he has shown that he can quickly turn a bad team into a playoff team , having done so with the cowboys just as he did with the giants , the patriots and the jets but he has yet to prove that he can put together a championship team , or even a nearchampionship team , without his old defensive assistant , bill belichick since leaving the giants in 1990 , parcells has failed even to make the playoffs in two consecutive seasons , with belichick or without him during the 12 years that they worked together with the giants , the patriots and the jets their teams went 117731 , winning 11 playoff games and 2 super bowls their third super bowl together , the loss to the packers , came during the only one of parcells s four seasons in new england with belichick at his side in his six seasons without belichick in new england and dallas parcells has lost more games than he has won his belichickless record , 4447 , is worse than dave wannstedt s career record or wayne fontes s or jim haslett s without his old understudy , parcells has won as many playoff games as bruce coslett or butch davis none belichick , of course , has done better since the two parted ways as the patriots' coach , he has won three of the last four super bowls and appears headed for the playoffs although probably for a short stay again this season when they were partners , belichick played the role of boygenius tactician to parcells s visionary commander in chief parcells ran the team , held more sway over personnel moves , spoke to reporters and ultimately took responsibility for the results belichick drew the x s and o s on one side of the ball in his first stint as a head coach , with cleveland from 199195 , belichick often seemed lost without parcells s leadership belichick made himself a villain for cutting the hometown favorite bernie kosar in humiliating fashion the browns finished below 500 in four of belichick s five seasons , and he looked at times like a man who did his best work in the shadows when he returned to parcells s staff on the jets , the old boss did n't let him forget it during one game , parcells disagreed with belichick s decision to blitz , as david halberstam recounts in his new book about belichick , the education of a coach but the play worked yeah , you 're a genius , everyone knows it , parcells said over a headset microphone that could be heard by other coaches , according to the book , but that s why you failed as a head coach that s why you 'll never be a head coach some genius given parcells s intelligence and his flair for language , it hardly seemed like an accidental outburst parcells has a very good use of words , halberstam said last week he has a great caustic tongue , and he knows it the two coaches ultimately had a public breakup belichick quit as the jets' coach after a day on the job scribbling a resignation note that abbreviated the job as hc of nyj rather than continuing to work under parcells , who was becoming a team executive for halberstam s book , which has the feel of an authorized biography , he interviewed everyone from belichick s high school teachers to espn football analysts he did not talk to parcells but even if belichick is not fond of his mentor , he seems to have learned from their collaboration his years as the public face of the patriots bear little resemblance to his cleveland tenure parcells , on the other hand , still seems to be struggling to find the strategic edge that his teams once had his former assistants from the giants and new england are largely absent from the dallas coaching staff some , like romeo crennel \( now the browns' coach \) and charlie weis \( notre dame s coach \) , played key roles in new england s recent championships parcells is a sure bet to make the hall of fame , and his shortterm turnaround skills are beyond question his record would probably be better if he had not taken on so many reclamation projects but he is 64 years old , and the cowboys are potentially the last team he will lead the most interesting part of their stretch run this season may be the chance it gives their coach to emerge from belichick s shadow , as odd a notion as that once would have been keeping score email keepingscore nytimescom
one of the bothersome aspects of digital video , particularly when used in fiction films , is its encouragement of a v rit shooting style that some filmmakers believe makes their fictions more real too often , though , this results in messy , undisciplined shots from weird angles and scenes that wobble as if captured from atop a mound of jello and just because you have the ability to shoot a scene from behind your protagonist s left earlobe as happens in piggie does n't mean that s the best way to make your narrative resonate the film s title is the nickname of fannie pogue \( savannah haske \) , a simpleminded teenager who lives on a farm in upstate new york with her father , jim \( robert john burke \) fannie keeps baby mice in her closet and has a pet pig named jingle when not in special ed classes and , the film suggests , sleeping with her teachers she babysits a senile old woman by walking her along the highway as one might a dog on a leash fannie aspires to be a country singer \( sample lyric i'm nice , i 'll delouse your head of lice \) , but is distracted by the arrival of nile \( the musician dean wareham , in his first acting role \) , a smalltime crook and recovering heroin addict despite nile s vigorous rejections , which include telling her that she stinks , fannie is soon more difficult to dislodge than a tick on a vein piggie is the first film directed by alison bagnall and written by ms bagnall and ms haske , a female comingofage as monotonous as fannie s songwriting there is not a moment when we are unaware of the camera , as are the actors , half of whom have little or no film experience , and none of whom are completely at ease even the estimable john c reilly \( who is also married to the film s producer , alison dickey \) , appears for five minutes as a vaguely defined criminal and seems to be checking his dialogue off a todo list the most committed performer is ms haske \( whom audiences may recall as the illfated tatiana in nbc s third watch \) , who is completely believable as a backwoods naif with its exasperating camerawork , murky lighting at least two scenes are near indecipherable and interminable shots of fannie gazing slackjawed at the world , piggie is a disappointing debut according to the film s production notes , ms bagnall wanted her film to be funny in an excruciating way she was only 50 percent successful piggie opens today in manhattan directed by alison bagnall written by savannah haske and mr bagnall director of photography , rufus standefer edited by cushla dillon music by dusty trails production designer , jennifer lea timmer produced by alison dickey released by this little piggie llc at the two boots pioneer theater , 155 east third street , east village running time 90 minutes this film is not rated with savannah haske \( fannie \) , robert john burke \( jim \) , dean wareham \( nile \) , john c reilly \( russell \) and marylouise burke \( ellie \)
the first task yesterday for lynne f stewart , after she returned to her office a few blocks from the manhattan courthouse where she was convicted of aiding islamic terrorism , was to figure out how to stop practicing law hoping for an acquittal until the last moments of her sevenmonth trial , ms stewart , a defense lawyer , began only yesterday to make calls to the new york state bar association to find out the steps by which she would be disbarred , a penalty she must pay after being convicted of a felony on thursday , she was found guilty by a federal jury on all five counts of aiding terrorism and lying to the government for carrying messages out of prison from a terrorist client , sheik omar abdel rahman the verdict felt like being in a massive car accident , ms stewart said in an interview yesterday , her voice still unsteady it s instantaneous and it hits you so hard you 're dazed for a while she sat surrounded by boxes and stacks of pictures in an office she has barely occupied since a nervous landlord evicted her from her longtime broadway work space in june ms stewart said she hoped to give most , if not all , of the halfdozen cases she was still working on to her son , geoffrey s stewart , who shares her criminal defense practice she will fill the time she would have spent practicing law helping to prepare a complex federal appeal her own besides the appeal , ms stewart and her chief lawyer , michael e tigar , plan to file posttrial motions by march 4 seeking to persuade judge john g koeltl to overturn the jury s verdict , arguing that the jurors misinterpreted the terror conspiracy laws it is a long shot , ms stewart admits they will also try to persuade the judge to be lenient when he sets her sentence on july 15 in a move that surprised her legal team , prosecutors working for united states attorney david n kelley allowed ms stewart to remain free on bail pending appeal ms stewart , who is 65 , faces up to 30 years in jail ms stewart said that even after the unexpectedly sweeping conviction , she had no second thoughts about her decision to give to the news media a statement by mr abdel rahman , a blind islamic cleric , even though special prison rules barred her from doing so the decision i made to go ahead was the right one , she said but ms stewart said she did regret underestimating how prosecutors would react to her provocative tactics i should have understood better , she said , that if they did come after me it would not be just to cut me off from visiting mr abdel rahman and she regrets some of her cocky talk , which the jurors heard on secret government recordings of telephone calls and of her meetings in a federal prison in minnesota with the sheik on one recording , she called a prosecutor in charge of enforcing the prison rules , patrick j fitzgerald , a crusader and said he was evil some of my loose talk , brash talk , i'm sure did not endear me to the jury , ms stewart said she said she was disappointed that the two or three jurors who , based on notes from the jury room , appeared to be leaning toward acquitting her did not stick to their position she attributed the jury s harsh judgment to the fear that she said has permeated the country since the sept 11 attacks an early decision by judge koeltl to allow prosecutors to show videotapes of osama bin laden in the courtroom had been a crucial setback to her defense , she said you ca n't throw a skunk in the jury box and tell the jury not to smell it , ms stewart said of the impact of mr bin laden s image none of the eight women and four men on the jury , who served anonymously because of the terror charges in the trial , discussed their deliberations , which lasted a total of 12 days of meetings over a month but from notes they sent out and expressions they showed in court in the final days of their discussions , it appeared that two or three female jurors were resisting a majority that favored conviction on all counts when the verdicts were announced , one female juror , no 7 , appeared to stifle a sob and spoke barely audibly when asked to confirm her decision ms stewart , who calls herself a radical lawyer , said she still believed in the strength of the people but she worried that the jurors allowed themselves to be written upon by prosecutors playing on their postsept 11 fears after a supreme court decision on sentencing last month , judge koeltl will have new flexibility to decide ms stewart s sentence ms stewart said the loss of her law practice was more painful than the prospect of life behind bars i spend a lot of time in jails , she said , and i'm not afraid of jail as such i know that jail is mostly unpleasant , uncomfortable , you 're at the command of persons who do n't have your best interests at heart , you ca n't make a decision for yourself but she worried that she might be singled out for special isolation or harsh treatment by prison authorities as a terrorism convict ms stewart s codefendants , ahmed abdel sattar and mohamed yousry , will also appeal their convictions , their lawyers said mr sattar , a staten island postal worker who worked as a paralegal aide with ms stewart , was convicted of terror charges that carry a maximum life sentence mr yousry , an arabiclanguage interpreter , was convicted of providing material support to terrorism a lawyer for mr yousry , david ruhnke , said he was shocked and bitterly disappointed by the verdict i really think he is an innocent man convicted because of 9 11 , and because he was working for an unpopular person , he said
trenton , oct 11 two years after new jersey embarked on an ambitious plan to improve its troubled child welfare system , the state is still failing to provide the most basic services workers are not monitoring children regularly children have failed to receive regular checkups or have their medical records updated and the efficiency of the adoption process , a problem that other child welfare systems have addressed to great success , is still lagging , leaving children to languish in fostercare limbo the findings were among those in a report by an independent panel charged with monitoring the courtordered overhaul of new jersey s child welfare agency , the division of youth and family services the longawaited report , which was released on tuesday , found that the state has largely failed at putting key measures in place to fix the overburdened system and keep children safe citing the report , lawyers representing foster children in a classaction lawsuit against the state asked a federal judge to intervene in the reform effort , setting the stage for a possible court takeover of the system the state and the panel have 10 days to try to forge an agreement to forestall a takeover the panel found that new jersey officials have not met the most critical terms of an agreement that settled a lawsuit against the system in 2003 in a federal court hearing in trenton where the report was released , lawyers for children s rights inc , the manhattan advocacy group that settled the suit with the state , said the group had lost faith in new jersey s ability to repair the broken system the children deserve more than they have gotten , susan lambiase , associate director of children s rights , said in court a lot of time and money has been spent the state is unable to do the job the children need and deserve without a major course correction that just has n't come the report was the second of three periodic evaluations of the state s efforts to revamp its child welfare agency in the two years since agreeing to sweeping changes , the state has poured more than 300 million into the effort throughout the 89page report , members of the panel go to great pains to detail the modest but measurable ways in which the system has improved , including the hiring of 600 caseworkers and the end of the longstanding practice of warehousing mentally ill foster children in detention centers but in other areas , like eliminating excessive worker caseloads and putting new training techniques in place , the report concluded that the state s performance has been lacking the panel found that the state had made seriously inadequate progress in 14 key areas , taking no action in addressing some problems while doing too little to resolve others as a result , the panel wrote , the overall progress of the reform effort is considerably less than the court and the citizens of new jersey could reasonably have expected of 909 children placed with foster families from april to june of this year , only 260 or 29 percent of those who should have received medical exams did so , the panel found that figure was particularly alarming in light of the case of the jackson siblings , four adopted brothers who two years ago were found to have been starved for 13 years the boys were supposed to be monitored by the state and yet none had made regular doctor s visits this month , the state settled a lawsuit filed on the boys' behalf for 125 million one of the areas that i'm most concerned about is the fact that there remains an insufficient safety net for children with health care needs in this system , said kevin m ryan , the state s child advocate he added , it remains possible today that there are children in the child protection system whose imminent medical needs are not being addressed the panel also pointed to the slowness of adoption as a problem when it comes to placing children in adoptive homes , the state actually did a worse job in june 2005 than it did in january , according to the report new jersey s ability to 'provide timely , specialized , highquality adoption services' has decreased rather than improved during this monitoring period , the panel wrote in court on tuesday , james m davy , commissioner of the state s department of human services , which oversees the child welfare agency , argued that there were no grounds for court intervention while mr davy acknowledged that the system was still far short of its goals , he said that the state had done all it could to meet the standards established in the settlement agreement by the interim deadlines i am not going to tell you that the child welfare system in new jersey is fixed , he told judge stanley r chesler , before adding that officials remained committed to reform aides to acting gov richard j codey said that while he was still reviewing the panel s findings , the state remained dedicated to overhauling the system and getting results , said kelley heck , a spokeswoman for mr codey ms lambiase s request set in motion a series of steps that could lead to the agency being placed in receivership under the terms of the settlement agreement , both children s rights and the state will engage in 10 days of mediation which will be administered by the panel that released tuesday s report we 'll figure out if we can reach agreement about significant course corrections , and if we ca n't , we will go to the court for enforcement , ms lambiase said in a telephone interview after tuesday s hearing there are lots of possible remedies the most drastic would be receivership , which we have n't ruled out other possibilities , she said , included the state appointing experts to address areas of particular concern or elevating child welfare to a separate cabinetlevel agency in the hierarchy of state government during tuesday morning s hearing , judge chesler said that the state had reached a critical point in this reform plan he said that arguing the case in court would mean that two years of hard work and taxpayers' money would have been wasted if we get to the point where , in fact , we are litigating this reform plan , what i will tell you ladies and gentlemen is that you will have failed , he said if i have to reach that point , i will judge chesler said that he believed the report left room for the state to fulfill its pledge to make reforms he said he looked forward to the panel s third and final report in december , after which the state which has had a contentious relationship with the panel in recent months will ask that the group be disbanded and a single monitor be appointed the panel was formed shortly after the 2003 settlement and has been monitoring the state s progress for about a year the report does not challenge the commitment of the commissioner or the department to achieving reform , he said it does not brand the reform effort as a total failure the panel was sharply critical of the system s leaders , saying they have not done a consistent job of helping frontline workers understand the most basic components of the reform effort last month , edward e cotton , the division s leader , announced his resignation the panel came down hard in its report about leadership and organizational issues that seem to be completely undermining the reform effort , said ms lambiase and we do n't want this effort to be wasted we think the job can get done , but the clock is ticking , and time is running out
baghdad , feb 4 with 35 percent of all polling stations in iraq reporting results , a coalition of shiite parties held a huge lead , amassing twothirds of the 33 million votes tabulated so far , election officials said friday but none of the results have been from provinces north of baghdad , which have major concentrations of kurdish and sunni voters , and officials cautioned that the race could still hold surprises the relative calm that had settled over much of the country during the voting continued to crumble friday when an italian journalist , giuliana sgrena , was kidnapped by armed men near the university of baghdad ms sgrena s mobile phone was on as she was being dragged away by the kidnappers about 1 40 pm , according to an editor at her newspaper , il manifesto the paper reported on its web site that sounds of gunfire and footsteps slogging across baghdad s wet streets on a rainy day could be heard on the phone an italian news agency reported that another journalist , the one who had been speaking with ms sgrena , shouted , giuliana ! giuliana ! but received no reply in an implicit appeal that has become sadly familiar among the dwindling circle of western journalists , contractors , humanitarian workers and others in iraq , by late friday the newspaper had already posted on its web site her picture , an upbeat biography and a selection of her articles , many of them focusing on the plight of ordinary iraqis in a wartorn country attacks against the american military also took a toll , with three soldiers dying in the last two days , the military said on thursday , one of the soldiers was killed and a second was wounded by a roadside bomb during an early morning patrol near the restive northern city of mosul , and another soldier died south of baghdad , in babil province late friday afternoon , a soldier was killed and seven more were wounded when a bomb went off near baiji , about 100 miles north of the capital a roadside bomb killed four iraqi soldiers on saturday and wounded three others in the southern city of basra , iraqi officers told reuters the first substantial returns from voting by expatriate iraqis , released on friday , may provide a glimpse of how the overall numbers can change as the tabulation continues of the 270 , 000 expatriate votes counted from 14 countries , including the united states , the highest percentage still went to the shiite coalition but it received only 36 percent of the vote a kurdish party was next on the list , with 30 percent the kurdish party has gotten only a tiny number of votes so far within iraq , and a secular group led by ayad allawi , the interim prime minister , is running a distant second to the shiite religious coalition the slice of the vote that each party receives will determine how many seats it receives in the 275member national assembly , which will choose a prime minister and president and write a permanent constitution the counting could begin moving swiftly hussein hindawi , the chairman of iraq s independent electoral commission , said in a news conference that the commission had now received the sealed tally sheets with vote totals for all of the roughly 30 , 000 polling stations that were open on sunday dr hindawi strongly hinted that the commission was likely to skirt a potential delay by dismissing allegations of widespread voting irregularities in the north , near mosul some officials there have charged that balloting materials mysteriously did not arrive , preventing hundreds of thousands of mostly kurdish christians from voting there have been some exaggerations , said dr hindawi , who led a delegation to mosul to investigate the claims and we regret that some of these exaggerations have exploited political and religious symbols ms sgrena , the italian journalist , was working on obtaining interviews at a sunni mosque near the university of baghdad when she was cut off by a vehicle filled with armed men ms sgrena , 56 , is a middle east specialist who has worked for il manifesto since 1988 and had been in baghdad less than two weeks , according to the paper it is unclear whether she was traveling with armed security guards il manifesto was once a communist publication , but after the collapse of the soviet union it became a smallcirculation paper , run by a collective , that is favored by the intellectual left colleagues at il manifesto were hoping that the arabiclanguage television channels al jazeera and al arabiya might help in persuading the kidnappers to free her with reports that emphasized articles reflecting her fierce opposition to the war and the american occupation but there is a ghastly unpredictability about which foreign hostages are killed and which are released , and no one can say whether gestures of that kind have the power to move kidnappers in iraq , whose motives range over the entire gamut from profit to politics the election returns continued to be a disappointment for mr allawi s party , which so far has garnering 580 , 000 votes inside iraq the shiite religious coalition , called the iraqi united alliance and closely identified with grand ayatollah ali alsistani , the country s most revered shiite cleric , has pulled in 22 million votes and seems close to sweeping into the new government with a powerful majority many of the national assembly s most critical votes , including those on the president and the constitution , will require twothirds majorities the returns so far suggest that such a bloc could be within reach for the shiites , especially if they decide to ally themselves with another group like the kurds a party affiliated with the antiamerican shiite cleric moktada alsadr , whose stronghold of support is in northeastern baghdad , was running third , with 37 , 000 , as the tally continued a communist party was running fourth , with just 30 , 000 votes , followed by another islamic party with 24 , 000 votes dr hindawi , the chairman of the election commission , and hamdiya husseini , another commission member , said overall figures for voter turnout were still not available they sought to distance themselves from initial , highly optimistic estimates that ranged above 70 percent of registered voters we speculated a number , and we said that this is only speculation , dr hindawi said we hope that this first figure is correct , but we have to wait to give you a correct figure for the turnout commissioners also gave clear signals that they did not believe that the voting problems in the north had been as widespread as some local officials and political parties had claimed dr hindawi said 96 polling centers had opened in nineveh province , which contains mosul he said that in only one town , hamdaniya , did polling materials arrive late because of the difficult security environment in the province and even in that town , said safwat rashid , another commissioner , the materials were sent , but it was too late
in the gently rolling landscape of the suburban commuter train , the middle seat is forsaken territory unloved and overlooked , doomed never to be a favored aisle or beloved window , it is always empty , except at rush hour , when it is a refuge for losers for the people who are too late , too slow , too tired to object to being coldshouldered by sleepy strangers left and right should you ever feel the perverse desire to relive the childhood misery of losing at musical chairs , just get on the 5 41 pm to hicksville at 5 39 you 'll have to stand or take a middle seat none of this , however , is any reason to make the middle seat go away in a frontpage article last week , patrick mcgeehan of the times reported that transit agencies around the country are eliminating middle seats , having decided that they are underused and a waste of space cranky commuters sometimes like to complain that railroads are run by stupid people , and with decisions like these , the officials seem almost desperate to prove them right what has been ignored in the quest for maximal passengerpacking efficiency is that the commuter is not a tomato the commuter is a human being , and the suburban rail car a delicate psychological battleground , a society of sleepy , depressive people jockeying for scraps of comfort and solace in this confined world , 18 or 19 inches the width of an empty middle seat is a sanity preserver , a cushion against oppression , a bit of emptiness no less necessary or precious than a landscaped highway median , a deserted beach or the arctic national wildlife refuge the meager pleasures available to a commuter include being able sometimes to stretch out , to place newspapers and coffee cups somewhere besides the lap , and to retreat into the quietude of one s own thoughts there are , too , people who travel in groups of three or more families with children , neighbors , cardplaying work buddies they also deserve the option of a convivial threeseat ride going two by two is fine for noah s ark , kindergarten recess or a wedding procession but in a twoseatbytwoseat car full of snarly business types , cellphone jabberers , sneezers , wheezers , and extralarge people with shopping bags roaming the aisle like a flotilla of fatbottomed boats , the heavens cry out for justice for mercy for three seats across

los angeles , may 22 star wars episode iii revenge of the sith became the year s first movie blockbuster while setting some historic benchmarks , as it rode a recordbreaking debut on thursday to the biggest number ever for a fourday opening , 1585 million but even an outsized hit like the final installment of the director george lucas s skywalker saga could not break a boxoffice slump that has kept movie attendance and ticket sales lagging behind last year s for 13 weekends , a trend that has some in hollywood concerned about the habits of american moviegoers even with last thursday s record oneday ticket sales of 50 million , the year s boxoffice total is lagging 5 percent behind last year s , and attendance is down almost 9 percent , said paul dergarabedian , president of exhibitor relations , which tracks the box office one movie cannot change the whole course of events over one weekend , he said this indicates a resurgence people will come back to the movie theaters , but one film that s a lot of pressure to turn everything around we could not reverse three months of downward with one film we 're way down last year at this time , there were two major films to lure moviegoers , the wildly popular shrek 2 , and the less wellreceived epic , troy , which starred brad pitt still , none of this news seemed to dampen spirits at 20th century fox , which is distributing episode iii for mr lucas s lucasfilm a privately held company that stands to reap most financial benefit from the hit we set records domestically , internationally and intergalactically , said bruce snyder , fox s distribution president a big part of the success , and the continuing amazing grosses , is that people are coming out of the auditorium and are getting back on line to buy more tickets for future shows episode iii benefited from a ubiquitous marketing campaign , huge anticipation from generations of fans and reviews that were far better than for the last two episodes \( and the film s performance did n't appear to be measurably hurt by the fact that a copy quickly became available on the internet and was downloaded by thousands of filesharers \) in the united states , the movie took in an estimated total of 1585 million in 3 , 661 theaters , a figure that bested the last fourday record , set for the matrix reloaded in 2003 , of 1343 million episode iii also opened almost everywhere around the world , and took in and additional 1447 million overseas international boxoffice records are difficult to calculate because of the myriad countries involved , but the figure was certainly a huge success for the film , whose total box office was 3032 million for the first four days the strong performance became a kind of final triumph for legions of star wars fans who grew up on the first three star wars films in the 1970 s and 1980 s , and hungered for a conclusion to the story of anakin skywalker , who in this last installment turns into the archvillain darth vader many fans were disappointed by the more recent installments , star wars episode i the phantom menace in 1999 and star wars episode ii attack of the clones in 2002 episode ii took in 311 million at the domestic box office , a figure the latest film looked likely to surpass within a number of weeks while the current film had wide appeal , polls by fox found that an estimated 58 percent of the audience was male mr snyder said he did not put much stock in concerns over the lagging box office , though he acknowledged getting congratulatory calls from his colleagues at other studios saying , 'thank you , we needed this to jumpstart everything ' he added i think the industry is awakening from bit of slumber it s absolutely fine next weekend will bring another pair of major commercial bets , the animated comedy madagascar , from dreamworks animation , and an adam sandler vehicle , the longest yard , from paramount studio executives said they were expecting both to draw big summer audiences this weekend , the new line comedy monsterinlaw took second place at the box office , with 143 million in its second weekend universal s comedy kicking and screaming , which stars will ferrell , took in 105 million warner brothers slipped its dominion prequel to the exorcist , by director paul schrader , into 110 theaters this weekend , and took in 119 , 000 in an unusual twist , essentially the same film was already made by another director , renny harlin , and released last year by warner as exorcist the beginning

no place to hide by robert o'harrow jr 348 pp the free press 26 chatter dispatches from the secret world of global eavesdropping by patrick radden keefe 300 pp random house 2495 your mother s maiden name is not the secret you think it is that sort of personal identifier being used by banks , credit agencies , doctors , insurers and retailers supposedly to protect you against the theft of your identity can be found out in a flash from a member of the new securityindustrial complex there goes the personal identifier that you presume a stranger would not know , along with your social security number and soon your face and dna in the past five years , what most of us only recently thought of as nobody s business has become the big business of everybody s business perhaps you are one of the 30 million americans who pay for what you think is an unlisted telephone number to protect your privacy but when you order an item using an 800 number , your own number may become fair game for any retailer who subscribes to one of the booming corporate datacollection services in turn , those services may be and some have been penetrated by identity thieves the computer s ability to collect an infinity of data about individuals tracking every movement and purchase , assembling facts and traits in a personal dossier , forgetting nothing was in place before 9 11 but among the unremarked casualties of that day was a value that americans once treasured personal privacy the first civilliberty fire wall to fall was the one within government that separated the domestic security powers of the fbi from the more intrusive foreign surveillance powers of the cia the 9 11 commission successfully mobilized public opinion to put dotconnection first and privacy protection last but the second fire wall crumbled with far less public notice or approval that was the separation between law enforcement recordkeeping and commercial market research almost overnight , the law s suspect list married the corporations' prospect list the hasty , troubling merger of these two increasingly powerful forces capable of encroaching on the personal freedom of american citizens is the subject of two new books robert o'harrow jr s no place to hide might just do for privacy protection what rachel carson s silent spring did for environmental protection nearly a halfcentury ago the author , a reporter for the washington post , does not write in anger sputtering outrage , which characterizes the writing of many of us in the antisnooping minority , is not o'harrow s style his is the work of a careful , thorough , enterprising reporter , possibly the only one assigned to the privacy beat by a major american newspaper he has interviewed many of the major , and largely unknown , players in the world of surveillance and dossier assembly , and provides extensive source notes in the back of his book he not only reports their professions of patriotism and plausible arguments about the necessity of screening to security , but explains the profitability to modern business of consumer relationship management no place to hide its title taken from george w bush s post9 11 warning to terrorists is all the more damning because of its fairmindedness o'harrow notes that many consumers find it convenient to be in a marketing dossier that knows their personal preferences , habits , income , professional and sexual activity , entertainment and travel interests and foibles these intimately profiled people are untroubled by the device placed in the car they rent that records their speed and location , the keystroke logger that reads the characters they type , the plastic hotel key that transmits the frequency and time of entries and exits or the hidden camera that takes their picture at a super bowl or tourist attraction they fill out cards revealing personal data to get a warranty , unaware that the warranties are already provided by law even as people fret about corporate intrusiveness , o'harrow writes about a searching survey of subscribers taken by cond nast publications , they often willingly , even eagerly , part with intimate details about their lives such acquiescence ends for a while when snoopers get caught spilling their data to thieves or exposing the extent of their operations the industry took some heat when a young new hampshire woman was murdered by a stalker who bought her social security number and address from an online information service but its lobbyists managed to extract the teeth from senator judd gregg s proposed legislation , and the intercorporate trading of supposedly confidential social security numbers has mushroomed when an article in the new york times by john markoff , followed by another in the washington post by o'harrow , revealed the pentagon s intensely invasive total information awareness program headed by vice admiral john poindexter of irancontra infamy , a conservative scandalmonger took umbrage \( safire s column was like a blowtorch on dry tinder , o'harrow writes in the book s only colorful simile \) the poindexter program s slogan , knowledge is power , struck many as orwellian senators ron wyden and russell d feingold were able to limit funding for the governmentsponsored data mining , and poindexter soon resigned a pentagon group later found that tia was a flawed effort to achieve worthwhile ends and called for clear rules and policy guidance , adopted through an open and credible political process but o'harrow reports in no place to hide that a former poindexter colleague at tia said government interest in the program s research actually broadened after it was apparently killed by congress the author devotes chapters to the techniques of commercial data gatherers and sellers like acxiom , seisint and the britishowned lexisnexis , not household names themselves , but boasting computers stuffed with the names and pictures of each member of the nation s households as well as hundreds of millions of their credit cards he quotes ole poulsen , chief technology officer of seisint , on its digital identity system we have created a unique identifier on everybody in the united states data that belongs together is already linked together soon after 9 11 , having seen the system that was to become the publicprivate surveillance engine called matrix \( in computer naming , life follows film art \) , michael mullaney , a counterterrorism official at the justice department , told o'harrow i sat down and said , 'these guys have the computer that every american is afraid of' of all the companies in the securityindustrial complex , none is more dominant or acquisitive than choicepoint of alpharetta , ga this data giant collects , stores , analyzes and sells literally billions of demographic , marketing and criminal records to police departments and government agencies that might otherwise be criticized \( or defunded \) for building a national identity base to make american citizens prove they are who they say they are with its employeescreening , shoplifterblacklisting and creditreporting arms , choicepoint is also , in the author s words , a national nanny that for a fee could watch or assess the background of virtually anybody from sales brochures that choicepoint distributed to its corporate and government customers as well as from interviews with its ceo , derek v smith , the doyen of dossiers , who claims this incredible passion to make a safer world the post s privacy reporter has assembled a coherent narrative that provides a profile of a profiler as if to lend a news peg to the book , choicepoint has just thrust itself into the nation s consciousness as a conglomerate hoist by its own petard the outfit that sells the ability to anticipate suspicious activity that provides security to the nation s security services that claims it protects people from identity theft has been easily penetrated by a gang that stole its dossiers on at least 145 , 000 people across the country on top of that revelation , the company had to admit it first became suspicious last september that phony companies were downloading its supposedly confidential electronic records on individual citizens not only is the federal trade commission inquiring into the company s compliance with consumerinformation security laws , but the securities and exchange commission is investigating prearranged sales of choicepoint stock by smith and another top official that netted a profit of 17 million before the penetration was publicly disclosed and the stock price plunged choicepoint data cache became a powder keg was the washington post headline , with the subhead identity thief s ability to get information puts heat on firm this was followed by the account a week later of another breach of faith at a competing data mine id thieves breach lexisnexis , obtain information on 32 , 000 now that a flat rock has been flipped over , much more scurrying about will be observed this will cause embarrassment to lobbyists for , and advisers to , the major players in the securityindustrial complex no place to hide names famous names , revealing associations with howard safir , former new york city police commissioner gen wesley clark , former nato commander and former senator dale bumpers of arkansas \( if you hear , this is not about the money it s about the money \) more of the press has been showing interest , especially since congressional hearings have begun and data is being disseminated about the data collectors a second book not as eyeopening as o'harrow s original reporting but a short course in what little we know of international government surveillance is chatter dispatches from the secret world of global eavesdropping , by patrick radden keefe this thirdyear student at yale law school dares to make his first book an examination of what he calls the libertysecurity matrix chatter , he notes , is a once innocuous word meaning gossip the babble of a child that in the world of electronic intelligence has gained the sinister sense of telltale metabolic rhythm chatter silence attack the flurry of sigint signals intelligence , picked up by the secret listening devices of our national security agency sometimes precedes a terrorist attack , and almost always precedes an elevation of our colorcoded security alerts keefe does what a brilliant , persevering law student with no inside sources or a prestigious press pass should do he surveys much of what has been written about sigint and pores over the public hearing transcripts he visits worried scientists and some former spooks who have written critical books , and poses questions to which he would like to get answers he does n't get them , but his account of unclimbable walls and unanswered calls invites further attempts from media bigfeet to do better keefe is a researcher adept at compiling intriguing bits and pieces dug out or leaked in the past the most useful part of the book is the notes at the end about written , public sources that point to some breaks in the fog chatter focuses on government , not commercial , surveillance , and thereby misses the danger inherent in the sinister synergism of the two moreover , the book lacks a point of view at 28 , keefe has formulated neither a feel for individual privacy nor a zeal for government security it may be , as roman solons said , inter arma silent leges in wartime , the laws fall silent but the privacysecurity debate needs to be both informed and joined this is no time for agnostics for example , what to do about echelon \? that is supposedly an ultrasecret surveillance network , conducted by the united states and four other englishspeaking nations , to overhear and oversee signals we do n't know whether echelon exists , keefe writes , and , if it does exist , how the shadowy network operates it all remains an enigma though he cannot light a candle , he at least calls attention to , without cursing , the darkness keefe s useful research primer on today s surveillance society , and especially o'harrow s breakthrough reporting on the noxious nexus of government and commercial snooping , open the way for the creation of privacy beats for journalism s coming generation of search engineers a small furor is growing about the abuse of security that leads to identity theft we 'll see how long the furor lasts before the commercialpublic security combine again slams privacy against the wall of secrecy , but at least poindexter s slogan is being made clear knowledge is indeed power , and more than a little power in unknowable hands is a dangerous thing william safire writes the on language column for the times magazine
fort hood , tex , jan 11 the soldiers tied the detainees' hands behind their backs and hooded them as they marched them one by one into the cellblock at abu ghraib prison on a november night in 2003 they threw us in a pile , and then i heard footsteps running , one of the detainees , hussein mutar , testified by videotape on tuesday at the military trial here for specialist charles a graner jr , the army reservist accused of being the ringleader in the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal then i heard someone diving on me the diving soldiers had hurt mr mutar s knee and shoulder he was crying , he testified , the men around him were crying , and the soldiers were screaming and laughing the soldiers ordered the detainees to strip , he said , and anyone who could not take his clothes off fast enough had them cut off with a knife the detainees were forced to masturbate , he said , and pile into the pyramid of naked bodies so infamously photographed by the soldiers mr mutar and a syrian detainee testified in taped depositions here as the prosecution wrapped up its case against specialist graner , the first contested courtmartial to come from the abuse scandal the photographs the detainees described set off international outrage against the american military and led to abuse investigations at other american detention centers he hit me on my face and on my knees , and all i could hear was the screaming of the people around me , and myself screaming , mr mutar testified i wished that i would kill myself because no one over there was stopping what was going on the detainees narrated the events captured on film using stark , vivid language , shaking their heads and occasionally thumping themselves in the chest or the head to punctuate the force of the soldiers' fists punching them mr mutar took a pen and circled himself in the photos as the man on top of the pyramid , identifying himself by the scar on his buttocks their testimony , videotaped last month in a courtroom at camp victory in iraq , capped the government s effort to portray specialist graner as a ruthless abuser who took delight in beating prisoners and forcing them into sexually humiliating positions lawyers for specialist graner have said the soldiers were following orders from military superiors who were under pressure to obtain better intelligence from the detainees guy womack , his civilian lawyer , said he would provide taped testimony on wednesday from a detainee who will say that military interrogators gave specialist graner orders to rough up prisoners an army major , mr womack said , will testify that there was pressure from superiors but several military investigators and the detainees themselves testified tuesday that the detainees in the photographs were at most common criminals , not suspected terrorists , and none were interrogated by military intelligence no one questioned us , said mr mutar , who said iraqi policemen had taken him at night from his house in baghdad because they believed he had stolen a car , then transferred him to the americans they took us and tortured us the other detainee , ameen said alsheikh , a syrian who said he had come to iraq to fight the american forces in 2003 , testified , graner was the primary torturer mr womack asked him if specialist graner had been acting under orders perhaps , mr alsheikh said , but it is his nature he is an aggressive man mr womack suggested that mr alsheikh was an unreliable witness because he had exchanged gunfire at abu ghraib with american soldiers , using a gun that was smuggled in to him by an iraqi guard mr alsheikh said the guard had given him the gun after he expressed fear for his life he said specialist graner once jumped on his leg , already wounded by gunshot , so hard that it failed to heal straight the soldier then beat it with a collapsible metal baton , mr alsheikh testified he handcuffed me to the door for eight hours and the next day i had a dislocated shoulder and they took me to the hospital , he said specialist graner watched as another soldier urinated on mr alsheikh , the detainee testified , and specialist graner made another detainee eat from a toilet he threatened to rape them and their wives , and made them eat pork and make statements against their muslim faith , mr alsheikh said graner told me to thank jesus for keeping me alive , mr alsheikh said mr mutar said that after the forced masturbation , he and other detainees were walked back to their cells with hands above their heads , only to discover their cells had been soaked with water they slept naked in wet , cold cells until the day shift came , he said prosecutors showed the jury several email messages that specialist graner had sent on his army account to family and friends the judge would not allow the email to be read aloud or released publicly , but a spokesman for the prosecution told reporters that they contradicted specialist graner s assertion that he was under orders to mistreat detainees specialist graner s former wife , staci morris , whom he once admitted beating in an altercation that led to his arrest and guilty plea for harassment , made a brief appearance to identify notebooks and military manuals that were taken from the house the two once shared in uniontown , pa prosecutors would not specify why they gave the notebooks to the jury , but said specialist graner s notes in the books outlined his views on detainee treatment a former prison guard and a marine veteran of the first iraq war , specialist graner faces 17 and half years in prison on charges of assault , conspiracy , indecent acts and maltreatment a jury of 10 soldiers , all men and all combat veterans , is expected to deliberate his case by the end of the week he is one of seven members of the 372nd military police company , based in cresaptown , md , to be charged three soldiers have pleaded guilty and agreed to testify three face courtmartial at a break , mr womack told reporters that the testimony from mr alsheikh was very helpful to the defense because it would offend the jury it s the face of the enemy , he said , it s very clear that he hates america but the detainees said specialist graner had become the face of the american enemy that graner guy , he is a man that hurt his country , hurt his people , mr alsheikh said , shaking his head mr mutar said saddam did n't do this to us
ron rifkin looked unhappy , which is not exactly unusual during a rehearsal last month for the paris letter now previewing at the roundabout s laura pels theater , where it will open next sunday he paced and pawed and scratched at his role like a cat fighting its way out of a bag also in the room , scribbling on a script , was the play s author , jon robin baitz the two men \( following standard rehearsal protocol \) spoke to each other only through the director , doug hughes , but they were nevertheless fidgeting in sync they 've had a lot of practice the paris letter is the fourth play mr baitz has written with mr rifkin in mind even so , mr baitz knew that the character he 'd created represented the biggest challenge yet to the actor s skills and the biggest provocation to their relationship we 'd gotten to the point where it could n't just be more of the same , mr baitz said it had to be private , it had to be costly , it had to hurt and so he came up with the role of sandy sonnenberg , who \( like isaac geldhart in the substance of fire and kenneth hoyle in three hotels and other baitz leading men mr rifkin has played \) is a cultured , wellmarried and prosperous businessman facing a moral catastrophe unlike the others , though , he is a homosexual the disaster in the paris letter is not primarily precipitated by external forces like capitalism but by the sudden explosion of sonnenberg s interior life , when he has an affair with an intense , ambitious , younger male colleague , and loses everything in the process mr rifkin is 66 and has been married for 38 years to the former iva march \( mr baitz is 43 and gay from 1990 until 2002 he was the partner of joe mantello , who directed three hotels \) but if mr rifkin looked troubled as he rehearsed the scene , it was not about the personal parallels , or even about kissing a man onstage do you really think that would be an issue for me \? he said later , wincing as if at a sip of sour wine no , what bothered him was that he wanted a joke , like the ones repeatedly being added for his scene partner , john glover and though mr baitz promised him one , mr rifkin knew better never gonna happen , he said they both understood that mr rifkin , with his perpetually moist eyes and his face lined by melancholy , was for mr baitz a dark , almost tragic muse it s not that mr rifkin is n't convivial , funny , capable of enjoying and sharing , often with mr baitz , the refinements and overrefinements of life \( the parisian greenglass doorknobs throughout the rifkins' tribeca loft are the least of it \) but ever since mr baitz first saw mr rifkin perform onstage , as a ruined depressionera coat manufacturer in a 1988 production of arthur miller s american clock at the williamstown theater festival , he has felt compelled to write ruinous stories for him when he entered , mr baitz said , the temperature changed what i saw was a man in sorrow and , under that , an incipient joy an elegant man whose world collapses under him and in an odd way he reminded me of my father after the show , when mr baitz eagerly told the actor he 'd like to write a play for him , mr rifkin reinforced that impression sure , kid , whatever , he said some 17 years later , the plays mr rifkin inspired mr baitz to write \( though he did not originally appear in all of them \) have won mr baitz many awards , and helped establish his reputation as a milleresque dissector of success and failure , commercial and familial if part of his interest in those subjects is autobiographical \( his father , a former executive for carnation , is clearly the model for many of his protagonists \) , part is biographical , a result of his bonding with mr rifkin , whose own story paralleled and would amplify his themes in uncanny ways as it turned out , commercial and familial failure and success was also mr rifkin s story several years before they met at williamstown , mr rifkin had all but retired from acting , in disgust having worked for years on television \( he was bonnie franklin s boyfriend on one day at a time , among many similar roles \) , he had grown tired , as iva rifkin put it , of playing the friend , then the friend of the friend , then the friend of the friend of the friend he did stage work in los angeles , but no one seemed to care or notice i was tired of not being taken seriously , he said iva was working as a casting assistant at the time , and when my name came up for a part , she heard someone say about me , 'i thought he only did sitcoms' i was never on the a , b or c lists \( or even the z lists , ms rifkin added \) and because we had no children , no responsibilities , he said , we 'd spent everything we 'd made i was worried about money and so he took on a new role around 1983 , he and his wife \( who had left a career as a broadway dancer to follow her husband to los angeles \) began to work for his father s coat business , which at the time was called ronlee apparel at first , the change the admission of defeat to a man who had always been horrified by his son s artiness was unbearable i would see him trying to get dressed for work , ms rifkin recalled the hair on his chest would be matted from sobbing but soon he began to enjoy the new challenge his father s korean manufacturers asked the couple to develop a more stylish , less expensive line the resulting shearedrabbit swing coats , dyed and printed in kicky patterns , were a hit and the company prospered mr rifkin had restyled himself , too , as a japanesesuited , ponytailed garmento performing sales presentations for saks and bendel as if they were scenes in a restoration comedy and after the koreans bought out ronlee and the younger rifkin stayed on , sundering the family business , there was some justice when he ended up competing with and beating his father at his father s own game but as in a miller \( or baitz \) play , it was a bittersweet justice at best mr rifkin had not succeeded at what mattered to him i still thought so little of myself , he said i would n't even go backstage after shows to see friends that he is now a successful and wellknown actor is , he said , mostly the result of meeting mr baitz but it was not an immediate reversal of fortune after the first play mr baitz wrote for him , dutch landscape , was given a workshop at the mark taper forum in los angeles in 1988 , the director , gordon davidson , decided to give it a full production only if he could recast mr rifkin s part mr baitz agreed , and mr rifkin , crushed , suggested that the two not talk for a while he flew off for meetings in korea it would 've taken a great kind of assurance on my part to resist the temptation and pull the plug , mr baitz said but i should have done it i had one of those moments where i had to say to myself afterwards , 'why do n't you even know how to fight for what you love \? ' mr rifkin is more forgiving he was a kid , he was 27 , what was he supposed to do \? in any case , mr baitz soon started turning his ruminations on loyalty and cowardice into the substance of fire , a play \( written largely while living at the rifkins' los angeles home \) about a fight over a family business the 1991 production at playwrights horizons , which moved to lincoln center theater in 1992 , would win mr rifkin his first major awards and frank rich s review in the new york times noted his careertransforming performance but for mr baitz , what he called the demon need was not yet exorcised when a film studio offered him a lot of money to turn the play into a movie , and bandied about names like dustin hoffman and anthony hopkins , mr baitz accepted , at least until he and ms rifkin had a screaming fight about betrayal in the street outside the theater where they were about to see lips together , teeth apart in the end , mr baitz pulled out of the deal and the movie was made \( independently and for much less money \) with mr rifkin , tony goldwyn , timothy hutton and sarah jessica parker , who was also in the stage version and was shocked to learn , when she wore a ronlee coat to rehearsal one day , that her costar had manufactured it though he continued to hold some meetings with his korean business partners in his lincoln center dressing room , and would call his wife during intermission to say he saw a no 3015 in the front row in green , mr rifkin gradually untangled himself from the coat business his success in mr baitz s plays \( including , eventually , dutch landscape , by then reworked as a fair country \) led to his being cast in many other productions off broadway and on \( he won a 1998 tony for his appearance in sam mendes s revival of cabaret \) and none of it would have happened without robbie offering me that part , he said if i 'd had to audition , who would have cast me , me from the garment biz and 'one day at a time , ' as this elegant mitteleuropean publisher \? typically , he starts to tear up as he plays out the theme he s the son i did n't have , he said i have to tie his bow tie for him when he s pale , who else tells him 'i do n't like the way you look' \? when he had heart surgery , he recovered in our loft i'm a father without the time put in but no one ever believed in me as much as this boy did it s a twoway street , that belief although many actors have since played some of mr rifkin s roles , it grows increasingly difficult , as those roles grow more idiosyncratic , for mr baitz to imagine anyone inhabiting them as fully in part because the characters are set on mr rifkin , much as choreographers set their dances on a favorite dancer , his grasp of their substance is literally authoritative even his ellipses , he said i know what those dot dot dots are i feel i could do any part in his plays , even the women in its classical incarnation think dante and beatrice , or shakespeare and his dark lady the muse relationship is partly romantic and wholly unilateral beatrice did n't advance her career by doing readings of the divine comedy for backers in today s theater , though , especially as it becomes more beleaguered and marginalized and centered on directors , it makes sense that some playwrights try to cement the relationship with the actors who inspire them by formalizing it in a kind of family but what happens when you 've wrung every possible variation out of your archetype \? \( in its explosive combination of themes drawn from his own life , his father s and even mr rifkin s , the paris letter seems to be the last turn of the biographicalautobiographical screw \) and what happens when the muse \( shades of pygmalion and galatea \) becomes independently successful \? after all , mr rifkin is now a wealthy television star , having played the evil genius arvin sloane on abc s alias since 2001 mr baitz and mr rifkin \( and mr mantello and ms rifkin \) are trying to resist entropy despite the younger men s breakup , the four remain close which is putting it mildly , ms parker said they practically all live together indeed , they recently bought a parcel of land on long island , where they intend to build a compound of three houses and mr baitz , when invited to script an episode of alias for broadcast last month , tried to get the producers to allow him to write mr rifkin out of the show at least temporarily so he would be more free to do my plays in new york , mr baitz explained the producers , men of commerce , declined 'the paris letter' laura pels theater 111 west 46th street in previews , opens next sunday
men are seen and women are looked at , as susan sontag once observed , a truth that applies to nearly all cultures , but to none more starkly than our own the eight days of new york fashion week , which begins a cycle that will move on to london , milan and paris , are like an ongoing orgy for the most promiscuous or , anyway , the least morally restrained of human organs , the eye for the next month , women will be looked at constantly , baldly , unashamedly , as they parade around runways wearing the latest fashions and , in important ways , representing the latest fashions in how women are understood few things are less in vogue right now than intellectual dissection of fashion and that is a shame , since the current runway season has a lot to say about how female emancipation retains the power to stir cultural unease it is not merely that the first lady whose sartorial image seems engineered to quote a placid era before locutions like lady were given the boot descended on fashion week to demonstrate her glacial poise and concern with women s issues \( in this case , high rates of heart disease \) it is not just that , when carleton s fiorina , the chief executive of the computer giant hewlettpackard , a designer sponsor of fashion week , was ousted on wednesday , criticism of her performance deployed all the clich s of the hysteric at the top \( apparently her glamour and charisma did ms fiorina in \) it is that designers were once again attracted to ideals of docility that one imagined had gone out with the corset but hold on a second corsets are back so , too , are hourglass shapes \( narciso rodriguez , esteban cortazar \) , dollhouse clothes \( marc jacobs \) and skirts that fit so tightly \( roland mouret \) they make mincing the only possible gait it might surprise some people to learn how closely the vocabulary of dressmaking can resemble that of animal husbandry words like cinch and harness and strap and hobble turn up a lot one could refer to the designs of mr mouret , a talented designer and industry favorite being touted as a frontrunner for the chief design job at givenchy , as ultrafeminine many critics did one could equally point out that the career prospects of the black dahlia types mr mouret used as inspiration for his exaggeratedly fitted dresses were not altogether bright sure , there was beauty in their veneered passivity and sultry glamour , but no future the likeliest fate for most women in noir films is becoming a corpse if i had a choice right now between soulful house music or electro or music with a rock edge , my preference is for rock , said wilson chan , who goes by the name mrwilsondj and whose musical preferences this week were in line with a trend rock is more forward right now and ahead of the curve , said mr chan , whose play list for a variety of shows ran to indie bands like earlimart , louis xiv , the kings of convenience and the shins and rock stalwarts like trex and lou reed mr chan was the house dj at gucci during that label s musical glory days under tom ford his musical tastes were formed during what he called an ethnic brady bunch boyhood in staten island , where his italian stepfather and filipino mother , an aerobics instructor and music fanatic , favored the compilations called stars on 45 these records , still available online , are like prototypes for genres like sampling and mashup , although they were recorded years before those terms were coined or before anyone could have imagined that an unassuming renegade called danger mouse might one day combine the beatles' white album with jayz s black album to produce the grey album , which drew international attention last year i do n't know how they got away with it , but there are these amazing clips of , like , 30 seconds of four beatles songs in a row , said mr chan , who finds his music mostly at stores like rebel rebel or on the incredible jukebox at the phoenix , a gay bar on the lower east side sometimes it would take the powers of , say , rosemarie , the 5 clairvoyant on 42nd street who advertises her services on a sandwich board featuring a 40yearold photograph of veruschka , to figure out who is who at a fashion show it is not all topshelf brands like anna wintour and beyonc in the tents the usual gang of photographers mobbed a scantily clad blonde on wednesday at anna sui s lively hippieish show to the usual befuddlement of frontrow types , who conducted a whispering campaign to determine who the woman was \( she was kiera chaplin , charlie s granddaughter \) despite guards and signs at bryant park warning admission by invitation only , plenty of interlopers make it into the tents from a security viewpoint , this is probably not a good thing but it is nice to know that the spirit of enterprise that once inspired local drag queens to borrow , steal and counterfeit tickets to gain entry to the shows is alive and kicking you have to move , a young hiphop singer named janet brown told this reporter at the twinkle show yesterday my friend needs the seat whatever ms brown lacked in credentials , she made up in moxie true , she may never have heard of olivier theyskens , john galliano or alber elbaz \( the designers for , respectively , rochas , dior and lanvin \) , but she knew what she liked \( jlo and baby phat \) and , after all , could n't fashion use a dose of civilian wisdom to cut through all the insider hooha and hype \? it was not a total surprise that ms brown had managed to score a frontrow seat for twinkle plenty of shows have been filling empty seats from the ranks of the standing room crowds word must be out that the bryant park tents are no longer impregnable we find out a lot of happenings , ms brown explained we know when it s fashion week
the investment banks that are being wooed to back a rival bid for the new york stock exchange agreed yesterday to study the exchange s deal with archipelago independently john j mack , the wall street veteran who is advising the bankers , spoke with john a thain , the chief executive of the exchange , and said that his primary role would be to ensure that mr thain made his case to the chief executives that the proposed merger with archipelago , the electronic trading platform , represented the best deal for seat holders that the investment banks , including jp morgan , merrill lynch , bear stearns and lehman brothers , decided to study the merits of the deal on their own rather than join the group pulled together by kenneth g langone , the former exchange director who conceived the bid , underlines how difficult it will be to scuttle the exchange s deal mr mack , a former president of morgan stanley and chief executive of credit suisse first boston , acknowledged as much by saying that mr thain had a strong case and that the group , in its amorphous state , was unlikely to derail the deal with the banks declining to pay the expenses of hiring a lawyer and an investment banker , the group has more or less disbanded , although mr mack said that they all had agreed to keep in touch mr mack had asked that they put up about 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 , as an indication of their support for the deal none did as for mr mack s role , he said he would continue as a liaison between mr thain and the banks i was an unpaid coordinator of the first meeting , he said with a laugh now i'm just trying to get the facts out , so i guess i'm more of a facilitator of information the tepid reaction of the banks stands in contrast to the fiery rhetoric of mr langone , who has said that he and stanley druckenmiller , a hedge fund investor , will invest more than 100 million in a competing bid for the exchange driving his initiative was his displeasure that goldman sachs had advised both parties to the deal a feeling shared by goldman s competitors , who still question whether goldman secured the most attractive valuation for the exchange the merger agreement between the exchange and archipelago was filed by archipelago with the securities and exchange commission late yesterday it included a copy of the engagement letter with goldman sachs , which outlines the various conflicts goldman sachs could pose with its myriad interests in the deal among goldman s many footholds in the deal are that it owns a 156 percent stake in archipelago , goldman and its affiliates own 21 seats on the exchange and lease 92 , goldman sachs execution and clearing provides services to archipelago , and a goldman representative is on the exchange s board of executives those interests were disclosed in the letter the letter also indicated that while goldman was being retained to study how much a combined company would be worth , it would not be responsible for negotiating any financial aspects of a transaction or rendering a fairness opinion
baghdad , iraq , jan 19 insurgents detonated five powerful truck and car bombs across baghdad on wednesday , killing 26 people , at least 9 of them members of iraq s fledgling security forces the attacks came as iraq s interim prime minister , ayad allawi , said he would reveal plans next week for an accelerated buildup of those forces to prepare for an eventual american withdrawal responding to political pressures within iraq ahead of the jan 30 elections and mounting questions in washington about the prospects for an american pullout , dr allawi said he had been talking with the united states commanders in baghdad about ways to accelerate the training , equipping and deploying of iraqi security forces he added that this in turn will accelerate the drawdown and gradual withdrawal of the multinational forces in iraq those forces are made up of about 150 , 000 troops from the united states and upward of 25 , 000 from other nations but dr allawi raised the tantalizing prospect of an eventual american withdrawal while giving little away , insisting that a pullout could not be tied to a fixed timetable , but rather to the iraqi forces' progress toward standing on their own that formula is similar to what president bush and other senior administration officials have spoken about some american military commanders have said privately that with this approach and considering the demoralization , desertion and unwillingness to fight common among iraqi forces trained so far , american troops could be tied down for years , unless elections or other political developments bring the war to an unexpected end i will be explaining this carefully planned process what i call a 'conditions based' rather than a 'calendar based' gradual withdrawal program , in more detail next week , dr allawi told reporters at a ceremony at baghdad airport he was there to accept the first of three c130 military transport planes that iraq is to receive as part of the americanfinanced buildup of iraqi forces the aircraft was the first large plane acquired by the new iraqi air force , which was one of the most powerful in the middle east before it was decimated by bombing attacks in the 1991 persian gulf war dr allawi s remarks were made on a day when attacks underlined , once again , how insurgents have turned wide areas of the country , including baghdad , into what is effectively enemy territory , with an ability to strike almost at will , and to shake off the losses inflicted by american troops the attacks in baghdad on wednesday were aimed at the approaches to the australian embassy and four iraqi security targets , including a police station , an army garrison and a bank where policemen were lining up to receive their monthly pay the attacks , four of them within 90 minutes in the morning rush hour , rattled windows and doors miles away spread across a wide area of the city , they wounded dozens of people , most of them iraqi civilians , in addition to those killed , and served as a reminder of the insurgents' power to spread mayhem across the capital only 11 days before the elections american commanders have sought to prepare public opinion in iraq and abroad for one of the bloodiest chapters in the war so far , saying the escalation of violence promised by the insurgents can be diminished to a degree , but not prevented , by an increasing tempo of american military raids on insurgent groups the american hope is that the voting , for a national assembly and provincial councils , will help turn the tide by drawing a strong turnout among more than 14 million eligible voters , despite the threat of attacks by sunni insurgents on polling stations , candidates and voters , and a boycott of the election being urged by powerful figures in regions where iraq s sunni minority population predominates in almost any foreseeable outcome of the election , the sunnis face the prospect , for the first time in centuries , of ceding political power in baghdad to the country s 60 percent shiite majority wednesday s deadliest attack occurred near a police station and al alahi hospital in the alwiyah district of eastern baghdad the american command said a suicide car bomber killed 18 people , including 5 iraqi policemen , and that 15 other people had been wounded in a car bomb attack on an iraqi military garrison on the site of baghdad s old muthana innercity airfield and another attack at a checkpoint on the perimeter of the heavily secured baghdad international airport , two iraqi soldiers and two security guards were killed the first attack , shortly after 7 am , involved a truck packed with explosives that approached concrete barriers guarding the australian embassy compound in southern baghdad the american command said two iraqis were killed a spokesman for the american command , lt col james hutton of the first cavalry division , said that none of the bombers wednesday had reached their intended targets while any loss of life is tragic , it could have been a lot worse , he said nevertheless , at the worst of the bombing sites there were deep craters , pools of blood , scattered human remains and shattered buildings near the rafidain bank in the etifiyah neighborhood of northcentral baghdad , where a bomb went off as policemen lined up for their salaries , a crumpled child s bicycle lay near the center of the blast people there said a boy had been killed the new united statestrained iraqi army , national guard and police force have had hundreds of men killed in the past year now , american election plans depend on these forces protecting more than 5 , 500 polling places the insurgents' threats to iraqis seen as working for or alongside the americans were demonstrated on wednesday in a video posted on an islamic militant web site of the killing of two iraqi telecommunications technicians the video showed the men , still alive , posed in front of a black banner emblazoned with the name of an islamic terrorist group , ansar al sunna , that has claimed responsibility for many of the most brutal attacks of the war in the past year they were then shown crouching before a stone wall , blindfolded , as their executioner approached from off camera and killed them with pistol shots to the back of the head earlier , the men confessed that they had been sent to the northern cities of mosul and erbil on an american contract to install computer communications for the elections at least 11 other people were killed on wednesday gunmen who attacked the baghdad offices of a major kurdish party , the patriotic union of kurdistan , killed one party member and wouned others , party officials said also in baghdad , another car bomb aimed at an american convoy missed its target but killed four iraqi bystanders in hilla , 60 miles south of baghdad , an iraqi policeman was killed in a car bombing , according to a polish military spokesman much of the remaining violence was in northern iraq , in erbil , dohuk , kirkuk and mosul
boston , july 14 alex rodriguez returned to the yankees' dugout , a safe haven for him in hostile territory , and he wrapped gary sheffield in a quick bear hug he did not smile as he did it this was business for rodriguez , and it was personal , too rodriguez , the yankees' third baseman who memorably folded at the end of last year s american league championship series , came through in a big way on thursday night in the rivalry within he rivalry , rodriguez overwhelmed curt schilling and led the yankees to a stirring 86 victory at fenway park incredible feeling , rodriguez said you 've got a hall of fame pitcher on the mound sheff hit that big double to get the job done right there is very satisfying after a lengthy rehabilitation for his right ankle , schilling was making his first appearance in his new role as the red sox' closer he entered the game with the score tied , 66 , to start the ninth inning the fans cheered wildly as he entered , but sheffield and rodriguez silenced them sheffield , who was 3 for 4 with a homer , led off and bashed a splitter off the green monster for a double rodriguez followed him and crushed a firstpitch splitter to straightaway center it sailed over a platform for television cameras and off the back wall of the park for his 24th home run the pitch i got beat with tonight was the one pitch i was not worried about coming off my rehab , schilling said i felt very , very comfortable with it it felt good in the pen i threw two splits as bad as i can throw on backtoback pitches schilling retired the next three hitters after the homer , but by then it was too late the yankees' closer , mariano rivera , came on for the save in the ninth , striking out all three hitters he faced the victory moved the yankees to a game and a half behind the red sox in the american league east the yankees have won eight of their last nine games , scoring at least seven runs seven times in that span this victory was a comeback the yankees trailed by 40 after one inning to me , this is what we established starting two , two and a half weeks ago , this kind of mentality and this kind of grinding attitude , manager joe torre said i'm glad it s carried over to the second half rodriguez has a history with schilling , who was vocal in criticizing him late last season it helped endear schilling to boston fans , who revile rodriguez , a player who nearly joined the red sox and has often wilted when playing against them rodriguez ignored questions about his public clashes with schilling that s a dumb question , he said , admonishing a reporter but he acknowledged that the homer was his biggest hit of the year rodriguez has learned that as a yankee , some home runs matter much more than others he understands it s a little bit different here as far as when you get the hits , torre said he s always going to put numbers up , because he s so good but what he s done this year , whether it s a single , a sac fly , stealing a base , he s helped us win in so many ways and tonight was his signature type of thing , because he hit a monster home run the easily forgotten star of the game , considering the circumstances , was mike mussina torre told the players before the game about the shoulder injury to the rookie starter chienming wang , the latest blow to the yankees' ravaged rotation it was sobering news on the eve of an 11game road trip with no days off mussina then made matters worse , struggling with hunter wendelstedt s strike zone in the first inning and giving up a threerun homer to trot nixon mussina said he knew he would have to throw 100 pitches , and he used 34 in the first inning but he adjusted to the strike zone and made it through six innings , walking none and allowing just one run from the second inning through the sixth basesempty homers by jason giambi , bernie williams and sheffield off bronson arroyo had helped the yankees tie it , 55 , by the time mussina left he had lasted long enough to allow torre to bypass the unproven middle relievers and give the ball to tanyon sturtze , tom gordon and rivera sturtze allowed a goahead homer to david ortiz in the seventh , but the yankees tied it the next inning on a pinchhit double by ruben sierra gordon \( 33 \) then worked a scoreless eighth for the victory as one of two healthy starters left on the team , mussina recognized how much his effort meant to an important team victory i did n't get a win out of it , and i gave up five runs , mussina said but take out the first inning , and the other five innings were pretty good i was able to hold us right there against a team that talented that hits that well at home i'm going to look back on it and think that may have been one of our bigger games of the year , to come back and win this one inside pitch joe kerrigan , the former boston manager and a pitching coach for the expos , the red sox and the phillies , has joined the yankees as an advance scout general manager brian cashman said kerrigan will analyze video of other teams cashman said he did not hire kerrigan to put him in uniform on the coaching staff reliever felix rodriguez , who has missed more than two months with a knee injury , is not returning to the yankees this weekend , as the team had hoped rodriguez decided he needed more time in the minor leagues , and he will pitch on friday for class aa trenton
cairo , nov 21 for the first time , iraq s political factions on monday collectively called for a timetable for withdrawal of foreign forces , in a moment of consensus that comes as the bush administration battles pressure at home to commit itself to a pullout schedule the announcement , made at the conclusion of a reconciliation conference here backed by the arab league , was a public reaching out by shiites , who now dominate iraq s government , to sunni arabs on the eve of parliamentary elections that have been put on shaky ground by weeks of sectarian violence about 100 sunni , shiite and kurdish leaders , many of whom will run in the election on dec 15 , signed a closing memorandum on monday that demands a withdrawal of foreign troops on a specified timetable , dependent on an immediate national program for rebuilding the security forces , the statement said the iraqi people are looking forward to the day when foreign forces will leave iraq , when its armed and security forces will be rebuilt and when they can enjoy peace and stability and an end to terrorism , it continued the meeting was intended as preparation for a much larger conference in iraq in late february the recommendations made here are to be the starting ground for that meeting in washington , justin higgins , a state department spokesman , said , the united states supports the basic foundation of the conference and we certainly support ongoing discussion among iraq s various political and religious communities but regarding troop withdrawal , he said multinational forces are present in iraq under a mandate from the un security council as president bush has said , the coalition remains committed to helping the iraqi people achieve security and stability as they rebuild their country we will stay as long as it takes to achieve those goals and no longer shiite leaders have long maintained that a pullout should be done according to milestones , and not before iraqi security forces are fully operational the closing statement upheld a sunni demand for a pullout , while preserving aspects of shiite demands , but did not specify when a withdrawal should begin , making it more of a symbolic gesture than a concrete agenda item that could be followed up by the iraqi government the statement , while condemning the wave of terrorism that has engulfed iraq , also broadly acknowledged a general right to resist foreign occupation that was another effort to compromise with sunnis who had sought to legitimize the insurgency the statement condemned terror attacks and religious backing for them , and it demanded the release of innocent prisoners and an investigation into reports of torture almost all the delegates belong to political parties that represent the spectrum of iraqi politics but while sunni parties hinted at their lines of communication to nationalist and tribal insurgents , none would admit any link to militants like abu musab alzarqawi , who has led a wave of suicide bombings through his group al qaeda in mesopotamia the wording was a partial victory for iraq s sunni politicians , who have long demanded that the united states commit to a scheduled pullout while the wording stopped short of condoning armed resistance to the occupation , it broadly acknowledged that national resistance is a legitimate right of all nations this is the first time that something like this is said collectively and in public , muhammad bashar alfaythi , spokesman for the hardline sunni muslim scholars council , said monday , referring to the timetable we managed to convince them of the importance of a timed pullout on monday , iraq s interior minister , bayan jabr , said americanled forces should be able to leave iraq by the end of next year , adding that the oneyear extension of the mandate for the multinational force in iraq by the united nations security council earlier this month could be the last , the associated press reported by midnext year , we will be 75 percent done in building our forces , and by the end of next year it will be fully ready , mr jabr told al jazeera , the panarab news channel the monday statement offered shiite politicians concessions , too , by condemning terrorism against shiites , condemning trumpedup theological arguments for attacks on shiites , and legitimizing the political process that has made shiite leaders the dominant political force in iraq some of the sides that were especially sensitive have opened up with the support of the arab league , said sheik humam hamoudi , a shiite who headed the iraqi constitutiondrafting committee we now clearly see that sunnis have entered politics , and this meeting wo n't change that if this meeting did anything , it was to comfort the arabs and the iraqi sunnis about the whole process , he added the solution first is that sunnis enter politics , then they enter government , then we deliver services to their areas , and then we build a strong government the statement also called for the release of all prisoners who had not been charged or were deemed innocent , and asked arab league members to cancel iraq s debts and assist in building iraqi security forces perhaps the biggest winner of the meeting was the 22member arab league itself , which has entered the political scene in iraq hoping to repeat its success in 1989 , when it brokered an end to lebanon s 15year civil war in a similar conference the arab league s secretary general , amr moussa , said monday that the results of the meeting were a success , but he warned that expectations should remain modest this is a success for the most part , he told reporters we succeeded in 70 percent of the issues we will move step by step , but what happened was very significant the iraqi politicians thrashed out their differences in the most open debate about the country s future yet starting saturday , they wasted no time expressing their complaints and differences , after more than two years of sectarian violence even if there is no agreement , we will have accomplished a conversation , iraq s interim president , jalal talabani , said sunday mr talabani and other senior members of the government refrained from taking a direct part in closeddoor sessions of the threeday conference the meeting ultimately centered on iraq s insurgency and its causes , seeking to goad sunnis to lay down their weapons and join the political system , while forcing shiite politicians to acknowledge sunni grievances on sunday , mr talabani said he was willing to meet iraqi insurgents if they dropped their weapons from the start , the meeting was beset by controversy as many , especially shiites , objected to plans to invite former baath party officials to take part even the statement s release was delayed monday because of lastminute objections by sunni leaders but with some diplomacy , which included shuttling from the general assembly to mr moussa s offices for private talks , a compromise was reached monday evening
kerem atzmona , gaza strip , aug 17 nearly 10 , 000 israeli soldiers and police officers began the forcible evacuation of israeli settlers from gaza on wednesday , carrying some screaming from their homes in scenes that moved a number of the soldiers to tears after months of argument and political maneuvering , the israeli forces moved in strength , but without weapons , to carry out the will of the government to give up part of the territory that israel conquered in the 1967 war and that the palestinians consider a part of their future state the mood was somber and serious , with experienced soldiers and police officers quietly trying to negotiate voluntary departures first with sometimes hysterical settlers , while ignoring their taunts only later in the afternoon did the forces resort to widespread forced evacuations in various settlements , in some cases dragging parents away in front of their frightened children israeli officials spoke wednesday evening of finishing the pullout here by the middle of next week , before moving to dismantle four smaller settlements in the west bank while there was little serious violence in gaza , an israeli settler in the west bank grabbed a gun from a guard near the settlement of shiloh and opened fire on palestinian workers the settler , asher weissgan , 40 , killed four palestinians and wounded one other , and the killings are bound to increase tensions further , with the palestinian militant group hamas vowing revenge one of israel s prime concerns has been the possibility of pulling settlers out under palestinian fire from mortars or rockets the palestinian authority has worked closely , and thus far successfully , with israel to keep the quiet while israeli troops are busy with their own citizens but the killings and the hamas threat have increased the chances of a serious confrontation that could delay the pullout , which is likely to be what the shiloh settler had in mind prime minister ariel sharon condemned the murders as an act of jewish terror the state department condemned the attack and called on the palestinians and the israelis to show restraint the israelis also uncovered what they called an effort by the palestinian militant group islamic jihad to commit a suicide attack during the pullout , and made four arrests , the israeli army said an explosives belt that was to have been used in the attack was discovered in a solarpower water panel in a house in the palestinian enclave of mawassi , which borders the main gush katif southern settlement bloc early on thursday , reuters reported that the israeli army said palestinian militants had fired two mortar bombs at the gadid enclave in gaza there were no injuries or damage the army moved into most of the main gaza settlements , leaving only two of the most militant , kfar darom and netzarim , alone by nightfall , the army said it had cleared the settlements of morag , bedolah , kerem atzmona , ganei tal , and tel katifa gadid , peat sadeh , rafiah yam , shalev , dugit and nisanit were already empty or nearly so action was continuing in the largest gaza settlement , neve dekalim , where several hundred young protesters , most of them there illegally from the west bank , were taking refuge in the main synagogue the tactics were to move slowly , increasing the pressure on residents with a show of force special teams of police officers and soldiers tried negotiation first , and mostly successfully only later were the crowbars unpacked and doors forced open large groups of protesters , like those in neve dekalim s synagogue , were surrounded and then isolated , and the police may deal with them early on thursday , when they are tired and many are asleep but in morag , negotiations with protesters in that militant settlement s synagogue resulted in many men in prayer shawls being carried out by officers the women then agreed to be escorted away by female officers in neve dekalim , dikla cohen , 41 , insisted on being carried out of her house , as were many of her nine children and their friends i feel that today was a pogrom , she said the family locked their large wooden front door and refused to open it to the soldiers , who eventually used a crowbar to pry it open the operation took 90 minutes amid much drama and many insults in morag , adi hendel left her house screaming at the officers you should be ashamed , she said you 're doing a crime that the arabs did n't do you 're puppets in the hands of this dictator sharon ! her husband , eran , in a prayer shawl , pried off the mezuza at the door of his house with a knife , then burst out crying and keening he cut his shirt , to indicate mourning , then fell to the ground , sobbing four policemen picked him up and carried him away a younger soldier , standing on the street as backup , put his hands over his face and wept here in kerem atzmona , one of the most militant and religious of the settlements , more than 1 , 500 police officers and soldiers , some in riot gear , broke through gates and a barricade to surround fewer than 20 house trailers few left voluntarily , and many houses had to be broken into , and their inhabitants carried away still , most of those carried screaming onto buses also had their bags packed in one house , a settler who had thrown eggs at soldiers and journalists was one of the last to go his door had a poster from the nazi era , implying that israel was making gaza a jewishfree zone he wore an orange star of david on his shirt , marked jude , german for jew when his wife finally agreed to leave the house , all her children left with their arms up , screaming in unison , all wearing an orange star , a piece of theater for the television cameras the police commissioner , moshe karadi , was there , and he said the day was hard on his officers and on the soldiers if you asked the police , maybe half would support the settlers , but we do n't ask them , he said our government has decided , and we have to do this task with the utmost sensitivity , but also with a clear and obvious will a police spokesman said 13 members of the security forces were wounded in clashes with settlers and their supporters , including nine soldiers , but none seriously in netivot , outside gaza , a woman set herself on fire to protest the pullout and was in serious condition , and 2 , 000 other israelis protested outside mr sharon s farm near sederot speaking to reporters in jerusalem , mr sharon praised the settlers and the security forces when i see the families with tears in their eyes and soldiers and police with tears running down their cheeks , too , as they help them pack their possessions and the children s toys , you ca n't watch it without i find myself crying , too i'm proud that our army and police are capable of displaying such great sensitivity alongside the effort to fulfill all the instructions they have been given , he said the army s deputy chief of staff , maj gen moshe kaplinski , also came here to kerem atzmona to oversee the difficult operation , hoping to learn lessons for those to come , like kfar darom and netzarim it s very complicated operationally and emotionally , he said asked about the emotional effect on soldiers , he said simply , you can understand why but the first day had gone pretty well , he said , raising hopes of finishing this evacuation quickly but for the military to then destroy the houses of the settlers , and pull out its own equipment , will take several more weeks , he said doron kotler , the head of operations for the israeli ambulance service , magen david adom , said he was impressed by the unusual patience shown by the police and soldiers , and the silence there s a lot of sorrow , he said there s a kind of sadness , and all the faces are serious the quiet and the silence here amazes me
american colleges and universities do such a poor job of training the nation s future teachers and school administrators that 9 of every 10 principals consider the graduates unprepared for what awaits them in the classroom , a new survey has found nearly half the elementary and secondaryschool principals surveyed said the curriculums at schools of education , whether graduate or undergraduate , lacked academic rigor and were outdated , at times using materials decades older than the children whom teachers are now instructing beyond that , more than 80 percent of principals said the education schools were too detached from what went on at local elementary and high schools , a factor that made for a rift between educational theory and practice i thought there were problems in the field , said arthur e levine , president of teachers college at columbia university , who is to release the findings in a report today but i did n't realize the depth of the problems in the report , dr levine who when interviewed described the program at his own school as strong but absolutely not ideal said he and other experts who worked on the study had focused their efforts on finding education schools capable of producing excellent principals , superintendents and other administrators they found none in the entire country much of the problem , the report said , stems from what dr levine called the consumer mentality dominating the nation s education schools all states , and nearly all public school districts within them , award higher salaries to teachers who take additional courses and earn advanced degrees one result of this has been an army of unmotivated educators looking for extra credits in the easiest ways possible during their off hours , the report said the universities , in turn , capitalize on this demand by viewing their education schools as cash cows , setting low admissions standards and offering quickie degrees instead of investing in a quality curriculum , the report said in fact , while criticism has often focused on the questionable academic qualifications of many teachers , the report found that school administrators typically had substantially lower scores on the graduate record examination than the teachers they supervise principals and superintendents need to be better trained than ever , the report contends , a necessity that puts added pressure on already faltering education schools federal law is demanding that students make measurable academic progress where local districts once set the bar , more states have adopted uniform exit exams that students must pass in order to graduate and the population itself is changing , with more immigrants whose english is limited but others contend that these same conditions are precisely why education schools cannot be held wholly responsible for the failures of their graduates in the era of federal demands for quick and consistent testbased results from even the most troubled districts , some defenders argue that education schools have little power to set the tone of what goes on in the nation s classrooms , and therefore are often inappropriately blamed for it we 've got to blame someone , so we blame the education schools easy target , said theodore r sizer , former dean of the harvard graduate school of education though these schools are far from exemplary , we 're asked to prepare people to go out into a field where their chances of survival are limited it s like training kamikaze pilots
frankfurt , july 7 markets across europe were thrown into turmoil on thursday morning , with stocks and currencies plunging after the deadly rushhour explosions in london but they recouped much of their losses by day s end , as the talk of another terrorist attack took on a numbing familiarity the trading pattern was similar in new york , where images of bloodied commuters and hastily evacuated office buildings are not new all three major american stock gauges even managed to wind up slightly higher i hate to sound cold hearted , but investors , to a large extent , have become immune to terrorist attacks , said hugh johnson , chief investment officer at johnson illington advisors in albany the british pound and the dollar fell sharply right after the explosions , as traders dumped both for the perceived safety of the euro and the swiss franc trading floors in london , some ringing with the sounds of passing sirens , were swept by panic selling in the morning before calming down by lunchtime oil prices also swooned , reflecting fear that a fresh terrorist strike in europe could dampen economic growth but the dollar rebounded by the afternoon in new york and was little changed against the euro and the yen after dropping almost 4 percent on the new york mercantile exchange , oil recovered much of its ground in afternoon trading , falling 55 cents , or 09 percent , to 6073 a barrel the pound , however , wound up down 08 percent against the dollar the ftse 100share index tumbled by 207 points , or 4 percent , shortly after trading began , as word of the explosions spread by the close of trading , it was down only 14 percent shares of airlines , travelrelated companies and insurers were the hardest hit the london stock exchange , which is near st paul s cathedral , was not affected by the explosion at liverpool street station , several blocks northeast but the swiss bank ubs evacuated its offices at 100 liverpool street , near the station in new york , the standard poor s 500stock index rose 293 points , or 03 percent , to 1 , 19787 , after falling 1 percent earlier in the day even travel stocks rebounded after sharp declines in the morning a bloomberg index of 31 airline , hotel and other travel stocks ended the day up 03 percent after falling as much as 19 percent the yield on the benchmark 10year treasury note fell sharply , to 393 percent , in overnight trading in new york , attesting to a sudden surge of investors into the haven of the government bond market but by late thursday in new york , the yield was back to 406 percent , down just a tick from 407 percent wednesday , as the immediate explosion jitters dissipated this is a reminder that geopolitical risk is still alive in the world , said lorenzo codogno , cohead of european economics at bank of america in london confidence is an issue , but it s too much to say that the whole global economy will slow down because of this single event if history is any guide , the economic fallout will be fleeting , as it was after the train bombings in madrid last year even the devastating attacks in september 2001 were only a temporary setback for the american economy , which was climbing out of a recession at the time the psychological shock of the bombings could dent the confidence of british consumers , economists say , but that would only add to the continuing slowdown in consumer spending in britain these events do not have as longlasting an effect as markets , with their kneejerk reaction , would suggest , said thomas mayer , the chief european economist at deutsche bank in london the madrid and london bombings are of the sort we have seen in the past while the bombings all but paralyzed one of the world s leading financial centers and disrupted a meeting of the leaders of the group of 8 industrial nations in scotland the death toll was lower than the attacks in madrid or new york and washington as terrible as it is , it s nowhere near the extent of 9 11 , said steve massocca , the head of trading at pacific growth equities , an investment bank in san francisco i think , ultimately , it s going to have next to no effect on the financial markets in a note to clients , economists at goldman sachs said three things would have to happen for the attacks to jeopardize financial markets terrorists would have to hit more targets consumers would have to cut their spending significantly and central banks like the federal reserve and the bank of england would have to make major policy changes the bank of england and the european central bank , which were both meeting thursday as the news broke , left interest rates unchanged at 475 percent and 2 percent , respectively jeanclaude trichet , the president of the european central bank , spoke by phone with mervyn a king , the governor of the bank of england and alan greenspan , the chairman of the federal reserve he said the bankers were satisfied that the markets were functioning properly we are alert , we are vigilant , we monitor all developments , mr trichet said at a news conference in frankfurt after the september 2001 attacks , the world s major central banks pumped money into the financial system to stabilize it the attacks also temporarily incapacitated new york s financial markets , disrupting payment and settlement procedures none of which occurred in london 9 11 was very , very unusual , mr mayer said it was the first of these attacks , and it directly hit the financial sector still , the center for economics and business research , an economics research firm in london , predicted that the bank of england might convene an emergency session to discuss a cut in rates if the impact on the ftse and , more importantly , the pound worsens , the bank may consider cutting rates so as to prevent additional negative pressure upon the uk s consumer slowdown , it said in a note in the united states , the full impact of the attacks on consumer confidence will be evaluated in the weeks leading up to the next federal reserve policymaking meeting on aug 9 the federal reserve raised shortterm rates on june 30 , and indicated that it was inclined to continue raising them the good news here is the next fomc meeting is a long way away , and there s a lot of opportunity for gathering information , said raymond w stone , an economist at stone mccarthy research associates in princeton , nj predictably , the selloff hit shares of airlines , tourism and travel companies , and insurers the hardest british airways lufthansa hilton hotels munich re , the big german reinsurance company and tui , a german tourist operator , all fell sharply , before recovering somewhat shares of british airways suffered their steepest decline since sept 20 , 2001 , the week after the american attacks , falling as much as 95 percent by late afternoon , they were down 42 percent some companies rushed to reassure the market tui , for example , said it did not expect a drop in its bookings for london , citing the unwavering response of travelers after the madrid bombings swiss re , the world s secondlargest reinsurance company , said it had reduced its exposure to terrorist incidents , though it did not comment on the size of potential claims in britain , insurers take part in a pool that covers damage from terrorist attacks , limiting their individual exposure while fears of terrorism might depress air travel temporarily , analysts said , the airlines are better prepared to deal with it than in 2001 , having gone through painful costcutting exercises for all the geopolitical impact of this , the markets are beginning to expect that it wo n't affect the profits of most companies , except possibly airlines , travelbased stocks , and insurers that have major exposure , said nick sloane , a trader in frankfurt with the swedish bank seb analysts said the rebound in the price of oil during the day reflected the fact that investors concluded that the london bombings were not likely to disrupt the global economy or the demand for oil , which means oil could swiftly return to record levels it will have a fairly fleeting effect , said antoine halff , the director of energy at the eurasia group , a political risk consultancy in new york lately , supply issues have taken the lead in driving the market for workers in the city , as london s financial district is known , the biggest worry was how to get home mr mayer of deutsche bank said he planned to hike to waterloo station and hope the suburban trains were running if not , he said , he might end up sleeping in his office
redwood city , calif like many employees at google , charlie ayers profited handsomely when the company went public in august 2004 selling some of his google shares enabled him to quit his job and follow other passions it is a familiar silicon valley success story but mr ayers , 39 , got his start at google in an unusual place the company cafeteria chef charlie , as he was known around the company s mountain view , calif , headquarters , ran the cafeteria for six years he served free breakfast , lunch and dinner to employees and honed his recipes on an enthusiastic , young , multinational work force that he said helped him understand a new generation of california diners i did most of my research on them , he said now mr ayers is banking on that experience , with financial backing from his rich former colleagues , for his next venture a healthconscious and sustainably farmed \( grassfed beef , for one \) cafe he hopes to open near stanford university in palo alto , calif , next summer mr ayers was the 56th employee at google when he arrived in 1999 by the time he left the company in may 2005 , he oversaw a kitchen staff of 135 , serving 4 , 000 meals a day and organizing parties and events for the growing google work force \( the company expects to replace him with two executive chefs \) he developed a following there , and as his reputation spread through silicon valley , outsiders angled their google friends for invitations to eat at the company s campus mr ayers credited the founders of google , larry page and sergey brin , with giving him a generous budget so he could offer highquality , environmentally friendly \( think biodegradable flatware \) and largely organic meals intended to keep workers happy and fueled , without having to leave work to eat in turn , mr ayers said , he took great pleasure in expanding the employees' tastes i 'd tell them , 'look , you 're getting paid to come to work and try this , and the food is free , ' he said they were from all over the world , and i had to cook for these guys as well as their mothers did often , mr ayers got help from the homesick young engineers who requested dishes from their native countries this one indian engineer named anarod wanted to show me how to make a certain spinach dish , but he only knew how to make it for four people , he said i told him 'you 're the engineer you do the math ' even before mr ayers realized that his ambition was to go into business for himself , he said he was always conscious of the relationships he was building with his cafeteria patrons and the suppliers and vendors , which he plans to use as crucial help getting his venture off the ground a master chef in rhode island told him years ago that networking was the most important thing in the restaurant business , mr ayers recalled he said , 'you never know when that milkman is going to own his own dairy and be in the position to give you a price break ' mr ayers has worked at expensive restaurants and middlebrow chains , cooked privately for families and ran the prepared foods department at a whole foods market but it is his google friends lawyers , business development professionals , engineers and financial experts that he expects to draw on most of all born in chicago and raised in brooklyn , ny , mr ayers had a varied r sum even before he started cooking for google his love of music led to behindthescenes cooking jobs at various music festivals , and google says on its web site that mr ayers formerly cooked for members of the grateful dead \( it was after jerry garcia s death , when the band dissolved , mr ayers said \) dressed in flipflops and cargo shorts , mr ayers recently sat in the coffee bar of a whole foods market near his home in redwood city here , spinning his vision for his new restaurant , called calafia \( based on a mexican myth from which the state of california draws its name \) he said his inspiration came in equal parts from whole foods , mcdonald s and starbucks he is looking for about 8 , 000 square feet of space in highpriced downtown palo alto , where other restaurants include wolfgang puck s spago and the cheesecake factory mr ayers has invested 100 , 000 of his own money for startup costs , and expects to raise 4 million from some former google employees and private equity investment groups another friend , a former doctor , is helping him write the business plan everything is handshakes at this point , mr ayers said of the possible financial arrangements my lawyer is looking at the paperwork and trying to figure out who s going to give me the best deal and allow me to have the most control none of the wouldbe financial backers were willing to be identified in print the venture is flavored with california dogood environmentalism and silicon valley technological gimmicks mr ayers s plans include the biodegradable flatware \( tested at google \) , touchscreen video kiosks to teach children about sustainable agriculture and a plexiglass compost bin that will demonstrate , over time , the virtues of biodegradable packaging patrons will be able to order by touchscreen , and wireless internet access will be available mr ayers even intends to offer discounts to customers for future orders by pedaling stationary bicycles to help power the restaurant though he does n't expect the pedal power to make any noticeable difference in the restaurant s utility bill , he hopes it will help send a message about alternative energy and it might be fun i think it will be popular with those spinningclass people , he said , referring to the health club exercise classes the menu will be a mix of salads , sandwiches , wraps and soups , with heavy pacific rim and latino accents it will include everything from burgers to mango lassis \( yogurt smoothies \) a lunch might be a wholewheat tortilla wrap with tahinilemon tuna salad , cabbage , fresh sprouts , carrot , toasted pine nuts and mint for about 495 a side of carrotalmond salad , flavored with cumin , ricewine vinegar , red currants and green onions , might cost 295 mr ayers said part of his motivation came from his struggle to teach his 8yearold son good eating habits he 'd eat pizza or fast food every day of the week if we let him , mr ayers said i was putting on all this weight from eating with him he wanted to eat at mcdonald s because he wanted those toys , and i realized i was being held hostage by disney and pixar mr ayers said he hoped calafia will help parents feed their children wholesome fare that is affordable people who are highly educated want to eat better , and they want to teach their kids to eat better , he said i want to help them , and i want to make it fun
greenburgh , ny , dec 31 stephon marbury strolled off the knicks' practice floor friday with a scowl , as if a spoonful of codliver oil was waiting for him at the door not long into an interview , the subject had turned to another point guard jason kidd kidd is not just any other point guard , but the gold standard among active players marbury appears convinced of his own standing among nba point guards , but he also seems to be tormented enough by kidd to become testy and boastful when he is mentioned i know i'm the best point guard in the nba marbury said i do n't need anybody else to tell me that marbury and the knicks \( 1613 \) play kidd and the nets \( 1018 \) on saturday at madison square garden the nets have been fortified by the acquisition of vince carter , but the eve of any knicksnets game usually dredges up comparisons between marbury and kidd me and jason kidd are two different players , marbury said we do n't play anything alike we play totally different it does not seem to matter the knicks won their last game against kidd and the nets , 8779 , on dec 14 at the meadowlands , but over the years , kidd has taken his team much further into the playoffs marbury , a coney island native and a former nets point guard , desperately wants to win an nba championship he is leading the knicks in scoring , with a 202 average , and he is averaging an assist for every four and a half minutes he plays , about the same pace as kidd , who has missed all but 12 games this season while recuperating from offseason knee surgery because kidd has taken the nets to two nba finals , his style seems to have been validated even the knicks' recent victory over the nets had an asterisk kidd played only 21 minutes when told what marbury had said about himself on friday , richard jefferson of the nets said sarcastically i agree with him steve nash , dwyane wade none of those guys have really done anything this season jefferson then turned serious and added i think , right now , that him , steve nash and dwyane wade , right now , are playing at an extremely high level but jason kidd is still getting his legs under him marbury was less interested in talking about kidd than he was in talking about the knicks , who have won three games in a row they have not lost since shooting guard jamal crawford sustained a toe injury dec 22 that will keep him out for at least a couple more weeks crawford s injury , in addition to a hamstring injury that has caused the valuable reserve penny hardaway to miss 14 games , have forced the knicks to focus inward , instead of on their opponents the knicks are playing comfortably together the team kind of pulled together and said , 'hey , we 've got to do it ourselves , ' hardaway said everyone s just rallied around each other and did what we had to do to win hardaway practiced friday , and coach lenny wilkens said he would decide saturday morning if hardaway could play against the nets but wilkens said that the rotation would be hard to crack the knicks left standing are taking on new roles and talking on defense in a way that pleases wilkens allan houston , who usually speaks in a soft , smooth baritone , is identifying opponents' offensive sets with a holler , so the knicks can be in the right position any time you can stop people , you always have a chance , houston said wilkens said that marbury , who has scored 66 points in the knicks' last two games , is playing better defensively marbury s focus seems to be on the grittier parts of the game , even though a group of reporters tried friday to tug it elsewhere as long as i'm playing come april for the championship , marbury said , referring to the playoffs , that s the most important thing
carlos beltran , the most desirable free agent on the market , will become a member of the mets in the biggest signing of the offseason an official with a national league team who was briefed on the negotiations said beltran and the mets agreed in principle to a sevenyear , 119 million contract early yesterday the deal is contingent on beltran s passing a physical today and on an accord on the financial parameters of the contract that means the mets are agonizingly close to being much more relevant as a team they are hoping that beltran , who was seemingly destined to play center field for the yankees , then was supposedly returning to the houston astros , can help them revive a stagnant organization , and they are dreaming about eventually challenging the yankees for supremacy in new york by being persistent and offering the most money , general manager omar minaya persuaded beltran to spend the next seven summers chasing fly balls in flushing and playing in the shadow of the yankees the mets are hoping beltran can do something about that shadow beltran does everything well he can run , hit , hit for power , throw and field in signing beltran and pedro mart nez , the premier freeagent pitcher on the market , the mets have invested 172 million in a makeover that minaya who has made a point of appealing to hispanic players was able to persuade each player to relocate to a team that has averaged 71 victories in the last three seasons cannot be viewed as anything but baseball s biggest coup of the offseason in less than a month , the mets have added two allstar players and made the kind of splashy moves usually associated with george steinbrenner , the principal owner of the yankees steinbrenner had some interest in beltran , but almost none in mart nez the mets , in need of star power because they are planning to start their own cable network in 2006 , were consumed with signing each player and were not scared off by their competition who will be next \? yesterday , beltran called carlos delgado , the freeagent first baseman the mets are still interested in beltran is a friend of delgado s and a fellow puerto rican the mets need a first baseman and have continued their conversations with david sloane , delgado s agent to secure beltran , the mets outlasted houston in nailbiting negotiations scott boras , beltran s agent , was talking with the astros up until their midnight deadline on saturday the astros , who faced the deadline because beltran had declined salary arbitration , offered beltran a sevenyear , 108 million deal but the astros would not agree to a full notrade clause , hurting their chances because there is no state income tax in texas , the mets' offer to beltran was only marginally better than houston s but the mets included a blanket notrade clause that helped seal the deal beltran s contract will also include an 11 million signing bonus , and the sides are discussing the amount of money that will be deferred the agreement may end up being for slightly less than 119 million we 're still having dialogue , minaya said that s all i can say only 27 , the switchhitting beltran will slide neatly into the third spot in the lineup and is expected to replace the fading mike piazza , who is 36 , as the foundation of the franchise beltran batted 267 with 38 homers , 104 runs batted in and 42 stolen bases with the astros and the kansas city royals last season he solidified his status as a multitalented player and set the stage for the fattening of his bank account during the playoffs , batting 435 with 8 homers , 14 rbi and 6 stolen bases in 12 games he helped the astros come within a game of making their first world series but the only time beltran has hit more than 30 homers was this past season , and his career batting average is a modest 284 before boras began negotiations , he told some associates that he thought beltran could end up playing for the yankees although the yankees monitored the negotiations , they never made an offer boras initiated contact with the yankees , but they told him they were not enthused about adding a 17 million player to a payroll that is already up to about 200 million and incurring additional luxury tax payments at one point saturday night , boras contacted the yankees and proposed a sixyear , 100 million contract for beltran , a lesser offer than the one tendered by the mets once again , the yankees resisted the mets were understandably worried about the yankees hovering over the beltran discussions , and that is one reason minaya pushed to reach an agreement in principle yesterday the mets did not want to leave any opportunity for the yankees to crash their offseason party when the mets added mart nez , they said he was a player whose value transcended how many games he would win beltran told the mets that he took them more seriously as a suitor because they signed mart nez whether the presence of mart nez and beltran can help deliver delgado is the next question sloane said friday that several teams were serious about signing delgado but the mets clearly made themselves more attractive in many ways by adding beltran , their new marquee player , and , they hope , their new savior inside pitch omar minaya , the mets' general manager , and his wife , rachel , will have dinner with president bush and a small group at the white house tonight minaya was with the texas rangers' scouting department when the president owned the team

new york state officials seized control of the brooklyn manor adult home yesterday , saying that the mentally ill residents who live there were in imminent danger because of abuses on the part of the management the move came less than a month after a fire in the home left one resident dead and raised renewed concern about the overall management of brooklyn manor , which is meant to offer a refuge for mentally ill people who have no other place to go the residents of the 216bed home , at 2830 pitkin avenue in east new york , are among the city s most vulnerable , suffering from disorders ranging from drug and alcohol addiction to severe mental illness state inspectors have documented abuses at the home since the early 1990 s the fire department joined the new york state department of health , which oversees the home , in the latest investigation , which found that there was no effective evacuation plan inspectors found that 17 residents who needed assistance , including amputees , were not helped by the staff a deaf man was left in his room and given no warning during the fire , and staff members fled the building before many residents did , according to inspectors based on what we have learned from our investigation and from fdny s findings , it is unimaginable to think what would have happened had this fire occurred during the night instead of during a daytime meal when most residents were on the main floor , said dr antonia c novello , the state health commissioner the state does not plan to shut the home down , in part because it is so hard to find replacement homes willing to take residents these patients have nowhere else and they consider this their home , dr novello said , and we are not going to do anything to jeopardize that instead , the state has taken control of brooklyn manor , replacing the current operator and bringing in an administrator from the new york hospital medical center of queens to run the home it ordered the immediate suspension of brooklyn manor s operating certificate and barred the home s current owner from entering the premises all new admissions have been suspended the state also froze the home s bank accounts and will turn over those funds to the temporary operator jeffrey j sherrin , a lawyer who represents brooklyn manor and other adult homes , said the state s action was out of line they tried and got it done secretly because they knew they ca n't do it in open court , he said mr sherrin was fielding calls yesterday from staff members at brooklyn manor , who became aware of the action about 6 pm when the police showed up to escort health workers into the home this is not how the state of new york is supposed to operate , mr sherrin said , adding that the move would be challenged in court if the state is successful , it could end a saga that has dragged on for more than decade as early as 1991 , state investigators uncovered evidence that the operator of the home , benito fernandez , then the husband of state senator nellie santiago , took more than 45 , 000 in retirement benefits from a resident who had entrusted the money to the home over the years , investigations detailed more abuses medical evaluations were improperly conducted , and residents were allowed into the home when they should have been sent elsewhere because of the severity of their illness over a sixmonth period in 2004 , state health workers went to the home 39 times to respond to complaints the health department had been stymied from taking action by legal challenges but dr novello said the fire was the last straw on may 8 , charles dunbar , 51 , burned to death after setting his room ablaze with a cigarette while the fire was ruled accidental , an investigation found many problems in the response of staff members in addition to the inadequate evacuation effort , inspectors found that fire extinguishers in the building had not been checked since 2004 , and that those in the kitchen had not been inspected since 2003 the sprinkler system had not been checked in the last 12 months they also found that a staff member shut off the alarm almost immediately after it started ringing mr sherrin said he had not seen the details of the investigation but was confident that none of the allegations were true he made available a letter he had sent to the department about the success of a fire drill conducted at brooklyn manor on may 16 , after the deadly fire despite the critical findings , dr novello could not be sure the state would be successful after court challenges that is the 64 , 000 question , she said
to the editor president bush s proposed budget is a blatant example of his disdain for the poor and middle class he proposes cuts in medicare , amtrak and programs for veterans , students , the police and others that mostly benefit the poor and middle classes but the president adamantly defends all the tax cuts for the rich there is no equal sharing in this one ! none of these proposed cuts would need to be discussed if the tax cuts for the top 10 percent were rescinded after afghanistan and iraq , is class warfare mr bush s third war \? frank zaski franklin , mich , feb 8 , 2005
science magazine has seen its share of controversies over the years papers questioned and withdrawn and occasional accusations of scientific fraud but none of those incidents , says science s executive editor , monica m bradford , can compare to the turmoil that has been shaking the magazine for the last month it involves a dazzling paper in which south korean scientists announced not only that they had produced cloned human embryos and extracted their stem cells but that they had done so with such efficiency that it seemed almost easy the publication of that paper , celebrated by science with great fanfare on may 19 , has now turned into a debacle and the mood in science s editorial offices on the 10th floor of a gray marble office building in washington has gone from elation to distress and exhaustion on friday , science announced that that paper was in the process of being withdrawn in the meantime , investigations continue into what actually happened at the south korean research labs and where the truth lies this has become so dramatic , ms bradford said , saying she could think of no precedent at the journal in a sense it has been unlike anything else for science , the chain of events began on tuesday , march 15 , when the manuscript arrived by email it was clearly a highprofile paper , and its lead author , hwang woo suk of seoul national university , was known at the journal he had published a previous paper in science , on feb 12 , 2004 , announcing that he had , with great difficulty , cloned a human embryo and extracted stem cells still , science put this latest paper from dr hwang s lab through the same process it put the nearly 12 , 000 other papers received this year , ms bradford said papers are sent to one or two outside experts on the journal s board of reviewing editors who advise on whether they are appropriate for science magazine seventy percent of submitted papers are rejected the others are sent to at least two additional scientists for indepth review the reviewers comment on the paper and also assess its quality , checking off boxes ranging from reject to publish without delay about 25 percent of those reviewed end up being published but the reviewers are not the science police , ms bradford and outside scientists emphasized we work on the assumption that the data are real , ms bradford said the question is , do the data support the conclusions \? on may 12 , after having passed scrutiny by three outside reviewers , dr hwang s paper was accepted for publication , faster than the journal s average time from submission to acceptance , which is about three months when the paper appeared may 19 , it met with enormous acclaim dr hwang traveled the world lecturing on his work and scientists trekked to south korea to visit the lab and see how the feat was accomplished the first hints that something might not be right came in november by dec 9 , ms bradford and her colleagues katrina l kelner , the deputy editor , who has an office next door another editor , working from another city , whom ms bradford would not identify and the editor in chief , donald kennedy , who is at stanford were trying to get some answers as the weeks passed , dr hwang , was hospitalized for stress but insisted that his group had really cloned human embryos and created 11 lines of stem cells , as his paper reported but one of his coauthors , dr roh sung il , said the data were fraudulent one question was whether photographs , described in the paper as being stem cells derived from cloned human embryos , were frauds dr roh said they were actually from a large computer file of stem cells and not derived from cloning experiments another question involved the veracity of the dna fingerprints in the science paper that were used to show that a stem cell was genetically identical to a person who provided cells for cloning we sent a series of questions to the authors , ms bradford said how did this high resolution image get put together \? look at all your images go through your data the same with the dna fingerprinting go through your data what are your answers \? but despite repeated calls and email messages to south korea , ms bradford said thursday , we have n't gotten any answers yet all along , science s news department , a group of journalists at the magazine , was kept separate from the editorial investigation colin norman , science s news editor , said the editors on the editorial side tell us when something is going to be released to the press , but not much more in fact , he said , i only know what i'm reading in the press at the moment , which is pretty amazing the story continues , with its twists and turns on dec 12 , the one american author on the paper , gerald schatten of the university of pittsburgh , asked that his name be taken off and his university began an inquiry on friday , dr schatten and dr hwang told science they wished to retract the paper but dr hwang also held a news conference on friday in which he insisted that the data were correct and dr schatten , in a telephone interview on wednesday , did not really distance himself from dr hwang , whom he had previously introduced as his best friend , or from the results i still remain totally optimistic and convinced about all of this , dr schatten said i'm optimistic that at some point , i hope sooner than later , this is brought to a satisfactory conclusion that i think will be constructive for everyone including the man i still think of as my best friend dr kennedy said in news conference by telephone on friday afternoon , as of now we ca n't reach any conclusions with respect to misconduct issues he also said that as of now the journal s editors did not know the exact reasons that dr schatten and dr hwang asked that the paper be withdrawn if the paper is withdrawn , dr kennedy said , there will have to be a retraction statement , and it will have to contain more than we now know about the authors' reasons for retracting it he added , i ca n't state chapter and verse , but it is more than we have gotten now dr hwang and dr schatten were the only 2 of the paper s 25 authors who asked that it be retracted , dr kennedy said ordinarily , science requires each one of a paper s authors to sign a statement agreeing to a retraction ms bradford said that despite quite a bit of effort , she and her colleagues had been unable to get even email addresses for all of the authors but dr kennedy said dr hwang was trying to reach the members of his group meanwhile , stem cell scientists and ethicists continue to follow the story with what laurie zoloth , an ethicist at northwestern university , describes as a kind of collective mesmerized despair , and some troubling questions what we do not understand is how one person could have hoaxed all 24 of the collaborators on the papers all of whom seemed eager to claim the work as 'our' work at the time , dr zoloth said did we see only what we yearned to see \?
jerusalem , feb 27 as israelis buried their dead from a suicide bombing , prime minister ariel sharon warned palestinian leaders on sunday that there would be no further moves toward peace unless they take strong action to eliminate militant groups behind such attacks mr sharon also accused syria of playing host to militant palestinians from islamic jihad , the group that took responsibility for the bombing on friday of the stage club on tel aviv s palmlined beachfront four israelis died in the blast one of them a 28yearold woman celebrating her coming wedding and 49 more were wounded using harsher language than other israeli officials in the immediate aftermath of the attack , mr sharon warned that it is clear that if palestinians do not begin to take vigorous action against terrorism , israel will be compelled to step up military activity that is designed to protect the lives of israeli citizens he did not say where such military action might take place islamic jihad has members in lebanon and syria as well as in palestinians areas syria denied knowledge of the attack and said it supported the tentative peace moves between israelis and palestinians , which mr sharon depicted in his comments on sunday as being suspended syria is under growing international scrutiny after the assassination in beirut on feb 14 of rafik hariri , the former lebanese prime minister the united states is supporting demands for syria to withdraw its troops from lebanon in a move widely seen as an attempt to mollify the united states , syrian officials in damascus confirmed monday that they had handed over to the iraqi authorities a group of officials from the former iraqi government of saddam hussein , including mr hussein s halfbrother the bombing in tel aviv was the first lethal attack inside israel since november it broke a truce between israelis and palestinians declared on feb 8 , and left the palestinian president , mahmoud abbas , under strong pressure to demonstrate his ability to rein in militants mr sharon also said , while the state of israel is interested in advancing towards a settlement with the palestinians , there will be no diplomatic progress , none at all , until the palestinians take strong action to eliminate the terrorist organizations and their infrastructures in areas they control the attack came as clubgoers formed a line outside the stage club according to israeli news reports , one of the dead , yael orbach , 28 , had been with her fianc , ofir gonen , handing out wedding invitations to members of his military reserve unit who were celebrating a birthday ms orbach died and mr gonen was wounded when a palestinian suicide bomber , identified as abdullah badran , 21 , blew himself up next to the crowd at her funeral on sunday in kfar saba , her father , yisrael orbach , stood over her open grave and vowed personal vengeance for her death if the government failed to exact it if they do not avenge the blood of this righteous one , i will avenge her blood , mr orbach said , in remarks broadcast on the israeli radio until today , there has been nothing like this where someone or a family has avenged the blood of another in this country , as i will avenge the blood of this righteous one senior israeli officials on sunday sharply criticized syria , which has allowed islamic jihad leaders to live in damascus for many years , although syria maintains that the organization s office there is closed a syrian foreign ministry statement said , referring to islamic jihad , syria has no relation with the tel aviv operation , and the office of this movement is closed in syria but mr sharon declared the terrorist attack was perpetrated by members of islamic jihad the orders came from islamic jihad elements in syria even though we know this for a certainty , the fact is not enough to absolve the palestinian authority of its responsibility for the departure of the terrorist and of its obligation to act against his partners in the crime the immediate test for the palestinian authority will be in vigorous action against islamic jihad members , mr sharon declared at the same time , the attack seemed to have provoked unusual discord within islamic jihad on saturday , its military wing took responsibility for the bombing , while its political leaders in gaza still insisted sunday that the group had not been involved in the west bank , the palestinian prime minister , ahmed qurei , said the palestinian authorities would still prefer to maintain the reconciliation sealed when mr sharon and mr abbas met in the egyptian resort of sharm el sheik on feb 8 if israel wants to cut off contacts with the palestinians , it will be its own decision , and we will not cry , mr qurei told reporters in ramallah but we say that there is an opportunity begun in sharm el sheik , and we want to develop this effort mr sharon s demands leave mr abbas , the palestinian leader , in a delicate and potentially dangerous position , caught between israeli calls for action against militant factions and palestinian demands for tangible evidence that israel is prepared to make concessions in the interests of peace according to the israeli radio , defense minister shaul mofaz said that after the bombing on friday , israel gave the palestinian authorities a list of suspects , particularly islamic jihad members , and expected the palestinians to arrest them he also said no islamic jihad members would be freed in a planned release of an additional 400 palestinian prisoners mr mofaz said senior israeli security officials would brief their counterparts from the united states , france and britain on israel s insistence that syria was involved in the bombing other israelis suggested that the restriction on the planned prisoner release might be more sweeping justice minister tsipi livni said the release was being reconsidered , according to the israeli radio mr abbas , who is regarded as a pragmatist , was elected last month to succeed yasir arafat , who died in november since his election , he and mr sharon have conducted a cautious reconciliation , culminating last week in israel s release of 500 palestinian prisoners mr abbas has also sought to persuade some militant palestinian factions to suspend attacks , but in a message on saturday on its web site , islamic jihad accused israel of violating the truce and threatened further violence as long as the other side is not committed , there will be a response from our side , an islamic jihad official identified only as abu tarek said israel has not attacked syria since october 2003 in that instance , israeli warplanes bombed what israel said was an islamic jihad base outside damascus after a palestinian suicide bomber from the group killed 21 people
washington , dec 19 the house of representatives moved early monday to provide millions of households with coupons to buy equipment to keep their television sets working after broadcasters switch from analog to digital signals but consumer groups warned that the new law would still impose significant costs on viewers the house measure , including a mandate to complete the transition to digital television by early 2009 , was included in budget legislation approved shortly before sunrise by a vote of 212 to 206 the provisions , awaiting senate approval , are of enormous importance to the television , cable and wireless telephone industries as part of the transition , the legislation would provide each household with up to two coupons worth 40 each for converter boxes to attach to analog television sets so they are not obsolete once broadcasters surrender their analog licenses on feb 17 , 2009 , as the new law would require not coincidentally , the date was selected to fall two weeks after the super bowl and a month before the widely watched national collegiate athletic association basketball tournament supporters of the legislation said it would allow enough time for a smooth transition and would raise billions of dollars for the treasury from the sale of analog spectrum licenses that will have to be surrendered by the broadcasters and are being sought by wireless telephone and broadband providers the legislation would also set up a 1 billion program for emergency workers to upgrade their communications systems a great technical revolution that has been in the making for years will finally be complete , said representative joe l barton , republican of texas , who heads the energy and commerce committee we will have three years to prepare for the transition that is more than enough time for manufacturers and retailers to move lowcost digital televisions and converter boxes into the market , for the federal communications commission to complete the channel allocation process , for broadcasters to finalize their digital facilities , and for government and industry to prepare consumers for the transition but consumer groups said the money allocated for the program , 990 million to 15 billion , would not be nearly enough for all of the analog television sets and that , in any event , many consumers would still need to pay 20 or more to upgrade each television set in their home that is not connected to a cable or satellite service \( the converter boxes are expected to cost about 60 apiece , and the coupons cannot be combined for a single purchase \) this is the government making your tv go black and then only paying part of the costs for some of the people to make it work again , and none of the costs for others , said gene kimmelman , public policy director at consumers union an estimated 70 million to 80 million television sets now in use are analog and are not attached to cable or satellite services , though experts say that by the completion of the transition , consumers will be using many more digital sets and fewer analog ones the consumer groups and some democrats had preferred a version of the measure adopted by the senate commerce committee two months ago that would have provided 3 billion for converter boxes the conversion to digital signals will not affect consumers who own digital television sets or subscribe to satellite services or digital cable services but analysts and cable company executives said additional legislation might be required to enable cable companies to alter their broadcasting feeds so that the more than 50 million customers who subscribe to analog cable services would be unaffected the cable companies have sought legislation that would allow them to convert digital signals back into analog signals before transmitting them into homes , which would be far less expensive than replacing settop boxes in each residence the house legislation will raise billions of dollars for the federal treasury from auctions for spectrum licenses that must be surrendered by broadcasters those licenses are desirable because of their special characteristics they cover large distances and the signals easily penetrate buildings as a result , wireless telephone companies and others have been urging the quick auction of those licenses to expand their broadband and other services the government estimates that those auctions , which will begin in 2008 , could raise at least 10 billion for the treasury as it faces growing deficits from the war in iraq , hurricane damage in the south and the new program to produce vaccines for the avian flu as a practical matter , the existing did not encourage a speedy transition to digital television because it required broadcasters to surrender their analog licenses at the later of two dates dec 31 , 2006 , or when 85 percent of households receive digital signals experts said the 85 percent requirement threatened to delay the transition for many years , although broadcasters have lobbied against setting a more immediate deadline

owner , william wirtz , whose team has not won the stanley cup since 1961 \( the league s longest drought \) , has long been criticized for his tightfisted ways in the nhl s nascent salarycap era ,

a mouth like yours by daniel duane 189 pages farrar , straus giroux 22 cassius harper , a berkeley graduate student , delivers a throebythroe account of his painful subjection to joan artois , daughter of a vague california aristocracy and flakier than a millefeuille she seemingly rolls up together every wild and witchy heroine in modern fiction , from hemingway s brett ashley to capote s holly golightly as the contemporary young femme fatale in daniel duane s novel a mouth like yours , she displays none of their fibrillating charm , though or at least none that manages to get through cassius' steamcloud of rant , which is a swirl of infatuation and selfabasement and , at 189 pages , feels much longer than gone with the wind \( add scarlett o'hara \) cassius practices the protracted obsessional venting of an ancient mariner , but his language \( eyes dripping into my own \) lacks the wings and his theme the lift it s as if the albatross had shot him a mouth like yours begins with cassius recalling the affair he is about to relate and deciding that , despite everything , it has transformed him from an emotional mess into a stronger and more purposeful human being nothing in the telling that follows bears this out there is no real movement in the story , other than the back and forth by plane between san francisco and new york nor does anything much happen other than an uptodate sadomasochistic contest with lashings of intricate psychologizing joan alternately seduces and punishes , with occasional poorlittlerichgirl pleas for understanding cassius repeatedly yields to the seducing , apologizes for his weak character and resolves to do better there s a whisper of the abused horse in animal farm promising to work harder , and the much louder buzzing of a wasp and a caterpillar caught in a jam jar mr duane expends a lot of energy but considerably less useful work on joan her seductiveness is all churning and not much movement in her endless variety the key word is endless it is hard to see her as a real character we get symptoms of illness mental without anyone there to have them sexy in her case is an adjective unattached to a proper noun it s possible that the writer intends joan as a parody of various trendy extremes cassius' efforts to please in bed infuriate her she charges insincerity in his erotic maneuvering , and an attempt to control her in fact mr duane uses his story to take a number of swipes at contemporary modes and foibles cassius has an alternative girlfriend , shauna , who is a compendium of fashionable haveitallways qualities she is sexy , warm and outgoing and pleasingly fullfigured but she is also an academic whiz at the cutting edge of feminist theory , and an assiduous , if smiling , monitor of correctness her cookies are made with soy oil instead of butter but they taste like mush so does she , rather , cassius finds , though he knows he 'd be far better off with her than with joan he should try loving someone who appreciates him , a friend advises one who , like cassius , once hunted for the turbulent highmaintenance affair but has settled down to sensible matrimony even at the end , having rid himself of joan , or possibly not , cassius ca n't bring himself to do that as the novel s principal character joan is mainly what happens to him cassius is the author s smaller success and larger failure the first , in fact , contributes to the second he does manage to represent a type of contemporary driftiness among the educated young and privileged cassius' graduate studies offer years of what might be called adjunctivitis the widespread use of lowpaid instructors , or adjuncts , to carry a university s teaching burden , with only a vague prospect of eventual tenure at some middling college when he tells himself he must change his life , he does n't think of charging the world full tilt he thinks law school a core is lacking , perhaps from having too many choices for too long , none requiring much of a journey from home at most he manages an occasional acid comeback , as when joan insists that her whiplashing will strengthen his character i could n't imagine having the energy for all that selfbetterment , he says his pursuit of wild transformative affairs instead of twoway intimacy stems from a sense that deep down there s no there there all this is reasonably effective at portraying or perhaps ironizing a particular class and generation as the author of caught inside , mr duane wrote an excellent nonfiction report about one youthful culture , that of california s surfers \( he is also an occasional freelance contributor to the new york times \) fiction , though , makes different demands cassius' bland formlessness works against our engagement with him his helpless subjection to a charmless and quickly tedious succubus makes him quickly tedious as well years ago jb priestley , the gritty british novelist of the 1930 s and 40 s , growled about the young in the posthippie 70 s nothing ever happened to them except that their mothers were fond of them it pretty much applies to cassius and his peers , although in keeping with certain current styles of disarray , his mother s fondness sports an incestuous touch besides
philip and elizabeth portrait of a royal marriage by gyles brandreth illustrated 413 pages w w norton 2795 biographers sometimes borrow the attitudes of their subjects perhaps that is why gyles brandreth would like you to know this about the marriage of queen elizabeth ii and philip , duke of edinburgh what goes on between them , dear reader , is really none of your affair in a world with no need whatsoever for another study of british royalty , mr brandreth has somehow written a whole book from that haughty perspective it turns out to have been a canny choice presumptuousness becomes a selling point if it signifies any actual familiarity and mr brandreth turns out to have spent enough time in royal company to be told by prince philip \( about his childhood \) i just had to get on with it you do one does but neither prince philip nor the queen has been garrulous with mr brandreth as he points out frequently , neither is prone to great bouts of introspection he cannot be cajoled or tempted into complaining about any aspect of his upbringing , mr brandreth writes about prince philip nor is he interested , it seems , in analyzing the effect it might have had on him that leaves the author free to speculate , fill in blanks and make up dialogue he imagines that the first words between 18yearold philip of greece and 13yearold princess elizabeth , when they met in 1939 , as how do you do \? and i'm quite well thank you he is also free to inflate the extent of his contact with the royals , although the acquaintance sounds substantial enough to make this a semiauthorized biography prince philip has also annotated some of the manuscript , at one point having asked do you really want to keep the last sentence \? philip and elizabeth , wellreceived in britain and admired there for its cheekiness , does make such cooperation understandable both the queen and prince philip have long been at the mercy of tabloids and tellalls and they would like to supply some indirect rebuttal the queen in particular , according to the book , has always resented the little princesses , a 1950 booklength breach of trust committed by her former governess because of that book , there are widely circulated fond memories of elizabeth s childhood that are not her own what qualifies mr brandreth for this mission \? well , he is both a politician and a journalist who holds the record for world s longest afterdinner speech \( 18 hours \) all of this makes him well qualified to spin little bits of information into long stories and to ramble reasonably charmingly about royal history it makes him bold enough to include a long footnote about his hapless efforts to flirt at buckingham palace and it makes him equipped to deal with the central question raised by a book about two staunch public figures where s the story \? one part of the story is simply conveying the royal experience cars come , guards salute , breakfast is served , valets press your suits , the fairies clean your shoes dishiness in this area extends only to tupperware , which is what is used to keep the queen s breakfast cereal fresh , though prince charles extravagantly wastes cereal in boxes mr brandreth must bring interest to the fact that the queen s morning includes music from her personal piper at 9 am each day but this book purports to be modeled on nigel nicolson s revealing book about his parents , portrait of a marriage so it needs to pry , or at least pretend to once philip and elizabeth fell in love and married , they shared a boudoir or adjoining separate bedrooms that the book must invade somehow thanks to servants' tittletattle \( reliable in this instance \) we do know that prince philip , in the early days of his marriage , did not wear pajamas , mr brandreth reports the trickiest part of his assignment is maintaining a dignified aura while stooping to snoop so he invokes the royals' most looselipped employees and he brings some wit to this mission the valet who wrote about prince philip , he says , delivered a memoir of his happy years as the prince s trouserpresser and he tells paul burrell , the butler who wound up with some of the clothing of diana , princess of wales , after she died , your trouble was that you fell in love with diana because judy garland was dead inevitably , this admiring yet lively book must address what will be a point raised by prince philip s obituaries \( according to mr brandreth , who has already studied them \) how much of a ladies' man has he been \? the author s tactics here are nothing if not resourceful , especially after he tells readers i am going to try to nail the issue once and for all in ensuing pages he incorporates the most outrageous rumors , expresses concern that this may seem exploitative \( because it is \) , tracks down women with whom prince philip has been friendly and defends an older man s need for the occasional confidential companionship of a sparky , larky girl who is flattering , intelligent and fun he does a fine job of defending the prince s behavior until he brings up lewis carroll as another innocent victim of calumny in the end , typically , mr brandreth loyally dismisses the matter he dutifully praises the prince s honor and the queen s understanding nature and he amusingly thanks mrs thompson \( the brandreth family s lone cleaning lady \) for refusing to tell tales
a woman was killed and two other people were injured last night in central newark when someone in a moving car opened fire about 8 30 pm near the intersection of clinton and chadwick avenues , the authorities said as the car sped away , it collided with a city bus , and the car s two occupants fled on foot , the police said they said that they knew of no motive for the shootings , and that they might have been random the woman died from a wound to her head the other two victims , a man and a woman , sustained wounds that did not appear to be lifethreatening , the authorities said none of their identities were disclosed by the police last night
in the 1990 s , they were held up as corporate supermen , executives whose skills and brainpower made them so indispensable to their companies that they were paid on a scale virtually unseen in human history but in the new millennium , as the story has moved from the boardrooms to the courtrooms , they have portrayed themselves as having been fumblers , sloppy with their paperwork and unaware of crimes in their midst yet still deserving of their gargantuan paychecks and , for the most part , juries are not buying it the conviction on friday of l dennis kozlowski , the former chief executive of tyco , on charges of grand larceny and conspiracy is underscoring what legal analysts say is perhaps the most surprising consequence of the explosion in corporate pay during the 1990 s a heightened expectation that executives know how to do their jobs and understand what is happening at their companies indeed , coming after the convictions of other top executives including bernard j ebbers , the former chief executive of worldcom , on charges of accounting fraud , and john j rigas , the former chief of adelphia communications , on charges of conspiring to loot the company the kozlowski verdict demonstrates that , at a criminal trial , high pay scales can serve as the government s exhibit a of the defendant s potential knowledge of wrongdoing one of the perils of being paid an enormous amount of money is that people will ultimately conclude that you 're worth it , said robert a mintz , a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at mccarter english in newark the assumption jurors will reach is that somebody who receives large compensation is playing a critical role at the company , and a defense that you were more cheerleader than ringleader is going to be very difficult for a jury to buy at his trial , mr kozlowski who in the 1990 s was celebrated as one of corporate america s most aggressive deal makers and who , like john f welch jr at general electric , had come to personify the company he had transformed portrayed himself in his testimony as something of a slipshod , fromthehip manager tens of millions of dollars in payments to him , mr kozlowski testified , had been approved by the board and were discussed informally with a single director , since deceased he claimed that he failed to pay taxes on the money because he had relied on his accountant and therefore had not been paying attention with their verdict , the jury rejected each one of those arguments most people on juries are n't business owners they are employees , and their bosses would never tolerate those kinds of excuses , said john j fahy , a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at fahy choi in rutherford , nj to have someone making millions and millions of dollars saying 'i was disorganized i was n't paying attention' is something that jurors just ca n't understand none of this reaction , the legal analysts said , stems from envy or a belief among jurors that high pay scales are , in and of themselves , evidence of criminality instead , it is simply a rational conclusion that executives would not be paid huge sums if they were inattentive or mismanaging the company there is an inconsistency between someone who takes the position that he built a company from scratch but forgets certain things that jurors find important and material , said ira lee sorkin , a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at carter ledyard milburn in manhattan they are going to wonder how anyone could have risen to the top of the world , earned justifiably the pay and not known what was going on mr kozlowski s codefendant in the case , mark h swartz , tyco s former chief financial officer , fared no better with his defense that he believed the money he had received from tyco had been authorized mr swartz was also convicted the two men were charged with stealing 150 million from tyco , a conglomerate whose products range from security systems to health care devices , and also taking in 430 million more by secretly selling company shares while inflating the value of the stock the defense of claiming ignorance or foolishness has been widely derided as difficult to believe but legal analysts said that , given the circumstances of the cases , the defendants were hard pressed to argue anything else there was no denying , for example , that mr kozlowski received huge sums that he did not report on his taxes or in corporate filings similarly , in the worldcom case , with the former chief financial officer , scott d sullivan , testifying about his role in that company s accounting fraud , it was impossible for mr ebbers to argue that wrongdoing did not occur ignorance and sloppiness were the only defenses left from a legal perspective , they had no other defense they could possibly use , said mr fahy they had to argue that they were disorganized or foolish the compensation that has come back to haunt corporate executives would be hard for most wage earners to comprehend in addition to the amount he has been convicted of stealing , mr kozlowski was paid hundreds of millions of dollars in salary and bonuses , including more than 70 million in 2002 , his final year at the company much of those payments came in the form of restricted stock the payments to mr ebbers of worldcom were also colossal not only did they include tens of millions of dollars in salary and bonuses , but the company also provided him with about 400 million in loans at his criminal accounting fraud trial , mr ebbers testified that he was not intimately familiar with the operating financial details of the company that paid him so generously a position that was rejected by the jury of course , there is no foolproof guide to what juries will do if there were , no one would ever bother to go to trial even now , there are signs that jurors can struggle with deciding cases against highly paid former chief executives who maintain they were left in the dark about wrongdoing a federal jury in birmingham , ala , has been deliberating for 16 days in the criminal fraud case against richard m scrushy , the former chief executive of healthsouth the jurors have told the judge in the case that they are unable to agree on a verdict for any of the charges stemming from a false accounting scheme at the company the scrushy case differs in one important respect from those involving mr ebbers and mr kozlowski the defendant never took the stand to explain how widespread wrongdoing could take place at his company without his knowledge in other words , mr scrushy has not personally explained to jurors the essence of his defense that he was duped by underlings , former executives who have pleaded guilty to fraud and testified against him instead , he has simply held the government to the test , compelling prosecutors to prove that he knew of wrongdoing rather than trying to explain away why he did not deliberations resume monday but staying off the witness stand proved to be of no benefit to mr rigas of adelphia his lawyers argued that at 79 , he had simply been too old to understand some of the financial machinations within the company he headed the jury rejected that argument and convicted him he is scheduled to be sentenced monday in federal district court in manhattan there is , of course , a lesson in this corporate executives who want the big pay had better turn in spectacular , precision performance , legal analysts say otherwise , if a scandal blows up inside the company , their own compensation may prove their undoing any highly paid corporate executive had better move swiftly to make sure they have a firm grasp on the finances of their company , mr mintz said because at the end of the day , these cases go to show that they are going to be held to a very high standard that may come back to haunt them
secaucus , nj he s back in 1991 , richard kreimer shook up municipalities in northern new jersey with a series of lawsuits that broke new ground in extending the civil rights of his fellow homeless people his lawsuit against the morristown and morris township library led to a federal court decision saying that the first amendment prohibited public libraries from barring otherwise wellbehaved people whose shabby appearance and odor might bother other patrons although the court ultimately ruled that morris township had acceptable rules in place , mr kreimer nonetheless won 150 , 000 in damages he also won a new jersey attorney general s ruling in 1990 giving voter registration rights to the homeless who had no fixed address but the streets that they roamed the money he made in the suits bought him some time out of state but now mr kreimer is back , and this time the target of his protests is the new jersey transit system and its 160 railroad stations , as well as the state s light rail lines as before , he is protesting the treatment of homeless people , saying they have been harassed and rousted by police mr kreimer was one of two homeless people who complained to the state chapter of the american civil liberties union last year , setting off months of meetings and no lawsuit so far the goal of the talks has been to draft a new code of conduct for the stations or shore up existing regulations that try to walk the tightrope between the rights of the homeless and the rights of nearly 400 , 000 commuters who use the stations daily new jersey transit and the aclu may ultimately come up with a way to make sure people are not being singled out because they are homeless , without the court s involvement but that is no guarantee that mr kreimer will not sue anyway , and that knowledge is casting a shadow over the negotiations , said one new jersey transit official who spoke on the condition of anonymity some people who have dealt with mr kreimer in the past have likened him to the mysterious and infamous keyser soze in the movie the usual suspects , a character who , by the mere mention of his name , can set off chilling reactions i used to try to treat him with respect , said one municipal official who , for fear of legal retaliation from mr kreimer , spoke only on the condition of anonymity but the only way to deal with people like him is to ignore them he s the kind of person who will turn nice suburban liberals into conservatives real quickly deborah kole , a staff lawyer with the state s league of municipalities , said many local officials recall the morristown library lawsuit , and none want to go through that only the large municipalities have fulltime legal departments , she said , and the smaller ones have to hire private counsel at hourly rates it adds up and is so openended , and has to get passed on to the taxpayers mr kreimer , 55 , is a morristown native with piercing dark eyes and a determined gaze a short man bundled in about five layers of clothing and carrying a black canvas bag filled with the 18 medications that he said he has to take , he was found in the secaucus transfer station of new jersey transit one recent day , one of the frequent stops on his daily travels in the system mr kreimer said that he had recently been released from a hospital and that a lung infection made it difficult to talk so he jotted his comments on sheets of white typing paper that he kept in his bag along with his pills and a sheaf of legal papers he said that his goal in bringing the lawsuits was both winning monetary damages and achieving some measure of social justice he has spent days poring over law books in libraries , and he drew a distinction between the aclu efforts on behalf of a class of homeless people and his own individual quest to hold accountable through a kreimer lawsuit those who he said had disrespected him all americans have dollar signs in their eyes , wrote mr kreimer in large print peppered with some misspellings i'm an honest person and i sue to get monetary claims but also for social justice lawyers who have represented mr kreimer in past cases suggest that what makes him tick is much more complex frank askin , a rutgers university law school professor and former aclu lawyer who represented him in the 1991 library suit and the voting rights case , called him driven and difficult to deal with , as well as manipulative indeed , it was mr kreimer who , anonymously , prompted this article he telephoned a new york times reporter , claiming that he was a new jersey transit employee he said that richard kreimer was back , prompting talks between the transit agency and the aclu over the treatment of homeless people in later telephone calls , he used a false name after the details of the negotiations between new jersey transit and the aclu were independently verified , a meeting was arranged between the new jersey transit worker and the reporter it was mr kreimer now able to talk who showed up at the appointed meeting place in newark s penn station asked whether he had used a ruse to bring attention to his issues , he smiled and denied it , but said of his methods , i 've got this right mr askin said that to mr kreimer , money is secondary to personal satisfaction and recognition he does things that are important for civil liberties because it is the driven and obsessive who are willing to stand up for what they think are their rights , mr askin said sometimes they are wrong about that , but the point is that they wo n't stop so he has accomplished some things because of his driven personality penny bassett hackett , a spokeswoman for new jersey transit , said the agency and the aclu had spent two months in an effort to review the agency s existing code of conduct regarding homeless people she portrayed the talks as an opportunity to make sure that agency employees clearly understand that they must treat people equally , she said edward barocas , the legal director of the aclu , said there is a legal issue in that agency regulations do not clearly say everyone has to be treated the same case law states that when the general public is invited into a location , then government cannot pick and choose who enters , mr barocas said you can have conductbased removal only part of the problem here is that transit police were using their personal discretion , and we wanted policies that prohibited that mr barocas said that if new jersey transit came up with new guidelines or a code that was acceptable to the civil liberties group on constitutional grounds , then the aclu would not sue but mr kreimer said he would sue , no matter what if the aclu accepts a landmark new code of conduct , he said , that s fine with me , but i would still sue for abuses either way in the end there would be only a kreimer damage suit , not a first amendment case mr kreimer has also filed lawsuits against the town of woodbury , near camden , for harassment , and against amtrak in philadelphia , claiming harassment both cases are still pending he became homeless in the late 1980 s after he lost his morristown house after a dispute with relatives over the estate of his adoptive parents and tax foreclosure soon he was a regular visitor to the library in morristown mr kreimer , who often talks of himself in the third person , said he received 230 , 000 in settlements and damages for his lawsuits against his hometown more than half of which went to pay expert witnesses and other fees , he said with that money , and disability benefits that mr askin and others helped him get , he moved to a denver suburb , got a job in sales and for five years refrained from filing lawsuits but while living there , he learned that he had diabetes his health worsened , and he lost his job and his rented condominium he returned to new jersey in 2003 talking about his complaints against new jersey transit , mr kreimer , even in writing , is more brash and selfassured than socially outraged he withholds some details of his encounters with police and talks of having snitches in the transit agency who give him information he said new jersey transit had made a mistake in picking on a smart homeless man who is sharp as a tack i hold all of the aces , he said they should offer me a quick settlement
of all the things that mayor michael r bloomberg boasts about on the campaign trail , perhaps none is closer to his heart than his contention that new york city s economy has rebounded with a vigor unfathomable four years ago thanks to his administration the terrorist attack of sept 11 , 2001 , punched a huge hole in the city s budget , pushed a foundering economy to its knees and raised concerns about whether the financial industry was too exposed to security threats in new york empty hotels were forced to cut their rates , downtown restaurateurs fond of velvet ropes were begging regular new york folks to patronize them , and major companies were poised to flee nearly four years after mr bloomberg took office , unemployment in the city is at a 20year low tourists are arriving in droves and major companies have stayed put cuts to balance the city budget 36 billion to date did not result in the dire erosion of services foretold by critics on the left , nor did tax increases hamper economic growth , as conservatives had warned they would from the perspective of many of the city s employers , the bloomberg administration has been far more proactive than any other city hall in recent memory in stimulating economic development through rezoning policies , neighborhood improvements and the active seduction of companies and new industries he basically has restructured and transformed the city s economic development functions , said kathryn s wylde , president of the new york city partnership , a consortium of business leaders , who was once banned from city hall under the giuliani administration for being critical of its strategies instead of waiting for someone to come and say they want subsidies , they consider it the responsibility of the economic development folks to cultivate relationships with key industries on the economic front , mr bloomberg has his share of detractors , whose two central complaints are echoed but only privately by administration supporters the first is widespread remonstrance over the administration s obsession with building a stadium on the far west side of manhattan , a plan that went down in flames , but only after charring many interests along the way business leaders and elected officials complained that the mayor and his senior staff were often unavailable over the last year to address important economic issues while they fought for the stadium in particular , they complain that while the mayor was vigorous in pushing the west side plan , he has been inattentive to the city s infrastructure especially transportation and power , which are critical as the city grows i think mike has done a pretty good job , said one highly regarded chief executive and mayoral ally , who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to alienate city hall i would say great except for the olympics there are only so many hours in all of our days , and attention and resources were diverted second , the bloomberg administration has faced complaints that it favors the interests of large companies and developers , who get sweet deals from government , over those of small merchants and artisans , and that it has had a tin ear for local politics within economic debates countless politicians have said that small businesses are the backbone of new york city , and yet we 're getting steamrolled over here , said stanley mayer , the president of the bronx terminal market preservation association , which has been at war with the bloomberg administration over its plans to displace merchants there as it redevelops the land their basic overall economic strategy is to favor the bigger people and on the fiscal front , while it is true that the administration has kept its budget balanced with targeted cuts , tax increases and surging tax revenues from a booming real estate market , it has failed to grapple with longerterm structural deficits caused by creeping increases in the number of city employees \( something the mayor controls \) and rising pension and medicaid costs \( something he does not \) the bloomberg team brushes off such complaints , arguing that any mistakes they have made are eclipsed by the sinewy state of the economy i think the results speak for themselves , said daniel l doctoroff , the deputy mayor in charge of economic development even critics offer praise but even the mayor s critics have strong praise for his management of the city s overall economy this administration has really transformed economic development , said jonthan bowles , the research director for the center for an urban future , who is a frequent critic of the mayor s policies he added they are going after sectors of the economy with assertiveness that was n't there before their focus on the boroughs outside new york is impressive i do n't see eyetoeye with him on the stadium or a couple of other projects , but i do credit the administration for trying to diversify the economy and thinking more strategically mr bloomberg s democratic challenger , fernando ferrer , did not respond to several requests for comment on mr bloomberg s economic development record the conventional wisdom about mr bloomberg s privatesector background is that it has helped mold his leadership style , in that he treats the city like a business , for better or worse but in trying to steer the city s economy , that has meant a reliance on management strategies and good connections for instance , the administration started its term by bringing in a firm to dispassionately evaluate the city s economy , and created a task force with many executives to figure out what industries should be courted to lay down roots or locate corporate headquarters in new york mr bloomberg and mr doctoroff sought to bring a more professional quality to the city s economic development corporation , which previously had a reputation not only for being an employer for political patrons , but also for being less than aggressive in courting new businesses the two brought on andrew m alper , a former partner at goldman sachs , to run the agency the three wealthy men earn a combined 3 a year for their services mr alper and mr doctoroff began to fly around the country and the world generally paying the airfare themselves trying to persuade companies to bring their corporate headquarters here corporation officials have met with more than 300 companies in 23 cities around the world this is not just edc trolling around the world , said mr doctoroff this is a major change from how edc was run before the city s most prominent success has been in the decadeslong pursuit of a viable biotechnology industry in new york city , a business the city had failed to woo as it gravitated to the west coast , boston and other cities in recent years the city recently announced that a california real estate firm would erect a 700 million complex of commercial health care laboratories on the campus of bellevue hospital center historically , said harold varmus , the president of memorial sloankettering cancer center , there has been a lot of interest and not much action , on the part of city government with this deal , i am feeling 100 times more optimistic than i did before and mr bloomberg has not been shy about using his connections in the business world to lobby for the city when he wanted to keep companies from leaving new york after sept 11 , he called up kenneth i chenault , the chief executive of american express , and appealed to his civic pride when he needed money for the republican national convention or a sept 11 commemoration , he called in chits with friends like e john rosenwald jr , the vice chairman of bear , stearns company , whose causes he had financially supported in the past , and asked them to open their checkbooks tourists abound again there is a longstanding theory among some urbanpolicy experts a theory embraced by former mayor rudolph w giuliani that if crime and other qualityoflife problems are kept in check , a city s economy will benefit , too one area where this theory appears to have borne fruit is tourism as anyone who has dodged the hordes of theaterbound , sneakerclad masses on any given wednesday over the last few years knows , tourism has fully rebounded from its low before the sept 11 attack new york s low crime rate and almost ostentatious official cheerfulness \( this is the city that offered discounts at applebee s to protesters during the republican national convention \) appear to have worn down even the most skittish outsiders in 2004 , the number of tourists visiting the city hit nearly 40 million , a 6 percent increase over 2003 the number of coveted , often freespending international visitors grew 10 percent in 2004 those increases , fueled in part by a weak dollar , have translated into jobs over the last two years , the leisure and hospitality sector of the new york economy grew by 83 percent , compared with the 2 percent increase in the city s total employment base , according to department of labor data of course , much of this growth came off a low base after the 2001 recession , and many of the jobs are low paying however , these tourism jobs are directly a result of improved infrastructure and crime , which he can take credit for , barbara byrne denham , an economist at jones lang lasalle in new york , said of mr bloomberg a booming economy has produced concern about what many say is unchecked development around the city in 2004 , the city approved the construction of 25 , 208 housing units , more than in any other year since 1972 , a figure that the city is expected to surpass this year from staten island to the northern bronx and everywhere in between , there are residents who complain that shady developers lay down concrete while zoning changes are being contemplated , work illegal hours and create housing that ruins the character of neighborhoods and is too expensive to boot growth is always good , but you have to be guarded about it , said chuck apelian , vice chairman of community board 7 in queens i wish i knew who could pay 500 a foot for these new apartments here i 'd marry them in part to manage growth , the city is undertaking its greatest rezoning effort in decades , which has paved the way for significant economic development in longignored corners of new york in the past four years , the city has rezoned 52 areas covering more than 4 , 000 blocks , with the goal of adding 40 million square feet of commercial space from the far west side of manhattan absent a new stadium to downtown brooklyn to flushing to morrisania , underused or vacant space is now in some stage of development , often with government investment in the surrounding area in may , city officials agreed to let developers erect residential towers and retail stores on the decaying north brooklyn waterfront the plan included an industrial business zone designed to appease the city s dwindling and largely ignored manufacturing base , with a 4 million fund to help preserve manufacturing jobs in that area the waterfront represents a very aggressive turnaround for government , ms wylde , the new york city partnership president , said in the past , the city has waited for a private developer to come along and propose rezoning and typically most of the benefits went to the developer but on the west side and the brooklyn waterfront , city planning is investing in the predevelopment work and undertaking these major rezoning actions with the result that the city will capture far more of the value digging out of a hole the booming property market has helped the city balance its budgets , but its fiscal prospects looked dire when mr bloomberg took office with the prospect of a 6 billion deficit , mr bloomberg was forced to break his 2001 campaign pledge and raise sales , property and some income taxes and persuade the state to restructure some of the city s debt from the 1970 s none of these moves were remotely popular homeowners and landlords were appalled by the tax increases fiscalpolicy experts clucked that the debt restructuring was imprudent and mr bloomberg was widely mocked for not squeezing more help from gov george e pataki , a fellow republican while many fiscal experts sympathize with mr bloomberg s handling of the budget , others suggest he has failed to tackle the costly nondiscretionary obligations that saddle the city for instance , budget watchdogs say , he could push albany harder for things like a new pension tier that would give newly hired city workers lessgenerous pensions , or he could pressure municipal unions to pay some of their members' health care costs that is what really frustrates us , said charles brecher , the executive vice president of the citizen s budget commission but the mayor s initial approach of tax increases to solve the budget deficit he initially faced , combined with the booming tax receipts from a superheated real estate market , got the city out of the 64 billion hole it faced when he took office his operating mantra in 2002 that he would rather raise taxes than allow the city to fall into the lamentable state of the 1970 s now seems prescient , as even his critics concede he stepped into a very difficult situation , mr brecher said and he has managed to balance the budget , and you have to give him credit for that the bloomberg record this is the second in a series about mayor michael r bloomberg s record an earlier article examined his performance on crime it

condi vs hillary the next great presidential race by dick morris and eileen mcgann 326 pp reganbooks harpercollins publishers 2595 the case for hillary clinton by susan estrich 275 pp reganbooks harpercollins publishers 2595 a long time ago , it became clear that something about hillary rodham clinton had driven many political pundits around the bend for nearly 15 years , she has been denounced , at various times , as a deeply subversive rogue feminist who equated marriage with slavery an overreaching social engineer bent on nationalizing the american health care system and a disturbingly acquiescent wife too willing to stick with a straying husband now , in the latest incarnation offered up by her critics , she is the scheming , probably unstoppable frontrunner for the 2008 democratic presidential nomination , currently presenting herself as a moderate via another insidious makeover but hellbent on returning to her leftwing agenda once in power dick morris and eileen mcgann , in condi vs hillary the next great presidential race , can barely contain their alarm do not underestimate this woman ! they warn in fact , the authors argue \( over and over again \) , hillary clinton may be so powerful , so stealthy and so determined that only an extraordinary candidacy by condoleezza rice , the secretary of state , can stop her as millions of rightthinking americans realize the dangers of a hillary presidency , the authors suggest , a draftcondi movement will spring up at the grass roots , producing a kind of manichaean catfight in the general election that , at least , is the conceit of this book , its particular niche in the crowded marketplace of hillary lit very quickly , this argument begins to feel more obsessive than provocative morris and mcgann \( they are husband and wife \) labor mightily to set up a contrast between hillary the bad and condi the good , a sort of fox news fairy tale clinton s candidacy is driven by enduring ambition , rice s by her own lasting achievements and experience in government service clinton has risen by freeriding on her husband s success \( although it hardly seems like much of a free ride \) , while rice is a triumph of individual upward mobility and the meritocratic ideal clinton is surrounded by hardcase political operatives who will do almost anything to win , including the thuglike harold ickes , while rice has succeeded and will continue to succeed almost spontaneously , when mentors and potential voters see her remarkable talents and push her up to the next rung get it \? the authors' basic political rationale for a rice candidacy to block clinton seems reasonable enough rice could hold the republican base and take away democratic votes among women , blacks and hispanics , they argue only condoleezza rice offers the republican party a chance to close the gender gap , they say , or , at the very least , to prevent it from widening further but the authors fail to make a convincing argument for why republican activists not always the most pragmatic bunch would make such a calculated decision , based so heavily on politics over ideology rice , for one thing , is a supporter of abortion rights republicans have not nominated someone who was not solidly antiabortion since the days of gerald ford it s a different party now moreover , rice s skills as a campaigner are essentially unknown , and a presidential election is an unforgiving place to learn them ask wesley clark she has never held elective office and has no real record on many domestic issues and while the authors appear dazzled by her diplomatic feats , even they acknowledge that if the war becomes manifestly unpopular , rice may find herself sucked down along with it aside from all that , she s perfect condi vs hillary , though , seems at times less a serious exercise in political analysis than a chance for morris to vent about the wife of his former boss \( for those not steeped in clintonology , morris , a longtime adviser to bill clinton who helped him shift to the center after the 1994 republican landslide , left his employ in 1996 , in the midst of a furor over morris s reported relationship with a call girl \) morris clearly has some unresolved issues with hillary clinton he warns that in private , she is often bitter and sarcastic , a partisan who is always looking for and finding enemies , plots and conspiracies she is filled with rage at the republicans and their policies at her core believes in income redistribution and is on a secret mission to bring liberalism back to the white house finally , the authors warn solemnly at the end , after listing a long catalog of her failings and sins , there is this she cries surprisingly , this tough , combative , sharptongued woman often broke down in tears during her time as first lady , they write quite often , her tears were mixed with anger , as they were at various points with me , george stephanopoulos and rahm emanuel in short , angry mommy must be stopped such excess , of course , provokes a reaction the political culture and the market \( not to mention reganbooks \) demand it and so we have the case for hillary clinton , by susan estrich , in which the former democratic operative and current law professor and commentator tries to buck up any wobbly democrats about the desirability and electability of hillary clinton estrich has a rather touching belief that , if elected , clinton would profoundly change not just the government but the culture , reinvigorating the feminist movement around the world \( reading estrich after dick morris produces a kind of ideological whiplash \) but she correctly identifies a core belief among many democrats that clinton may have a lock on the nomination , but cannot win the general election because \( not to put too fine a point on it \) too many people hate her that thinking inevitably leads to the case for nominating a safe white male , which estrich dismisses as just another democratic delusion you 'll never find anyone who s as safe as you hope , who can do as much as you need , she writes for instance , which of your safe white men are going to excite the base the way hillary does , so they can spend all their time in the middle \? i 'll answer none estrich s book reads , at times , like a long dinnerparty rant at friends who she believes ought to know better for god s sake , stop obsessing about why she stayed with her husband ! \( if imperfect marriages were grounds for disqualification from high office , would there be anyone left to run \? she writes \) stop worrying about her ability to move beyond the democratic base and look at her formidable approval ratings in upstate new york ! and stop worrying about what the republicans might throw at her in the general election there s nothing left to throw ! there will always be a market for the hillary trash , just as there is for hardcore porn , estrich writes but , she adds , however many books they write , however many trees they pulp , the simple fact is that the haters have run out of material maybe but the case against and for hillary clinton long ago transcended mere facts 'condi vs hillary' and 'the case for hillary clinton' robin toner is a senior correspondent in the washington bureau of the times
riggs bank will plead guilty to a federal criminal charge and pay a penalty of at least 16 million to avoid being prosecuted for failing to monitor suspicious financial transactions , according to a person with direct knowledge of the settlement the settlement , expected to be filed today in federal court , is likely to end the justice department s investigation into the bank and its holding company , the riggs national corporation , and should pave the way for its sale to pnc financial service group , the parent of pnc bank , based in pittsburgh but riggs will continue to cooperate with investigators as they pursue some former executives and officers , the person said , and the agreement allows federal prosecutors to bring separate criminal charges against them since last spring , riggs , based in washington , has been at the center of a highprofile moneylaundering scandal that has bridged the financial and political worlds the bank has been mired in investigations of money laundering and possible terrorist financing through saudi arabian and equatorial guinean accounts at the bank , and in april it paid a 25 million civil penalty to the treasury department , acknowledging its lax practices and improper oversight of suspicious accounts meanwhile , riggs has faced intense scrutiny from federal regulators and lawmakers on capitol hill , who have portrayed it as a willing facilitator of shady financial deals with the government of equatorial guinea and gen augusto pinochet , the former dictator of chile the 16 million criminal penalty , reported yesterday by the wall street journal , is the largest imposed under the bank secrecy act it comes on top of the civil fine riggs paid last year and is substantial given the bank s size in october , amsouth bank of alabama , a larger institution than riggs , paid a 10 million penalty for poor moneylaundering controls it also paid 40 million as part of an agreement to defer prosecution riggs has been negotiating with prosecutors for about two months by entering a guilty plea to one crime under the bank secrecy act that of failing to file reports to regulators about clients who make suspicious transfers and withdrawals legal specialists say the bank eliminates the risk of stiffer penalties , including those that could shut it down what the justice department is saying is , 'let the bank live , ' said charles intriago , publisher of the newsletter money laundering alert however , mr intriago added that the troubles for this bank are not yet over some former riggs executives could face criminal charges for allowing money laundering to occur simon p kareri , the senior riggs manager in charge of the equatorial guinea accounts , is the subject of a grand jury investigation the justice department has also been investigating r ashley lee , a riggs executive who was formerly the federal regulator responsible for monitoring its moneylaundering controls so far , however , none of the bank s officers , managers or directors have faced regulatory penalties or legal action joe l allbritton , the bank s former chief executive and controlling shareholder , said through a spokesman yesterday that he had done nothing wrong pnc declined to comment on the impact of the potential settlement , but analysts said it should allow pnc to complete the acquisition of riggs national , a deal valued at 779 million when it was announced in july pnc has the right to walk away from the deal if new problems arise pnc wants to acquire as clean an operation as it can under the circumstances , and this carries pnc in that direction , said gary townsend , a banking analyst at friedman , billings , ramsey in arlington , va
daytona beach , fla , feb 18 six years removed from his nascar cup championship , dale jarrett fields more questions these days about his timetable for retirement than his chances for another title run that is to be expected at 48 , jarrett has edged into that middle ground middleaged ground , some might call it where a driver often settles after reaching the height of his career and before leaving the sport he has not finished in the top 10 in points since 2002 and has not won a race since 2003 he has not even been on the pole at the start of a race since june 2002 that will change on sunday , when jarrett finds himself on the pole for the seasonopening daytona 500 at daytona international speedway and jarrett , for one , does not need to be reminded about what happened the last time he captured the pole here , in 2000 he won not that jarrett or anyone else would predict a repeat a pole is one thing winning is quite another matter , as jarrett should know he also won this race in 1993 and 1996 it s great to talk about and think about that possibility being there to happen again , he said , but as far as getting any momentum or anything from that , no , there s nothing you can draw still , there is a hope that the pole is a sign that jarrett s team is ready to be a top10 contender again jarrett used to be a regular in the upper echelon of the sport he was in the top 10 every season from 1996 through 2002 , including during his lone cup points championship in 1999 it has been awhile since jarrett visited that pinnacle , though there was the freefall from ninth over all in 2002 to 26th in 2003 , his lowest finish since 1987 last season , jarrett s car owner , robert yates , joined with the other main ford competitors at roush racing to build engines the yates roush engines helped the roush driver kurt busch win the cup championship elliott sadler , a yates driver , made the top 10 chase as well for jarrett , who joined with a new crew chief , mike ford , for the 2004 season , the improvement was significant , too he moved up to 15th and was in the hunt for a top10 spot things were pretty much in disarray at the end of 2003 and mike had quite a job of rebuilding our race team and he s done a terrific job of that , but we 're much better prepared this year coming into daytona not only for daytona but for the upcoming races , jarrett said i 've been very pleased with what i see within our team we 've added some engineering to staff , and i feel like we can be considered a top10 team right now that s what i want is to get ourselves in a position to have a chance at winning another championship sunday s pole is another step forward but it is too early to say that one pole means jarrett will suddenly be a contender for the championship this season perhaps , though , it was early to assume he was no longer capable i know dale s intensity to end his career as he moves on in the next few years on a high note , said eddie d'hondt , general manager of robert yates racing , so none of this surprised me not at all jarrett knows it is a surprise to outsiders you sit and watch and read and listen to everything that s talked about for the daytona 500 , he had said after winning the pole probably , and for good reason , you have n't really seen the 88 car or my face or my name mentioned that much about it , and i think , even though we have n't contended the last couple of years for wins , we still know what it takes to win at this so it s kind of nice to say that we 're not finished with this yet we may be getting on up there in age , but that does n't really make any difference jarrett has stood quietly by as , one by one , his contemporaries have announced their retirements bill elliott , 49 , became a parttime driver after the 2003 season terry labonte , 48 , will drive only 10 races this season mark martin , 46 , and rusty wallace , 48 , will end their nextel cup careers after this year not jarrett he said he planned to race through the 2006 or 2007 season i'm not ready to quit this yet , he said at the start of speedweeks i think that i have a few more years left of enjoying this i still love to compete , and i do n't think that there s anything these 20 and 25yearolds can do that physically i ca n't do in a car i keep myself in good shape , and i love to compete as long as you do that , i think that my experience will take over somewhere i'm not looking to be out there and drive around if i'm going to do this and i'm going to compete , i want to compete at a high level i want to know that i have a chance to win on a regular basis and that we have a chance at running up front on a regular basis maybe this year , he will
smaller , shorter and as gently cut as a brandnew baby boy , the edited version of mel gibson s passion of the christ opened in theaters on friday with none of the furor that greeted the film on its original theatrical release this new edition , titled the passion recut , clocks in at a scant six minutes shorter than the original two hours , with most of the trims taken from the notoriously gruesome scourging scene no longer do chunks of flesh fly across the screen , though blood still splatters and sprays with the same luxuriant excess as it does in kill bill vol 1 mr gibson says that this modestly abridged version of the passion of the christ was inspired by fans of the original in a brief introduction on the film s web site \( www thepassionrecut com \) , he says some of you actually said that you wish you could have taken your aunt martha , uncle harry or your grandmother or some of your older kids , and you thought that perhaps the intensity of the film was prohibitive to those people so i listened to that and it inspired me to recut the film to cater to those people that perhaps might not have seen it because of its intensity or brutality it s about five , six minutes less and indeed i have softened it , somewhat it s still a hard film you bet older kids may roll their eyes , but aunt martha and uncle harry may still not be able to stomach the image of jesus , played by jim caviezel , being beaten for over an hour with fists , clubs , canes and cato'ninetails adorned with fleshrending hooks the scourging occurs near the story s midpoint , after jesus is arrested and hauled first before the pharisee high priests , who accuse him of blasphemy , and then before the brooding pontius pilate affronted by the pharisees' blood lust , pilate hands the prisoner off to his men for scourging , which they do with the kind of growling , scowling gusto generally unseen since the silentscreen era mr gibson defended the violence in his movie on the reasonable grounds that the only way to grasp jesus' sacrifice was to see the horrors inflicted on him a similar rationale drives the action movies that made mr gibson a star in those entertainments , as in gangster and detective stories , film noir and the passion both short form and long , the hero s journey invariably subjects him to violence that justifies a stillmore violent climax like riggs , mr gibson s detective in the lethal weapon series , jesus endures a crucible of suffering both men are resurrected one through the miracle of sequels , the other through the divine and both extract serious payback as the trailer for ridley scott s film about the crusades that played before the passion recut reminded me , some of jesus' followers racked up the higher body count stories of regeneration through violence , to borrow the historian richard slotkin s phrase , are as old as homer and hollywood , although special effects and increasingly sophisticated makeup techniques also mean that they are stories now told onscreen with squirming verisimilitude as it happens , it was the palpable realness of the violence in the passion of the christ , the image of flesh transformed into meat , that gave the film not only its reason for being , but also its only point of cinematic interest what remains now of the film is just bluntforce dramatics and kitsch by reducing the ecstatic , almost sexualized aspect of the violence in his film , mr gibson has denied its audience that which lights up the faces of selfflagellating religious believers and genre movie fans alike its promise of transcendence

a chief executive is under pressure to resign representing a rival faction from an awkward merger , he is roundly criticized for his aloof management style irate investors attack him over the stock s sluggish performance that pretty much sums up the ordeal facing philip j purcell , the chairman and chief executive of morgan stanley , who is locked in a battle with eight retired executives calling for his ouster and it s also similar to what happened to one of his main allies , michael a miles , the influential chairman of the investment bank s governance committee and the board s unofficial lead director in the early 1990 s , mr miles was the chief executive of philip morris , having joined the company when it merged with kraft a few years earlier he cut cigarette prices , watched the stock plummet and finally resigned as a nonsmoker from chicago , he never quite hit it off with the company s power base , its top cigarette executives in new york for mr miles , it was a searing experience that ended a distinguished managerial career , and it sheds light on the stubborn resistance of the tightknit morgan stanley board to the demand by dissident former executives that mr purcell step down and as the bilious debate over mr purcell s leadership rages on , it is the board that has come to occupy center stage after all , morgan stanley is one of few companies that require a 75 percent vote by directors to replace a chief executive that provision was written into the bylaws in 1997 , after morgan stanley s merger with dean witter at nearly all other companies , a simple majority will do the standoff has cost the firm dearly william kourakos , who once ran its highyield bond division , a unit that produced hundreds of millions in revenue , was the latest top executive to leave , submitting his resignation late last week mr kourakos was a managing director and a 20year veteran of the firm , and his departure adds to the growing discontent within morgan stanley pressure on mr purcell and the board is building late last week , he and mr miles traveled to baltimore to meet with t rowe price , one of the firm s larger shareholders and one that has been critical of mr purcell , according to people who were briefed on the meeting these people , who described the meeting as contentious , said it was significant that t rowe price had asked for a director to accompany mr purcell t rowe price declined to comment even if directors are dead set against compromising with the eight executives , the erosion of good will within the firm , its languishing stock price and growing unease among shareholders may eventually force their hand it remains to be seen whether the close relationships that many of the directors have with mr purcell will color their judgment in any way indeed , morgan stanley bankers , not to mention the dissident executives , have accused the board of coddling him it is packed with former chief executives , many from the chicago area , where mr purcell lives some have golfed together others have worked for one another for all the board s interconnections , the most profound bond may be the shared experiences of two directors who have led the way in defending mr purcell mr miles and edward a brennan , the former chief executive of sears , roebuck like mr miles , mr brennan was the target of a shareholder revolt in the early 1990 s , when sears stock slumped as the company struggled to remain competitive bowing to the pressure , mr brennan , who nurtured mr purcell s career while he was at sears , reshuffled his board , asking mr miles to join it in 1992 he capitulated further when he reversed the company s foray into financial services , spinning off dean witter in 1993 and paving the way for mr purcell s subsequent ascent on wall street for the two men who rose to power in the 1970 s and 80 s , accustomed to the imperial trappings of their position , the shareholder revolts of the early 1990 s were in many ways a shared crucible that appears to be steeling their resolve as they face down the retired morgan executives clearly , mr brennan and mr miles know what it takes to topple a chief executive a united group of vocal shareholders and public pension fund managers lobbying for a change but that combination has yet to materialize during the current battle i think that having gone through these experiences and having been subjected to these pressures , these guys realize it s a long game and that they have a lot of cards , said robert ag monks , a corporate governance activist who led the shareholder putsch against mr brennan and in the absence of a coalescing of major shareholders , they and purcell could say , 'how many troops does the pope have \? ' in recent years , the board has become more diversified , adding john e jacob , a communications executive at anheuserbusch and an africanamerican , in 2001 klaus zumwinkel , the chairman of deutsch post and sir howard davies , a former top securities regulator in britain , in 2004 but its core members remain remarkably monolithic and the ties that bind them go well beyond the shared experience of mr miles and mr brennan first , there is the kraft connection mr miles , the chairman of the nominating committee and an original dean witter director , recruited two former executives who worked for him at kraft in the mid1980 s miles l marsh and c robert kidder then there is the mckinsey connection four directors were partners at mckinsey , the management consulting firm , as was mr purcell himself and finally , there is the fact that a number of directors , notably mr brennan and mr miles , serve together on boards at other companies governance watchdogs frown upon such board overlaps , saying that it restricts directors from taking contrary positions mr miles , for example , serves on six boards , including that of the amr corporation , where he serves alongside mr purcell and mr brennan mr brennan also serves on six boards , and charles f knight , a former chief executive of emerson electric , sits on five , including those of sbc communications \( where he serves with another morgan stanley director , laura d'andrea tyson , a former top economist in the clinton administration \) and anheuserbusch , where he serves with mr jacob besides having a lot in common with one another , these executives also share a lot with mr purcell they hail from the midwest , and all have been top executives morgan stanley s directors say their work as former corporate executives underscores their independent thinking and trumps any ties they may have with one another i think this board is competent and independent of phil , said one independent director who asked not to be identified to dwell upon issues of geography and the fact that some might have worked at the same firm is really quite shallow obviously , the board is very concerned about these issues and is acting responsibly to deal with them charles elson , a governance specialist at the university of delaware , said the issues of overlap were a matter of nuance none of these relationships are problematic legally , he said the concern for shareholders is , do these ties make it harder for directors to stand up and take a contrary position \? and even if the relationships do n't impact you , they impact the public view , which is why you need to avoid them others say such ties are not harmful if they are disclosed in a recent note to clients , martin lipton , the takeover lawyer at wachtell , lipton , rosen katz who also advises companies on governance matters , criticized the new class of institutional investors and academic gadflies who say social and philanthropic ties among directors may compromise their independence these types of requirement are the antithesis of the kind of collegiality and relationship with the ceo that is necessary for the board and ceo together to promote the appropriate tone at the top , he wrote the concept of the board as remote strangers and as the agency for discipline of management , rather than as partner of management in setting the strategic course for the corporation is contrary to all prior experience and will not lead to better performance strong words , to be sure , especially considering that mr lipton advised mr brennan during his battle with shareholders mr lipton also famously earned 20 million for two weeks of work when he advised mr miles and kraft on its 1988 merger with philip morris , and he is now advising the independent directors at morgan stanley on a range of matters , including their strategy for dealing with their antagonists one point made by the retired executives is that until recently , no director including mr purcell had ever operated a line of business for a securities firm that set morgan stanley apart from nearly every other wall street firm last month , in response to that criticism , mr purcell appointed his new copresidents , stephen s crawford and zoe cruz , to the board he has also cited mr madigan s wall street background , though his experience as a junior investment banker at paine webber and salomon brothers in the 1960 s and 70 s pales in comparison with those of industry veterans on other boards so what happens next \? assuming that the board remains firm in its support for mr purcell , it will face a much larger hurdle later this year , when the forces allied against management will do their best to rally shareholders to withhold proxy votes against the current directors at that point , if there has been no sharp upswing in the stock , the perceived coziness of the board will be an added spur for unhappy investors to take action a similar situation occurred at walt disney , where directors had close ties to michael d eisner , the chairman and chief executive but in disney s case , it was not discontent with the board that motivated shareholders as much as it was frustration over mr eisner s management of the company so morgan stanley directors may have helped mr purcell survive so far but if he fails to quell the rebellion within the firm and drive the stock price up , there may be little they can do to save him later
an incident at a swim camp in fairfield in july has prompted a chairman of the legislature s public health committee to call for stricter state licensing requirements for summer programs nine campers attending a nike us sports camp barricaded themselves into a dormitory room at fairfield university , where the camp was held , after counselors began drinking alcohol no one was hurt , but frightened campers called their parents , who alerted town police and campus security none of the counselors involved were arrested , but they were fired , including the son of the camp director who is the university s swim coach connecticut has no specific requirements for the training of counselors , except for specialty areas , like swimming or riflery the only requirement for all other counselors is that they have to be at least 16 years old camps are not required to train counselors or make background checks state senator christopher murphy , a democrat from southington who is cochairman of the public health committee , said that while there is a limit to what government can do , the state should consider requiring counselors to have more training background checks and training are n't going to stop certain counselors from being idiots , mr murphy said but requiring training as far as licensing is something we should take a look at a spokesman for gov m jodi rell said the issue is something we 'd have to look at further the state department of public health , which oversees camps , is investigating the incident , said devon conover , a section chief for the agency the department licenses all camps other than municipal camps and summer education programs ms conover said there are 441 licensed camps in the state , of which 124 are sleepaway camps to be licensed , the camps must meet standards regulating food , transportation , health , water safety and sanitation camp directors must meet certain qualifications , including having previous administrative experience , she said the department has eight investigators who visit every camp each year to make sure they follow regulations ms conover said the state has revoked one license in the past six years , in 1999 at shady brook camp and learning center in east haddam , which the state found was neglecting campers and in violation of safety standards last year , the state cited 21 camps , a majority for not being licensed ms conover said parents concerned about the staff at a camp could contact the department even though there is no specific regulations , we want to make sure counselors are appropriate , ms conover said peg smith , chief executive of the american camp association , which accredits 2 , 300 camps around the country , said state requirements vary in westchester county , for example , camp directors must obtain two written references for every employee , and adult employees must be screened by state agencies for child abuse and criminal records ms smith said new york is one of the stricter states few states have regulations regarding camps , ms smith said to get accredited by the american camping association , camps must meet more than 300 standards counselors undergo 3 to 10 days of training , including learning what is required to work with different age groups and what is appropriate behavior in front of children , ms smith said she said criminal checks are difficult because there is no national criminal database accessible to camps , but the association suggests that camps verify counselors' previous work experiences , check references and ask applicants whether they have ever been convicted of a crime the association also recommends that camps that hire counselors from foreign countries work through foreign recruitment agencies that conduct background checks however , accreditation is voluntary and only 26 camps in connecticut are accredited the us sports camp is not among them , the association said steve pence , president of us sports camp in san raphael , calif , which runs programs in a variety of sports in 500 locations , said the camp has never had an incident similar to the one in fairfield mr pence said the camp hires reputable college coaches and top college athletes to supervise their campers and thus never felt the need to be accredited mr pence said the counselors have a halfday of training , to learn how to handle emergencies and what types of evening activities to provide for the children they must also sign forms inquiring about criminal records kristin martin , the director of camp chinqueka , a girls' sleepaway camp in bantam , said the accreditation process is essential to ensure a safe environment for children it goes above and beyond the licensing process , said ms martin , whose grandparents started the camp and own two others in the area counselors at the camp come for a week of training before the children arrive and are subject to criminal background checks , ms martin said because states vary so much on regulations , and not all camps are accredited , camp officials said it is imperative that parents ask camps about their counselor training programs and safety procedures no environment is risk free , ms smith said we all have to do our own due diligence along the way camps are often advised on safety issues by their insurers , said gary kimball , executive director of campalert network , an emergencyresponse service for camps insured by amskier partners , an insurance company in hawley , pa counselor behavior is an important issue that camp directors have to address , mr kimball said a lot of it goes back to the training they receive before camp begins we go out and do workshops with counselors and we talk about inappropriate behavior aside from checking if a camp is licensed or accredited , state and camp officials suggested that parents ask the camp for a variety of information robert and jodi scheinfeld , a new rochelle , ny , couple who began a web site \( www campsafetyguide com \) on camp safety guidelines after their son drowned while at sleepaway camp in 1998 , suggest on their site that parents ask for a camp s written safety plan , which is supposed to describe procedures for verifying staff qualifications and staff training parents can also ask to see counselor training materials and request information on a counselor s employment history the guide also suggests that parents ask a camp how it disciplines its counselors and how camp directors would enforce any polices on alcohol or drug use parents who want to check whether a camp is accredited by the american camp association can go to www campparents org to check if a camp is licensed by the state or has had any violations , parents can type youth camp in the search engine at

she was born with a passion to help somebody , and she never wavered clifford ruzicka there was always a tendency to stereotype marla ruzicka people could n't seem to help themselves she was young and she had the blond hair and freshfaced californiagirl look that is widely viewed as an american ideal on that score she was great cheerleader material no reason , at first glance , to take her too seriously or even at second glance , for that matter because , face it , she did like to party so if you were into stereotyping , you might see her , even admire her , and still miss the fact that in her short life she gave us a stunning example of what it means to function full time , and with all one s energy , at the highest level of humanity with a cellphone \( that she had a tendency to misplace \) , a backpack and an apparent genius for working with very different types of individuals and organizations , she would head off to the most dangerous spots on the globe , determined to bring aid and comfort to the afflicted , wherever she found them this meant , of course , that her constituency was impossibly large the world is filled with people who have nowhere to turn i think going to afghanistan and seeing the innocent victims of the war had a particular impact on her , said medea benjamin , a close friend of ms ruzicka s who traveled with her to afghanistan , and later to iraq we were all stunned when we actually saw the widows that had no way to feed their families because their husbands had been killed when a bomb fell on their neighborhood by mistake or a little boy who picked up a cluster bomb and had his arm blown off , and nobody was helping him get a prosthetic limb or people whose homes had been destroyed and were living in the cold , literally just living outside that trip , and subsequent trips to iraq , inspired ms ruzicka s last big campaign she would try to do what her government had refused to do she began personally gathering as much information as possible , often going from door to door in the war zones , sometimes covered by an abaya and a hijab , in an effort to document the destruction and the suffering her goal was twofold first , to secure compensation for the relatives of innocent victims who were killed , and for the many thousands of noncombatants who have been wounded or displaced and , second , to get the us government to establish an office or agency , perhaps within the state department , to collect data and report on the civilian casualties of war for an individual with so few obvious resources she established a tiny organization called the campaign for innocent victims in conflict \( civic \) and had very little money ms ruzicka s reach was tremendous she worked tirelessly over the past three years with the office of senator patrick leahy , a vermont democrat , to get millions of dollars in compensation for civilian victims in iraq and afghanistan tim rieser , an aide to the senator , said she came here as a very sort of na ve antiwar protestor , really , and became someone who was extraordinarily effective at putting politics aside not trying to cast blame , but rather working with everyone from us military officers to the congress and others on how to actually help people she was out there doing something that all of us knew was really needed , but that was too dangerous for most people to want to do , or be willing to do ms ruzicka , 28 , was killed on saturday in the chaos of iraq she and an iraqi colleague , faiz ali salim , were trapped in their car on the airport road in baghdad when a suicide bomber attacked a convoy that was passing nearby ms ruzicka s vehicle was engulfed in flames she and mr salim burned to death i interviewed many people who were griefstricken but anxious to share memories of ms ruzicka none were as eloquent as her dad , clifford , a civil engineer from lakeport , calif when i asked if he and his wife , nancy , both rocksolid republicans , had been surprised by their daughter s intense commitment to humanitarian causes , he said no she s been like that all her life she had this calling and she pursued it with vigor she did n't do it for political gain or monetary gain she did it out of love i think her legacy will be to forever change the attitude of the us government and the us military on how they deal with collateral damage oped columnist email bobherb nytimescom
the box , filled with yellowing papers that detail a life cut short and a trail long cold , languished for decades in a dusty quadrant of the basement beneath police headquarters in lower manhattan it contained a jumble of leads and theories , pieces of a 75yearold puzzle that has intrigued generations of new yorkers none ever led to an answer in the most storied disappearance in the city s history , that of a state supreme court justice named joseph force crater but the death of a 91yearold woman in bellerose , queens , this year , and notes she left to be read by her family upon her death , prompted new york city police detectives to retrieve the file and begin reinvestigating the mysterious disappearance as a murder , one perhaps authored by a city police officer and his cabdriver brother , both now dead while theories on the fate of judge crater a denizen of tammany hall , a man of punctual habits , a bon vivant and a fancier of chorus girls have abounded over the years since his disappearance on aug 6 , 1930 the notes put forward a new one that detectives have been pursuing but have not fully assessed as far as we know , the story we have is speculative , one investigator said it may be some lady s scribbling all police officials and investigators contacted yesterday spoke on the condition of anonymity , because they have not been authorized to talk about the case the woman , stella ferruccigood , who died in early april , wrote that her husband had told her that he learned over drinks with one or both of the brothers that they , along with several other men , had killed the judge and buried him under the coney island boardwalk in brooklyn along with the theories , the judge s disappearance has spawned countless newspaper headlines , the most recent of which appeared yesterday in the new york post i killed judge crater vanish mystery solved ' perhaps premature , the single quotation marks notwithstanding , and very likely confusing to all but the most devoted aficionados of new york lore who saw it screaming from the newsstands it joined others published in the last 75 years , like crater hunt swings to havana jersey girl insists she saw crater aug 8 ransom of 20 , 000 asked for crater and crater was killed , exwife says again the notes , which a granddaughter passed on to the police after mrs ferruccigood died several months ago , made no mention of motive , leaving the field wide open on this most wide open of cases , police officials said but one official , and several investigators with some knowledge of the inquiry , said yesterday that the cold case squad detectives reinvestigating the disappearance have been unable to corroborate the central elements of her account in her notes , some of which were scribbled in the margins of more recent copies of the daily news , mrs ferruccigood wrote that her husband told her that frank burns , the taxi driver , told him that he had picked up the 41yearold judge the night he disappeared after dining at billy haas s chophouse on west 45th street in midtown , the official said according to her husband s account , mr burns drove a few blocks , then two accomplices jumped in the cab , and they drove to coney island , where they were joined by two more men there , the judge was killed and buried beneath the boardwalk near west eighth street , the official said mrs ferruccigood wrote detectives , who are still combing files , have been unable to find records of any bodies found in that area , which was excavated in the 1950 s for the construction of the new york aquarium , the official said over the years , the intrigue of the judge s disappearance became so imbedded in new york city s public consciousness that the term pulling a crater became slang for vanishing the conventional wisdom at the time , because of his large bank withdraws cited in newspaper reports , was that he had fled , but , in fact , his wife later acknowledged that she had found the money he was declared legally dead in 1939 and the police department s missing person s case was closed in 1979 by then , it had long been a favorite of amateur and professional sleuths , and a staple for newspapers over the years , which would revisit the mystery on the 20th , 30th , 50th and , most recently , the 75th anniversary of his disappearance news accounts over the years have recalled the dapper judge , wearing a brown suit , gray spats and a panama hat , climbing into a taxi and bidding his dinner companions goodnight at about 9 15 pm , bound for the theater but richard j tofel , the author of an october 2004 book about the case vanishing point the disappearance of judge crater and the new york he left behind expressed skepticism yesterday about the version of events that mrs ferruccigood passed on from her husband mr tofel said he was unable to find any accounts from witnesses who saw the judge get into a taxi , adding that it was likely that he attended the theater that evening he had tickets to the show dancing partner , which he had seen before my hunch is he went and saw the second act of the show because he was more interested in the showgirls , mr tofel said mr tofel s theory of the judge s evening is vastly different from the one set forth in mrs ferruccigood s notes he said he believed the judge ended his life in the arms of a prostitute at the brothel run by the celebrated madam polly adler mrs ferruccigood s recollections also left the judge s disappearance entangled with another coney island mystery that has also become a staple of new york city crime lore , that of abe reles mr reles , a murder incorporated assassin known at the time on the streets of brooklyn as kid twist , and then , after his untimely demise , as the canary who could sing but could not fly fell , or was pushed , out a sixthfloor window of the half moon hotel on coney island , where he was under guard waiting to testify against one of the leaders of the killing combine , louis \( lepke \) buchalter ms ferruccigood also wrote that her husband told her that the police officer brother of frank burns was indirectly implicated in the judge s disappearance the police official said that the brother , charles burns , was also mr reles s bodyguard detectives said they had begun trying to determine whether charles burns was assigned to the hotel when mr reles died , one investigator said but however judge crater died , the entire episode made a great many people uncomfortable , mr tofel said this was very close to the throne and they wanted it covered up , he said of the judge s tammany hall ties and the corruption in the city at the time even if they did n't know what happened , and this is the thesis of my book , i think a lot of people knew that no good could come of people delving into judge crater s affairs

third baseman david wright and shortstop jos reyes are among the faces of the mets' future but they have already paid dividends this season wright is second on the team in home runs with seven , and the speedy reyes had four triples last week wright and reyes have combined to play less than two full seasons in their major league careers , so some growing pains are to be expected with five outs remaining in yesterday s series finale against the yankees , their youth and inexperience cost the mets dearly in their 53 loss at shea stadium in the top of the eighth inning , the yankees had no runners on base with one out the mets were clinging to a 31 lead , with dae sung koo pitching in relief of pedro mart nez but then wright fumbled tony womack s grounder to third base , the ball hitting the heel of his glove for the next few minutes , wright led the mets in errors this season with six the next batter , ruben sierra , hit a grounder to second baseman miguel cairo , who underhanded the ball to reyes for what looked to be the genesis of a double play but reyes , with his back to first base , bobbled the ball , and the yankees had runners on first and second suddenly , wright had company atop the leader board it was reyes s sixth error , too roberto hernandez relieved koo to face alex rodriguez the yankees then executed a double steal , with wright failing to cover third catcher mike piazza did not make a throw after rodriguez fouled out , the yanks took a 43 lead when hideki matsui singled in two runs and bernie williams doubled home matsui manager willie randolph said he was disappointed that his team blew a chance to have a really special weekend but he said that hidden in the loss were important lessons for his young players you learn from your experiences , and when you make mistakes , you pay for them , randolph said whether it s david wright or jos reyes or whoever it might be , you understand that when you get a crucial situation coming up , you have to make a play and even after it happens , you still learn from it and just move on wright , who made his major league debut in the middle of last season , stood in front of his locker after the game , speaking as if he were his toughest critic the way i feel , this one s on my shoulders , he said as for not covering third on the double steal , wright said , we might have gotten crossed up on some signs reyes , who was first called up in 2003 , shared the blame i just tried to be too quick with the ball , make a double play too quick , he said randolph called reyes a young and enthusiastic player who competes at a high speed but he added that the mets were working on slowing reyes down none of the mets' veterans approached reyes with words of encouragement cliff floyd said that a pat on the butt would suffice they understand the game , and they know what they 're doing out there on the field , floyd said it s not like we 're waiting for these guys to mature into some great ballplayers in my opinion , they 're great the veterans also made their share of errors in the series on friday , the right side of the infield committed gaffes second baseman kazuo matsui and first baseman doug mientkiewicz made errors on consecutive plays , allowing the yankees to seize a lead they never relinquished even though each position of the mets' infield committed an error during the series , randolph insisted that he had one of the best defensive teams in the league the mets entered yesterday s game with 25 errors , tied for ninth in the national league no , our defense is fine , randolph said wright displayed some of that good defense with the bases loaded in the first inning he almost caught jason giambi s popup in foul territory that drifted into the stands two pitches later , giambi popped up to nearly the same location this time , wright dove into the stands , making a spectacular grab to end the inning a thankful mart nez pumped his fist and congratulated wright it was something pretty to see , mart nez said so that can overtake the little error in the eighth inning

sure would be but contrary to popular belief , the quality of corporate earnings is on the slide again and , as a result , richard bernstein , chief united states strategist at merrill lynch , is advising investors to tread carefully there is an impression that the quality of earnings has improved dramatically , he said that is true relative to the worst levels of postbubble reporting , but relative to history , the absolute quality of earnings is quite poor and getting poorer mr bernstein reaches this depressing conclusion by analyzing the difference between the earnings that standard poor s 500 companies have reported under generally accepted accounting principles and operating earnings , the figures companies typically trumpet because they do not include writeoffs and other unusual items the difference between the two figures , mr bernstein says , is the gaap gap and it is widening in the most recent period the fourth quarter of 2004 the gap was 137 percent in other words , operating earnings were on average 137 percent higher than reported earnings while that figure is well down from the 40 percent gap reached in 2002 , it is much higher than the longterm , prebubble average of 67 percent the result while stock valuations may not be so high as they were before the bubble burst , the quality of earnings appears to be worse of course , none of this might matter if investors bought stocks based on gaap earnings but too many buy shares based on what companies report in their press releases and on their quarterly conference calls , which are often heavily skewed to earnings before the bad stuff the fact is , stocks trade on press releases , on what the headline number is , mr bernstein said and on the conference calls , companies talk about whatever numbers they want to talk about investors should still be very skeptical of the quality of earnings mr bernstein said that he thought the recent downturn in earnings quality began , not surprisingly , a couple of quarters ago , when the profit surge started to subside if times are good , companies are not under pressure to keep their growth profile up , he said in tough times , when you get a cyclical company that has been coined by the street as a growth company , it feels pressure to keep up that profile that s when the earnings games usually begin by focusing on operating earnings , rather than on more stringent reported figures , companies try to steer investors away from mistakes such as asset writedowns or restructuring charges but these factors reflect bad choices by managers such as overpriced acquisitions and should definitely not be excluded from investors' analyses the difference between operating and reported earnings is an indication of how well executives are managing the balance sheet of their company , mr bernstein said this is often lost on investors who pay little heed to the balance sheet the five companies with the widest gap between reported earnings and operating income currently , according to the merrill lynch analysis , are eastman kodak georgia pacific , a paper products company rowan companies , an oil drilling concern ford motor and clorox mr bernstein said the vast majority of companies with the biggest gaps between reported earnings and operating income are of lesserquality , those whose common stocks are ranked b or below by sp among the five with the widest gap , all are rated b or below except clorox , which is rated a so investors can often limit their exposure to earnings shenanigans by sticking with highquality issues but such a strategy wo n't offer full protection as mr bernstein noted , 22 percent of the companies with the largest gaps between reported and operating earnings were rated b or better by sp mr bernstein said he thought the earnings games would be curtailed sharply if the securities and exchange commission required that all company communications with investors reflected figures computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles then there would be no confusion among investors about what a particular company really earned in a quarter the reason you have gaap is so investors have consistent clear information , mr bernstein said the us has always prided itself on having the most transparent financial markets but over the past 5 to 10 years , the us market has become more opaque , and foreign markets have become more transparent that has huge implications for the economy as a whole and for the cost of capital
silvia broome is not just an employee of the united nations , where she works as an interpreter she is also a passionate believer in its goals and ideals , and holds fast to the conviction that it offers the best hope for addressing the violence and corruption running rampant across the globe when she explains this to tobin keller , a secret service agent assigned to protect her from a sinister conspiracy \( and also to investigate her possible involvement in it \) , he responds with a smirk you 've had a tough year , he says and that is pretty much the only contact that the interpreter , a glossy new picture directed by sydney pollack , makes with the world as we know it this kind of movie , stuffed with intimations of faraway strife and people in suits talking frantically on cellphones and walkietalkies , is conventionally described as a political thriller , but the interpreter is as apolitical as it is unthrilling a handsomelooking bluechip production with a singularly impressive oscar pedigree , it disdains anything so crude , or so risky to its commercial prospects , as a point of view the role of the united nations in the face of shifting geopolitical alliances and ferocious ethnic conflicts is a rich and complicated topic , as a glance at the past few weeks' newspapers will confirm , but none of that complexity troubles the shiny surface of this film , which is mainly interested in the united nations as a piece of architecture it should be said that the organization s headquarters building on first avenue at 44th street in manhattan is beautifully shot , both from without and within darius khondji s cinematography captures the clean , elegant modernism that at once expresses the building s idealistic purpose and places it in a bygone era of internationalist optimism making the united nations look good is easy compared to the movie s main imaginative ambition , which is to turn nicole kidman , apotheosis of all that is blond in hollywood today , into the embodiment of african suffering silvia , ms kidman s character , may have a european education , but her roots are in the troubled \( and fictional \) african nation of matobo , where her parents were white farmers lest we think that she was therefore aligned with apartheid or colonial oppression the interpreter is not , after all , mr pollack s sequel to out of africa , or at least not quite we see old photographs of silvia and her brother bearing arms in a noble multiracial cause she is fond of quoting the wisdom of the ku , a tribe whose views on vengeance and mourning are at odds with the grim state of her country \( the moral of the interpreter is , in effect , do as the ku say , not as the ku do \) matobo is ruled by one dr zuwanie \( earl cameron \) , a vaguely mugabelike figure who followed a familiar path from liberator to genocidal maniac , and who has squandered both the hopes of his people and the respect of the united nations member states it is a measure of just how bad he is that both french and american diplomats agree that he should face some kind of justice , and also that his two main rivals an oldschool socialist \( curtiss i' cook \) and an apostle of capitalist development \( george harris \) have put aside their differences to oppose him more effectively as it happens , the dictator is on his way to new york to address the general assembly , and silvia , returning to the office to retrieve her african flutes , overhears someone plotting to kill him when he makes his speech this strikes tobin \( sean penn \) as too convenient to be entirely coincidental , and as he digs into silvia s background he begins to suspect that she is more deeply enmeshed in matobo s intrigue than she lets on the great disappointment of the script is that it fudges the question of her involvement , leaving some gaping holes you can discuss with your friends at your favorite matoban restaurant after the movie more thought has gone into addressing the challenge of giving mr penn something to do that could n't be done by a secondstring copshow actor on television to ensure that silvia does not suffer alone , tobin is provided with his own back story of grief and loss , which mr penn must relate in tearful moments when the plot takes a break from third world misery at first , mr penn and ms kidman , his brow as dramatically furrowed as hers is smooth , promise some interesting chemistry their first scene together has a brisk , parryandthrust rhythm , as silvia , hiding behind a lock of hair gone strategically astray , frustrates tobin s attempts to figure her out but after that , nothing much happens ms kidman , as ever , nimbly switches between vulnerability and clever toughness while adding another unusual accent to her roster of achievements mr penn seems a bit more uncertain , burrowing with his characteristic earnestness into a role that hardly exists from time to time , you may detect a wink of brandoesque detachment , but more flagrant subversion would have turned this character from the pedestrian confection of a screenwriting committee into someone worth watching that committee which included steven zaillian , who won an oscar for schindler s list , and scott frank , nominated for out of sight failed to come up with either a diverting whodunit or a plausible moral melodrama mr pollack s direction walks the line between competence and complacency as the day of dr zuwanie s arrival approaches , the pace of the narrative accelerates , the action moves from turtle bay to crown heights and something blows up the two principals are driven by their respective hardships into a chaste moment of snuggling , and tobin s partner , dot , fires off some impatient wisecracks dot is played by catherine keener , a wonderful , underused actress who , if there is any justice in hollywood , will someday have her own chance to embody the sufferings of the african continent the interpreter is rated pg13 \( parents strongly cautioned \) it has violence and some profanity the interpreter opens today nationwide directed by sydney pollack written by charles randolph , scott frank and steven

regulators are examining scores of transactions set up by the american international group with about a dozen offshore concerns to determine whether the company , the world s leading insurer , struck deals to enhance its financial position or performance , according to a person briefed on the investigation the transactions under scrutiny by regulators are in addition to the dozen or so problematic transactions uncovered by aig s internal review the latter transactions , some of which involve deals with the offshore entities , could lead to a significant financial restatement by the company , according to a person briefed on the review of interest to regulators , whose investigation of aig came to light last month , are the offshore companies that specialize in reinsurance the business of insuring other insurance companies and that do most or all of their business with american international group as is the case with most big insurers , aig buys reinsurance from other companies to shed some of the risks associated with the insurance it has written but if no risk is transferred in a transaction , then the reinsurance resembles a loan , and favorable insurance accounting treatment cannot be used reinsurers that do most or all of their business with american international group include two companies in bermuda , stockton reinsurance and western general insurance , according to the most recent figures compiled by schedulefcom , a research firm that is a collaboration of the reinsurance association of america and specialty insurance research , a unit of dowling partners stockton re , according to a bermuda insurance industry web site , is a reinsurer that has specialized in financial reinsurance , or finite insurance , a business that can be viewed by regulators as dubious when there is no risk transfer involved threequarters of stockton re s business is conducted with aig the company appears to have stopped writing new coverage , but the most recent figures indicate that its 312 million in reinsurance recoverables are from aig recoverables are what a reinsurer owes to the primary insurer when losses occur the most recent figures show that aig s recoverables total 21 billion stockton did not return a phone call left over the weekend , seeking comment western general also has a sizable relationship with american international group the most recent figures show that 83 percent of its premiums were associated with aig 99 percent of western s recoverables , or 11 billion , were associated with aig western general is owned by the pritzker family , the wealthy chicago investors behind hyatt hotels officials at western did not return phone messages requesting comment hannover re of germany is another company that conducts considerable reinsurance business with aig the most recent figures show hannover with 34 billion in recoverables from aig the company is aig s largest reinsurer hannover said earlier this month that it had received subpoenas from the new york attorney general s office and that it was cooperating with the inquiry robert arvanitis , president of risk finance advisors , a corporate finance advisory firm in westport , conn , specializing in insurance , said that the broadening investigation into insurance was not surprising , given the industry s complex and opaque operations insurance is the last inefficient frontier being dragged up to the standards of the rest of the capital markets , he said union excess reinsurance company ltd , richmond insurance company ltd and pillar insurance company are three other offshore companies that do all of their business with american international group none of the companies has been accused of wrongdoing offshore reinsurance entities , which are lightly regulated , are often set up with minimum capital and for very narrow purposes , sometimes even a single transaction , according to insurance specialists insurers can do deals with offshore entities to smooth their earnings , get around capital requirements , defer taxes or bolster their balance sheets as a result , regulators are trying to determine whether the transactions american international group conducted with these companies were done for legitimate reasons transferring risk and assuming the economic responsibility for doing so or simply as a way to obtain favorable tax or accounting treatment regulators examining the close ties these companies have with aig could determine that the transactions between the companies were not conducted at arm s length if so , then true risk was not transferred , running afoul of insurance accounting , and the transactions may have to be reversed that would bring liabilities back onto aig s financial statements and require the company to restate results to eliminate revenues generated by the deals chris winans , an aig spokesman , declined to comment on the company s relationships with the reinsurers the company disclosed in february that it was being investigated by the securities and exchange commission and the new york attorney general s office the company is cooperating with the investigation american international group s internal review is continuing it is scrambling to meet a deadline of thursday to file its annual financial report with the sec
amid the flurry of yearend statistics , consider this one new york city put fewer dogs and cats to death this year than in any year on record since the 1890 s city shelters put to death 23 , 684 dogs and cats in 2004 , according to animal care and control , the group that runs the city shelters the figure , which accounts for killings through dec 30 , is down by about 17 percent from last year , and by more than a third compared with 10 years ago this year s drop was sharp , but not unexpected the number of animals killed has been falling ever since the 1930 s , when spaying and neutering started to become common practice in new york and stray populations began to decline , animal experts said the number of stray animals peaked in the depression , according to the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals , which has tracked new york s figures since 1894 , the year it became the city s animal caretaker the records show the highest number in 1928 , when about 287 , 000 animals , mostly cats , were killed there are fewer unwanted animals being born , said edward boks , executive director of new york city animal care and control , which took over the city shelters from the aspca in 1995 the city has not always bragged about declines in killings at the end of the 19th century , when stray dogs were more likely to carry disease and ran wild , an increase in killings was often taken as a sign of improved animal population control in its 1895 annual report , the aspca boasted that it had killed more dogs and cats than any city agencies before it , said stephen zawistowski , head of national programs for the association dogs served a different purpose then , said mr zawistowski , who helped compile a report dealing with the history of strays in new york city that was published in the journal of applied animal welfare science in 1998 dogs drew carts for ragmen they ran inside large wheels to turn rotisseries only the most affluent new yorkers had dogs as household companions animal protection groups focused on horses early methods of killing would raise hackles today in manhattan , dogs were put in iron cages and drowned in the east river , mr zawistowski said in brooklyn , dogs were clubbed to death when economic times are hard for people , they 're also hard for their animals , mr zawistowski said during the depression , he said , cats were proliferating and taking over parts of the city in the warehouse areas and docks almost none of the cats were adopted it was not until after world war ii that dogs and cats began to be held as household pets by large numbers of american families , mr zawistowski said the change was part of a broader social transformation , as average americans became more affluent by the 1970 s , the number of dogs and cats killed each year dropped off precipitously spaying and neutering had become socially acceptable ways of controlling unwanted pet populations in 1972 , the aspca began requiring that all animals up for adoption in its shelters be sterilizedthe first lowcost animal sterilization clinic in the country opened in neptune , nj , in 1957 , said merritt clifton , editor of animal people , a newspaper in washington state that covers animal protection and keeps national statistics on euthanasia new york has one of the lowest kill rates in the country , when measured against human population according to animal people s figures , new york killed 32 dogs and cats per 1 , 000 people in 2004 , a rate far below the national average of 174 per 1 , 000 in comparison , san antonio , with a population of just over one million , killed about 35 animals per 1 , 000 people in 2003 , mr clifton said the rate in new york should be adjusted upward , he said , to compensate for the fact that there are fewer pets per capita in new york than in other cities mr boks said his organization planned to make it unnecessary to kill any animals within the next four years , largely through sterilization programs and the encouragement of adoptions new yorkers began adopting on a large scale in the 1950 s and 1960 s this year , adoptions jumped by about half , to 15 , 587 animals , up from 10 , 564 in 2003
for four years , a sizable obstacle stood between albert pujols , the st louis cardinals' talented young slugger , and his first national league most valuable player award that obstacle was barry bonds with every remarkable season pujols compiled , bonds outdid him , unwilling to relent the honor but with bonds limited to 14 games in 2005 because of a knee injury , pujols finally commanded the spotlight with another dynamic season , and yesterday he ended bonds s fouryear stranglehold on the award it s awesome when you hear people compare you to barry , the 25yearold pujols said after being named the mvp all 32 voters from the baseball writers' association of america awarded pujols , a first baseman , a first or secondplace vote he received 18 firsts and 378 total points , beating out atlanta braves center fielder andruw jones and chicago cubs first baseman derrek lee jones received 13 firstplace votes , 17 seconds and 2 thirds for 351 points lee , who received one firstplace vote , had 263 points none of the 29 others who received votes collected anything higher than a fourthplace vote pujols ranked among the leaders in nearly every significant offensive category , playing in 161 games despite a nagging heel injury that he said made it a chore to get out of bed in the morning his 330 batting average was second only to lee s 335 , and he led the league with 129 runs scored he finished with 41 homers , behind only jones \( 51 \) and lee \( 46 \) and he was second in the league with 117 runs batted in , 360 total bases , a 430 onbase percentage and a 609 slugging percentage he was a constant for the cardinals , who won the nl central for the third time in four seasons in his four previous seasons , pujols had a strong supporting cast , but injuries shredded the cardinals' lineup , knocking out scott rolen for the season and reggie sanders and larry walker for long stretches since 2001 , when he was the nl rookie of the year , pujols has averaged 40 homers and 124 rbi , batting 332 with a 416 onbase percentage and a 621 slugging percentage every year his statistics measured up to bonds s , but he could not surpass him when the mvp votes were tallied he finished fourth in the voting in 2001 , second in 2002 and 2003 , and third last season i do n't think about the past , pujols said i think about the present and the future jones and lee each won gold gloves this season it was jones s eighth in a row and lee s second in the last three seasons lee also led the nl in hits \( 199 \) , doubles \( 50 \) , extrabase hits \( 99 \) and slugging percentage \( 662 \) but neither player was as dominant from start to finish as pujols was jones batted 239 in april and 208 in september lee appeared poised to win the triple crown through the first half , but cooled off after the allstar game break pujols batted at least 322 in every month but august , when he hit 287 but had 7 homers and 16 rbi in a statement released yesterday , cardinals manager tony la russa said albert s award was well deserved because he was the most valuable player to our team across the board , as soon as he showed up to the ballpark until he left his value went well beyond statistics
dubai , united arab emirates , dec 3 when young iranians like arash tale look across the skyline of this rapidly growing city , they see what their parents once saw in american and european skylines opportunity , riches and freedom mr tale , 24 , founder and publisher of a real estate magazine aimed at iranian investors , is one of a new generation of educated iranians who have eschewed dreams of heading west for the more easily realizable destination of dubai , where home is only a 45minute flight across the persian gulf , iranian passports draw no extra scrutiny and nightclubs are as accessible as mosques getting a visa to canada or the us is almost impossible now , said mr tale here , you just buy a property and you get a residence dubai is building an environment of freedom that still fits our culture thousands of iranians , most of them wealthy , are making the leap , investing in real estate , starting businesses and opening second homes , turning this desert country into an iranian business hub free of the corruption , american penalties and political turbulence they face in iran mr tale , who studied in australia , came last year in the hopes of profiting from the construction boom here , which is fed in significant part by iranian money his biweekly real estate guide , maskan , with its print run of 12 , 000 copies , disappears from the stands in days this is a bridge between iran and the west , mr tale said it s like america 25 years ago , where if you are smart and you have a plan , you can make money iranians were the first to jump in when dubai s real estate projects opened to foreigners more than three years ago they now control 10 percent to 30 percent of the developments being sold , the iranian business council and others report a recent report by an iranian cultural publication estimated that up to 400 , 000 iranians control some 200 billion in assets in dubai other estimates put the number far lower , 20 billion , still a significant sum iranian businesses make up about a tenth of the companies operating in the socalled free zone , dubai s vast taxfree industrial and business zone , helping to increase trade between the united arab emirates and iran to an expected 7 billion this year from 4 billion in 2003 and that does not include the illicit trade that can never be accounted for the iranians rushing here are mainly seeking the same formula personal freedom , political and economic stability and a break from the west s political tensions with iran businessmen use dubai s freemarket zones to funnel goods across the gulf , skirting the trade sanctions in place against iran since the 1979 revolution youngsters come for schooling minus the mullahs , while older iranians come for a more comfortable and cosmopolitan life the boundaries are closed in iran because of political policies , said peiman haqhiqhat , 29 , who moved to dubai with his new wife in 2004 he had been teaching computer engineering courses at the islamic azad university in tehran when he was invited to teach at the university s new dubai campus you have more freedom here to live as you want , he said here you can interact with people from other countries it is interesting for me the effect of the flight of iranian cash to dubai became apparent when the tehran stock exchange plummeted in october , in the wake of an international atomic energy agency resolution on sept 24 to refer iran to the united nations security council for violating its nuclear obligations the agency has not yet formally made the referral , but such a move could result in international sanctions officials said iranian investors appeared to be moving millions into dubai s stock market , which had opened to foreign investors only weeks earlier the iranian government appears to be tolerating the exodus , as evidenced by dubai s huge iranian club financed by the iranian government , it is the largest country club for a single expatriate community in the city , with nightly cultural events , soccer fields of lush grass and a renowned restaurant several iranian schools operate here , too , while iranian pop stars schedule frequent concerts for the iranian community dubai and iran have long had a special relationship , unusual even in the arab world a quarter of the citizens of the emirates trace their roots to iran during the iraniraq war in the 1980 s , dubai became a crucial transshipment point for goods and supplies , and the late president of the united arab emirates , sheik zayed bin sultan alnahyan , argued for a more balanced relationship with iran s ruling clerics than that of the policies pushed by the united states the proximity does mean that the government can keep close tabs on its citizens here many iranians were afraid to speak on the record for this article for fear of retribution from the government mr haqhiqhat said that he felt a degree of ambivalence about leaving iran , but that the current political environment made him glad to be in dubai maybe in the future the situation in iran will get worse , he said there may be limitations on people s freedom , and this can affect how long i stay here perhaps influenced by a growing influx of iranianamericans , too , some dubai streets are beginning to resemble parts of los angeles , home to one of the largest iranian communities outside iran dubai s heavily iranian deira section has long streets divided by shrubbery , dotted by swanky stores like gucci and iceberg , and teeming with rows of iranian restaurants and businesses this is a very nice , very free , very safe and rich country in the neighborhood which is very unique , said zahra tehrani , who owns the iranian sweets palace none of the other countries near iran have this you have everything that you have in europe and america , but close to home
the bush administration is proceeding briskly with its demolition job on the environmental regulations it inherited from previous administrations , especially the rules protecting the national forests against commercial exploitation over the last four years , the forest service has weakened agreements aimed at preserving oldgrowth trees and wildlife in the pacific northwest and in the sierra nevada it persuaded congress to adopt its misnamed healthy forests initiative that helps timber companies as much as it helps communities at risk from forest fire it threatens to overturn president bill clinton s popular roadless rule protecting the most remote areas of the forests , and it has already removed those protections from the tongass national forest in alaska then last week , just before christmas the administration s preferred time for unveiling bad news it announced a radical overhaul of the rules governing the management of the nation s 155 national forests the ostensible purpose of the change is to streamline a cumbersome management process and give individual forest managers more flexibility to respond to threats like wildfires and the increasing use of the forests by offroad vehicles but the new rules would also eliminate vital environmental reviews , as mandated by the national environmental policy act of 1969 , jettison wildlife protections that date to president ronald reagan , restrict public input , and replace detailed regulations , like those limiting clearcuts and protecting streams , with vague resultsbased goals these are unacceptably high costs to pay for regulatory efficiency more broadly , the whole idea of giving local managers more flexibility defies history , however reasonable it appears on the surface the main reason congress enacted the national forest management act in 1976 was that the public had lost confidence in the forest service , not only local foresters but also their bosses in washington , who seemed mainly interested in harvesting timber no matter what the cost to the forest s ecological health there are , of course , forest mangers who act responsibly and the administration promises that forest plans will be regularly audited under an environmental management system it has borrowed from private industry but it is not clear who will be conducting these audits \( indeed , it s entirely possible the timber industry could end up monitoring itself \) nor , given the vagueness of the new guidelines , are there any longer clear standards against which foresters and their plans can be measured this is a recipe for trouble forest supervisors have always been subject to fierce pressures from timber companies and the communities that depend upon them for jobs unless the law unambiguously requires them to protect nature giving them legal cover to resist industry pressures we could see a return to the days when what counted on a r sum was not whether a manager harmonized the competing needs of nature and commerce but whether he met his annual cut representative tom udall and others in congress may try to overturn these rules legislatively their chances in this congress are slim to none it s also true that in a purely statistical sense , the stakes for both sides are not as high as they were 15 years ago , when about 30 percent of domestic timber production came from the national forests today that figure is about 5 percent , partly because of shifting industry priorities and partly because of court rulings protecting endangered species like the spotted owl and their forest habitat still , there s plenty of room for mischief , especially if president bush succeeds in rescinding the roadless rule people like mr udall are right to keep fighting
today is the birthday of a man thought by many to be the nation s greatest president it is also the birthday of a man whom many believe to be if not the nation s greatest theologian , at least to come close that is no coincidence , because they are the same man abraham lincoln seems an unlikely candidate for the theological hall of fame he belonged to no church he had read little theology the exact nature of his religious beliefs remains a matter for debate lincoln s standing as a theological thinker rests , above all , on his second inaugural address although its closing lines about binding up the nation s wounds with malice toward none , with charity for all are so familiar and so susceptible to a sentimental reading that the extraordinary force of the whole speech can be missed , a sizable and thoughtful literature has grown up around this address mark noll , an outstanding historian of american religion , has done something further in america s god from jonathan edwards to abraham lincoln \( oxford university press , 2002 \) he compares lincoln with the acknowledged theological minds of that era none of america s respected religious leaders , professor noll wrote , mustered the theological power so economically expressed in lincoln s second inaugural none probed so profoundly the ways of god or the response of humans to the divine constitution of the world none penetrated as deeply into the nature of providence and none described the fate of humanity before god with the humility or the sagacity of the president consider that famous peroration who would be for malice or against charity \? but as professor noll points out , the operative words here are toward none and for all that included the still undefeated enemy as well as union soldiers and innocent victims this , at a time when henry ward beecher \( the billy graham of his era , professor noll calls him \) was preaching a vision of southern leaders these guiltiest and most remorseless traitors , the evildoers who had drenched a continent in needless blood cast down by god into endless retribution almost alone among his contemporaries , professor noll explained , lincoln did not presumptuously assume that the moral high ground belonged to only his side by questioning the righteousness of the north and by failing to denounce the south in absolute terms , he joined a very small minority in the spring and summer of 1865 if lincoln s magnanimity and his moral evenhandedness were generally religious , his view of providence was distinctly theological more than any other feature of this address , lincoln s conception of god s rule over the world set him apart from the recognized theologians of his day that conception was set forth dramatically in the central section of the speech , beginning with the declaration , the almighty has his own purposes and issuing into a complex reflection on how the providence of god could encompass both the existence of slavery and now its abolition and how that providence might further encompass even the terrible war as punishment of both north and south for their complicity in that evil fondly do we hope , fervently do we pray , that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away , lincoln continued but god s justice might not necessarily coincide with those hopes or with the nation s prosperity the lord s true and righteous judgments might require that all the wealth piled by the bondsman s 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and that every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword these were hard words , and few religious leaders were willing to speak them for the theologians , professor noll wrote , there was little mystery in how god dealt with the world for lincoln there was awesome mystery for the theologians , god s power remained securely tethered to the interests of the united states , however differently that interest was perceived but for lincoln , god s power was controlled by no one but god and finally , he wrote , for the theologians , the end of the war only tightened the bond between god and his american chosen people for lincoln the course of the war injected a doubt about whether america was the people of god these theologians were not backwoods preachers they were wellhoned thinkers who were also grappling during these years , often in impressively measured ways , with questions raised by darwin and herbert spencer and new and unsettling findings about the bible but about the central issue of their day , what they had to say is now of interest , professor noll noted , only to historians like himself , while the brief address on march 4 , 1865 , by an unchurched layman remains an object of intense study and admiration just short of 140 years after that address , it is easy to turn this paradox into a cheap lesson , to make it a populist demonstration of the lone soul s superiority to the theologically instructed , or to harness it to a secular critique of religious leaders' involvement in public affairs certainly contemporary theologians and religious leaders should pay heed to this episode but so might the nontheological and the nonreligious by easily identifying oneself with the profound president and not with the conventionridden theologians , one falls into the very selfrighteousness that blinded them lincoln and the theologians of this day shared an idiom of god s providential rule over the world s events that belief has not disappeared , but it is no longer the shared framework of public discussion today , the talk is of freedom , rights and opportunity , security , prosperity , pluralism and nondiscrimination contending within that framework are outlooks , both religious and secular , liberal and conservative , red and blue , no less certain of their own correctness and privileged place in the course of history than were lincoln s theological contemporaries subtract the mid19thcentury focus on divine providence and the contrast is still between what professor noll described as a morally nuanced picture of america s destiny and a morally juvenile view of the nation and its fate anyone absolutely confident of standing on lincoln s side of this contrast probably does n't
around the world , offshore oil and gas platforms are generally built to survive without serious damage a socalled 100year storm a hurricane so powerful that it typically occurs only once every hundred years hurricane ivan roared through the gulf of mexico a year ago , generating the highest waves ever recorded there in a storm considered likely to occur only once every 2 , 500 years given the scale of the hurricane , it was inevitable that it would wreak havoc in the gulf , america s biggest energyproducing region , uprooting miles of underwater pipelines , destroying platforms and crimping production for months but when industry officials , engineers and oceanographers gathered at an american petroleum institute conference in houston in july to discuss ways of improving the gulf s infrastructure , they expected to have plenty of time to work on the problems then katrina struck we 're seeing more 100year events happening more often , even every few years , said jafar korloo , who has designed , engineered and managed offshore platforms for unocal , the oil company recently acquired by chevron the bar has to be higher the stakes , too , are higher than before older production basins in texas and oklahoma have been on a gradual decline for years some potential oilproducing regions on land elsewhere in the united states are out of bounds in the meantime , more oil and gas has been gushing out of the gulf , which was first tapped half a century ago , amounting now to nearly a third of domestic output and the bulk of that production is concentrated at no more than a couple of dozen platforms , each costing 1 billion to 2 billion as the petroleum industry confronts the challenge of recovering as quickly as possible from katrina , officials are just beginning to assess the bigger , longerrange questions but clearly , they cannot count on nature being predictable most definitions of a 100year event were calculated before ivan and katrina , said bob hamilton , a vice president at the woods hole group , an ocean engineering group in massachusetts at this point , are the 100year criteria good enough \? hurricane katrina cut deeply into oil and gas production , shut down major refineries , sent gasoline prices to record highs and set off fears of an energy crisis oil companies , just as they did after earlier devastating gulf storms betsy in 1965 , camille in 1969 , ivan in 2004 are rethinking how they operate offshore but now they are asking themselves tougher questions we 've never seen anything like katrina , said tim sampson , one of the july conference organizers and the coordinator for drilling and production operations at the petroleum institute we have to consider the data and look at whether we need to update our standards according to the coast guard , katrina destroyed , damaged or sank about 50 of the 4 , 000 gulf platforms when it passed over the gulf s crowded waters , katrina was at its peak , a category 5 storm , the most powerful on the saffirsimpson scale winds of 175 miles an hour snapped mooring lines , sending some platforms adrift waves toppled steel structures , and underwater slides shifted the ground under pipelines , probably causing widespread damage that has yet to be fully assessed four installations owned by royal dutch shell , the gulf s largest operator , suffered extensive damage these included the biggest offshore facility in the region , a tensionleg platform called mars , which is expected to be out of commission for months after being shaved by the hurricane s winds and waves shell said its output which usually amounts to 450 , 000 barrels a day , or nearly a third of the gulf s oil production would be down 40 percent until next year at its peak , the hurricane caused nearly the entire gulf oil region to be shut down a few days before katrina struck , oil companies closed off wells , evacuated the platforms and stopped production as a safety precaution from daily output of 15 million barrels a day , the region is now producing an average of 650 , 000 barrels a day , according to the interior department but since aug 26 , when the platforms were shut down , 20 million barrels of oil production has been lost , the equivalent of a day s consumption for the united states the loss in natural gas production , now back at 65 percent of its level before the storm , was 99 billion cubic feet despite the damage , many oil experts said that most of the offshore infrastructure fared remarkably well all the platforms that were destroyed were old and antiquated structures , some built in the late 1960 s and producing little oil the newer platforms , including shell s , did not suffer catastrophic structural damage after lengthy repairs , the company expects mars to resume full production moreover , the facilities offshore survived the storm better than those onshore because of flooding in coastal louisiana and mississippi , it will be months before a handful of major refineries and gasprocessing facilities are brought back online offshore , though , about 30 , 000 workers were safely flown out while there is much to repair , most of the platforms and rigs that operate at sea suffered relatively little major damage that s an absolute story of success , said dan orange , chief executive of aoa geophysics , a consulting firm you can do the best engineering in the world , but nature might still throw a curveball at you specialists are more worried about the state of the underwater pipeline network totaling 33 , 000 miles , the grid turned out to be the weakest link after hurricane ivan , which produced mudslides that snapped pipelines , shifted parts around and caused long delays and repairs before production could be resumed so far , there is little information on the state of the pipelines oil companies must test the pressure on their platforms before assessing the state of the pipelines but the fear is that some parts of that network have again been disabled engineers have known about the ravages caused by mudslides at the mouth of the mississippi delta since at least 1969 that was the year shell s south pass 70 platform was destroyed by mudslides set in motion by hurricane camille the destruction of the platform , which was brand new , shocked the industry and led to the development of structures with foundations as deep as 600 feet , well below the mud line but pipelines are a different matter , said jim hooper , an experienced geotechnical engineer and senior consultant for fugro mcclelland marine geosciences , who compared the seabed in some coastal areas to gelatin stretching at depths of 300 feet eventually , the waves get big enough and the jello fails , said mr hooper , a pioneer of the mudslideresistant platforms given that phenomenon , he said , pipelines cannot be easily buried most are simply laid on the unstable seabed or submerged somewhat to avoid fishing trawlers to prevent oil spills , they are designed with breakaways and valves that shut off automatically when the ground shifts the trick then is to find the parts and quickly snap them back together what it comes down to is that pipelines are fragile and failures will occur , mr hooper said the industry has learned to repair as fast as possible with larger quantities of oil coursing through some major pipelines , more costly solutions are now being considered , including burying the largest pipes well below mudslideprone regions or diverting around them but the biggest uncertainty is in the 100year storm criteria followed by the industry with more powerful storms occurring more frequently , the question is how to update certain design standards , like the height from the surface of the water to the lower deck of a platform the greater the distance , the bigger waves that can be cleared during a storm in the 1960 s , recommended deck heights or the air gap in industry jargon were 35 feet today , the most common recommendation is 55 feet but even that proved insufficient with hurricane ivan chevron s petronius platform was hit by a wave estimated at 90 feet from crest to trough its impact caused extensive damage requiring the installation to be shut down for six months for repairs the industry is feeling the strain hurricanes come in phases that alternate between quieter periods and more active seasons since 1995 , the atlantic has been in a period of stronger hurricanes that might last 10 or 15 years more , according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration from 1995 to 2004 , hurricane seasons averaged 136 tropical storms , 78 hurricanes and 38 major hurricanes six of these years were classified as hyperactive and 2005 is shaping up as another one by contrast , from 1970 to 1994 , hurricane seasons were quieter , averaging 9 tropical storms , 5 hurricanes and 15 major hurricanes none was a hyperactive season the last active period was in the 1960 s , said charles watson , president of kinetic analysis , which models the impact of hurricanes on the gulf s production people have been lulled by a period of inactivity but as with most debates over climate , there is little consensus on whether this means that hurricanes are becoming fiercer or whether global warming has had an effect one thing , though , seems certain with the global oil industry operating flat out , there is almost no margin for error life is getting complicated in the gulf , said joe suhayda , a coastal oceanographer formerly at louisiana state university , who now works as an oil industry consultant the industry has to address the environmental risk if i am going to build a platform , i have to look at the risk of that facility being destroyed by nature
hempstead , ny , dec 31 jets coach herman edwards says he has been sleep deprived during the last month while the jets have been trying to nail down a spot in the postseason but he perked up friday , the last practice of the regular season , and the final practice before the jets \( 105 \) take off saturday for st louis , where a victory would guarantee only their 11th playoff appearance in the franchise s often frustrating 45 seasons despite the urgency , friday s workout looked and felt the same as any other friday during the regular season , which began in september and will end sunday the routine has worked well enough for the jets , and if they succeed on sunday , they will make edwards the first jets coach to reach the playoffs three times this is not a day to change , edwards said after friday s practice when asked if the jets had done anything different to get ready for the rams \( 78 \) next week , there 'll be a day to change he smiled , thinking about that possibility players like routine , he added make them stay focused next week , it s different so the friday ritual was this team breakfast from 7 30 to 9 am specialteams meeting at 8 15 offensive and defensive units meeting at 9 practice from 11 15 to 12 30 then home before an earlyafternoon charter flight to st louis on saturday the rams also are in the running for a playoff berth the jets player with the most playoff experience is cornerback terrell buckley he has been in 14 postseason games , although none with the jets he was with the green bay packers , the miami dolphins , the denver broncos and the new england patriots before joining the jets in september , just after ray mickens sustained a seasonending injury in training camp you get up in the morning , brush your teeth , shower , like any day , buckley said when asked what practice was like friday , before a makeorbreak game we know it s christmas and new year s and a game that s the same as a playoff game but coach herm has handled it all the great coaches handle it the same way they tell you what s in store , they prepare you , give you perspective coach herm is different he played , and that gives him instant credibility buckley added , talking about edwards s playing days as a defensive back ten years as a db , 38 picks amazing i know his stats , huh \? buckley also knew that edwards played in super bowl xv with the philadelphia eagles what you have to remember about a playoff game and this is a playoff game is that you do n't go crazy until after the game is over , buckley said you have to remember that every game counts you do the normal things , then you turn it up a notch then you can think about the next one , and the possibility of the super bowl we have to win , buckley said , savoring the drama we play at high noon , the ok corral , clint eastwood , 'the good , the bad and the ugly ' buckley was just getting started , and he did not seem to be running out of metaphors , but then he excused himself to take a shower the daily routine , consistent for a whole season , took precedence in his three previous seasons with the jets , edwards has twice led the team to victories in the final regularseason game to open the door to the postseason in the playoffs , edwards is 12 but , he noted friday , many of the players who went through those tough tests with him are no longer with the jets this year s team is the youngest he has coached but we 've been in some big games this year already , and some of them on the road , edwards said that includes a victory in week 2 at san diego , where the jets could return next saturday night if they make the playoffs as the top wildcard team in the american football conference but the jets also lost at new england , in buffalo and in pittsburgh through it all , edwards has attempted to keep his players at a level they are accustomed to nothing has changed , even as december has intensified matters for the jets nothing , except the hours edwards is putting in i have n't seen my wife in two weeks , edwards said and we live together extra points the backup quarterback quincy carter practiced friday for the first time this week , attempting to recover from the flu coach herman edwards said it would be a gameday decision whether carter or brooks bollinger would be the backup to chad pennington for the fourth time in his seven seasons with the jets , running back curtis martin was voted the team s most valuable player by his teammates he is the league s thirdleading rusher with a teamrecord 1 , 544 yards linebacker eric barton was voted the jets' most inspirational player in taking the dennis byrd award pennington , who has played four games after missing three with a rotator cuff injury , received the ed block courage award
the yankeecentric myopia of the yes network reached a fascinating level of absurdity yesterday in a pregame show that virtually ignored the sight of the boston red sox receiving their world series rings oh , it was discussed , but not seen live during kimberly jones s 5minute24second report from fenway park , the camera never showed the ceremony , live or on tape this place is wild , jones told the studio host bob lorenz \( do tell \) the yankees are standing on the dugout steps , she said \( no , did n't see that \) derek lowe got a rousing ovation , she said \( sorry , missed that , too \) the yes cameras , having lost all mobility , remained in a tight closeup on jones \( you managed to see fans in the bleachers , but they were far away \) except during a taped interview with yankees manager joe torre , himself in a tight closeup , who said the team was not under orders to ignore the ceremony so while the yankees graciously watched from their dugout , yes would not show them watching jones then asked torre one of the silliest questions ever posed to a manager clearly , your players know the objective today no matter what happens before the game , is to win do you address that specifically with them at all \? torre surely resisted an impulse to be rude and said , if i have to tell them we need to win , we have the wrong bunch of players the handling of the ceremony in the pregame show was defended by john filippelli , the president of sports programming and production for yes our audience is 80 percent or more yankee fans , and they do n't want to see 45 minutes of the red sox getting their rings , he said i would n't do that to our audience yes is in business to promote the yankees that is what a teamowned regional sports network does and it is certainly reasonable to wonder if nesn , the red soxowned channel , would show much , or any , of a yankees ring ceremony but this was a different one , 86 years in the works , and certainly the most significant ring presentation since richard burton s gift of a 6942carat diamond to elizabeth taylor in 1969 nesn s pregame show in boston , viewed via directv at the espn zone in manhattan , was way over the top , with lots of highlights , fawning profiles , interviews with the red sox' owners and crazy fans , and 360degree tours of each ring but it also had a few live shots of the yankees' dugout , including one of torre and don mattingly applauding and another that yes should have had live or immediately after the introduction of mariano rivera his blown saves in the american league championship series \( along with another one that led to a loss last week \) endeared him to red sox fans he laughed at all the cheers he received but none of that was visible from 2 30 to 3 pm on yes , which must have believed that showing more than 30 seconds of clips in the pregame show would have undermined its raison d' tre pinstripe propaganda our fans went through enough pain last october , filippelli said they do n't want to relive it if you believe in such parochialism , then the historic event not seen live on yes was less important than highlights of sunday s loss to baltimore , the lineups for yesterday s game , key yankeesred sox matchups and a taped derek jeter interview that revealed that playing for the yankees is what he had always wanted to do with his life when the pregame focus turned to the yankees' announcers , they discussed the ceremony but only with two small clips , one of torre tipping his cap to red sox manager terry francona the camera on michael kay , jim kaat and bobby murcer never moved the huge 2004 world championship banner draped over the green monster was behind them its unfurling was seen in a taped clip to open the show you can see the outpouring of love as they 're handing out the rings , kay said \( guess you had to be there \) most of the yankees have all been on the top step , kaat said \( no , could n't see that \) the entire dugout was clapping for johnny pesky when he just came out , kay added \( missed that , too \) murcer provided the pr , saying the yankees' presence in the dugout showed that this was the classiest group i 've ever seen or met in baseball to yes s credit , it showed a package of highlights and the live vestiges of the ceremony between 3 o'clock and 3 15 , as the beginning of the game was pushed back but it was too late history knocked , and yes was slow to answer airwaves the dispute keeping msg and fox sports new york off time warner s cable systems is clearly hurting mets ratings without the fans in the 24 million time warner households , the combined rating for msg and fsny is down 54 percent but the two weekend games on channel 11 available to the entire market showed a 1 percent increase over last season
the archdiocese of new york notified six struggling roman catholic elementary schools yesterday one in greenwich village , one in rockland county and four in westchester that they would close at the end of the year , according to two people who were briefed on the plan the move comes days after brooklyn diocese officials said they would shutter 22 schools in the biggest round of catholic school closings in the city s history catholic school finances in new york have been battered by declining enrollment , rising costs and competition from other schools the archdiocese s spokesman , joseph zwilling , declined to confirm any closings last night but said , we have been looking at our schools in terms of enrollment to determine if they are filling their role and their mission as well as they possibly can according to one of the people who had been briefed , the schools notified yesterday included st anthony of padua in greenwich village st joseph s in spring valley , rockland county mount carmelst anthony in yonkers st pius x in scarsdale and two others in westchester county whose names he did not know the archdiocese covers manhattan , the bronx , staten island and seven counties north of the city parents at the affected schools were to be notified by letters sent home with their children this week at st anthony of padua , where enrollment has plummeted nearly 50 percent since 1999 , the pastor , joseph f lorenzo , seemed resigned after learning that the yellow brick school on macdougal street would shut its doors after 130 years it s a tough thing , he said , but added , it s something that was bound to happen over time the six schools make up 3 percent of the 216 elementary schools in the archdiocese more closings are likely in the months to come the archdiocese is in the early planning stages of a big reorganization that officials have said will result in the closing and consolidation of schools and parishes in cardinal edward m egan s column in the current issue of catholic new york , the archdiocesan newspaper , he warned , where we find huge churches with few parishioners , where we find schools that will educate more effectively when joined to nearby schools , the archdiocese will make the adjustments and accommodations that are required the larger reorganization , known as a realignment , is not expected to be formalized for months , archdiocese officials have said the consolidation of the archdiocese s sprawling school system was one of the main challenges handed to cardinal egan when he succeeded cardinal john o'connor in 2000 six schools is the most the archdiocese has closed since 1991 , when cardinal o'connor shut five elementary schools and three high schools over the years , critics accused cardinal o'connor of being too reluctant to close schools and parishes that no longer carried their weight the schools on the list have some of the lowest enrollments in the archdiocese st anthony of padua has only 112 students , father lorenzo said , or 12 per grade when the brooklyn diocese announced its closings last week , officials explained that a school with less than 25 students per grade was simply not financially viable mount carmelst anthony school in yonkers once anchored a thriving italian neighborhood over the years , generations of immigrants' children from several continents passed through its doors now the onestory school building stands forlorn on a garbagestrewn lot in a gritty neighborhood only 140 students were enrolled in the school last year nobody is closing the school really , the school is closing itself , by itself , said father terzo vinci , the pastor of our lady of mount carmel , the parish associated with the school if you are looking for a scapegoat , there is none the school just faded away by itself father vinci said that despite his attempts to draw in the children of the many mexicans moving into the neighborhood , nodine hill , their parents either could not afford the 3 , 000 annual tuition or had no interest in catholic education the school has received about 1 million in subsidies from the archdiocese over the past five years , he said in the wealthy suburb of scarsdale , where the st pius x school competes for students with public schools that are ranked among the nation s best , the school s enrollment for prekindergarten to eighth grade has dropped to 96 , said the rev john p o'brien , the pastor as long as we could sustain it , we did , he said we 're all sorry about it st anthony of padua , too , was a neighborhood institution in a western outpost of little italy that has been supplanted by the chic shops and childless households of soho of the few remaining students at the school , fewer still live in the parish , father lorenzo said the school has ceased being a parochial school , he said it reached the point where the tuition got too high and the population just dropped father lorenzo said that while the students at st anthony have been promised spots at other catholic schools , he felt bad for them their lives are being disrupted , he said in front of the school , a statue of st anthony , the patron saint of lost things and missing persons , stood beneath the streetlight , clutching a bible to his heart
the nation mourns the men and women in uniform who are killed or wounded in iraq , one by one but the public needs to be aware , and be worried , about the larger picture too our military and our military readiness have been strained and risk real , permanent damage twentyfive years ago , america s army was a lot larger and had a lot less to do now , a substantially smaller force is struggling to cope with the demands placed on it by iraq , where boots on the ground are in chronically short supply for much of the past two years , the bulk of america s frontline ground forces have been tied down in an openended counterinsurgency war they were not expected , or given the resources , to fight these soldiers and marines , activeduty and reserve , have shown courage and determination , despite shortages of armor and other equipment , involuntarily extended enlistments and accelerated rotations back into combat their fortitude has allowed the pentagon to sustain a situation that everyone recognizes cannot go on indefinitely , even though no end to the iraqi conflict is yet in sight the extended unplanned deployment of american forces is taking a heavy cumulative toll , especially on the army and army national guard it is undermining readiness and morale , and limiting america s ability to send substantial ground forces elsewhere to back up its diplomacy or respond to emerging threats the pentagon is beginning to resemble a desperate farmer who feeds his starving family the seed corn meant for sowing next year s crop to keep enough boots on the ground now , it is sacrificing the ability to retain the leaders of tomorrow as overdeployment has become chronic , promising young officers are opting not to reenlist when new crops of young people graduate from school , they will be less willing to combine their civilian careers with service in the army national guard recruitment is already down almost 30 percent the regular army is hurting too despite enlistment bonuses , it has had to speed up its reporting schedules , sending new recruits straight into basic training this growing crisis is not due to a lack of preparedness on the part of military brass , but to the ideology on which preparedness was based before iraq , pentagon dogma supported by most republican politicians and many conservative democrats held that united states troops were war fighters peacekeeping and nationbuilding were jobs for old europe well , that was then now , more than half of the regular army s fighting forces have either served in iraq , are currently there or can expect to be on their way soon , along with a substantial fraction of the marine corps and historically high proportions of the army national guard and reserves rotations are being accelerated , with units that have already served in iraq returning for second tours these faster rotations are degrading readiness , wearing down equipment and leaving less time for normal training exercises reservists , including police , firefighters and other homeland defenders , are spending lengthy tours overseas four out of 10 americans now serving in iraq come from reserve or national guard units none of this should lead americans to worry that the united states with the world s premier air force , navy and nuclear strike force fully intact is defenseless if a new threat suddenly arose if , for example , al qaeda threatened saudi oil fields , radical islamist officers got control of pakistani nuclear weapons or china attacked taiwan washington could respond forcefully and decisively but that does not mean that broader american security interests are not paying a price any additional foreign engagement that dragged on beyond a few months and required large numbers of ground troops would require a wider callup of reserves and perhaps a return to the draft many potential enemies overseas doubt that the public would have the appetite for that kind of sacrifice as a result , america s diplomatic clout is being subtly undermined iranian mullahs weighing whether to give up their nuclear programs may conclude that washington is in no position to face them down north korea s dictator , kim jong il , may also feel freer to proceed with his nuclear plans and move troops closer to the south korean border chinese leaders may see this as an opportune time to escalate their bullying of taiwan listing all the dangers is much easier than coming up with solutions but there are some obvious shortterm answers barring any unexpected breakthroughs in iraq , washington needs to increase its recruitment quotas sharply for activeduty service in the army and marine corps the current army recruitment ceiling of just above 500 , 000 ought to go up to nearly 600 , 000 , still substantially below the levels of the late 1980 s the marines' ceiling should go up from the current 178 , 000 to around 200 , 000 attracting those recruits will require offering financial and other inducements on top of the added payroll costs most of the additional money required for this could come from elsewhere in the military budget the pentagon is taking a big step in the right direction

pacific palisades , calif , feb 20 the nissan open remained in dire need of california sunshine sunday a third consecutive day of heavy rain wreaked havoc on the tournament , leaving players in limbo and the outcome in doubt play was suspended just 30 minutes into the third round , with chad campbell and adam scott tied for the lead at nineunderpar 133 , one stroke ahead of darren clarke and brian davis none of those players even teed off in the third round pga tour officials will try to resume play monday morning , but the forecast called for more rain , leaving several possibilities if riviera country club is unplayable monday , officials could decide to hold a onehole playoff between campbell and scott to determine the winner the last time that happened on the tour was in 2000 , when phil mickelson defeated gary nicklaus in a onehole playoff at the bellsouth classic asked which hole he would like to see used for a playoff , campbell smiled and said , they would probably pick the driest one if play resumes monday , the third round will not become official until at least half of the 75player field finishes at that point , tour rules would require the round to be completed , and the tournament would continue tuesday if half the field does not finish the third round monday , officials will revert to the 36hole results , meaning campbell and scott will meet in a onehole playoff tournament officials will not begin a fourth round unless they believe it can be completed monday that made a 72hole tournament unlikely but what if thirdround play carried into tuesday but could not be completed \? the match play championship is scheduled to begin wednesday in carlsbad , calif we would not go beyond tuesday , said mark russell , the tour s tournament director that would be a decision for the commissioner the last 36hole tour event was the 1996 buick challenge in pine mountain , ga , won by michael bradley in a fiveman playoff according to pga tour policy , the winner of a 36hole event wins the all of the firstplace prize money , but it does not count as an official victory that means the 36hole winner does not receive a twoyear exemption on the tour , nor does he gain entrance into the following year s mercedes championships scott made a clutch birdie putt on his final hole sunday to finish a round of 66 and tie campbell , sinking a 20footer at no 9 to reach nine under par with campbell already in the clubhouse and rain in the forecast , scott knew the importance of his final putt it was a bit of a breaking putt , but i had a pretty good line on it , said scott , who at age 24 has three tour victories it was nice to see that go down i did think this may be the last putt of the week , so i better make it count the torrential rain has created some weird possibilities campbell has not hit a shot since friday , meaning he could win the tournament despite having the weekend off asked now many practice balls he hit during the weekend , campbell said none yesterday and none today that would be zero there was no play saturday , the first time an entire day was washed out on tour since the second round of last year s matchplay event play was held for 5 hours 45 minutes on sunday , enough to finish the second round , before another heavy dose of rain ended the action players have spent much of their time this weekend hanging out in the clubhouse , wondering when the los angeles area became a rain forest it has made for a bizarre tournament with an uncertain ending we are going to come back in the morning and try to finish the third round , russell said but the forecast is n't very good chip shots tiger woods threeputted for a double bogey on his final hole , giving him a 70 and leaving him at five under par for the tournament , tied for 13th place at 137 woods has never won the nissan open in seven starts as a professional it is the only tour event he has played at least four times without winning
team of rivals the political genius of abraham lincoln by doris kearns goodwin illustrated 916 pp simon schuster 35 more books about abraham lincoln line the shelves of libraries than about any other american can there be anything new to say about our 16th president \? surprisingly , the answer is yes having previously offered fresh insights into lyndon johnson , the kennedys and franklin and eleanor roosevelt , doris kearns goodwin has written an elegant , incisive study of lincoln and leading members of his cabinet that will appeal to experts as well as to those whose knowledge of lincoln is an amalgam of high school history and popular mythology team of rivals \( an apt but uninspiring title \) opens in may 1860 with four men awaiting news from the national convention of the republican party in chicago thousands of sup porters were gathered in auburn , ny , where a cannon was primed to fire a salute to the expected nomination of senator william henry seward for president in columbus , ohio , gov salmon p chase hoped that if seward faltered , the mantle would fall on his shoulders in st louis , 66yearold edward bates , a judge who still called himself a whig , hoped the convention might turn to him as the only candidate who could carry the conservative free states , whose electoral votes were necessary for a republican victory in springfield , ill , a former oneterm congressman who had been twice defeated for election to the senate waited with resigned expectation that his longshot candidacy would be flattened by the seward steamroller although her readers presumably know who won the nomination , goodwin leaves them in suspense for almost 250 pages as she chronicles the personal stories and political careers of these four men the unifying theme is the growing sectional polarization over the issues of slavery and its expansion but each story follows a separate track until they begin to converge with the death of the whig party and the birth of the republican party in the mid1850 s having served four years as governor of new york and nearly 12 as a senator , seward emerged as the leader of the new party after 1856 , when it fell just short of electing a president on a platform of restricting the expansion of slavery next to seward in prominence was chase , who had organized the free soil party in 1848 , became its first senator in 1849 and represented the cutting edge of the republican antislavery ideology in contrast , lincoln s career languished in relative obscurity before 1858 in goodwin s telling , however , his story gradually and subtly takes precedence his famous debates with stephen a douglas in 1858 gave him national exposure , though douglas won reelection to the senate lincoln s cooper union address in new york and his subsequent tour of new england in early 1860 increased his visibility although some newspapers still spelled his first name abram , lincoln appealed to a growing number of republicans as the strongest potential nominee less radical than chase and more firmly antislavery than bates , he seemed the one most likely to carry the lower northern states of pennsylvania , indiana and illinois that the republicans had lost in 1856 , without alienating the antislavery northern tier states from new england to minnesota although lincoln s house divided speech in 1858 was as uncompromising as seward s irrepressible conflict address that same year , seward , as well as chase , had a more radical reputation than lincoln but because they had been in public life much longer than lincoln , they had also made more enemies having set the stage for the nominating convention , goodwin recounts the drama of lincoln s surprising firstballot strength \( 102 votes to seward s 173 , chase s 49 , and bates s 48 \) on the second ballot lincoln pulled almost even with seward , and amid rising excitement in a convention hall packed with a leatherlunged homestate cheering section , he won a stunning victory on the third ballot all three of his shocked rivals believed the better man had lost lincoln s subsequent election as president did not change their minds the republican victory without a single electoral vote \( and scarcely any popular votes \) from the 15 slave states provoked seven of them to secede and form the confederate states of america in this crisis , lincoln took the unparalleled step of appointing to his cabinet all three of his rivals plus a fourth , simon cameron , pennsylvania s favorite son seward got the top spot as secretary of state chase became secretary of the treasury , bates attorney general and cameron secretary of war could this team of rivals , each of them initially convinced of his superiority to the inexperienced president , work together in harmony \? joseph medill , the editor of the chicago tribune and one of lincoln s most loyal supporters , later asked the president why he had made these appointments we needed the strongest men of the party in the cabinet , lincoln replied these were the very strongest men then i had no right to deprive the country of their services they were indeed strong men , goodwin notes but in the end , it was the prairie lawyer from springfield who would emerge as the strongest of them all seward at first shared the widespread assumption that he would be the premier of the administration during the tense weeks between lincoln s inauguration on march 4 , 1861 , and the eruption of war on april 12 , when confederate guns fired on fort sumter , seward recommended that lincoln withdraw the troops from sumter and then worked to undermine the president s determination to hold and resupply the fort this tug of war climaxed with seward s notorious memorandum to lincoln complaining that the administration was without a policy either domestic or foreign seward proposed to abandon fort sumter while reinforcing fort pickens \( at pensacola \) to preserve the symbolism of federal authority seward also suggested an ultimatum to provoke war with spain or france over their violations of the monroe doctrine as a way to reunite the country whatever policy we adopt , seward declared , either the president must do it himself or devolve it on some member of his cabinet i neither seek to evade nor assume responsibility such a baldfaced challenge would have justified seward s dismissal but lincoln did not want to worsen the crisis by breaking up his administration after less than a month in office so he responded in a manner that would become his hallmark in dealing with recalcitrant but important subordinates , generals or senators a firm assertion of his own policy and responsibility for it , done in such a way as to avoid a personal rebuff that might create an enemy lincoln wrote a response to seward that reiterated his intention to resupply sumter , ignored the suggestion of an ultimatum to spain or france and insisted that whatever policy was decided on , i must do it thinking that this written response might be too cold , lincoln did not send it but instead spoke personally with seward several weeks later lincoln again overruled seward by softening the tone of what goodwin accurately describes as a surly and abrasive dispatch warning britain against recognition of the confederacy by this time seward had begun to see the light it is due to the president to say , that his magnanimity is almost superhuman , he wrote the president is the best of us lincoln grew closer to seward than to any other member of his administration they spent many relaxing hours together \( seward lived a block from the white house \) swapping political anecdotes and other stories , and seward became one of the president s most loyal and effective supporters he frequently praised lincoln publicly as the best and wisest man he had ever known attorney general bates , who initially underestimated lincoln , soon echoed seward s favorable opinions not so chase , who never quite got over his conviction that the wrong man was nominated in 1860 and that he should receive the nomination in 1864 lincoln valued his treasury secretary s abilities as a finance minister , but he recognized chase s lack of loyalty and poorly concealed ambition to replace him chase also became a lightning rod for the radical republicans' dissatisfaction with the pace of lincoln s actions against slavery on several occasions chase offered his resignation in a calculated effort to force lincoln s hand on a policy or patronage dispute each time lincoln parried chase s tactic , refusing to accept his resignation , reasserting his own authority and maintaining the balance among radicals , moderates and conservatives in the administration when chase tried this ploy a fourth time in june 1864 , after lincoln had been safely renominated , the president astonished him by accepting the resignation to redress the cabinet balance , lincoln subsequently requested the resignation of postmaster general montgomery blair , chase s most bitter enemy in the cabinet and a member of the powerful blair family , which represented the most conservative element in the party and lincoln further defused radical opposition by appointing the deposed chase as chief justice of the united states as these internal republican feuds suggest , the party in the 1860 s was a coalition of politicians who only a few years earlier had been whigs \( lincoln , seward , bates \) , democrats \( blair , secretary of the navy gideon welles and vice president hannibal hamlin \) , free soilers \( chase \) , or had flirted with the shortlived antiimmigrant american party , or know nothings \( cameron and bates \) in addition , several cabinet members personally disliked each other blair and chase , seward and welles , chase and seward , blair and secretary of war edwin m stanton , who replaced cameron in january 1862 lincoln s political genius enabled him to herd these political cats and keep them driving toward ultimate victory how did he do it \? goodwin deals with this question better than any other writer part of the answer lay in lincoln s steadfastness of purpose , which inspired subordinates to overcome their petty rivalries part of it lay in his superb sense of timing and his sensitivity to the pulse of public opinion as he moved to bring along a divided people to the support of a new birth of freedom and part of it lay in lincoln s ability to rise above personal slights , his talent for getting along with men of clashing ideologies and personalities who could not get along with each other this temperament was best illustrated by lincoln s relationship with stanton , which goodwin analyzes with great insight in 1855 lincoln had been retained as one of the attorneys for the defense in a patentinfringement suit brought by the mccormick reaper company because the case was initially scheduled to be tried in chicago , the defense team needed an illinois lawyer but when the trial was moved to cincinnati , the defense retained stanton , one of the country s foremost attorneys , without bothering to inform lincoln when he arrived in cincinnati after careful preparation , stanton and his colleagues ignored him stanton was even heard to speak contemptuously of lincoln as a backwoods bumpkin lincoln was hurt by the snub but stayed to watch the trial and was impressed by stanton s courtroom brilliance six years later stanton , a democrat , was practicing in washington during the war s first year and referred disdainfully to lincoln in conversations with friends lincoln was aware of stanton s opinions , but when he decided to get rid of the incompetent cameron , who had made a hash of military mobilization , he appointed none other than stanton as secretary of war stanton soon justified the appointment he worked 15hour days at his standup desk and proved to be one of the best war secretaries the country has ever had and like seward , he soon changed his opinion of lincoln , forging a close relationship with the president second only to seward s no men were ever so deceived as we at cincinnati , stanton confessed to his former associate on the reaper case no one was more griefstricken by lincoln s assassination than stanton , who spoke the imperishable words as the president breathed his last now he belongs to the ages lincoln s private secretary and confidant john hay subsequently wrote to stanton not everyone knows , as i do , how close you stood to our lost leader , how he loved you and trusted you , and how vain were all the efforts to shake that trust and confidence team of rivals invites comparison with goodwin s prizewinning account of another wartime president and his associates , no ordinary time both portray the extraordinary leadership qualities of the commanders in chief in america s biggest wars but no ordinary time is really a book about two leaders , eleanor as well as franklin roosevelt , and about their complicated personal as well as official relationships with the women and men who were close to them the only women conspicuous in team of rivals are mary lincoln and salmon chase s beautiful daughter kate , who rivaled mary lincoln for status in washington social circles but they appear only occasionally and are not essential to the story goodwin depicts the sometimes splenetic mary lincoln with more sympathy than many historians have done , but cannot turn her into an eleanor roosevelt team of rivals is about men , not men and women it does not range over the home front of factories and farms in the manner of no ordinary time it focuses on washington and on the men who ran the war , chiefly lincoln , seward , chase and stanton within that sphere goodwin has brilliantly described how lincoln forged a team that preserved a nation and freed america from the curse of slavery james m mcpherson is emeritus professor of history at princeton university and the author of several books on lincoln and on the civil war , including battle cry of freedom
london , april 22 after tony blair s first election as the british prime minister in 1997 , show business celebrities and pop stars cheerfully clinked glasses with him at 10 downing street to celebrate the arrival of cool britannia and , with it , a golden age for the arts in britain now , eight years later , as mr blair confidently awaits reelection to a third term on may 5 , star power is nowhere to be seen indeed , while support for the arts is included in the platforms of the three main parties , culture has barely earned a mention in daytoday campaigning the opposition conservative party s silence is unsurprising after its last 18year stretch in office , it left britain s cultural institutions museums , theaters , orchestras , the movie industry in shambles in contrast , mr blair s labor government has good cause to boast by increasing spending on the arts , it has presided over something of a cultural renaissance here much of the country s cultural infrastructure has been renovated museums are crowded contemporary art has never been more popular opera and theater are flourishing and performers and artists from around the world can be seen here without resorting to campaign hyperbole , it could be argued that britain s arts scene is healthier today than at any time since the 1960 s so why is this not being trumpeted as a reason to reelect labor \? there s a deeply rooted antiartist and antiintellectual tradition in britain , said stephen daldry , a leading theater and movie director the labor party has never benefited from aligning itself with artists in truth , since mr blair backed the americanled invasion of iraq , artists have not been too keen to align themselves with labor , either but harold pinter , the playwright , is one of the few to denounce mr blair publicly more striking is that politicians here apparently see nothing to be gained from embracing the arts and that includes the labor high command having flirted with blur and oasis in 1998 , blair s spinpot dictators decided that the arts were unmentionable , tom morris , associate director at the national theater , wrote in the observer last december , referring to mr blair s chumminess with two british rock bands how many taxpayers know that the arts budget has been doubled by the present government \? stop some and ask i did the answer is none in this sense , britain is different from , say , france , germany and italy , where support for the arts is viewed as a fundamental part of the government s mandate in france , while artists and performers tend to be on the left , the centerright president , jacques chirac , never misses a chance to woo them and as in other mainland european countries , the opinions of intellectuals and artists in france carry real weight they , too , are political players even in the united states , where the federal government gives less to the arts than many mediumsize european cities do , politicians and glitterati are happy to join forces when their politics coincide bruce springsteen and barbra streisand like to sing for the democrats ronald reagan , arnold schwarzenegger and clint eastwood went further , using their screen fame to win election as republicans and the american public , it seems , finds nothing amiss but in britain , celebrities have no easy way into politics , while politicians prefer to keep artists at a distance as a party of the masses with intellectual roots , labor s position is particularly ambivalent perhaps because it has moved to the right under mr blair , it is now ever wary of being accused of catering to the elite by the proudly philistine tabloids so even while noting that arts subsidies have risen by 73 percent in eight years , the government often sounds apologetic , preferring to stress the collateral benefits creative industries that employ 19 million people and lift the economy cultural activities that bind communities and reduce juvenile crime new arts centers that help to regenerate rundown industrial cities this social engineering approach has at least given the tories some ammunition their election manifesto takes a swipe at too much government interference in culture and politically correct grant awards it pledges we will free cultural funding from the constraints of shortterm social policy considerations we will cut bureaucracy and provide value for money what they really mean , however , is value for less money , because the tories have also promised acrosstheboard spending cuts , including some 500 million from the culture department s budget they evidently hope to please voters who consider arts subsidies to be a kind of welfare system for longhaired layabouts , but in cultural circles the tories have done little more than revive memories of the bad old days it was a terrifying time for the arts , victoria todd , director of the independent national campaign for the arts , said of margaret thatcher s 11 years as prime minister , which ended in 1990 the national lottery in 1994 helped a bit , but it did not reverse the devastation then labor came along and it channeled huge quantities of cash into the arts with polls pointing to another labor victory , britain s artists , performers and cultural administrators are hoping for more of the same more being the operative word last year , there were protests when the government froze arts subsidies for three years but elections are good occasions for taking stock , and here labor s record stands up well the national lottery has helped , channeling 45 billion in profits into restoring , expanding and building cultural institutions those benefiting include tate modern , tate britain , the british museum , the national portrait gallery , the victoria and albert museum and the royal opera house the government has also eliminated admissions fees to major museums , increasing the number of visitors by 75 percent since 2001 the ups and downs of performing arts institutions can depend as much on the quality of management as on subsidy levels , but after difficult patches , the royal opera house , the national theater and the royal shakespeare company are again enjoying prestige regional theater , decimated in the thatcher years , has recovered several orchestras threatened with closing in the early 1990 s are again secure but this is not the stuff of electoral debate party leaders may consider themselves practitioners of the art of politics , but culture and politics still speak different languages here even , it seems , when the government has something to boast about

since 1993 , and in other alternative weeklies since 1989 , and the strip is presented here quite consciously as a bracing , bitter tonic the antidote to comicspage malaise , albeit one that might kill before it cures this is a classic ensemble comic , full of suburban archetypes the smiling dad , ted his longsuffering son his straight man neighbor there are also some distinct weirdos johnny lemonhead , who is named with grotesque physical accuracy the gym teacher who jogs around the supermarket naked to quit smoking a dead , decomposing clown the joke is that none of the latter are as

\) , the beautiful first volume of the projected complete gasoline alley , created by frank o king gasoline alley , which has been published continuously since 1918 , is exactly the sort of strip a curmudgeon might curmudge about long running , on its fourth artist , its real estate safeguarded by nostalgia , not required to amuse but only to reassuringly show up i recall as a child finding it simply impenetrable , perhaps because i had missed out on the last few decades' worth of the story for the uninitiated , the eponymous alley refers to a string of chicago garages populated by an affable gang of friends who share the thennovel hobby of automobiling the story did not really pick up until 1921 , when the bachelor of the group , walt wallet , finds a baby on his doorstep , whom he calls skeezix slang for a motherless calf walt is instantly besotted , and his adaptation to fatherhood is documented sweetly and slowly its decency is marred by one racial caricature , walt s maid , who is outlined in sambo contours yet even she is a complex human character , fully drawn king would become an icon to comic artists like chris ware , one of the editors of this volume , for his full page sunday strips , with their bold experiments in framing and pacing but the hallmark of his daily strips are their unhurried depiction of quotidian life king rarely went for a proper punch line , though he seems aware that he is perhaps expected to when the infant skeezix topples over in inadvertent imitation of the classic comic strip heelsintheair stumble , walt laughs very good , old top ! you know what a comic paper ending should be all right ! there is a lovely , often wrenching gravity to the strip king knows how humans as well as cars work , especially toddlers his unsentimental understanding of their moods and games , matched by walt s sudden and unquestioned devotion to his adopted son , make this about as affecting a portrait of fatherhood as i 've seen , not least because skeezix grows this is the great innovation and dark curse of gasoline alley the characters age a few other comics have done this , most notably lynn johnston s for better or for worse and garry trudeau s doonesbury but both still glow with a kind of bloomer youthfulness in the current strips , skeezix is in his 80 s , having grown up before our eyes , eventually , inevitably to die it s hard to tell how much king was aware of what the seeming minor novelty of having skeezix learn to walk would have on the strip but while gasoline alley may seem reassuring today , it is in fact profoundly unnerving two other recent books were never comic strips , but clearly were inspired by them daniel clowes s ice haven \( pantheon , 1895 \) is called a comicstrip novel and flips darkly through the pages of a small town s secrets its broken homes , anguished youths and loathsome amateur poets through the virtuosic lens of various comic strip styles the little kid strip , the detective strip , even the funny animal strip black hole \( pantheon , 2495 \) , by charles burns , was serialized for more than 10 years in comicbook form , but it is invested with all the dudgeon of that often bewildering stalwart of the comics page , the soap opera strip burns s intricate , controlled and pulpy penwork \( he is an alum of raw magazine \) is one of the most recognizable styles in comics , and black hole is his masterwork an uncanny imitation of traditional comics at their most mannered and melodramatic , invigorated by the shock of the deeply human and the deeply weird it follows keith , the lovably dumb high school hunk , who pines for his biology lab partner , chris though he does not know she s got the bug , the blatantly metaphoric virus that s going around town the bug disfigures different teens differently some shed their skin , others wither into walking corpses , others grow a second , semivaginal mouth near their collarbones burns s is a world , like that of peanuts , without grownups , unless you count the older dudes who live with that girl who has a tail think gil thorp via david cronenberg and the bug forces its victims into selfsufficient , lonely exile in a darkly shadowed magic forest the bug is the stain of sex and of puberty , of the fear of difference and the dual curse blessing of adulthood , when we realize we are all deformed like red meat , tony millionaire s maakies does not appear on the comics pages of daily newspapers , but lurks darkly instead in our nation s alternative weeklies millionaire s new collection is called der struwwelmaakies \( fantagraphics , 1995 \) , struwwel being a reference to the grim german children s book struwwelpeter , and maakies meaning , well , maakies , a word that millionaire has refused to define , and that would seem to refer to the crew of the ship maak , most notably its loutish animal mates uncle gabby , a monkey and drinky crow , an alcoholic crow both are characters of pure , ginnedup id , engaging in high jinks that range from the boobish to the bizarre making booze cream from the milk of drunken cows in one panel , going to prison to have time to read swinburne in the next the humor is often so lowbrow as to be subterranean if gasoline alley is preoccupied with life s slow unfolding , maakies is fascinated by its swift , violent ends it is difficult to count the times gabby or crow have been mutilated , shot in the head , eaten , burned in hell and yet millionaire , raised by an artteacher by the sea , can draw the living spit out of a ship or a giant squid it is just as likely that maakies will feature one character vomiting into another s mouth as it will a wordless , befuddling , beautiful parade of intricately rendered church spires and tall buildings it sways this way between the very low and the very high the only applicable adverb here is drunkenly , for as the name might suggest , there is a lot of boozing in drinky crow s life this may offend \( or may be the least of the offenses \) , but i would bet if you counted crow s tipples against the number of highballs the lockhorns had consumed , it 'd come out even and in his surrealist impulse and draftsman s brio , millionaire is the closest thing we have to george herriman of krazy kat but curiously , the most melancholic comic strip that i 've encountered emerges neither from the alternative weeklies nor from the distant past , but from perhaps the most celebrated and mainstream of the mainstream comics calvin and hobbes though the strip has been rampantly collected in the past , the complete calvin and hobbes \( andrews mcmeel , 150 \) now arrives in three massive tomes encased in a box it is so big and dense and beautifully printed and huge that i have real difficulty carrying it from one room to the next it is worth the work , and worth every penny it is hard to understand why calvin and hobbes has developed so firmly a middlebrow reputation , though i suspect it has something to do with the countless decals of calvin mischievously urinating on the back windows of suv s \( all bootlegs , by the way to his syndicate s chagrin , the creator bill watterson refused to sign off on any merchandising apart from books if i 'd wanted to sell plush garbage , i 'd have gone to work as a carny , he said in a rare interview he gave to comics journal in 1989 \) maybe another reason is that it seemed so effortless watterson worked for years trying to develop a strip that a syndicate would buy , and the strip felt fully formed when the anarchic 6yearold calvin and his tiger , hobbes , first started playing in 1985 the art was already skillfully na ve \( that is , until it came time to unleash a sweeping and beautiful alien landscape in calvin s imagination \) , the characters already real and endearing it stayed that way , with only two breaks , every day for 10 years , and then ended leafing through this volume , i found it hard to find strips that did n't at least raise a smile , and often something more open randomly to page 131 of volume 3 , and here is a crystalline gag that is sly and poetic and still relevant more than 12 years later hobbes why is this snowman looking at a snowball \? calvin he s contemplating snowman evolution obviously , if he evolved from a snowball , it raises tough theological questions for him hobbes like the morality of throwing one s precursors at someone \? calvin sure , and what about shoveling one s genetic material off the walk \? the strip also had its share of unabashed sentiment , tiger cuddling and cocoa swilling and like all comics , it relied on a certain number of stock gags most notable of these was the flip , the sudden , jarring switch between calvin s imagined world and the real world between hobbes , his living , tall , scruffy , tiger mentor , and hobbes the stuffed toy that everyone else saw watterson was devoted to maintaining the reality of both of these worlds in the strip , and it could only be done this effectively in comics , with their photographic stillness and temporal elisions are those snowmen chasing calvin in his mind \? or did he spend hours actually building them that way \? and how did he tie himself up in that chair \? but reading this volume now , i suddenly got the grand , terrible flip of the entire strip calvin is , almost all the time , alone and in this way , this is a book that not only could kill a cat if improvidently dropped , but break a heart in two there was an outcry when watterson retired the strip in 1995 \( in anticipation of this collection , it is being reprinted in a number of newspapers , probably to the curmudgeons' dismay \) unlike skeezix , calvin did n't grow up christmas after christmas passed , and he remained 6 years old but unlike many comic strip protagonists , he seemed like a real character with a real inner life who could not go on believing in talking tigers forever any smart person , watterson included , would recognize this situation was untenable if the strip was to feel honest toward the last part of his run , watterson had managed to wrestle from newspapers a full half page to

having spent nearly half his life as a transit worker , ray volsario is used to his subway cars looking a certain way but on monday , mr volsario , 50 , entered the 42nd street shuttle , the line where he works as a motorman , and noticed that none of the yellow and orange seats seemed normal he assumed the seats were dirty mr volsario was all set to call a car cleaner to clean the seats off , he recalled , when he looked closer and realized that the seats were part of an elaborate advertisement for deadwood , a television series hbo , the cable network , paid about 100 , 000 to cover the interiors of three subway cars including the walls , seats , ceilings and doors with plastic wrap promoting the show , which begins its second season on sunday riders who board the shuttle at grand central terminal and take the 90second trip to times square were confronted this week with another series of advertisements these applied directly to the white tiled walls , and wrapped around the stanchions , near the shuttle platforms the advertisements portray a flock of birds against an angry red sky , with a single phrase omnium finis imminet , latin for the end of all things is near the advertisements , for steven spielberg s movie version of hg wells s war of the worlds , cost about 50 , 000 the film is to open in july the two sets of advertisements are likely to reopen the debate over the degree to which public space should be protected from commercialization most shuttle riders seemed to react to the deadwood advertisements with surprise or amusement , but others viewed the advertisements as an intrusion i think it s creative , but it really imposes on our privacy , said andrea sage , 42 , a real estate lawyer who lives in chelsea and rides the shuttle every day it s disorienting it s really going to wear thin after a while kent l barwick , president of the municipal art society of new york , an organization devoted to urban design and planning , also criticized the advertisements as excessive it was one thing when they decided to sell all the advertising in a car to a single advertiser , mr barwick said , but it s a quantum leap to actually convert a public conveyance into a stage set in which i am now totally captive a spokesman for the metropolitan transportation authority , tom kelly , defended the advertisements but acknowledged that money is a driving factor this is our attempt to experiment , to find different ways to seek advertising revenue to go back into the system , mr kelly said remember , this is one campaign he added should someone else come along with another campaign , obviously , considering the financial condition that we 're in , we 'd give it serious thought but it would have to be something that is tastefully done the deadwood advertisements produced strong but divergent reactions from riders andy elbery , 31 , an architect from jersey city , gazed admiringly at the plasticcovered seats , which resembled cushions it s beautiful , mr elbery said i love the textural feeling , with no material annie kirby , 25 , a graduate student from park slope , brooklyn , said there are few spaces where new yorkers can be free from commercial messages that s one of the difficult things about living here , she said , adding that the movie advertisements try to direct our fears away from real problems the spielberg advertisements seemed to attract less notice when james a venable , 52 , a subway conductor guiding shuttle passengers to the correct platform , was told that the end is near \( at least in mr spielberg s film \) , he replied yes , it is near , but we do n't know how near correction march 9 , 2005 , wednesday an article on saturday about unusual subway advertisements included an erroneous identification from transit officials for the production whose ad featured a flock of birds with the phrase omnium finis imminet , latin for the end of all things is near it is an nbc television series called revelations , not steven spielberg s film version of war of the worlds
elfunoun palestinian popular dance troupe may have called its program dancing tragedies and dreams , but outside alice tully hall on wednesday night , the atmosphere was all flashing cameras and unabashed delight a woman approached a circle of friends to exclaim , i just saw my sister ! clearly , the company , as its name indiscreetly hints , is extremely popular but its polished assortment of dancers was attractive on many levels and not simply because opportunities to see palestinian dance are rare presented by the network of arabamerican professionals of new york , elfunoun is a nonprofit troupe based in ramallah , on the west bank for its new york engagement \( the company appeared at the united nations on tuesday and will continue on to washington today and dearborn , mich , tomorrow \) , the group offered nearly two dozen dances , some based in folklore and others rooted in a more contemporary style people think of us as being in a box , said omar barghouti , who is the company s dance trainer and one of its choreographers as well as the tour s artistic director , but palestinian dance is n't just about one form the company , formed in 1979 to preserve palestinian culture , was not always as revered as it is today in its beginnings , occupation authorities viewed elfunoun negatively we were persecuted in many ways , mr barghouti recalled there were travel bans , and some of our members were arrested and accused of belonging to a subversive dance company in the 1980 s and early 90 s , he said , that view began to shift as the company s reputation grew the challenge became , what type of identity do we want \? he said we see our dance as a form of civil , cultural resistance to oppression , and that starts with the occupation , but not just that we are also against social oppression , so in our dances you 'll see a lot of issues dealing with women s liberation , equality and democracy the current tour features 30 dancers , ranging in age from 11 to 42 \( there are nearly 50 members in the actual company \) obtaining visas for them was not a pleasant experience must we talk about that \? mr barghouti asked with a pleading smile we want to come back , and unfortunately now we 'd better watch what we say it s not like in the past it was very hectic , very difficult but the effort was also worth it the company s recent program featured joyful dances inspired by traditional palestinian weddings , along with a series of works dealing with oppression and resistance though the company performed in new york in 1999 , this engagement was the first to include such contemporary works , which , in many ways , were defiantly obvious key to peace exile and dreaming of return featured dancers grappling with lifesize keys that they did n't literally hit the audience over the head with them was the work s only measure of artistic restraint it was one prop away from mummenschanz another work , 43 exorcising defeat , began with a single boot placed in a pool of light at the center of the stage a dancer , clearly browbeaten and wearing a torn shirt , ran in frantic circles and collapsed to the floor when he put on a boot , he assumed the role of oppressor , but in elfunoun s optimistic state of grace , he found salvation in the final seconds by kicking it off to the side still , elfunoun remained unpredictable even when the contemporary pieces seemed patently earnest , there was nothing artificial in the performers' enjoyment of dancing from time to time , they may have lost their footing \( or an actual shoe , in one case \) , but the dancers remained radiant , moving with a sweet and determined fearlessness none of the members of elfunoun are compensated , not even mr barghouti , who works as an engineer as well as an independent researcher the company is a strictly volunteer organization now , i'm on my own vacation time , he said but this group is ours we do it for ourselves and for our conviction that this is how we contribute to the struggle for justice

the securities and exchange commission has notified three highprofile current and former directors of hollinger international inc that they may be sued for failing to spot fraud that senior executives of the newspaper company are suspected of committing the notices were issued to james r thompson , richard r burt and mariejos e kravis , according to a person close to the company the three directors made up hollinger s audit committee from 1998 to october 2003 , when mrs kravis resigned from the board mr thompson and mr burt have remained on the audit committee , but are expected to step down at the company s next annual meeting , in january mr thompson is a former governor of illinois and a partner with the law firm of winston strawn mr burt is a former united states ambassador to germany and mrs kravis is the wife of the financier henry r kravis and a member of the boards of the ford motor company and iac interactivecorp the wells notices , or notices of potential civil action by the sec , were filed about a month ago they were first reported by bloomberg news a wells notice is issued to a target of an investigation to give that person an opportunity to provide facts or testimony to regulators to convince them that the filing of a fraud complaint is unwarranted if the sec does file a civil suit against mr thompson , mr burt and mrs kravis , it would be an unusual attempt to hold independent directors to account for not being vigilant enough about a suspected fraud none of the three directors received any of the money from payments that are the subject of various actions against the hollinger cofounder conrad m black and his associates lord black , who was hollinger s chairman , is expected to make a second appearance before a federal district court in chicago tomorrow to face criminal fraud charges stemming from the financial scandal at the company he has pleaded not guilty , as have three other senior hollinger executives and a canadian company he used to control that is now in receivership lord black s longtime deputy and business partner , f david radler , pleaded guilty in august to a single fraud charge relating to 32 million in payments made to lord black and others that were not authorized by hollinger s board prosecutors in the case against lord black and the others have said further criminal charges may be filed the wells notices are the latest strands in the tangled litigation surrounding hollinger after lord black s ouster from the company in early 2004 another hollinger director , richard n perle , a former pentagon adviser , received and responded to a wells notice this year , and no public action has been taken against him by the sec mr perle served on hollinger s executive committee with lord black and mr radler mr thompson declined to comment , as did a spokesman for mrs kravis and officials at the sec mr burt did not return a call lord black has maintained that he believed that all the payments made to him including 518 million that is the subject of his criminal trial were approved by the audit committee or board lord black chose the members of the board when he ran what was once the world s thirdbiggest newspaper concern lord black , a british peer known as lord black of crossharbour , is being sued separately by the sec , along with mr radler , over 85 million worth of payments he , mr radler and several associates are also being sued for more than 540 million by hollinger itself for compensation and dividends they received from the company over several years lord black has maintained he is the victim of a smear job and has filed several lawsuits and countersuits against the company and its directors one lawsuit is directed at mr thompson , mr burt and mrs kravis it asserts that if lord black is found liable for receiving payments that were not properly authorized , the three audit committee members are culpable because they approved the payments lord black s criminal defense is also likely to rely in part on pointing at the conduct of the audit committee , which an internal report by a special committee of hollinger s board said showed an inexplicable and nearly complete lack of initiative , diligence or independent thought the hollinger special committee report , written under the direction of richard c breeden , a former sec chairman , also accused mr radler and lord black of selfrighteous and aggressive looting of the company , publisher of the chicago suntimes and other newspapers it depicted mr thompson , the audit committee chairman , as too trusting of lord black and mr radler , and mr burt and mrs kravis as too ready to go along with mr thompson it also noted that neither hollinger s outside lawyers , torys llp , nor its auditor , kpmg , raised concerns to the audit committee about the payments now in question this month , torys settled potential claims against it by hollinger for 30 million , without any admission of guilt or innocence similarly , a group of hollinger s current and former independent directors , including the three audit committee members who received the wells notices , agreed to settle a shareholder lawsuit against them for 50 million that settlement is still awaiting court approvals

the most infamous unresolved case from america s civil rights struggle four decades ago the 1964 abduction and killing of three voterregistration volunteers by nightriders on a lonely rural road in mississippi was revived last night with the arrest of a longtime leader of the ku klux klan , the authorities announced the suspect , edgar ray killen , a 79yearold preacher who , investigators say , organized and led two carloads of klansmen on the night of the killings , was arrested at his home in philadelphia , miss , and charged with the murders of michael schwerner , andrew goodman and james chaney , sheriff larry myers of neshoba county said the sheriff said there would be more arrests in the notorious case , which helped to cement mississippi s image as a haven of hatred and violence in the 1960 s , when black churches , homes and businesses were firebombed and civil rights volunteers were beaten by white mobs the case was the subject of several books and was dramatized in the 1988 movie mississippi burning the murders provoked an outpouring of national support for the civil rights movement , and in the ensuing investigations federal officials gathered enough evidence to prosecute 18 klansmen in 1967 on charges of violating the civil rights of the three slain men seven klansmen were convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 3 years to 10 years , although none served more than 6 years mr killen was released after there was a deadlock by an allwhite jury but the state never brought murder charges in the case , and it was not until 1999 that the state s attorney general reopened the matter , after the clarionledger of jackson , miss , published expos s , including excerpts from a secret interview given to a state archivist by sam bowers , the onetime imperial wizard of the white knights of the ku klux klan , america s most violent white supremacist group in the 1960 s in the interview , mr bowers , who was serving a life sentence for ordering the 1966 firebombing in hattiesburg , miss , that killed vernon dahmer , a prominent civil rights leader , said he had thwarted justice in the killings of mr schwerner , mr goodman and mr chaney mr bowers also said in the interview that he did not mind going to jail because a fellow klansman had gotten away with murder a grand jury last year found sufficient evidence after 40 years to go ahead with the case , and its indictments led to mr killen s arrest the slain civil rights workers mr chaney , 21 , a black man from meridian , miss , and two white new yorkers , mr schwerner , 24 , a cornell graduate , and mr goodman , 20 , who had attended queens college were participating in what became known as freedom summer , the climax of an intensive voterregistration drive in the south mr goodman s mother , dr carolyn goodman , said in a telephone interview from her apartment on the upper west side , this was something that had to happen there was no question dr goodman , 89 , has been actively involved in civil rights work since her son s death and has just completed a documentary about the killings , freedom now she said that her two other sons were out of the country and that she had not yet spoken with them about the arrest dr goodman spoke from the apartment where , one day in 1964 , andrew told her that he was going to the south to do civil rights work he said , 'mom , you know , i was raised in an era of terrible things that have happened in my lifetime , so i have to go , ' she recalled she added it was n't easy for us but we could n't talk out of both sides of our mouths so i had to let him go reached by phone at her home in willingboro , nj , mr chaney s mother , fannie lee chaney , said , mighty long time of those who took part in the killings , mrs chaney said , most of them dead about now the victims were working with the congress of racial equality at a community center in meridian mr chaney had been a volunteer there for months mr schwerner had gone to mississippi with his wife , rita , in january 1964 , having been hired as a core field worker mr goodman , a graduate of the walden school on manhattan s upper west side , arrived in mississippi only a day before he was killed on june 21 , 1964 , the three men set out together in a ford station wagon to inspect the ruins of a black church near philadelphia , miss , that had been firebombed by the klan mr chaney was driving in the afternoon , they were arrested for speeding by a neshoba county deputy sheriff , cecil price they were held at the sheriff s office in philadelphia for several hours during those hours , according to testimony at the federal trial , deputy price sent out word that the three in custody included a man who had been designated goatee the klan s code for mr schwerner , who had a goatee and had been marked for death by mr bowers mr schwerner had infuriated the klan by organizing a boycott of a whiteowned variety store until it hired a black , and by his intensive work to register black voters according to testimony in the federal trial , deputy price held the men long enough for mr killen to round up a group of klansmen the civil rights workers were released from jail and were never seen again , although their subsequent movements were later established leaving the jail that night , they drove down route 19 , tailed by deputy price and two carloads of klansmen after a frantic chase , they were caught and taken to an isolated spot on rock cut road , where they were killed mr schwerner on mr bowers s orders , and mr chaney and mr goodman because they were witnesses mr chaney was beaten to death , while mr schwerner and mr goodman were each shot once in the chest their station wagon was set ablaze , and the bodies were buried under an earthen dam on the farm of a prominent philadelphian , olen burrage six weeks later , after one of the largest searches ever undertaken by the federal bureau of investigation , helped by 200 american sailors , the bodies were discovered in the ensuing federal investigation , 19 men were arrested on charges of violating the victims' civil rights , and 18 were eventually brought to trial three years after the killings mr bowers , mr price and five others were convicted three others were released because the jury found itself deadlocked the rest were acquitted mr killen , the man charged last night , is one of eight suspects still alive he was identified during the 1967 trial as the klan leader who had received the orders from mr bowers to kill mr schwerner , and as the man who had coordinated the klansmen s activities on the night of the killings but he was released with the jury deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of conviction the lone holdout insisted she could never convict a preacher mr killen s arrest followed grand jury testimony that reportedly included accounts of people who had direct knowledge of the killings sheriff myers declined to comment on the proceedings , but said mr killen had been arrested first because he was prominent in the case and available we went ahead and got him because he was high profile and we knew where he was , the sheriff said mr killen has always denied any involvement in the slayings in an interview with the clarionledger last year , he spoke about the killers of the civil rights workers i'm not going to say they were wrong , he declared i believe in selfdefense jerry g killen , the suspect s brother , told the associated press that he had no knowledge of the arrest but was quoted as saying he thought it was pitiful he said his brother never mentioned the slayings he wo n't talk about it , jerry killen said i do n't know if he did it or not mississippi has reopened some old civil rights murder cases in 1994 , byron de la beckwith was convicted of the 1963 assassination of medgar evers , a field secretary for the national association for the advancement of colored people a critical piece of evidence in the murder of the civil rights workers has been the 3 , 000page transcript of the 1967 federal trial under the court rules in mississippi , even the testimony of witnesses who have died or are unavailable can be put before a grand jury indeed , such testimony was used to convict mr de la beckwith , who died in prison in 2001 while the killings of the civil rights workers have remained in the public eye over the years , there was little progress in the case until it was reopened by attorney general jim hood last month , an anonymous donor posted a 100 , 000 reward for information leading to murder charges outside the grand jury room yesterday , billy wayne posey , one of the men convicted in the federal trial , leaned on a cane and complained about being subpoenaed after 40 years to come back and do something like this is ridiculous , like a nightmare , mr posey said he refused to talk about what he expected to be asked by the grand jury efforts to bring about a trial for the murder of civil rights workers in mississippi have been enhanced in recent years by the opening of the longsecret files of the state sovereignty commission , which was founded in 1956 to defend the state from encroachment by federal authorities before it was abolished in 1977 , the commission monitored anyone suspected of promoting racial integration containing 87 , 000 names , the files detail a series of klan killings in the 1960 s , including those of mr evers and mr dahmer , as well as those of mr schwerner , mr chaney and mr goodman they also detail the profound hatred that many white

the roman catholic archdiocese of newark is asking all of its parishes to consider sharing resources and even merging to save money , according to a church official who is coordinating the restructuring effort a directive to be issued next month will require 187 of the archdiocese s 235 parishes to submit proposals showing that they are either efficient enough to remain independent or that they could trim fat by combining resources , msgr william c harms , coordinator of a task force for parishes and schools , said yesterday the 48 other parishes of the archdiocese , which covers bergen , hudson , essex and union counties , were examined last year for streamlining we have a significant number of parishes in urban centers , monsignor harms said do we need all the parishes \? we have a parish in almost every suburban municipality is that a luxury for us \? he added , we 're trying to get the parishes to figure it out monsignor harms said the archdiocese had no plans for largescale closings of parishes or schools the first round of assessments last year focused on urban churches in areas where the catholic population has been declining for decades about three or four of those parishes are merging , five or six are planning to share pastors but maintain separate congregations , and several are closing , said monsignor harms this new round , first reported yesterday by the record of hackensack , will affect many suburban parishes in wealthier areas parishes will be divided into three groups , which will meet successively for nine months to discuss possible streamlining , monsignor harms said about 60 percent of newark s parishes have been unable to sustain themselves , and the archdiocese has subsidized them with nearly 4 million in aid , said james goodness , a spokesman for the archdiocese i think it s a necessary test , said the rev brian cullinane , who leads the church of the assumption of our blessed mary in woodridge this is a franciscan parish there s another franciscan parish less than a mile away about three years ago , we arranged our mass schedules so none would be at the same time to cut costs , priests from several parishes could live together or coordinate outreach , said msgr thomas ivory , pastor of the church of the presentation in upper saddle river , whose budget of 2 million places it among wealthier parishes still , said monsignor ivory , a lot of people would like to receive sacraments in their own community
the chinese yossi milo 525 west 25th street , chelsea through aug 26 you may recall photographs by liu zheng from recent exhibitions at the international center for photography the show of new chinese photography and video in 2004 and the icp s first triennial in 2003 mr liu presented immense , staged scenarios with people in traditional costumes or in the case of most of the women , in states of near nudity acting out operatic scenarios none of the photographs in the chinese appears to be staged , but almost all convey a dark narrative intensity often bordering on surrealistic that lifts them above ordinary photojournalism about half of the approximately 100 black and white pictures from the series , all measuring 18 inches square , are presented in this exceptionally gripping show august sander , robert frank and diane arbus are among the more obvious sources of inspiration for the chinese , which mr liu worked on from 1994 to 2002 he aimed for a cross section of chinese society , but he favored its less privileged segments subjects include coal miners , prison inmates , strippers , transsexual performers , rural acting troupes , hospital patients , wax works tableaus and corpses in morgues or coffins rich contrasts of light and shadow and vividly realized textures give all the images an alarmingly heightened sense of reality however varied the subjects , you always feel the urgency of a singular sensibility a mix of curiosity , erotic attraction , repulsion , fear , mordant humor and humane sympathy ken johnson
videotape of terri schiavo blinking at her parents has inspired donations from people around the country to the foundation set up to help pay for the family s legal battle but many other groups are soliciting donations in her name as well , some for a much broader agenda help save terri schiavo s life ! says the web site of the traditional values coalition , a christian conservative group best known for its campaigns against gay rights next to a link to the web site of her parents' foundation is a pitch to become an active supporter of the traditional values coalition by pledging a monthly gift what this issue has done is it has galvanized people the way nothing could have done in an offelection year , said rev lou sheldon , the founder of the group , acknowledging that the case of ms schiavo , a severely braindamaged florida woman , had moved many to open up their checkbooks that is what i see as the blessing that dear terri s life is offering to the conservative christian movement in america mr sheldon , whose organization is based in anaheim , calif , said his group had sent email messages and direct mailings telling supporters to call elected officials about the schiavo case and usually asking for donations as well voice for terri , a coalition of antiabortion and christian conservative groups , is one of several organizations that has sent email messages and set up web sites pointedly criticizing ms schiavo s husband , michael , who has fought for years to have his wife s feeding tube removed over the objections of her parents troy newman , the president of the antiabortion group operation rescue and a spokesman for voice for terri , said the coalition was spending the money it raised to cover the costs of rallies , of hotel rooms and of rental cars for organizers of protests in florida , and of email and letterwriting campaigns this is not something you make money off of , mr newman said it is a tragedy the web site of ms schiavo s parents , robert and mary schindler , terrisfightorg , warns visitors that their foundation and web site are the only legitimate places to contribute to her legal defense any other source that claims to be a fundraising effort on her behalf should be brought to our attention here , the site says paul nelson , the president of the evangelical council for financial accountability , which certifies the accounting of many of the bestknown evangelical charities , said his organization frowned on groups raising money for causes peripheral to their work and mr nelson said any accusations or criticisms against mr schiavo or others that were raised on web sites and could not be proved would stretch his organization s requirement that all fundraising be truthful none of these conservative groups would say how much they had raised so far by invoking the schiavo case the connections can be complicated ms schiavo s parents invited randall terry , the founder of operation rescue , who is estranged from the group , to help organize rallies and protests for their cause mr terry , in turn , asked his friends and fellow conservative activists , william greene and philip sheldon the son of lou sheldon of traditional values to help raise money through their organization rightmarchcom the two founded rightmarchcom two years ago to counter the wellfinanced antics of radical leftwing groups like moveonorg , according to the group s web site often quoting ms schiavo s father s endorsement of mr terry , their organization has taken out advertisements in usa today and the washington times , and on radio stations around the country , directing supporters to its web site it has also sent millions of email messages to its mailing list urging save terri schiavo from starvation ! and asking for donations mr greene , who is also president of strategic internet campaign management \( the acronym is pronounced sic 'em , according to the group s web site \) , said he did not expect to raise more than the group spent on advertising and computer services for the battle over ms schiavo , but any surplus would be spent on conservative causes general operating procedure for anyone , i guess , mr greene said
pity paul dukas he seems fated to be remembered only for his miraculous and ubiquitous 1897 score , the sorcerer s apprentice , immortalized in disney s fantasia but in his day dukas , who died in 1935 in paris , was a highly respected composer , teacher and critic , though his catalog of completed works is inexplicably meager none of this explains the rarity of productions of his only opera , ariane et barbebleue first presented in paris in 1907 , it is a retelling of the legend of bluebeard , with a libretto by maurice maeterlinck , no less , the nobel prizewinning symbolist playwright who wrote the libretto for debussy s pell as et m lisande the adventurous new york city opera has corrected this neglect with a new production of ariane that opened on thursday night \( the metropolitan opera can claim the united states premiere of the work , in 1911 , a production starring geraldine farrar as ariane and conducted by toscanini that played for only seven performances \) perhaps the opera has slipped through the stylistic divide between postwagnerian and french impressionist camps dukas was a wagner acolyte who made two pilgrimages to bayreuth during his 20 s yet , the score is infused with the harmonically ambiguous and ethereal language of debussy , who had a lovehate relationship with wagner while opera fans should be grateful for the opportunity to experience this rich work , the production , directed by paulemile fourny and conducted by leon botstein , both in their company debuts , failed to convey its more elusive and subtle elements though mr botstein had a sure grasp of the flow and shape of the score , the orchestral performance was heavyhanded , lacking in texture and sometimes blaring , too much like die walk re and too little like pell as is the city opera s sound enhancement system a culprit \? maeterlinck s version of the legend is told with a feminist twist from the perspective of ariane , the latest wife of the bewitching duke when she arrives at his forbidding castle , a chorus of peasants issues warning cries in tormented tones she refuses to believe that her husband is responsible for the deaths of his previous five wives as if to tempt her , barbebleue gives ariane keys to seven rooms , including a golden key to a forbidden door behind that final door , which , of course , she cannot resist opening , ariane finds her five predecessors languishing in a catacomb becoming their sisterly ally , she empowers them to bedeck themselves in the duke s stash of queenly jewels and garments before facing the world her message seems to be that selfconfidence is the first step to independence , so why not look beautiful \? from the opening prelude , dukas s score is murky , agitated and harmonically restless the orchestration is wondrously lush and subtle the five wives and ariane sing some intense ensembles , and you cannot help thinking of wagner s valkyries still , the performance pushed the score too much , for me , in the germanic direction the austrian soprano renate behle , portraying the demanding role of ariane in her company debut , has sung isolde , elektra and other heavy german roles her voice , while sizable , sounded thick , tremulous and sometimes strident still , she was a forceful presence the duskyvoiced mezzosoprano ursula ferri had a shaky night , sounding insecure when her voice edged higher though barbebleue looms over the entire threeact opera , he appears in only two scenes , and in the final one , fatally wounded by the rebellious peasants , he does not sing still , the strapping bass ethan herschenfeld made an impact in the role over all , the performance and production , with louis d sir costumes and sets \( a symbolist montage of rotating walls , descending screens and hazy scrims \) work well enough to make the city opera s ariane a smart stop for committed buffs and the operatically curious performances continue today at 1 30 pm and on tuesday , friday , oct 16 and oct 22 at the city opera , new york state theater , lincoln center , \( 212 \) 8705630
babies born into what is certain to be a brief life of grievous suffering should have their lives ended by physicians under strict guidelines , according to two doctors in the netherlands the doctors , eduard verhagen and pieter jj sauer of the university medical center in groningen , in an essay in today s new england journal of medicine , said they had developed guidelines , known as the groningen protocol the guidelines have been described in some news reports over the last several weeks , and the authors said they wrote their essay to address bloodchilling accounts and misunderstandings we are convinced that lifeending measures can be acceptable in these cases under very strict conditions , the authors wrote those conditions include the full and informed consent of the parents , the agreement of a team of physicians , and a subsequent review of each case by an outside legal body to determine whether the decision was justified and all procedures had been followed stephen drake , a research analyst at not dead yet , an organization based in the united states that views euthanasia and assisted suicide as threats to people with disabilities , said there s nothing surprising about the medical profession wanting to formalize and legitimize practices that have wide acceptance in the medical community worldwide , and added , obviously , we 're against that the groningen protocol , he said , is based on singling out infants based on somebody else s assessment of their quality of life doctors commonly abort fetuses when grave medical conditions like taysachs disease are diagnosed in utero , and after birth will commonly withdraw treatment from infants with no hope of survival , or even end the lives of some of those newborns in a telephone interview , dr verhagen said that he and dr sauer were trying to bring a measure of accountability to acts that go on every day around the world given the fact that it is already happening , he said , we find it unacceptable that it is happening in silence in the netherlands , euthanasia is legal for patients older than 16 who request it the question under consideration now is whether deliberate lifeending procedures are also acceptable for newborns and infants , despite the fact that these patients cannot express their own will , the authors wrote or must infants with disorders associated with severe and sustained suffering be kept alive when their suffering cannot be adequately reduced \? the doctors divided the newborns who might be considered for endoflife decisions into three groups the first is made up of infants with no chance of survival because of severe underlying diseases babies in the second group have a very poor prognosis and are dependent on intensive care although intensive treatment might help them to survive , they have an extremely poor prognosis and a poor quality of life the third group has a hopeless prognosis and experience what parents and medical experts deem to be unbearable suffering , whether or not they need intensive medical care within this group , the doctors include a child with the most serious form of spina bifida , a condition in which the spinal column does not close completely according to the doctors , in the netherlands there are 15 to 20 cases of euthanasia each year in newborns who fall into the third group two cases reviewed by the authors resulted in court cases in the mid1990 s , and in each case , the dutch courts approved the procedures as meeting requirements for good medical practice the authors also examined 22 cases of euthanasia of newborns with severe cases of spina bifida that have been reported to district attorneys' offices since 1997 none of those doctors were prosecuted publishing the groningen guidelines is not about our preparedness or joy in ending life , dr verhagen said it s another phase , the phase that comes afterward if you end the life of children , are you prepared to be accountable for it \? douglas j sorocco , a lawyer in oklahoma city who has spina bifida , said that doctors might be quick to classify a baby as a hopeless case who might , with the right medical care , lead a happy and productive life he said he might be classified as having the most serious form of the condition , since he was born with an open spine people with spina bifida are having families , and making a contribution to their communities , said mr sorocco , who is chairman of the board of directors of the spina bifida association of america i would say i have a life worth living my wife would say i have a life worth living my family would say i have a life worth living dr verhagen said that he did not question the quality of life of people like mr sorocco , but argued that there was no comparison between those healthy people and the developmentally devastated newborns described in his paper arthur caplan , a professor of bioethics at the university of pennsylvania , said he could not imagine such guidelines and practices becoming the norm in the united states it s not acceptable to the culture , he said the doctors in the netherlands appeared to agree this approach suits our legal and social culture , they wrote , but it is unclear to what extent it would be transferable to other countries
abboccato is the 21stcentury version of an italianamerican restaurant there are no red tablecloths , no candles stuck in raffiacovered wine bottles , no lasagna or garlic bread instead there is an italian restaurant with one foot firmly planted in italy , the other in the new world buffalo milk ricotta , meet sourdough bread umbrian truffles , meet fresh corn and because no selfrespecting upscale restaurant is entitled to high prices without it , foie gras after an extensive tour of italy , the livanos family decided to add another restaurant to the two it owns in midtown , molyvos and oceana the livanoses hired a chef who had worked at felidia and esca , and tried to make a grottolike space in the blakely hotel into something bright and light but there are too many things going on in the decorative effort jim botsacos , the chef and a partner at molyvos and abboccato , and jake addeo , abboccato s chef de cuisine , are cooking some interesting but seldom seen regional dishes and creating a few delightful combinations that would never see the light of day in italy it s a bit of a jumble , but often a pleasing one , like the heavenly buffalo milk ricotta soup with tomatoes , corn and crisp pancetta i could eat it every week or the perfectly roasted black bass that is served with seared escarole stuffed with a zesty caponata , all of it moistened with a vinaigrette made with pork jowls foie gras has found its way into ravioli stuffed with wild radicchio and ricotta and served with a sage , walnut and balsamic butter sauce the only complaint was that the ravioli were a little too al dente another felicitous marriage is foie gras the buttery interior bursting through the nicely crisp exterior served with a potato dumpling stuffed with tomato marmalade anyone who likes quail but despairs of the bones should go directly to abboccato s boneless , beautifully roasted preparation , about the size of a spaldeen it is stuffed with mortadella and pistachios and served with lentils , the traditional balsamic onions and an unexpected slash of mostarda , the fruit and mustard preserves often found on a cheese plate carpaccio of tomatoes \? words take on meanings here they never had before as you might suspect , the tomatoes are thinly sliced and make a base for sweet peekytoe crab meat , lightly flavored with scallions and punctuated with lovage of course , this dish depends entirely on the flavor of the raw ingredients , so it wo n't be around much longer this year tomatoes also depend on proper salting and here is where the kitchen falls down on the notsosimple task the use of sea salt it is a fault emblematic of the restaurant s drawbacks , and it prevents abboccato , which means medium sweet , from being as good as it can be there is not always a steady hand at the stove on each visit some dishes tasted as if the chef had stock in a sea salt company you ca n't sprinkle coarse salt the way you sprinkle morton s not everyone wants a burst of salt in a bite but in other dishes it was completely missing the otherwise excellent spaghetti alla amatriciana , made with housecured pig jowls which sound better in italian , guanciale was oversalted at the other extreme , the tagliatelle bolognese was a tepid rendition of the old tradition , chiefly because it tasted saltfree a side dish of peperonata lacked not only salt but also any evidence of the ingredients that give it its usual piquancy onion , garlic and vinegar the panseared potatoes with pancetta and onion tasted reheated and you guessed it devoid of salt on the other hand , the rack of lamb for two , baked in a salt and mint crust , was not at all salty or minty for that matter the meat , though perfectly cooked medium rare , was tough for some reason most of the cheeses on the wellselected tray did not come with bread , though they were served with some delicious preparation of fruit , either macerated or marinated , fresh or dried that s how italians like to eat cheese but americans want bread , and when they ask for it in this country , in this city and in this restaurant , the waiter should not shoot them a look of disdain and say the restaurant does not have bread it was this same waiter who on two occasions stood uncomfortably close to the table , staring at my guests and almost close enough to hear the conversation each time someone spilled a drop on the table cloth , he rushed over with a napkin and ceremoniously placed it over the offending spot four times at one meal did he know i was reviewing the restaurant \? i doubt it it was service not with a smile but with a sneer i think the ma tre d'h tel needs to keep him busier otherwise , the service was pleasant and appropriate the hardest course for an italian restaurant in america to conjure up is dessert because italians finish their meals with the cheese but abboccato s pastry chef , david carmichael , has come up with some pleasing desserts connected to italy tiny , warm cinnamondusted doughnuts with vanilla mascarpone were hard to resist and the buffalo milk ricotta cheese tart with seasonal fruit poached in wine was a delightful mix of creamy , sweet and acidic thinly sliced , toasted panettone with an orangemarmaladestudded semifreddo , lovingly bathed in warm chocolate sauce , was a delicious deconstructed take on an ice cream sandwich the gelati might have pink peppercorns , mostarda or just plain caramel but bonet was an overly dense , unpleasantly bitter chocolate mousse with a white chocolate topping though the menu says it is served with three citrus powders , the night we tried it the citrus had taken a powder but when the espresso arrived with perfect little hazelnut meringues , we forgot about the bonet simple is good reviews by frank bruni , who is on vacation , will resume next week abboccato rating two stars 136 west 55th street in the blakely hotel , midtown \( 212 \) 2654000 atmosphere a small , pleasant space with competing decorative styles stuccosided walls , quilted walls and inlaid walls with wroughtiron sconces sound level quiet recommended dishes quaglia \( quail \) fegato grasso \( foie gras \) carpaccio di pomodoro zuppa di ricotta \( ricotta soup \) spigola nera \( black bass \) cheese tray torta di ricotta \( ricotta cheese tart \) dolce federico \( panettone and semifreddo \) bomboloni \( doughnuts \) wine list regional italian bottles from 28 to 400 price range lunch and dinner appetizers 9 to 18 primi 20 to 26 secondi \( main \) lunch 19 to 25 dinner 26 to 36 twocourse express lunch 22 three courses 26 theater menu 35 hours lunch , noon to 3 pm monday through saturday dinner , 5 30 to 10 pm on monday , until 11 pm tuesday through thursday , and until midnight friday saturday , 5 pm to midnight sunday , noon to 10 pm reservations recommended at least a day in advance credit cards all major cards wheelchair access accessible through hotel what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction to food , ambience and service , with price taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change past reviews from the times , with additional capsule reviews by times critics nytimescom dining
yellow blond , these days , and dressed in black and white , lauren bacall , who is 80 , appears tonight on tcm s private screenings , with robert osborne the engrossing interview is a prelude to a marathon of ms bacall s films , 10 in all , to be shown tonight and tomorrow on the same channel in providing lean analyses of various encounters with howard hawks , snippy gentiles , hollywood antisemitism ms bacall repeatedly emphasizes how insecure she has always been how shaky , how selfconscious , how even simpering but in spite of her having sounded this note for years , insisting , most notably , that she could n't stop trembling while filming to have and have not , it remains impossible to detect in her anything but absolute equipoise in this interview , and in her movies there are no strings tied to you , she says , as slim , circling bogart in one of their seduction scenes , which is replayed here she meets his eyes not yet yes , she was 19 , and bogart was 25 years older , and , yes , she still remembers being a nervous wreck throughout the shooting but visible in the clip are only her throaty voice , unimpressed eyes and surges of mischievous , semisadistic physicality evident in that movie when she scrutinizes bogart for strings , and slaps him for not shaving and none of that betrays a hint of anxiety she knew what she was doing all along and thus tonight s interview may provide an occasion to doubt and make sense of the great woman s lifelong habit of feigned na vet in the heyday of marilyn monroe , whose kittenishness seems to have puzzled her \( even as she grants that it worked \) , as well as a pantheon of other neurotic midcentury actresses , ms bacall appears to have kept her head , in part by carefully modulating a calculated awe of the powerful men around her it ca n't have hurt that she had an ally in bogart in the early years , but another way she kept aloof from typical starlet woes was by turning the town s top dogs into her friends gregory peck , frank sinatra , kirk douglas , john wayne they were all , in her telling , great pals , wonderfully fallible and vulnerable and adorable oh , and of course she was terrified of them in discussing her personal life , also , ms bacall invokes again the disingenuous , if harmless , conceit of her persistent trepidation at the big , bad world born in new york , she was raised by her romanian mother , who worked her parents divorced when she was 6 she insists that this background makes her only a nice , provincial jewish girl , adding as evidence the fact that she had never left new york city until diana vreeland flew her to florida when she was a teenage model imagine not traveling for vogue until you 've graduated from high school ! a real latebloomer , apparently and sheltered of bogart , who when she met him was married to his third wife , she says , he 'd call me up at 3 in the morning , and say meet me on the corner of beverly drive and wilshire boulevard , which i did , and my mother would say 'where are you going \? what are you doing \? ' i said , 'i'm going to meet him' 'you ca n't meet him ! he s a married man ! ' i said , 'yeah , but he likes me' the pallid explanation seemed to suffice when dawn with bogart is at stake , all mothers should be so strict ultimately what emerges in tonight s interview is a portrait not of a scared ing nue who has learned to hide her feelings , but of an openhearted and ironwilled woman who knows how to cultivate and deploy innocence an actress , in short tcm , tonight at 8 , eastern and pacific 7 , central time robert osborne , host produced for tcm
the company that publishes the village voice and five other alternative newspapers is to announce today an agreement to be acquired by new times media , the largest publisher in the market the deal would create a chain of 17 free weekly newspapers around the country with a combined circulation of 18 million the merger coming in the same week as the voice s 50th anniversary will undoubtedly raise questions about whether the voice and its siblings can preserve their antiestablishment roots as part of a growing corporation but in an increasingly rocky media landscape , an equally important question is whether conglomeration will give the chain which would include la weekly , sf weekly , miami new times and the dallas observer the editorial and financial muscle to compete against free competitors , both online and in print james larkin , the chairman and chief executive of new times , said in an interview that the merger , unlike those in the broader newspaper industry , where consolidation has led to accusations of uniformity and boilerplate coverage , allows us to get stronger and to have stronger content the most pressing issue raised by the deal is how it will play with antitrust regulators , with whom the merger partners have already had one runin in 2002 , the justice department charged new times media and village voice media with illegal collusion and blocked a deal between them to shut down moneylosing publications in los angeles and cleveland as a result , those papers were sold to other publishers , and the companies signed a consent decree in 2003 that , while they admitted no wrongdoing , ensures that their planned combination will get plenty of regulatory scrutiny as part of that settlement , the companies agreed that any further deals over the next five years would have to be submitted to the government for approval in any case , because of its size , the transaction would require approval under the hartscottrodino act of 1976 in addition , after an article speculating about the deal was published several months ago in a rival san francisco weekly , the california attorney general s office put new times on notice that it expected to be notified of any deal mr larkin described the consent decree as an albatross that stemmed from bad legal advice although no money is changing hands , people involved to the merger said it valued the combined companies at about 400 million the merged company , which will continue to use the name village voice media , is effectively an acquisition by new times , whose current shareholders will own 62 percent of the new company and hold five of nine board seats it will have revenue of roughly 180 million both companies are private and therefore do not publish their financial results , but mr larkin said that the combined entity would be profitable and that , despite industry pressures , new times had been increasing revenue and profit by single digits each year in 2000 , the voice chain was acquired by an investor group that includes david schneiderman , a former editor , and various arms of the investment firms goldman sachs weiss , peck greer and trimaran capital partners none of the current investors are exiting as part of the merger , although mr larkin said the expectation was that he and his partners would buy out the financial backers in five years mr larkin is to be chairman and chief executive , and michael lacey , new times s executive editor , is to continue in that role at village voice media a trust controlled by mr larkin and mr lacey , who have been publishing partners since 1971 , will hold 53 percent of the combined company s shares they would be the largest individual shareholders within that trust they have been backed in their efforts to assemble a chain of weeklies by alta communications , a private equity firm in boston that currently holds 14 percent of new times media mr schneiderman , who is currently village voice media s chief executive , is to take a new position as head of the group s online efforts donald h forst , the editor of the village voice newspaper , will continue in his role once the deal closes but mr forst and all the voice media editors will now report to mr lacey , rather than their individual publishers mr lacey said the voice papers are a good fit with new times s crusading culture and emphasis on indepth magazinestyle coverage of local news , although observers noted that new times had been deliberately apolitical and the voice had been unstintingly leftleaning i do n't think it will have a negative impact on the content of the papers , said jane levine , a former publisher of the chicago reader who is now on the paper s board there may well be changes to the content of the papers being bought , and there will be people who think that they will be negative , in part because new times does n't endorse political candidates if you think the loss of the endorsements is a big negative change , you wo n't be happy with this deal another criticism of new times has been the development of a consistent design that mr lacey described as a template aimed at appealing to travelers , but he said the village voice would retain its logo and format the village voice newspaper , with its weekly circulation of 250 , 000 , will be the flagship of the company as well as the national brand for a new alternative media internet portal that the merged company is planning generally , the alternative weekly format of melding provocative writing , serious arts coverage and extensive listings and classifieds has become unbundled by the web and readers of new times and voice papers , like those of all news media businesses , are spending more time online the online move that is meant to reposition the village voice as a national brand also represents the company s most immediate commercial challenge the voice s oncelucrative classified advertising business , unique in its size among all the papers in the new company , has been hampered by the success of the free ad site craigslist mr schneiderman said that the company was having a fantastic year relative to the daily newspaper industry , and that advertising categories other than classified ads were performing well at the voice it s painful , he said we 've lost millions of dollars of revenue to free online classifieds part of the strategy to address that shortfall will involve integrating village voice media papers with backpagecom , which is new times s attempt to compete with craigslist for free advertising additionally , the papers are to become part of a broader effort to tap into national advertising through a new times business called ruxton media group , which sells marketing packages in print and online meant to appeal to the typically young techsavvy readers of alternative weeklies together , the merged companies' publications would represent roughly 25 percent of the 76 million in weekly circulation that the association of alternative newsweeklies counts among its 126 north american members but that total does not include the many rivals looking for the attention of those readers or a slice of the alternative weekly advertising pie among them are the socalled faux alt weeklies produced by daily newspaper publishers new giveaway dailies like amnew york and online journalism sites like slate and salon the companies' filing under the hartscottrodino act is subject to a 30day government review period the government could request additional information that might delay the deal s completion mr lacey lamented that during that period he and mr larkin would have to refrain from sharing specific planswith employees at village voice media , a silence that he said would only enhance the perception they are the industry s bogeymen while acknowledging that the pending union will raise anxiety , both mr larkin and mr lacey said they hoped to be received as dedicated longterm proprietors after a string of unconventional owners of the voice during the last two decades , including the media baron rupert murdoch , the real estate and petfood mogul leonard n stern and the current consortium of financial firms i'm doing it because i love good journalism , mr larkin said i want to have newspapers in the most exciting markets in the country this is not a financial play
on a recent blueskied saturday , my family and i went to a bas mitzvah in a big , homey space used by b'nai jeshurun on west end avenue at 86th street the congregation is spirited there was lots of singing and clapping a slight , familiarlooking figure with a silk scarf tied fashionably around her head made her way toward us in a neighborhood like the upper west side , which overflows with young families , the past presents itself at unexpected moments as you walk down broadway , or push your cart around fairway out of context , it takes a moment to place a face , even of someone you once saw every day as the woman slipped into our pew , i had a double jolt first , of pleasure at recognizing nancy goldstein , who had been my younger daughter s teacher at public school 87 and , second , of dismay that she was battling cancer the scarf told the story after the service , ms goldstein filled me in on the details breast cancer multiple surgeries , chemotherapy , radiation single mom , with a daughter who was a senior in high school friends helped , like the one who organized her chemo schedule , and made sure someone went with her every time she had to make the trip to memorial sloankettering cancer center when the dean at her daughter s high school learned the news , he called to say you take care of yourself we 'll take care of your daughter and he did , shepherding the girl through the college application process ms goldstein had begun teaching 13 years earlier , when she was in her 40 s , after a career in the music business she worked throughout the year , she said with some pride , despite days when she felt totally rotten or exhausted a substitute took over when she had to be out , but she was able to plan her absences and made sure her students knew when she would n't be in class there s a lot to learn in third grade multiplication , spelling , geography and this year , in addition to the usual curriculum , her pupils learned what it was like to have someone in your life go through cancer treatment when she finished her last radiation session , the class celebrated with a nancy s all better party , although actually , she was n't , quite the radiation had caused a burn so painful that she went directly to the hospital after the party , and soon realized that she would not be able to take her class on a longawaited field trip to ellis island her class took it in stride that did n't surprise her what did , she said , were the adults in her life , some of whom vanished when she got sick people should learn how to be with people who have cancer , she said it s an isolating disease if they just say something , the ice is broken and life can go on small kindnesses meant a lot one teacher dropped a chocolate kiss on her desk each day a week or so after the bas mitzvah , the day arrived that ms goldstein had chosen to doff her scarf and show off her newly grownin hair as she walked down the hall at the school on west 78th street , selfconscious about the saltandpepper buzz cut that was so different from the luxuriant red curls that once framed her face , none of the colleagues she passed said a word did n't they notice \? ' she wondered to herself she went out into the sunshine to collect her third graders from the schoolyard , where parents swarmed her with hugs and compliments one mother pulled me aside to say how much the year had meant to her and her child her husband had died of a brain tumor when their son was 4 it was important for him to see that someone can have cancer and live , she said in the classroom the children went about the business of getting settled for the day ms goldstein asked them to take their places and focus on her the baldheaded nancy , one boy chanted in a singsong voice to his friend ms goldstein laughed she complimented the boy on saying what they all were probably thinking she told the story of how she had left the house that morning wearing her hat , because she was still a little nervous about appearing with her new hair she pulled the hat out of her bag and modeled it for them she showed them how she took it off , looked around , and finally stuffed it in her bag , reaching up from time to time to pet her cap of hair then she told the children about the silence that had greeted her as she walked down the hall , and asked them why they thought that had happened maybe they were thinking , 'what just happened to nancy \? ' volunteered one or maybe they were wondering , 'where are all the scarves \? ' said another finally , one ventured they might feel embarrassed a boy in the back piped up my grandma just found out she has cancer she has to get the same xray as you another child focused on her teacher s coif you have a haircut like me now , he said some people say it s like a porcupine the class talked for a bit about embarrassment and how people were afraid to hurt other people s feelings that segued into the morning s curriculum a lesson on poetry , which they 'd been working on poetry , as ms goldstein approached it , was a way to write about things that were difficult to express , or feelings that were complicated one assignment had been to write about something they were worried about miriam butler read her poem aloud with the assurance of an established poet its title nancy s sickness i was so worried about nancy s sickness , i was worried all the time i was worried night day and even at snack time one day , she said , i'm all better that was the end of my worries , until i had to take the 3rd grade test and that , i tell you is a whole other story
new orleans , dec 16 charity hospital , an institution that for nearly three centuries has been dedicated to treating the poorest and sickest here the shot , stabbed , overdosed and uninsured has been abandoned downtown since hurricane katrina it is now at the center of a battle over whether it will continue that tradition , or become a more conventional hospital the state officials who manage charity say hurricane katrina dealt this huey longera landmark a deathblow and want it torn down in its place , they say , they want to build a hospital with a new mission , one that treats both public and private patients and relies less on government money but doctors who work there sharply disagree with that plan they say louisiana officials are using the storm as an excuse to achieve the state s longsought goal of demolishing charity , getting millions in federal dollars to build a new hospital , and then moving away from a promise that has long been made to the city s poor people want to use these disasters to get insurance money , said dr james moises , an emergency room physician at charity who helped clean up the hospital after the storm louisiana officials , he said , saw it as a great opportunity to get the federal government to pay for a new facility for months now , officials have barred doctors from the building and forced them to practice in a tent field hospital , even though the doctors say the hospital is ready for use the doctors say the makeshift arrangement is inadequate for the severe trauma cases the hospital specializes in treating as one of the two oldest hospitals in north america it was founded in 1736 , the same year as bellevue hospital in new york charity has from the beginning been a symbol of a social commitment to the poor , and its wards are empty at a moment when thousands of poor new orleans residents are struggling to return home and fear that government has abandoned them in many ways , the debate over its future parallels that of new orleans itself , as it chooses whether to become a more middleclass city or to return to earlier traditions louisiana is the only state with a network of hospitals dedicated to serving the indigent before the storm , the hospital network of which charity was the linchpin was the main source of care for some 900 , 000 uninsured patients , about a fifth of the state s population don smithburg , chief executive of louisiana state university hospitals , which runs charity , said any replacement for the hospital should be based on a new model , less reliant on public dollars , with a new mission one serving both private and indigent patients this storm has told us you ca n't rely on government resources , he said university officials vigorously deny any ploys , insisting that the building is now simply unsafe the facility is not usable , said dr larry h hollier , acting chancellor of the university s health sciences center in new orleans it has tremendous deterioration on a televised media tour in october , the officials insisted that reporters wear fullbody protective gear in the basement and sign a health release , precautions regarded as laughable by doctors who cleaned the facility wearing shorts and tshirts walter adams , the state s consulting engineer from atlanta , assessed the building two years ago and recommended in a report to the state that it come down because of problems with its infrastructure and its outmoded layout mr adams inspected the building after hurricane katrina and cited asbestos in fallen ceilings tiles as one of his concerns veteran doctors at the hospital said the tiles were made of bagasse , a traditional louisiana building material made from sugarcane residue the federal occupational safety and health administration said it took two samples for airborne asbestos and found none state officials said they were not aware of any comprehensive environmental assessment of the building mr adams issued another report , restating the need for demolition and saying that 65 percent of charity s building was damaged by the storm , which is more than the federal emergency management agency s 51 percent threshold for a replacement officials from the federal agency confirmed that the state had been seeking federal aid for a new hospital louisiana officials said it would cost more than 600 million the state has mounted a very impressive public relations campaign to publicize their desires , said david fukutomi , a coordinating officer with fema , who expressed skepticism about the state s estimate of the damage to charity mr fukutomi said the agency would make its own determination of the damage charity hospital , originally known as l'hopital des pauvres de la charit , or hospital for the indigent , has been at the same downtown site since 1833 , and has occupied its current mshaped , 20story , art decostyle building since 1939 both the building and the institution have for generations played a unique role in the life of this impoverished city , a place the destitute and the working poor could always count on for help criminals who were handcuffed would be treated as readily as construction workers with no insurance many of the city s famous musicians and politicians were born there , like ernie kdoe , the eccentric rhythmandblues master of motherinlaw fame , and the current mayor , c ray nagin allen toussaint wrote a song to celebrate charity s 250th anniversary , in 1986 \( charity s always there \) , and the current building abounds with art deco touches an evocative aluminum grill over the entrance shows stylized louisianans in characteristic roles fishermen , trappers , dockworkers and sugarcane cutters as well as two ducks , a cheeky reference to mr long s deduct box , his practice of deducting contributions from workers for years , legislators and officials in baton rouge , traditionally hostile to new orleans , have slashed charity s budget , and in recent decades the old hospital has lurched from crisis to crisis , including stretches when , because of the facility s dilapidation , it lost its accreditation even its most ardent defenders acknowledged that the building , with its openward layout and vintage mechanical systems , needed an overhaul , if not outright replacement , before hurricane katrina but they say that now , with the city in crisis , it is not the time to close any health care option , even one that is less than ideal with charity ordered shut by the university , the city is facing an acute shortage of patient beds , doctors say and charity s historic teaching role for decades the principal learning arena for medical students at two universities , tulane and louisiana state university is no more we need more inpatient beds , and we need a place to take care of patients that are unfunded , said dr juliette saussy , director of emergency medical services for new orleans inpatient facilities are absolutely swamped dr saussy added in the past , we had charity now we do n't like other doctors who have been inside the old hospital since the cleanup effort , she asserted that the crews had made the building usable again in the weeks after hurricane katrina , doctors , nurses and dozens of military personnel worked feverishly to restore charity army , navy , coast guard and civil engineers from germany , equipped with giant hydraulic pumps and with the help of the medical staff , pumped water from charity s basement , removed excrement and trash from the halls and clambered up 19 flights of stairs to mop floors but then , with the first three floors cleaned and ready for use , a halfdozen of the doctors said , they were abruptly ordered out of charity , while state officials began their campaign for a new building dr peter deblieux , director of resident and faculty development and a leader in the restoration effort , and dr moises said the cleanup teams were deeply frustrated by the orders to desist we were na ve enough to believe people would want to do the right thing by the community , and ensure health care , dr moises said on numerous occasions they ordered us out they said , 'we want you out , stop cleaning the building' state officials said the doctors were told to get out for their own safety i ordered that be stopped , based on the environmental assessment reports i was getting from the consulting engineers , said mr smithburg , the louisiana state university executive we had guys in there who were very wellmeaning but we had to keep telling them and telling them a series of photographs taken by doctors and military personnel , after most of the cleanup effort had been completed , appear to show the emergency room and other rooms in the hospital in clean condition no trash is visible the floors look scrubbed on a recent warm day here , the emergency room at charity was empty and silent , wornlooking from decades of hard use , but hardly derelict the only sound was from a security guard s television set she had seen it all gunshot victims , stabbing victims , rape victims , enraged arrestees , inmates , as well as legions of the uninsured we had all that going on here , said the guard , donna jennings now , we have nothing this is just about where the average person came now , i do n't know where are all the gunshot victims going to go \?
after months of meetings dedicated to quieting critics of his imminent makeover of yet another disheveled new york city park , george vellonakis , the parks department landscape architect behind the muchvilified 16 million rejuvenation of washington square park , seems to have reached the saturation point in a positive way he takes it as a vote of confidence that at the most recent demonstration against his plan , only 20 protesters showed up mr vellonakis , who managed to survive being publicly denounced as the rapist of downtown brooklyn when he was introduced at an art commission hearing during his redesign of cadman plaza at borough hall , is a resilient sort and cocky , too possibly by necessity i'm george vellonakis , the rapist of downtown brooklyn , he recalls saying at the hearing , echoing the nasty introduction he has lived in greenwich village since 1989 and has revived seven parks , including abingdon square , where his redesign provoked a lawsuit over a wrought iron fence \( his plan prevailed \) here , the criticism has been less vicious he is , after all , a conscientious neighbor but vibrant they 're just angry about change , but i do n't think it s geared against me personally , he says , leaning tentatively against a chickenwire enclosure in washington square park with city parks , anytime you want to make a change there s controversy , but when the park is in greenwich village , there s more controversy there s this contingent that believes that even if it s broke , do n't fix it the silvertopped mr vellonakis , 46 , trim , single and accessorized by gucci , has n't been bitten , but he has been barked at by dog owners who do n't want their turf relocated and by squirrel lovers and by preservationist fans of the three asphalt mounds , the remains of a playground , now used as condominiums by neighborhood rats he wants to replace them with a new playground a large plaza would be replaced by a lawn a fence and gates would go up along the perimeter i'm surprised i have n't yet been approached by a save the washington square park rats coalition , he jokes partly mr vellonakis really dislikes those mounds not pretty ! does n't it make you want to come out here with a bulldozer \? a park should n't be multiple layers of concrete ! that s the failure of this park let it feel like park ! let it be green ! his planned upgrades have drawn scrutiny from nimby types worried about gentrification of this slice of bohemia as if , he says , gentrification is n't a done deal around here he has been chastised by traditionalists who do n't want the fountain , a central park leftover , aligned with washington square park s signature arch and by aficionados of the 1970 s concrete barriers and sunken planters and by folks who do n't realize that good fences make good petunias he also heard from an irate astrologist who took him to task for not consulting the zodiac he apologized mr vellonakis is an ace apologizer as a designer , you know not everyone is going to agree with you 100 percent , but once you start losing your professionalism and arguing , you 're a loser mr vellonakis does n't even argue when a guard at a perimeter barricade for new york university s outdoor commencement ceremony refuses him access to the empty plaza i never lose my temper , he says smoothly and he saves his lectures for his alma mater , city college , where he has been an adjunct professor the washington square project , which germinated during the giuliani administration , has occupied him 24 7 since last fall it has consumed my life to relieve the stress , he does interior design projects like repolyurethaning his floors at his coop on lower fifth avenue , where he designed the communal roof garden though he spent this morning bunkered in the brick field house , blueprints in hand and spiel at the ready for his weekly meetthepublic session , nobody dropped by to complain hurrah all the parks department needs now is a thumbsup from the landmarks preservation commission and phase one of renovation , focusing on the fountain and the plaza , will begin in late summer his fingers are crossed you have a respect for preservation up to a certain extent , but if you know you have a design where the usage is not a success , you modify it , he says it s a failure if you just restore something you know is not being used properly it s not all about preservation it s about modern times and making a space work for all its constituents whereas his mandate in the 30 million redesign of city hall park in 1999 was the innovative use of landscape features as security devices , here the mandate is giving a grassy backyard to those who have none he hopes to oversee the project i need 100 percent trust in every bit of construction that happens here , he says i'm a detail fanatic , and this absolutely has to be done right has he ever had a park vision that went awry \? good question , he says , without giving an answer mr vellonakis was raised in the bronx both parents were in banking , but he wanted to be an architect he made villages out of backyard mud at city college , he became entranced with the design of urban landscapes , and took a summer job with the parks department he says he has had offers of private work to tend the famous gardens at the famous homes of famous people i always decline , he says doing an estate is easy i could do it blindfolded having the city as a client is where the challenge is public lives correction may 17 , 2005 , tuesday on friday , because of an editing error , the public lives profile , about george vellonakis , the landscape architect who has redesigned the park , misstated the total number of city parks he has refurbished it is more than two dozen , not seven correction may 17 , 2005 , tuesday an article last tuesday about new york city s plans to redesign washington square park misspelled the surname of a former city council member who criticized the parks department for having consulted only a few people in the neighborhood before moving ahead she is carol greitzer , not greiser on friday , because of an editing error , the public lives profile , about george vellonakis , the landscape architect who has redesigned the park , misstated the total number of city parks he has refurbished it is more than two dozen , not seven

gadid , gaza strip , nov 26 amid the rubble of the former jewish settlements , palestinians have sown the first seeds of a modest economic revival less than three months after the israelis departed , palestinians have repaired scores of greenhouses left by the settlers and planted a fall crop , and they are preparing to harvest an estimated 20 million worth of strawberries , cherry tomatoes , sweet peppers and herbs and spices the produce is intended mostly for export to europe , but some will also be headed to israel , arab countries and the united states after overcoming numerous obstacles , the palestinians said their main worry now was the karni border crossing between the gaza strip and israel , critical to moving the produce to the markets after intense negotiations this month , secretary of state condoleezza rice brokered an agreement on the gaza crossings that says palestinian agricultural exports are to pass through karni on an urgent basis but the palestinians say they remain worried about possible delays at the crossing still , the harvest , which begins in about 10 days , will be the first tangible measure of development in gaza , which has been in an economic free fall for most of the past five years i think we have made this a success in a very short period , said bassil jabir , director of the palestine economic development company , a government group that works with the private sector and is overseeing greenhouse rehabilitation we are employing thousands of people in these greenhouses , mr jabir said during an interview in the former settlement of gadid , in the southwest corner of gaza , as he visited the flourishing greenhouses we kept the growing cycle intact we have pumped a lot of money into the gaza economy the israeli military demolished the settlers' homes before leaving in september , and piles of smashed concrete have yet to be removed some greenhouses were looted by palestinians in the chaotic days after the israeli withdrawal , but today they are hives of activity , filled with the sounds of power saws and hammers at work karni is the crossing for goods going in and out of gaza , which has no seaport or working airport during the violence of the past five years , israel has insisted on stringent checks for weapons , and palestinian militants have staged deadly attacks at karni but the lengthy israeli searches have caused frequent delays , at times spoiling produce before it reached its destination strawberries , for example , are the palestinians' most valuable export , but they should be refrigerated until they reach the market a few hours in the heat and dust at karni can ruin them once the produce clears karni , it will be handed over to the same israeli export companies that the gaza settlers used we are new to this business , and i do n't want to disrupt the system that has been in place for 30 years , said mr jabir i also believe that a divorce of the israeli and palestinian economies would n't be good for either side israel says it too has an incentive in seeing gaza s economy prosper we understand that a successful gaza economy is a crucial ingredient in the overall success of what is now palestinian gaza , said mark regev , a spokesman for israel s foreign ministry and the success of gaza is a crucial factor in getting the peace process back on track for palestinians , the greenhouses are the good news , and much of the economic picture is not so rosy they have several major development projects planned in gaza , but none have gained traction the rubble from the 1 , 500 settler homes must be removed before the palestinians can start building badly needed housing and other facilities in the former settlements , which account for roughly 20 percent of gaza s land israel is supposed to pay for the removal of the rubble , but talks to complete a plan are still under way a gaza seaport is planned , but that is expected to take a minimum of two years , and will still require negotiations with israel to operate it the palestinians want to renovate gaza s airport , which israel closed five years ago , but israel has not yet authorized its repair and reopening when the jewish settlers came to gaza decades ago , they developed innovative techniques for cultivating highquality fruits and vegetables in the barren sand dunes , where fresh water is scarce when the israeli farmers started leaving , they took their most valuable equipment with them , and some greenhouses were damaged or destroyed james d wolfensohn , the envoy for countries involved in middle east peacemaking , cobbled together a group of wealthy jewish americans who pledged 14 million in compensation for the israeli farmers provided that they left the greenhouses intact the deal was reached just days before the settlers were evacuated , and it is not clear that it prevented much additional damage to the greenhouses still , palestinian officials praise mr wolfensohn s overall efforts to preserve the greenhouses and revitalize gaza s enfeebled economy the israelis said they had about 1 , 000 acres of greenhouses in gaza but by the time palestinian officials surveyed the land , they found only a few hundred acres in working condition we had to rehabilitate the greenhouses day and night to catch the fall planting season , said muhammad bader , who is running the greenhouse project for the palestine economic development company today , crops are growing on close to 600 acres , and the palestinians hope to plant on another 200 acres next month last year , palestinian agricultural exports from the west bank and gaza totaled about 80 million , mr bader said the fall harvest from the gaza greenhouses could add about 20 million to the total this year , though the exact figure is difficult to predict , he said when the israelis ran the greenhouses , palestinian workers carried out much of the manual labor about 3 , 000 have retained their jobs , and 1 , 000 workers and 2 , 000 private guards have been added a typical worker makes 13 a day i think we surprised even ourselves by how quickly we reached this stage , mr bader said but we have a lot of qualified people with a lot of experience in these greenhouses
jonathan miller s tasteful production of le nozze di figaro at the metropolitan opera remains a laidback endeavor that wisely affords mozart s comedy ample room to move and breathe amid peter davison s spacious and mostly realistic sets now directed by robin guarino , it returned on wednesday with nary a heavyhanded interpretation in sight for that very reason , the smaller visual touches stand out , like the offkilter perspective introduced to the grand palace exterior in the final act right angles are suddenly in short supply , as if all the aristocratic symmetry had fallen strangely out of joint a subtle but recognizable nod to the opera s underlying theme of a social world coming unhinged written just four years before the french revolution , and based on a beaumarchais play subversive enough to be banned by french censors , figaro is , among other things , a merciless skewering of class hierarchies the count almaviva is depicted as a lecherous cad who has nominally renounced the feudal right to take his servant s bride for himself but is still corrupt to the core virtue lies , of course , with that plucky valet figaro and the maid susanna , with whom the countess engages on practically even footing da ponte s libretto trims the most polemical stretches of beaumarchais s original , but the radical spirit remains in the best performances , it churns beneath this sublime music as a dark , almost subconscious energy on wednesday , the conductor mark wigglesworth , in his house debut , traded that energy and tension for sheer speed , taking the overture at a whirring clip that even the fine metropolitan orchestra could barely maintain but the performance soon settled into a more sanely paced outing , headed by both fresh and familiar faces luca pisaroni , an italian bass who made his debut with the company last year , was a fine figaro tall and noble in bearing , he had a focused and warmly resonant voice his equally towering rival was the swedish bass peter mattei , who sang a smooth almaviva with surefooted technique and ample charisma heikyung hong made a sympathetic , purevoiced countess , and she found her way comfortably with lisa milne as susanna ms milne s voice did not glow as those of the best susannas can , but her phrasing was unerringly natural , and her tone refined joyce didonato made a strong metropolitan debut as cherubino , hopelessly entranced by all things feminine yet sincere and moving in voi che sapete the rest of the roles were filled out respectably enough by maurizio muraro , in a solid debut as don bartolo greg fedderly as don basilio wendy white as marcellina patrick carfizzi as antonio and monica yunus as barbarina mr wigglesworth did not bring a great personal stamp to the score , but with the perfection of figaro , none is required performances of le nozze di figaro continue through nov 19 at the metropolitan opera house , lincoln center \( 212 \) 3626000
the county executive , steve levy , created an uproar last fall with a plan to protect the people of suffolk from illegal alien fugitives it involved turning county police officers into justice department deputies and authorizing them to enforce federal immigration laws the idea , hatched by the bush administration for the war on terrorism , was a stretch for suffolk county , whose undocumented immigrants tend to mow lawns , blow leaves , work hard and keep their heads down mr levy said that new police powers were the only way to keep violent aliens from jumping bail but advocates for immigrants called it a useless tactic that would cause a vulnerable population of peaceable latinos to fear the police mr levy was steadfast for a while then he tinkered with the plan , suggesting at various points that the deputies should be parole officers , or that county employes get access to federal databases none of that happened mr levy s latest solution is the simplest and most obvious he received assurances from the federal authorities that suffolk police could call them any time if a problem arises , the feds will help handle it , 24 hours a day mr levy s critics insist that this is no big deal mr levy insists that it is whatever we 're glad it has been put to rest
pinellas park , fla , march 25 the somber ranks of protesters swelled on friday outside the hospice in which terri schiavo lay dying as two more lastditch legal appeals wound through the courts on friday and the sense there grew that this religious , moral and political drama was rapidly coming to a grim conclusion terri is weakening and she s down to her last hours , the woman s father , robert schindler , told reporters beneath a glowering sky something has to be done , and has to be done quick the question of whether the severely braindamaged ms schiavo should be allowed to die , as her husband , michael schiavo , says she wanted , or instead be turned over to the care of her parents , who want to keep her alive , has reached from this small , secluded hospice to the state s capitol , the vatican , the white house and the halls of congress robert schindler and his wife , mary , said doctors told them their daughter would most likely live 7 to 10 days after the removal of the feeding tube , which came out a week ago , on march 18 the drama s coincidence with good friday and easter weekend made protesters gathered here ever more fervent at one point this afternoon as the crowd sang amazing grace and onward christian soldiers , demonstrators holding plastic cups of water for ms schiavo stepped one by one across the police line at the hospice and were taken into custody still battling despite a series of legal setbacks that went all the way up to the united states supreme court , lawyers for the schindlers filed a motion friday before judge george w greer of pinellaspasco circuit court , who had ordered the tube s removal , with what they said was highly significant new information indicating that ms schiavo is more able to communicate than had been previously believed barbara weller , one of the lawyers , said she had been in the woman s hospice room on the day the tube was removed the motion before judge greer said that at one point during her visit , mrs weller attempted to elicit a direct statement from mrs schiavo regarding her end of life wishes it went on , mrs weller told mrs schiavo that this whole matter could end if mrs schiavo could articulate one sentence 'i want to live ' the motion continued , saying that ms schiavo attempted to verbalize the sentence she managed to articulate the first two vowel sounds , first articulating 'ahhhhhhh' and then virtually screaming 'waaaaaaaa' she became very agitated , but could not complete the vocalization attempted the schindlers argued that their daughter seemed to be trying to say i want , and that her feeding tube should be reinserted to determine whether she could communicate george felos , mr schiavo s lawyer , called the motion outrageous and an abuse of the legal system , saying the issue of whether ms schiavo can communicate had been addressed in previous hearings the sounds were nothing more than a reflex caused by touching her , he said judge greer said he would rule on the motion by noon saturday although the court filing did not come until late friday afternoon , whispers that ms schiavo had tried to speak rippled through the crowd of protesters and were already beginning to appear on placards terry i want to live , read one sign terri asks mom for food , read another in a second legal maneuver , this time in the federal courts , the schindlers' lawyers asked the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit , in atlanta , to overturn a ruling by judge james d whittemore of federal district court , denying their charge that ms schiavo s right to due process had been denied on friday night , the court declined to overrule judge whittemore as has been the case since crowds first began to form early in the week , nearly all of the protesters outside the woodside hospice house were siding with the schindlers i believe what is going on here is a sinister act , said marilyn aleman of orlando her sign , pointedly directed at mr schiavo , divorce is an option , murder is not , flapped in a stiff , muggy breeze a handful of other protesters quietly waved signs asking that ms schiavo be allowed to die in peace there s another side to this , said raymond simms , who described himself as a veterans' advocate no one , not even the government , should be allowed to interfere in the decisions between a husband and wife pastors in the crowd urged calm and forgiveness , but tempers were clearly on edge it s easy to get caught up in anger here , said pastor rick barnard of my faith house of prayer in morris , ill , as he led a noon service outside the hospice we need to ask the lord for the grace to forgive even those who oppose us at the same time , many of the chants and slogans were taking on a gruesome edge her skin is peeling , read one sign terri s nose and lips are bleeding , said another some protesters were even looking beyond ms schiavo s death no cremation , one sign read we want an autopsy mr schiavo and judge greer remained the main targets on friday , however , much of the anger was also being directed at gov jeb bush and his brother president bush for not taking further action to keep ms schiavo alive , despite their efforts to prod the courts and their calls for legislators to err on the side of life as president bush phrased it earlier this week president bush , governor bush fear god more than man , read one sign waved by protesters toward the burgeoning colony of cameras and reporters stationed across the street to be certain , jeb bush has done a great deal on behalf of terri , but how will history remember him if terri dies \? asked andrew doran , a spokesman for crossroads , prolife , one of the groups holding a vigil likely , as a weak , moral coward who did not have the courage to save a helpless , dying woman from those who so vehemently wished to take her life randall terry , the veteran antiabortion advocate and head of a group called the society for truth and justice , handed out what he said were five legal opinions showing that the governor had more powers than he seemed willing to use the governor has told reporters that he had asked the state s lawyers to search for any legal avenue to put ms schiavo back on her feeding tube , but had found none i cannot go beyond what my powers are , governor bush told reporters a cluster of cameras formed around the police barricade at the entrance to the hospice around 1 pm , alerted by religious leaders that they would try to send volunteers across the police lines in an effort to deliver water to ms schiavo it s good , it s good , my son is going to be a man , said scott helbreth of charlotte , nc , as he watched his 10yearold son , joshua , take his place in line carrying a cup of water mr helbreth said joshua had read about ms schiavo and asked his father to drive him to florida i am so proud of him , mr helbreth said only in america do we have children like this the crowd sang hymns and one by one protesters took their place in front of the cameras , made a short statement , then stepped across the police line and were taken into custody when it was joshua s turn , he seemed cowed by the hulking camera crews , muttering quiet answers to their shouted questions he did n't know how he felt , he replied he just wanted to do the right thing he was n't afraid joshua took two steps across the line , then looked up at two police officers , each one three times his size they spoke to him quietly , placed a hand under each of his arms and led him toward a police car what a statement this makes , mr helbreth said we have a culture of death in this country , but this strikes a blow for the culture of life
washington , march 25 despite recommendations by army investigators , commanders have decided not to prosecute 17 american soldiers implicated in the deaths of three prisoners in iraq and afghanistan in 2003 and 2004 , according to a new accounting released friday by the army investigators had recommended that all 17 soldiers be charged in the cases , according to the accounting by the army criminal investigation command the charges included murder , conspiracy and negligent homicide while none of the 17 will face any prosecution , one received a letter of reprimand and another was discharged after the investigations to date , the military has taken steps toward prosecuting some three dozen soldiers in connection with a total of 28 confirmed or suspected homicides of detainees the total number of such deaths is believed to be between 28 and 31 in one of the three cases in which no charges are to be filed , the commanders determined the death to be a result of a series of lawful applications of force in the second , the commanders decided not to prosecute because of a lack of evidence in the third , they determined the soldier involved had not been well informed of the rules of engagement a spokesman for the army criminal investigation command , chris grey , said in a statement we take each and every death very seriously and are committed and sworn to investigating each case with the utmost professionalism and thoroughness we are equally determined to get to the truth wherever the evidence may lead us and regardless of how long it takes human rights groups and others have criticized the military for not pursuing prosecution more aggressively the accounting was the most detailed the military has yet made public of the deaths of prisoners in american custody in iraq and afghanistan of the 28 deaths investigated , 13 occurred in american detention centers in those countries and 15 occurred at the point where prisoners were captured only one occurred in abu ghraib prison in iraq , which has been known until now as the site of the most extensive abuses by american military personnel the 28 deaths include two cases involving members of the navy seals , which are still being investigated by the navy , according to military officials they also include a prisoner in marine corps custody whose death resulted in the conviction of two marines on charges including assault and dereliction of duty , according to a marine spokesman not included in the 28 are three other deaths of prisoners involving marines but under investigation by the navy with the disposition of the three cases involving the 17 soldiers not prosecuted , the army now has 21 soldiers listed as subjects for prosecution on criminal charges including , among others , murder , negligent homicide and assault of those 21 soldiers , at least 3 have been convicted in general courtsmartial , and at least 3 others are awaiting trial , the army accounting showed the army said one of the three deaths for which soldiers would not be prosecuted was that of a former iraqi lieutenant colonel determined by investigators to have died of blunt force injuries and asphyxia at an american forward operating base in al asad , iraq , in january 2004 in that case , army investigators had recommended that 11 soldiers from the fifth special forces group and the third armored cavalry regiment face charges the decision not to prosecute in that case , as well as one other , was made by the army special forces command at fort bragg , nc , the army said a senior army legal official acknowledged that the iraqi colonel had at one point been lifted to his feet by a baton held to his throat , and that that action had caused a throat injury that contributed to his death the army accounting said the special forces command had determined that the use of force had been lawful in response to repeated aggression and misconduct by the detainee the former iraqi colonel was not identified but has been named in other reports as jameel the senior army legal official said the prisoner s resistance to his captors' instructions had caused them to gag him and to lift him to his feet with the baton , actions that contributed to the death the army special forces case that commanders decided to drop for lack of evidence involved the shooting death of a prisoner in afghanistan in august 2002 , the army said the case not prosecuted because the soldier involved was not well informed of the rules of engagement , involved the fourth infantry division the detainee , who died in september 2003 , was an iraqi prisoner at an american detention center the army said it has now closed its investigations into 16 of the deaths , and referred five of them to the navy , the justice department or foreign governments for possible prosecution some of the deaths described in the army accounting have already been widely reported , including two deaths at bagram in afghanistan in december 2002 the death at abu ghraib in november 2003 of an iraqi who was being questioned by a central intelligence agency officer and the death the same month of an iraqi major general who had been stuffed headfirst into a sleeping bag an army spokesman , lt col jeremy martin , said the prisoners who died represented a tiny fraction of what he said had been some 70 , 000 detainees held by american forces in iraq and afghanistan since 2001 altogether , more than a million american soldiers have taken part in those operations , colonel martin said a spokesman for the army special operations forces command , maj robert e gowan , said a careful review of the facts surrounding each of the two incidents involving that command indicated that no us army special forces command soldiers were found to have participated in any misconduct or detainee abuse us army special forces command takes all allegations of detainee abuse and homicide very seriously , major gowan said in an email statement in response to an inquiry as with any case , us army special forces command will consider all relevant evidence and facts this command will make appropriate disposition of such cases as warranted by the facts and evidence derived from the investigations
xaixai , mozambique there s a church in southern mozambique that is about 10 yards long , with a tin roof and walls made of sticks women gather there to sing and pray and look after the orphans of aids victims when you ask those women and their pastor what they tell people to prevent the spread of aids , the first thing they say is that it s important to use condoms they also talk about the consequences of unsafe sex but after a while they slip out of the language of safety and into a different language they say , it is easier for those who have been touched by god to accept when a woman says no they talk about praying for the man who beats his hivpositive wife , and trying to bring him into the congregation they have polygamists in their church but say god loves monogamy best in the week i 've spent traveling around southern africa , i 've been struck by how much technical knowledge we have brought to bear combating aids you give us a problem that can be solved technically like creating the medicines to treat the disease and we can perform mighty feats the problem is that while treatment is a technical problem , prevention is not prevention is about changing behavior it is getting into the hearts of people in their vulnerable moments when they are drinking , when they are in the throes of passion and influencing them to change the behavior that they have not so far changed under the threat of death this is a mysterious task in mozambique s gaza province , thousands of kids nursed their parents as they died and yet , according to those who now care for the orphans , the children are exactly replicating the behaviors that led to their parents' demise if that experience does n't change people , what will \? we have tried to change behavior , but we have mostly tried technical means to prevent the spread of aids , and these techniques have proved necessary but insufficient we have tried awareness , but awareness alone is insufficient surveys show that vast majorities understand , at least intellectually , the dangers of hiv they behave in risky ways anyway we have issued condoms , but condoms alone are insufficient surveys also show that a vast majority know where they can get condoms but that does n't mean they actually use them , as rising or stable infection rates demonstrate we have tried economic development , but that too is necessary but insufficient the most aggressive spreaders of the disease are relatively well off they are miners who have sex with prostitutes and bring the disease home to their wives they are teachers who trade grades for sex they are sugar daddies who have sex with 14yearold girls in exchange for cellphone time if this were about offering people the right incentives , we would have solved this problem but the aids crisis has another element , which can be addressed only by some other language the language those people in church slipped into the aids crisis is about evil it s about the small gangs of predatory men who knowingly infect women by the score without a second thought in the world the aids crisis is about the sanctity of life it s about people who have come to so undervalue their own life that ruinous behavior seems unimportant and death is accepted fatalistically it s about disproportionate suffering it s about people who commit minor transgressions , or even no transgressions , and suffer consequences too horrible to contemplate in america we read in the book of job in subsaharan africa they have 10 jobs per acre it s about these and a dozen other things trust , fear , weakness , traditions , temptation none of which can be fully addressed by externals they can be addressed only by the language of ought , by fixing behavior into some relevant set of transcendent ideals and faiths that s a language governments and ngo s rarely speak it s a language that has to be spoken by people who connect words like faithful and abstinent to some larger creed it has to be spoken , in africa , by people who understand local beliefs about ancestors and the supernatural it s a language that has to be spoken by an elder , a neighbor , a person who knows your name this week in africa , i 've been impressed by the level of medical expertise and depressed by the lack of moral , sociological , psychological and cultural expertise the most subtle analysis of human nature i heard came in that church made of sticks oped columnist email dabrooks nytimescom
biloxi , miss , sept 2 amber wyrick sat alone in a temporary office set up by the harrison county coroner , wiping at tears five days after the storm , she had yet to hear word about her 1yearold son , danny , who was with his father when hurricane katrina hit his house was gone i feel like in my heart i would know if something was wrong with him , ms wyrick said but she started to cry again it s just not knowing that hurts so bad scores of people here have a relative or friend whose fate is unknown while internet message boards have linked many on the outside seeking news , those on the coast have no access to any form of communication more reliable than a message in a bottle people have lost not only their telephone service , but also their addresses as rescue workers struggled to inspect hardtoreach areas , anxiety was mounting only half of bay st louis and waveland , two of the most damaged areas , had been canvassed , said joe spraggins , the harrison county director of emergency management , at a morning briefing fortyfive percent of biloxi had been searched so little of diamondhead and pearl river had been accessible that the federal emergency management agency rated them as zero percent searched , mr spraggins said there were 105 confirmed deaths in harrison , jackson , pearl river and hancock counties so desperate are people to communicate that when a tmobile office in gulfport put out a sign that said free calls , 1 , 500 people lined up over two days , the managers said there was tearful call after tearful call , with one relieved mother even insisting that her daughter pass the phone to a tmobile employee so she could thank him but by friday , the office had run out of fuel for the generator that powered its signal tower one woman , an evacuee from new orleans , said she was trying to reach her family so they could come get her another man was trying to tell his mother , a stroke victim , that he had made it through the storm thousands of calls have poured in to a tollfree number set up by the sun herald , a local newspaper , which has published items like mary hudson , looking for half brother , fire chief tommy stone , or sylvia hickey , mobile , alabama , is fine but that avenue is inaccessible to many , because the power is out and telephone and cellphone service come only in blips luanne thompson , 38 , said she had no idea where her infant son might be he had been in a new orleans hospital after surgery all i know is what i'm hearing on the radio , and i'm hearing they 're evacuating everyone , she said over there they gave me an 800 number for the red cross , but other than that i do n't know who to call a spokeswoman for the american red cross said the tollfree phone line was not yet staffed but , she said , there was a place on the organization s web site for families to reconnect calls by a reporter to more than 20 hospitals across the south located ms thompson s baby , sonny ray thompson , at our lady of the lake regional medical center in baton rouge we did n't know how we were going to find his mother , said his nurse , adrienne arnold ms wyrick lost her house to the hurricane and only narrowly rescued her other three children , 2 , 3 and 5 , in a boat her search for her youngest son began with a trip to gulf port estates in ocean springs , where danny s father had lived but deputies stopped her , telling her the area had been demolished she was not satisfied i tried to find a way around them , i ca n't lie , she said i kept telling my fatherinlaw , 'just drop me off , let me go , i 'll walk ' she checked shelters along the coast and visited the police every hour on friday , someone directed her to a family assistance center run by the disaster mortuary operational response team , a division of fema after filling out an eightpage form that asked for information about dental records and identifying marks , ms wyrick learned that the information would go only to the county coroner , not to shelters and other places where missing people might have gone cotton howell , the regional commander of the mortuary team , said that the specialists who run the centers had not arrived and that communications systems were not in place to share information with other relief agencies there was also the problem of locating families who made reports to tell them if a body had been found they were asked to provide their current location , possible future contact information and the name of a relative outside the disaster area people who come in for missings do n't have a fixed address , so we have to ask much deeper questions , mr howell said some of those searching were themselves missing my boss had accounted for everyone but me , said marla hemphill , an administrator at northrop grumman , who had come in to report that she suspected her sister , who lived in biloxi and refused to evacuate and leave her pets , might be dead like so many others , she had gone to inspect the damage herself the roof of her sister s house had collapsed , ms hemphill said , and the house had a terrible odor the front porch was still there with a table with a coffee cup on it , ms hemphill said but the whole house slid backwards some people outside the disaster area have been so worried they have simply gotten in their cars and made the trip charles d widgeon , 48 , and his brother charles w , 38 , saw their brother on television after the storm and came from columbus , ga , to find him we 've been to every shelter none of them have a checkin list , the elder mr widgeon said at the hospital , they do n't even know who all they got in there for two days , they drove around , he said thursday night , finding only their brother s car by then , they themselves needed to be rescued we 're out of gas and out of money , mr widgeon said they had spent the night in a shelter and were waiting for their mother , driving from columbus , to come pick them up some people coped with the uncertainty by throwing themselves into the recovery effort my brother stayed on the beach , said john boudreaux , who was helping run a shelter at orange grove elementary in gulfport , with a shrug that suggested he knew that many others shared his predicament i do n't know if he s dead or alive
washington it was in early 2004 , the beginning of president bush s reelection campaign , that lawrence b wilkerson first printed out a letter saying he wanted to quit as chief of staff for secretary of state colin l powell in essence it said , 'dear mr president , i find myself at variance with a majority of your foreign policies and even your domestic policies and therefore i respectfully submit my resignation , ' mr wilkerson recalled recently but the letter remained in a desk drawer for the rest of mr bush s first term nearly two years later , mr wilkerson , a 60yearold retired united states army colonel , has finally completed his journey from insider to apostate alone among those who surrounded mr powell in the first term , he is speaking out critically , assailing the president as amateurish , especially compared to the first president bush , and describing the administration as secretive , inept and courting disaster at home and abroad nor has he spared his former boss , whom he says was overly preoccupied with damage control for policies set by others what i saw was a cabal between the vice president of the united states , richard cheney , and the secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld , on critical issues that made decisions that the bureaucracy did not know were being made , mr wilkerson said in a wellpublicized speech at the new america foundation in october and you 've got a president who is not versed in international relations and not too much interested in them either , he added in the speech mr wilkerson has also attacked the bush administration for allegedly condoning torture and setting lax policies on treatment of detainees that led , he charges , to the abuses at abu ghraib prison in iraq and the black eye they gave to the united states army since starting to speak out a few months ago , mr wilkerson has become something of a washington celebrity he has given interviews and speeches , appeared on television , written oped articles and taken telephone calls from journalists and senators he has juggled book offers but says he has no plans to write anything that would seem to exploit his newfound fame soon he will begin teaching jobs at george washington university and the college of william and mary , where he may write a book on presidential decisionmaking since world war ii though mr powell has kept his silence about his former aide , he has let it be known through friends that he objects to the charges , especially the suggestion that he was overly loyal to president bush it s very painful for me , mr wilkerson says i 've lost a friend of 16 years i wo n't say i 've lost him , but the estrangement is palpable one email message he says he got from mr powell complained tersely , do n't characterize my loyalty on the other hand , mr wilkerson says that mr powell won crucial policy battles in making sure that the issue of iraq was taken to the united nations and in battling mr rumsfeld and mr cheney for the cause of improving relations with europe , encouraging negotiations with north korea and iraq , and avoiding confrontations with russia and china he says his decision to speak in the open about the policy wars of the first bush term was slow in coming , but a major factor was the revelations about abu ghraib , which he said he realized , after studying the matter , had resulted from decisions on prisoner treatment and intelligence set shortly after sept 11 , 2001 army discipline is something mr wilkerson says he has understood since vietnam , where he flew helicopters starting in 1969 i 've been there , he said i 've stood on the hot parade ground as a pilot i 've cursed generals he added , i understood the bestiality that comes over men when they 're asked to use force for the state he recalled that a battalion commander once declared an area a freefire zone , which means that anything that moves , you shoot it one of his gunners killed a 13yearold girl , mr wilkerson says , adding , i will always live with that for the rest of my life after the wilkerson attacks , administration spokesmen avoided any official response but many administration officials have acknowledged their displeasure a halfdozen former colleagues of mr wilkerson s at the state department , none of whom wanted to be quoted by name out of deference to mr powell s silence , said they were not especially surprised that he had begun to speak out , but that they found his criticisms unseemly a former colleague said it seemed mr wilkerson was motivated by his concern about what had happened to the army as a result of allegations of prisoner mistreatment and poor decisions on the iraq war larry loves the army , and he loves the people in the army , said a former state department official as somebody who thinks of himself as a leader of people , my sense is that he could n't be silent anymore born in south carolina , the son of a bombardier in the army air corps in world war ii , mr wilkerson bounced around the country growing up while his father worked after the war as an insurance executive months before he was to graduate from bucknell in 1966 , he decided to enlist but without a college degree , he found that only the army would let him fly after vietnam , mr wilkerson received advanced degrees in international relations and national security , and served on the faculty of the united states naval war college at newport , ri , and as director of the marine corps war college in quantico , va in 1989 he was hired as a speechwriter and top aide by mr powell , who had left the post of national security adviser under president reagan and later became chairman of the joint chiefs of staff larry has two qualities that powell appreciated , recalls another top aide to the former secretary first , he could always find the big picture in whatever was going on second , he always tore things apart he never takes things at face value , and what he s doing now is a kind of exaggeration of what he used to do internally mr powell turned to mr wilkerson to go with him to the cia to sort through the mounds of material prepared to buttress the case against saddam hussein on the eve of the iraq war , for the lengthy presentation the secretary gave on feb 5 , 2003 , at the united nations security council he found that the draft did n't have the sourcing and backing that we wanted and he tore the whole thing apart and put it back together , the former state department official recalled he was powell s internal iconoclast mr wilkerson recalls the preparation of the feb 5 presentation , which mr powell has acknowledged will be remembered as a blot on his career because of its mistakes on intelligence , as an exercise in frustration it was an embittering experience for everyone at the state department , mr wilkerson says , to be saddled with presenting what turned out to be false information at the united nations ,

several recent novels in the united states have addressed the events of sept 11 , 2001 , but none have yet dared to use an iconic image of that day a burning tower or ordinary objects blanketed with ash on their covers now , one such book is on the way in late january , alfred a knopf will publish the good life , jay mcinerney s first novel in more than six years its cover , designed by chip kidd , shows a photograph by quyen tran of dishes covered with concrete dust subtly peeking through the lettering of the title and the author s name is a faint image of one of the world trade center towers on fire on the spine is an ashcoated drinking glass , half full , or half empty and on the back cover , a platoon of shirts , neatly arranged on hangers in a store , draped in the soot that enveloped lower manhattan when the twin towers collapsed mr kidd , who has designed book jackets for knopf and other publishers for 20 years , said he immediately thought of such an image when he first heard about the subject of mr mcinerney s book set in the immediate aftermath of 9 11 , the good life traces the story of luke , who is late for a breakfast meeting at the world trade center that tuesday morning , as well as those of several characters first seen in mr mcinerney s 1992 novel , brightness falls i originally thought of that shot of the tea set covered in the ash from 9 11 , mr kidd said , referring to a photograph by edward keating published in the new york times on sept 20 , 2001 the photograph , taken inside a cedar street apartment that faced the world trade center , was part of a package of photographs that won a pulitzer prize for breaking news photography for the times in 2002 mr kidd asked researchers at knopf to accumulate images from ground zero for consideration , and they found quyen tran s photograph and the others in the collection here is new york a democracy of photographs the collection , published by scalo publishers , was culled from a storefront photo gallery that sprouted on spring street in soho soon after 9 11 while some hints had previously emerged that mr mcinerney s next novel would be set in new york city after 9 11 , it was not clear until knopf released its spring 2006 catalog this month that the novel in fact centered on the events of sept 11 and the wreckage they left behind mr kidd , who will have a collection of his book covers , chip kidd , book one work 19962006 , published by rizzoli in november , said he had no second thoughts about using the image but he expects that people will not immediately recognize it for what it is my hope is that when people first see the cover , they wo n't understand what they are seeing , mr kidd said then , only as they read the book or the flap copy will that image change from dishes with dust on them to something else one of the few recent novels that made an explicit visual reference to 9 11 was jonathan safran foer s extremely loud and incredibly close , published earlier this year by houghton mifflin included in the book is a sequence of photographs of a body falling from one of the trade center s towers the photographs are printed in reverse order , however , so when the pictures are flipped through , they create an effect , as imagined by the child narrator , of the body moving upward , away from death one other book that came close to using a recognizable 9 11 image on the cover was the writing on the wall , by lynne sharon schwartz , published in may by counterpoint press when early copies of the novel were distributed to reviewers , the cover included a photograph of bouquets of flowers stuck in a chainlink fence , evoking the impromptu memorials that sprang up after 9 11 david steinberger , the chief executive of the perseus book group , which owns counterpoint , said that the cover provoked intense discussions among the company s marketing and sales staff there was a concern that this was an image that was recognizable to new yorkers but not necessarily around the country , he said , plus a fear that the audience that would be interested in this book would not respond to such a harsh image and the memories it might dredge up so before the book was sent to stores , a new cover was designed , with a more subtle image a hazy , ghostlike photograph of the lower manhattan skyline , taken from the staten island ferry shortly after 9 11
they do n't always pop up where and when you expect them , the dishes that delight you , the bites that transport you in a city as blessed as this one , your next great entree or dessert can happen on a nowhere street or emerge from a seemingly cursed kitchen they can even happen at compass , whose name had come to seem like a cruel joke or poignant attempt at irony , given how swiftly and repeatedly this restaurant changed directions , given how lost it appeared to be compass opened in april 2002 and soon thereafter its chefs began tumbling like so many dominoes compass went through four of them in three years in april it welcomed its fifth , john fraser , who had been working at snack taverna , a greek restaurant , and was not yet 30 none of this history or detail left me with high expectations i dropped by compass on a recent night not because i was so curious or hopeful , but because it was in my path , it was sure to have empty tables \( it s an almost oppressively big place \) , and i happened to have the time the next thing i knew , i was raptly working my way through food that was every bit as pleasurable and interesting as the fare at many less stormtossed , more celebrated places a friend and i ordered a rather ambiguously described appetizer of lamb , and what arrived were indulgently fatty , luscious rectangles of braised lamb belly , arrayed around a circle of bibb lettuce , radicchio and sunflower seeds a main course of halibut presented a peerlessly succulent treatment of the fish , poached in olive oil at a very low temperature , crowned with a picholine tapenade and placed beside a shallow pool of basil sabayon , which was like a velvety pesto and one of our desserts utterly elated us it was a parfait of pur ed avocados , whipped cream , sugar and vanilla , which had been molded into a rectangle atop a peanutbutter crust and then bedecked with tiny wild strawberries its flavors and effects unfurled in overlapping chapters first the strawberries , so precise and pointed then the avocado , so much more diffuse and then the peanut butter , like an even more expansive , more emphatic iteration of the avocado s unctuousness we were utterly transfixed , and we were quickly out of parfait we did n't sample a broad crosssection of compass s dinner menu , which puts the halibut and the restaurant s other more elaborately plated entrees under the rubric compositions and groups less fanciful main courses of yellowfin tuna , filet mignon , veal chop and the like under simply roasted \( side dishes like steamed asparagus and parsley sp tzle appear beneath to complete \) some of what we had was unimpressive or offkey an appetizer of grilled sea scallops with a dill cr me fra che had an oddly chemical , almost detergentlike taste and as that compositions tag suggests , there s a tendency toward preciousness at compass , where even my favorite dishes crept up to the precipice of being overworked but a kitchen that might well have become optimism s tomb is alive and cooking , thanks to the clear engagement and equally obvious talents of mr fraser and the pastry chef , vera tong mr fraser is the kind of idealist who will dutifully do seared duck breast , but only if he can find a signature embellishment in this case , a pastilla of braised duck leg in a pastry shell to the side good for him better yet for compass compass , 208 west 70th street , manhattan \( 212 \) 8758600 appetizers , 9 to 20 entrees , 19 to 38
new orleans , sept 9 the first organized effort to scour the city for its dead has turned up far fewer bodies than expected , officials said friday that raised hopes that the death toll from hurricane katrina might be much lower than the 10 , 000 that the mayor and others had predicted as the floodwater continued to recede , police officers , national guard members and members of the 82nd airborne division of the army began to canvass street to street and house to house in the first phase of a hunt to find , remove and identify the dead there s some encouragement in what we found in the initial sweeps , col terry j ebbert , the city s director of homeland security , said the numbers so far are relatively minor as compared with the dire predictions of 10 , 000 the specter of a fivefigure toll was raised this week , and the federal emergency management agency ordered 25 , 000 body bags flown to a temporary morgue in st gabriel the official state death count stood at 118 mississippi reported 211 colonel ebbert , who would not provide figures for new orleans , said it would take two weeks before the search for the dead here could yield a reliable assessment as they looked for bodies , the officers and troops began to retrace steps that they had walked last week and this week as they searched primarily for the living , to try to persuade them to leave the city colonel ebbert said the holdouts now numbered fewer than 5 , 000 about 484 , 000 people lived in the city before the hurricane struck on friday , city officials continued to hold off on their threat to use force to remove people who refused to leave , calling it a last resort we 're trying our best to persuasively negotiate , and we are not using force at this time , city attorney sherry landry said in houston , thousands of displaced new orleans residents lined up as fema officials began to hand out the 2 , 000 debit cards that they had promised to help evacuees with immediate expenses it was tiresome , but it was worth it , said dwayne holmes , 20 , who said he waited about two and a half hours outside the shelter complex where he and his family have been living since they fled the superdome in new orleans each household that registered with the agency was allowed one card , which can be used at atm s officials of fema estimated that 5 , 000 cards were handed out in houston , and said the distribution would continue on saturday the agency s liaison for the houston area , tom costello , said distribution also began on friday at shelters in austin , dallas and other cities in texas despite the long lines that snaked inside and outside the astrodome , people chatted amiably , and food was provided there was none of the chaos and confusion that arose on thursday , when premature news reports of the distribution prompted thousands of evacuees to converge on the complex , only to be locked out by officials for nearly an hour mayor c ray nagin of new orleans went to dallas , touring shelters and visiting family members who had evacuated there he joined dallas leaders in announcing a citywide relief fund and denouncing the federal emergency agency for what they called its continuing slow response to the crisis it s a doggone shame that these survivors had to wait in the hot sun for fema yesterday , and fema did n't arrive , mr nagin said perhaps the most promising development to emerge was the first detailed timetable for draining new orleans the army corps of engineers said a new computer model showed that all areas of the city would be pumped dry by oct 18 , about 40 days from the estimate the corps had previously said only that the work would take 24 to 80 days and for the first time since the hurricane slammed into the gulf coast , government and utility officials offered a time frame for restoring electricity to the new orleans downtown business district they said they hoped to have power turned on and much of the debris cleaned up by the end of next week about 350 , 000 to 400 , 000 homes remained without power in new orleans and the surrounding area , compared with one million just after the hurricane , according to estimates by jimmy field , a member of the state s public service commission , and daniel packer , president of entergy new orleans , the major electricity provider in the city in adjacent st bernard parish , which was particularly hard hit , 99 percent of homes and businesses remained without power , mr field said in orleans parish , that figure was 89 percent , and in jefferson parish , just over 50 percent as floodwaters recede north toward lake pontchartrain , water levels across the city have fallen as much as four feet since monday parts of interstate 10 that had been flooded are passable , and the city s downtown core is mostly dry on canal street , a major commercial artery where many news organizations are working out of recreational vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel fuel , some hotels prepared to reopen businesses , including some clothing stores , sent employees to inspect their properties yet elsewhere , the city was emptier than it was earlier in the week , with fewer people sitting on porches or drinking outside bars even some residents who had promised to resist the evacuation orders said they would relent their change of heart was understandable in the areas where water remained , its stench has increasingly grown unbearable as corpses rot and human and animal waste builds up abandoned and unfed dogs roam , sometimes in packs , along lifeless streets even in dry zones , residents have no electricity or drinkable water , and they face an endless procession of police officers and soldiers telling them that the city is unlivable and encouraging them to leave , sometimes politely and sometimes sternly colonel ebbert said that in their first sweep of the city , the police and national guard had persuaded 3 , 854 residents to leave their homes since sunday , including many who had spurned previous evacuation orders he said that the new sweep would focus on the dead and that for dignity s sake the news media would not be allowed to watch officers who locate bodies will notify mortuary teams under the supervision of fema , he added those teams will seek to identify the bodies , notify relatives and feed the information to state health officials , who have started to compile death statistics while ms landry , the city attorney , continued to assert the legal right to force evacuations and arrest people who refused , she appealed to residents to leave for their safety and to refrain from trying to return if you come into the city now , the likelihood of you sustaining multiple flat tires is very high , she said , noting that checkpoints had been set up at all entrances to the city we want to send a message to our citizens who are concerned about the safeguarding of their property the city is now fully secured yet holdouts remained in the picturesque garden district , dean eftekhar , 42 , a waiter , said he was prepared to leave after soldiers visited him on wednesday and urged him to evacuate later that day , mr eftekhar said , he watched as contractors scooped tree limbs and trash into plastic bags he went downtown to the harrah s casino , now a disaster command center , and applied for work helping with the cleanup thursday was his first day on the job , and he said he was told that he would be paid once a week , at a rate of 125 a day , in cash now , he said , i have a legitimate excuse to stay in town
the last time al leiter pitched for the yankees at yankee stadium , he faced a reigning american league cy young award winner for the minnesota twins sixteen years ago , it was frank viola last night , it was johan santana on april 14 , 1989 , leiter beat viola on a blustery night last night , leiter lost to johan santana , 73 , on a steamy night he threw 162 pitches in the start against viola he only seemed to throw that many last night i was on pace , leiter said i 'd have stayed in if he 'd let me you 're at the stage of your career where you 're not a 23yearold pitcher with your future all ahead of you i do n't know about 162 , though it took 115 pitches for leiter to muddle through five innings , but he allowed just one run in spite of it he kept the game close , but the twins erupted off the yankees' bullpen , taking a sixrun lead in the eighth inning and holding on for the victory santana left after seven shutout innings , helped by center fielder torii hunter , who threw out derek jeter at the plate in the third inning the yankees scored three runs in the eighth off juan rincon , the final two coming on a throwing error by second baseman bret boone it was 63 when closer joe nathan replaced rincon with two on and two out , bernie williams lofted an 01 pitch high down the rightfield line the remaining fans from the crowd of 50 , 334 made the park shake , but the ball landed foul by a few feet he had one thing in mind , to try and pull it down the line , manager joe torre said it sort of ran out of steam when it got near the foul pole but it got everybody out of their seat , i know that we jumped up on the step their hopes raised and dashed , the fans and the yankees' players watched nathan stifle the rally by fanning williams on the next pitch nathan finished off the yankees in the ninth , striking out alex rodriguez looking to end the game it was rodriguez s 30th birthday yesterday , making him nearly 10 years younger than the 39yearold leiter the yankees brought him back in a cash trade with the florida marlins on july 16 , and after two road starts , leiter was back in the bronx he said he had some nerves i generally have good nervous energy , leiter said the basis for every start is the first couple of innings generally , for me , if you do n't get me in the first couple of innings , there s a settling in i did n't do any of that leiter s outing was truly remarkable he put at least two base runners on in every inning 13 runners in all , with seven reaching on hits , five on walks and one hit batsman but only one run scored the air was thick , and leiter seemed to wade through it he ran deep count after deep count , and when he tried to put away a hitter , foul balls seemed to follow in rapid fire leiter s pitch count hit 100 after his last delivery in the fourth , and by the end of the fifth he had thrown 115 only four were swinging strikes but the twins' lineup has been flagging , and for everything leiter may lack in stuff anymore , he still has guile he needed every bit of it last night the twins left the bases loaded in the first two innings leiter gave up a leadoff single in the third to joe mauer , who stole second , a nifty trick for a cleanuphitting catcher with two outs , leiter walked boone and got ahead of justin morneau , 02 but morneau drove a double to the wall in leftcenter field , scoring mauer and bringing boone around third the relay from hideki matsui to jeter to jorge posada caught boone easily when the first two hitters of the fourth inning reached on a single and a walk , leiter had allowed four runners to reach base consecutively , with none of them scoring he escaped that jam , and finished off the fifth with a double play started by second baseman robinson cano asked how he managed to give up only one run , leiter was speechless for a moment magic , mirrors , he said when the moment came when i really needed to make a pitch , i was able to get it and it s not that i'm lackadaisical leading up to the 'macgyver' moment when i 've got to get out of the mess , but i'm kind of relentless in the fact that i refuse to give in to the hitter or the umpire it sometimes hurts me somehow , leiter gave the yankees what they wanted when they traded for him he did not have to dominate he only had to battle into the middle innings and give the yankees a chance to win but after felix rodriguez pitched scoreless sixth , the twins got to tanyon sturtze for three runs on three hits in the seventh scott proctor allowed a tworun homer to jacque jones in the eighth , and morneau led off the ninth with a homer off alex graman
the chief of the new york city fire department directly criticized the bloomberg administration s decision to give the police initial control at hazardous materials emergencies , telling a packed city council chamber yesterday that it makes no sense and risks endangering firefighters and the public in startlingly frank language , chief peter e hayden , the city s highest ranking fire officer , said he believed mayor michael r bloomberg had signed off on a deeply flawed emergency response protocol based on bad advice from subordinates he strongly suggested that the protocol represented a power grab by the police department and in testimony that seemed likely to rub old wounds raw , he revisited the morning of sept 11 , saying that practices by both the police and fire departments had put lives at risk that day , he said , police helicopters observed that one of the trade center towers was near collapse , but police commanders became so focused on their own tasks that they neglected to perform the critical task of information sharing chief hayden said the city had not learned enough from its mistakes instead of seeking to control each other , agencies having major roles at terrorist events must learn how to work together to command these incidents , he said there is a human behavior element here , where people do n't want to share information because information is viewed as power , he said we see it in every level of government the cia does not tell the fbi the fbi does not tell the nypd the nypd does not tell the fdny this is human behavior the chief delivered his assessment from the same witness table where , moments earlier , the police , fire and emergency management commissioners struggled to give a unified defense of the new protocol , which dictates that immediate police oversight of suspected terrorist events is the best way to protect lives chief hayden attacked that argument , saying the fire department was better equipped to deal with lifethreatening situations the agency that is responsible for saving lives at a terrorist incident and for the rest of the city is not equally responsible for command , he said this does not make sense the mayor approved the new protocol last month , and the city council cannot alter it but the hearing provided the first public airing of the raging dispute over the new guidelines and raised anew questions of whether the city was adequately prepared to handle future terrorist attacks it also laid bare the frustrations and rivalries that continue to bedevil relations between the police and fire departments firefighters filling the gallery broke into applause when chief hayden finished testifying , while the police officers present looked on quietly the spectacle of the fire chief sitting alone , pointedly disagreeing with the mayor , was not lost on the politicians present council speaker gifford miller , a democratic candidate for mayor , engaged in a long and ultimately inconclusive debate with the commissioners about the wisdom of their protocol mr miller focused on the most disputed element of the protocol , a guideline that puts the police in charge at hazardous materials scenes until criminal or terrorist involvement can be ruled out the police commissioner , raymond w kelly , said the provision was necessary because of the seriousness of the incidents it addressed we know that al qaeda wants to come here this is the one place they want to come to again , new york , he said they 've attacked here twice , and if they 're able to do it a third time , it s a major , major victory for them they 're looking to do it in a spectacular way we have to be on our guard this is , i believe , a lesson from 9 11 , and that s why the mayor decided to go forward with it even with the police firmly in command , firefighters would still make all lifesafety decisions affecting rescue operations , said mr kelly and joseph bruno , the emergency management commissioner , although the wording of the protocol appears to say that fire officials would answer to police commanders in such situations why did the protocol place the police in command of those situations , mr miller asked , if the fire department would not be answerable to them on matters of lifesafety \? in a testy exchange , the council speaker suggested that mr kelly s explanation was absurd , since in effect it endorsed putting the police in charge because doing so made the least sense now come on , i did n't say that , mr kelly protested , i did n't say that speaking to reporters afterward , mr kelly , obviously annoyed , said council members might have resisted accepting what he had to say because it s fun to ask these questions on television give everybody face time nicholas scoppetta , the fire commissioner , who was mostly silent while much of the questioning focused on mr kelly and mr bruno , made it clear that his department had lost a behindthescenes dispute i 've been told publicly and privately that this is the final document and we 're going to go forward with it , he said the only responsible thing now for the fire department to do is to do everything in its power to make sure that it works and works well , because the stakes are very , very high none of the three commissioners stayed to hear chief hayden , who quickly dissected what he said were flaws in the protocol he said he agreed with council members who suggested that the protocol would theoretically place a lowlevel patrol officer in charge of senior fire officials at an emergency scene , and he said the protocol was so poorly conceived that the commissioners could n't even answer the questions straight when asked about it you heard testimony this morning from the commissioners here , and it s very clear to me and i think to many people in this audience , they are very confused , he said and if they 're confused , then i'm confused , and my firefighters are confused , and the police officers in the street are going to be confused and there will be a compromise of safety after the hearing , chief hayden told reporters that he hoped his decision to disagree publicly with the administration would not damage his relationship with the mayor , and that he felt mr bloomberg had been ill advised when he approved the plan asked about the fire chief s remarks , the mayor s office issued a brief statement defending the protocol giving the police department the ability to investigate a situation to determine whether it is an act of terrorism is the responsible thing to do in the post9 11 world the mayor is confident that regardless of who is in charge of a given incident , every city agency will work together to provide the highest possible protection to the people of new york
for two decades , kermit washington wrote every nba team and sent more than 700 r sum s looking for a steady coaching job at any level he had been an assistant coach in china s professional league and had worked the pete newell big man s camp he was a strength and conditioning coach and ran a predraft camp in washington but until last week , when nba commissioner david stern helped make an assistant s job happen with the asheville altitude of the national basketball developmental league , washington had been blacklisted because of one violent night i know the reason i have n't been in the league , and i understand that i understand the perception of kermit washington , washington said by phone friday on dec 9 , 1977 , washington , then with the los angeles lakers , threw a punch after he spotted someone , out of the corner of his eye , rushing toward him it was houston rockets forward rudy tomjanovich , coming to restrain him washington s punch fractured tomjanovich s skull , jaw and other facial bones , putting him in the hospital for 15 days doctors said the injuries were life threatening washington was fined 10 , 000 and suspended for 60 days the lakers traded him to the boston celtics tomjanovich missed the rest of the season he won a 32 million lawsuit from the lakers , went on to coach two championship teams in houston , left the rockets to win a battle with bladder cancer , then returned to coach the lakers this season washington , now 53 and 27 years removed from the defining incident of his life , finally received another nba chance i'm not doing it for the change of perception , washington said i love working with players more than anything else , i enjoy working with athletes who want to get better i'm certainly not doing it for the money i could make more cleaning streets , he added with a laugh , estimating his gross pay for the remaining two months of the season to be about 12 , 000 but i really appreciate what david stern did for me stu jackson , the nba s senior vice president for basketball operations and a friend of washington s , said the league was pleased to help kermit and i have been having some conversations over the past year about potential opportunities , and this one came open , he said the commissioner called me and i said , 'look , i think it s great it s perfect timing' i do know kermit has had a desire to get into the nba this is a very good way to join our family i 've watched kermit from afar when he worked pete newell s camp there s no one who can deny he s good at what he does washington is cautious about not making this opportunity sound bigger than it is but could it turn into something more , perhaps an opportunity in the nba \? it depends on how good a job i do , but i would n't be going to ashland without that hope , washington said , meaning asheville , nc , a place he confessed he had never heard of until this past week washington will not arrive in asheville until the middle of this week because he has meetings to attend in california for project contact , an international relief program for east africa that he founded in 1995 in 1994 , when he was the host of a radio show in portland , ore , and running a restaurant , he gave money to relief efforts in rwanda then he contacted his alma mater , american university , which has helped coordinate his program he has made more than 25 trips to africa , working with doctors and nurses to establish medical clinics and orphanages washington said the nba had been generous in financing the delivery of medical supplies i have never changed , washington said people do n't know who i am i have good in me and bad in me they see kermit washington i see in africa , those people do n't have any chance i am lucky he did not always feel that way washington s life view was skewed by the aftermath of the fight he played five more seasons for a total of 507 games , but never felt accepted again after the incident , i started viewing the world a little differently , washington said i thought if i did the right thing , i could get where i wanted to go in college , high school and pro i never got a technical foul , was never late for practice , never gave a coach any problems but i could n't keep playing the game anymore , i had no chance of winning anymore , and i figured , do n't break your neck trying i just went on with life knowing i had more limitations and less opportunities the punch continued to resonate after the pistonspacers brawl in auburn hills , mich , the league s most violent display of player behavior since the night at the los angeles forum in 1977 washington watched the replays and heard his name mentioned in reference to the level of violence it s just like the fights in baseball , in hockey , those are going to happen that s the competitiveness the athletes have , he said he understood why stern suspended ron artest for the rest of the season he said it was similar to his situation i had to be made an example of , regardless of what happened or who it was , washington said david stern is concerned about the nba because it s a business players , they have to understand they hurt the image of the league i think ron artest just does n't understand that a game in life is always being played but he does n't even know the rules of the game they do n't care if he was right or wrong the image of the nba is the most important thing and they will sacrifice you for it life humbles you washington knows that wherever he goes in the united states people know him for one thing it s 20some years , and every day people recognize me , he said they see me as a mean , nasty person can you overcome that \? i do n't know washington and tomjanovich have overcome it we 're friends now , washington said the thing with rudy , i told him , 'i'm sorry , but in that position , regardless of who started it , i did n't know your intentions' nowadays , there are videotapes at all angles to see what happens forgetting the olympic fiasco there was nowhere to go but up for the united states olympic basketball players after their bronzemedal embarrassment and worldwide ridicule at the athens games none of the players liked it , coach larry brown is still tortured by it , and david stern is furious enough about it to declare it will not happen again we will win the gold in beijing , stern said recently during an interview asked if that was a guarantee , stern smiled and said it was the plans , stern said , are not yet set on how the selecting , the coaching and the training will change , but stern insists that nba players on the 2008 olympic team will reestablish united states dominance over an evershrinking basketball world the nba s stu jackson said , i feel that we can field a team that s capable of winning a gold medal how it will happen is yet to be determined the explanations and excuses for defeat were myriad the growth of talent in the international game , the international game itself , use of zone defenses , not enough training , jackson said the current nba statistics suggest that the american players who were in greece have found their lost form at home allen iverson is the league s scoring leader lebron james and amare stoudemire , who were benchmates in greece , are most valuable player award contenders emeka okafor is a leading contender for rookie of the year and stephon marbury is the selfproclaimed best point guard in the league james and stoudemire averaged a combined 82 points in eight games in greece now they are averaging a combined 511 points we had 12 very good players on the team , jackson said not all can play an equal amount of minutes this team , as talented as it was , everybody still had to play a role brown , never inclined to play rookies , said he was not pleased with james s defense in the first meeting of james s cavaliers and brown s pistons , james scored 43 points it s also not a coincidence that he s playing better defense this year playing better on both sides , jackson said he is not alone dwyane wade shot just 382 percent at the olympics with shaquille o'neal setting him up , and with frustration from the summer perhaps motivating him early on , wade is shooting 487 percent for the heat every united states olympian other than the lakers' lamar odom and the suns' shawn marion leads his team in scoring \( marion is behind another olympian , stoudemire , and odom is behind kobe bryant \) perhaps the players learned perhaps they just put it behind them that was so long ago , stoudemire said i'm not even thinking of the olympics now from tv to sideline george karl became the second firedcoachturnedtvanalyst to return to the sideline when he became the denver nuggets' third coach of the season thursday karl joined mike fratello of memphis in making the leap to the court from the booth through friday , the grizzlies have gone 199 since fratello took over dec 2 karl will be charged with turning around an underachieving team although karl s abrasiveness wore on players when he coached the united states to a sixthplace finish at the 2002 world championships , carmelo anthony told the news media thursday that a tough coach was probably what the nuggets needed in karl s debut friday , denver \( 1825 \) won , 106100 , in milwaukee , where karl coached from 1998 to 2003 , and where he also wore out his welcome inside the nba correction february 1 , 2005 , tuesday the inside the nba column on sunday , about the effects of the united states' thirdplace showing in men s basketball at the 2004 olympic games in athens , referred incorrectly in some copies to the number of those olympians who are not leading their national basketball association team in scoring it is two , including shawn marion of the phoenix suns , not just lamar odom of the los angeles lakers
homestead , fla , nov 21 while tony stewart was raising the no 20 chevrolet banner to the top of the champion s flagpole at homesteadmiami speedway on sunday night , jack roush was already raising expectations for the deepest race team in nascar we 've got a lot of time for a lot of championships , and these guys are going to go get them as long as i can keep them in good cars , roush said after his drivers finished second , third and fourth in the final standings behind stewart , who drives for joe gibbs racing stewart clinched the 2005 nextel cup title by placing 15th in the seasonending ford 400 and it is just three months until the 2006 season begins stewart s title will be his to lose beginning feb 19 , when next season kicks off with the daytona 500 but there is little doubt that the roush contingent of greg biffle , carl edwards , mark martin , matt kenseth and the newcomer jamie mcmurray will be chasing him from the start just as roush drivers did this season biffle finished second to stewart in the final standings , 35 points behind edwards was also 35 points back but placed third because he had fewer victories than biffle martin was fourth kenseth was seventh and the departing roush driver kurt busch was 10th roush had half the field in the chase for the nextel cup jeff gordon may also be pulling back into contention for the title next year a fourtime cup champion , gordon finished 11th this year , but he has promised the team owner rick hendrick that his no 24 will be back in the hunt in 2006 after switching crew chiefs late in the season , gordon surged to one victory and four top10 finishes in the final five races this season i was just really thrilled the way we ended the season , gordon said sunday night we just tried to get some momentum , and i feel like we have recently gordon is also the defending champion of the daytona 500 the future is less predictable for the other icon of nascar , dale earnhardt jr he changed crew chiefs after failing to make the field for the chase , rejoining his cousin tony eury jr for the final 10 races but he had just three top10 finishes in those races the highlight was a fourthplace showing oct 30 at atlanta motor speedway earnhardt led 142 of the 325 laps there , which was more than he had led all season combined still , earnhardt finished 19th in the standings , his worst showing in cup competition , which he joined in 2000 when stewart , gordon and earnhardt return next season , they will find a changed nextel cup garage the veterans rusty wallace and ricky rudd retired after sunday s race with 78 victories between them busch , the 2004 cup champion with roush , replaces wallace in the no 2 racecar next year , with much to prove in 2006 he was suspended for the final two races of the season by roush after a confrontation with the police nov 11 near phoenix international raceway busch was not in homestead on sunday , when his no 97 champion s flag was replaced by stewart s no 20 faces change , but some story lines remain stewart , with his second titles in four years , has finished in the top 10 in each of his seven years in cup racing he is beginning to solidify his standing as the driver of the decade in nascar i do think when you win more than one , it puts you in an elite group and you 're going to be looked upon different , gordon said of stewart he s capable of winning more but so is roush s team he won titles in 2003 with kenseth and in 2004 with busch and the performances of biffle , edwards and martin this season give roush more potential contenders than any other team for 2006 biffle won six races this year , including the season finale sunday at homestead no driver was hotter than edwards at the finish he won two of the final four races , and he finished fourth and sixth in the other two he led a racehigh 94 laps sunday before finishing fourth behind his teammates biffle , martin and kenseth edwards had a slight chance to win the cup entering sunday he even closed the gap on stewart to 12 points during the race , but in the end , he and biffle fell short none of that was expected of edwards , who was in his first full season in nextel cup and had four victories that led roush to predict that edwards would be the driver of the decade not only for roush racing but for all of nextel cup racing
washington , june 21 the federal government s efforts to prevent terrorists from smuggling a nuclear weapon into the united states are so poorly managed and reliant on ineffective equipment that the nation remains extremely vulnerable to a catastrophic attack , scientists and a government auditor warned a house committee on tuesday the assessment , coming nearly four years after the september 2001 attacks and after the investment of about 800 million by the united states government , prompted expressions of frustration and disappointment from lawmakers if we go ahead and spend the money and do n't succeed , i do n't understand that , said representative steve pearce , republican of new mexico four federal departments homeland security , defense , energy and state are involved in a global campaign to try to prevent the illicit acquisition , movement and use of radioactive materials , which includes efforts to prevent theft of nuclear materials from former soviet stockpiles and inspecting cargo containers on arrival from around the world dirty bombs , crude devices that widely spread low levels of radiation , are relatively easy to detect but highly enriched uranium , a crucial ingredient in a nuclear bomb , could easily be shielded with less than a quarterinch of lead , making it very likely to escape detection by passive radiation monitors now installed at ports and border stations , benn tannenbaum , a physicist and senior program associate at the american association for the advancement of science , testified at tuesday s hearing the monitors are unable to distinguish between naturally occurring radiation from everyday items like ceramic tile and dangerous material like enriched uranium it has been , let me say , a bad few years , dr tannenbaum said customs officials also at times allow trucks to pass through the monitors too quickly , said gene aloise , an official from the government accountability office and because the devices sound so many false alarms , mr aloise said , their sensitivity has been turned down , making them less effective still nationally , less than a quarter of the radiation detection devices needed to check all goods crossing the borders have been installed , federal officials said in new york , for example , none of the cargo that moves through the largest ship terminal or goods leaving the port by rail or barge are inspected for radiation , bethann rooney , manager of security for the port authority of new york and new jersey , testified the problems extend beyond the borders , witnesses said about half of the monitors given to one former soviet state were never installed or put into use a monitor that the state department gave to bulgaria was set up on an unused road and sea spray and winds at some ports overseas may have compromised the detection equipment , mr aloise said richard l wagner jr , a physicist at the los alamos national laboratory and chairman of the defense department task force on preventing a clandestine nuclear attack , agreed that the radiation detection systems installed across the united states were quite limited in their capabilities and , in general , are insufficient to the task but the situation , dr wagner said , is not surprising given the rapid start up of the effort there will be false starts and there will be money wasted , he said representative jim langevin , democrat of rhode island , asked how homeland security should apportion 125 million in the coming fiscal year between buying more of the same radiation monitor technology and supporting research into better technology two witnesses called for putting the detection equipment on ships , so threats could be identified before reaching the united states members of congress have also recently questioned a proposal by the bush administration to spend 227 million in the coming year to create a domestic nuclear detection office , skeptical that it will do more than add a new layer of bureaucracy i am not too hopeful about this situation , representative bill pascrell jr , democrat of new jersey , said correction june 24 , 2005 , friday an article on wednesday about a warning to congress that the nation s borders remain vulnerable to terrorist attacks referred incorrectly to the forum in which the issue was discussed it was a joint hearing of the house s subcommittee on prevention of nuclear and biological attack and the subcommittee on emergency preparedness , science and technology not the full parent committee , homeland security
at springfield boulevard and hempstead avenue in queens , there was little shock yesterday at the news that two officers had been shot that morning the lack of surprise had less to do with the suspect , kevin davy , 25 , than it did with persistent skepticism and mistrust of authority as a group of teenagers stood near the entrance to spring deli , they spoke with cavalier pride about the dangers of shadyville the nickname they have given their neighborhood , queens village even though there was no indication that the officers had done anything to provoke the attack , several young people expressed hostility and frustration toward the police the police harass everyone everywhere around here , said j johnson , an 18yearold cousin of kevin , who insisted that her first name not be used for fear of provoking her neighbors that s probably why he did it he 'd been harassed his whole life though many details about mr davy remained unclear yesterday , friends and family members described him as a serious young man who had a history of mental problems the police said he had a juvenile arrest record , and several children in the neighborhood said that mr davy , also known as gambit , often harassed them in the park across the street from ss joachim and anne catholic church on 105th avenue , where the police say he smashed a statue and shot at it yesterday but ms johnson , who said she spent hours discussing politics and the future with mr davy , said that he dreamed of changing the world ever since the attacks on sept 11 , 2001 , mr davy thought more about his own politics , she said he was against the war in iraq and was increasingly angry about president bush s policies and he also opposed allowing more immigrants into the united states , ms johnson said he wanted to stop all foreigners from coming here , she said , adding that mr davy became even more agitated after the bombings in london earlier this month it s wrong that they 're coming over here scaring everybody he did n't want to get dragged into the army mr davy s frustrations are clearly displayed on a homemade dvd that he produced with his younger brother , keith , earlier this year the hourlong film , the raw coke , features mostly clips of news conferences and television shows there are pictures from the war in iraq preceded with a message accusing the army of raping a female prisoner another scene opens with a message across the screen that reads black and beautiful , but told otherwise , and then focuses on the backsides of mannequins and pictures of full lips at one point another message reads you can get life for touching crack , and then you can get probation for touching a little boy keith davy , who goes by shorty evalast , is briefly featured rapping in front of several stores along springfield avenue after the two completed the dvd last month , kevin davy sold dozens of copies to several delis in the neighborhood for 4 each a clerk at spring deli said that all 10 copies there had sold in the last week many teenagers in the eastern queens neighborhood , which is near the nassau county border , said that mr davy s dvd had become popular among their friends for the stark message it presented none of them , however , could articulate just what that message was for the last year , mr davy had been studying video production at the art institute of new york city in soho , ms johnson said , adding that he made the dvd partly to help promote his brother s rap music ms johnson said that she last saw mr davy on friday afternoon on jamaica boulevard , while he was shopping for clothes he did not seem particularly upset , she said but , she added he had been getting more serious anger for us here , it comes and goes , comes and goes not much you can do correction july 23 , 2005 , saturday articles on monday about a shootout outside a church in queens in which two police officers and the man who fired on them were injured misstated the academic status of the suspect , kevin davy he is not a student at the art institute of new york city in soho , according to the school his relatives did not respond to attempts to find out which school , if any , he attends

though , at times , there is the rare towel whipping how does this red carpet thing work \? wondered a befuddled sports reporter recently at a benefit for the joe torre safe at home foundation we 're used to just walking up to them in the locker room and asking them questions not here , na ve grownup reporter the carpet may have all of the noise and chaos and sexual harassment of the locker room , but it has none of the candor \( speaking of candor , mutters a perceptive reader when you say 'recently , ' what do you mean , exactly \? because i heard about this event a week ago to which we say give us a break it s the day after thanksgiving ! think of it as a cold boldface sandwich \) where were we \? yes , there stood the confused sports reporters at the pierre hotel , shouting out questions at mr torre , who created the foundation to educate the public about domestic violence those who were not yankees michael bolton , darrell hammond , stanley tucci , chazz palminteri and ari fleischer were generally ignored but our correspondent was among the few who wanted the glitzy names , so there he was on the carpet , asking george f will his opinion of the steroid controversy it was once said of a maiden that she was saved from being ravished by a timely compliance , mr will began , and as he talked , discoursing upon the players' union and congress and whatever , probably weaving in references to keynes and hayek and the third earl of shaftesbury that went over our dull , us weeklylittered heads , we fell into a reverie over the carpet we flew , over the harbor and down the eastern seaboard to miami beach , to shaquille o'neal s house , for a night of moroccan heat , which was celebrating the start of the miami heat s season and raising money for the real model foundation and the miami heat family outreach charitable fund \( wait , the start of the season \? the perceptive and increasingly annoying reader asks uh , boldface tetrazzini \? \) yes , it was quite a reverie , as reveries go there were camels and mercedesbenzes and the occasional rolls parked outside mr o'neal s 20 , 000squarefoot home which he is selling because he wants something bigger milling around , amid the moroccan pavilions and belly dancers and fezwearing staff , we saw most of the heat players , as well as barry bonds , method man , trick daddy and a threefoottall bobblehead of mr o'neal , which stood in the middle of his dock finally , mr o'neal himself appeared in a gray threepiece suit he had been out of play with an ankle injury for a , uh , few days , so we asked what he was up to nothing , just rehab nothing \? reading any good books \? books \? no beat i want to get my doctorate your doctorate \? in what \? psychology , with an emphasis in criminology but it will take three years \( and probably reading a book or two , right ! ha , ha ! actually , we did not say that out loud because we are small , and mr o'neal could dribble us \) soon he was off and so were we , back up the coast , past the glittering eastern cities and back to the red carpet at the pierre because the crux of the indictment of libby , mr will was saying , was that he was the first official to disseminate this supposedly secret information he was n't , so this will make it even if it does n't change the technical law involved it complicates the matter of selling the jury it was at that point that mr will concluded , and so will we , closing , appropriately enough , with mariano rivera , with whom we had a minute to chat mr rivera s trot out to the pitcher s mound is accompanied by a little metallica tune called enter sandman , and we have always been curious how he picked his theme song metallica \? no , i never picked that music , he said someone with the yankees did the fans liked it , so we stuck with the song if i had the choice , i would pick christian music and no rap music
there has been no healing , really four years have passed since the terrorist attack on the world trade center , and the road to recovery at ground zero looks bleaker than ever a rebuilding effort that was originally cast as a symbolic rising from the ashes has long since turned into a hallucinogenic nightmare a roller coaster ride of grief , na vet , recriminations , political jockeying and paranoia the freedom tower , promoted as an image of the city s resurrection , has been transformed into a stern fortress a symbol of a city still in the grip of fear the world trade center memorial has been enveloped by a clutter of memorabilia and the promise that culture would play a lifeaffirming role has proved false now that gov george e pataki has warned that freedom of expression at ground zero will be strictly controlled \( we will not tolerate anything on that site that denigrates america , denigrates new york or freedom , or denigrates the sacrifice and courage that the heroes showed on sept 11 , he has said \) the freedom center , the drawing center , the performing arts center that would house the tiny signature theater company and joyce theater all now risk being dumped , either because they are viewed as lacking in sufficient patriotism or because officials were only toying with them in the first place on this anniversary weekend , it may be time to face up to what few have wanted to acknowledge that nothing of value can be built at ground zero while the anguish and anxiety remain so fresh nor while political and economic forces are eager to exploit those emotions i was once unwilling to recognize this three years ago , when the lower manhattan development corporation was opening its competition for the design of a master plan for ground zero , i paid a call on an older architect who had spent a lifetime navigating the byzantine planning politics of american cities at the time , new york was full of anxious hope a public outcry over the dull uniformity of the original renderings by the architecture firm beyer blinder belle had sent the development corporation back to the drawing boards , and there was a sense that something bold and important might happen the architect , unimpressed , said flatly that the only ground zero project that was not doomed to failure was the transportation hub since it was devoid of symbolic importance , he explained , it would not become a political time bomb the rest \? forget it i refused to believe him obviously , his view was prophetic the only promising design so far is the soaring glass hall of santiago calatrava s train station , which may end up as one of the most glorious public spaces to rise in new york since the construction of grand central terminal by contrast , the rest of daniel libeskind s master plan looks eerily like those original beyer blinder belle proposals though with more elaborate packaging a somber memorial to the dead , neatly parceled off from a sea of corporate towers that could be anywhere this crushing failure results from an assumption that hollow symbols can be equated with democratic values and it is compounded by a sincere , quintessentially american belief that any problem , no matter how painful or complex , can be solved through good intentions architecture s function here is to provide a reassuring gloss of cultural sophistication and political cover the architects , of course , have not been entirely innocent mr libeskind , for one , could have resigned when it became clear that his master plan had been reduced to a few empty gestures in choosing to stay , he lent credence to the illusion that everything was proceeding normally the norwegian firm snohetta , architects of the freedom center , must now confront a similar ethical dilemma should it participate in a project where creativity has been so fully eclipsed by politics \? it s a stubborn situation , justified by those who believe that any development at ground zero is good for the city s economy if the 10 million square feet of commercial space at ground zero is not rebuilt , the thinking goes , our fragile confidence will be erased , and the terrorists will have won but commercial space is not what is needed at ground zero the city is building at a frenetic pace there are plans to transform a strip along 10th avenue into a canyon of corporate skyscrapers with 24 million square feet of office space more office development is percolating at the west side hudson yards and the former con edison site overlooking the east river the abundance of new development in the city was a bargain chip for goldman sachs when it struck its recent deal with the city to stay downtown when it threatened to abandon a site just across the street from the proposed freedom tower for another one in midtown , the city was forced to cough up hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives and over 16 billion in federally backed liberty bonds this kind of back scratching is likely to become the norm downtown luring corporations to one of the world s most tempting terrorist targets is arduous and expensive and it s a painful reminder of how far we still are from a state of normalcy four years after the towers collapsed , the city is still in a collective process of recovery , yet the grains of optimism sprouted elsewhere in a newly reopened moma , for example , or in plans to transform the high line viaducts into a lush extended garden meanwhile , ground zero remains the physical manifestation of our worst fears for that reason , the most moving ideas for ground zero have always been those that treated it with the most delicacy norman foster s slender undulating glassandsteel towers , gently rising out of a sprawling park ellsworth kelly s soft blanket of green , which eloquently captured the site s need for silence i suppose that governor pataki and the lower manhattan development corporation could regain a measure of credibility by starting to scale back plans for development at the site they could solicit proposals for an interim plan , say , that offers a more realistic time frame for rebuilding not just in economic terms , but in psychic terms as well the point would be to allow the site s meaning to evolve over time , from a place for grieving to a place where architecture reasserts the value of life but none of this will be possible without shifting the emphasis back to what is most important at ground zero the cultural and public spaces that could be emotionally transformative it would require some patience and humility until then , aesthetic judgments are all but irrelevant
more than a month after leslie moonves , the chairman of cbs , requested the resignations of three top journalists at the network who helped oversee a flawed report on the national guard service of president bush , they have yet to step down , two cbs officials said yesterday the journalists betsy west , a senior vice president for cbs news josh howard , executive producer of the wednesday edition of 60 minutes and mary murphy , mr howard s deputy were asked by mr moonves to resign on jan 10 , the day he released the findings of an independent panel engaged by cbs to investigate the flawed report the panel found that cbs news had rushed the report on to the air on sept 8 in a frantic bid to beat its competitors and had not worked aggressively enough to verify the documents on which the report was based although the three journalists were relieved of their duties on the day the panel reported its findings , none had agreed to mr moonves s request as of yesterday , according to two network officials who have been informally briefed on the situation a spokesman for mr moonves , gil schwartz , declined to comment yesterday , as did john siffert , a lawyer for ms west ms murphy did not return a message left at her home mr howard did not respond to an email message asked in recent weeks about the status of the three journalists , representatives for mr moonves have consistently refused to comment only recently , as the matter has grown more protracted , have others at cbs been willing to discuss what they have been told , and only then without being identified all three journalists have hired lawyers , each of whom has had at least preliminary conversations with those representing cbs and at least two of the journalists , mr howard and ms murphy , both of whom joined the network more than 15 years ago , have been offered cash settlements that are equivalent to less than a year s salary , said one of the cbs officials each has thus far refused those offers why mr moonves , who is also copresident and cochief operating officer of viacom , the parent company of cbs , has not fired any of the three journalists as he did mary mapes , the producer of the flawed segment has not been made clear theodore rogers , manager of the labor employment group at sullivan cromwell , who is not involved in the dispute , said that it is unusual , in my experience , to ask for someone s immediate resignation and then to have the matter drag out for weeks that said , mr rogers added , i can see how it could happen mr rogers said that , without knowing the specific language in their contracts , it was impossible to know why mr moonves had asked for the resignations as opposed to dismissing the journalists outright that the three journalists are thus far resisting is easier to understand , mr rogers said i 've got to assume from their point of view it s a little bit of leverage , he said
east rutherford , nj , nov 28 the giants have just been penalized for conduct unbecoming a team with postseason aspirations only two nfl teams have been penalized more often this season only three have been assessed more penalty yards none of them have playoff hopes , and none are coached by a disciplinarian like tom coughlin it just drives me nuts , coughlin said monday it s not something i'm very proud of , to be point blank with you the giants' 2421 overtime loss to seattle on sunday was further stained by 16 penalties , the most for a giants team since 1949 and the third most in the franchise s history they included 11 falsestart penalties , each encouraging the qwest field fans to become louder , sometimes leading to more penalties and lending a sophomoric feel to a tense game two falsestart penalties came on punts the others were called on the offense five against left tackle luke petitgout , three against left guard david diehl and one against receiver plaxico burress some came with quarterback eli manning in the shotgun formation and the giants using a silent count , when a signal between manning and center shaun o'hara starts the play some came with manning under center , barking the snap count none were excused you 're watching the ball , coughlin said , the implication being that watching the ball out of the corner of one eye and watching a defensive player with the other is just part of a player s job penalties are associated with discipline and are considered a reflection of a team s personality for the giants , they stand in sharp contrast to the determination of their coach coughlin , who has said this season that he has stressed avoiding penalties until he is blue in the face , may be on the verge of using discipline to teach discipline i would like to keep the unit together , but i do know that i have some veterans that can play , coughlin said when asked if he would bench any offensive linemen if i do n't see improvement in that , i would n't have a lot of choice bob whitfield is listed as the backup to petitgout rich seubert and jason whittle are reserve guards the game against seattle , while striking for the number of penalties , and particularly for the falsestart calls , was not an aberration the giants have been penalized 102 times only the 47 oakland raiders \( 113 penalties \) and the 38 baltimore ravens \( 106 \) have been flagged more times the 38 new orleans saints have been called for 100 penalties , but they have more penalty yards than the giants \( 846 to 796 \) it is , in some ways , impressive that the giants have overcome their selfinflicted wounds enough to be fighting for a playoff berth the giants and the dallas cowboys play sunday at giants stadium for first place in the national football conference east only two teams have fewer penalties than dallas all this only fuels speculation as to where the giants might be if they had not been penalized nearly eight fields' worth of yardage it was no coincidence that the team with the fewer penalties won eight of nine games the giants have played \( the teams had the same number of penalties in the other two games \) , making it as much a bellwether statistic as turnover margin and time of possession not all calls go against the offense , of course on sunday , the giants' special teams had six penalties and the defense had one but offense is where penalties tend to be the most memorable and most damaging , often turning shortyardage downs into longyardage ones , or wiping out successful plays for whatever reason , that has been our weak point offensively , o'hara said the penalties manning added , it s hard enough getting 10 yards for a first down the players seemed embarrassed that the penalties might have reflected badly on coughlin but penalties are the most obvious gauge of a team s onfield discipline , which is why it is hardly surprising that the raiders have led the league in that category many times , and why it is surprising that a coughlincoached team would be in the mix for that dishonor this season you ca n't put that on him , linebacker carlos emmons said coach is on us all day long about penalties he ca n't get on the field with guys and make them not do things on the field to get penalties emmons s statement reflected a bit of a switch normally , a coach shields players from blame in this case , the giants tried to shield coughlin from responsibility for their mistakes he s definitely upset about it , tight end jeremy shockey said i do n't want you to think it reflects on him , because he does n't play the game if tom coughlin was out there playing the game , i guarantee you he would n't have any penalties , and he would n't have any holding calls , and he 'd catch every pass and make every perfect throw , because that s the person he is
george steinbrenner is right where he wants to be , and randy johnson , carl pavano and jaret wright had nothing to do with it george steinbrenner is no 1 with the owners' approval of the sale of the milwaukee brewers last week , steinbrenner became the senior owner in major league baseball none other than commissioner bud selig confirmed that development he is the senior owner in baseball today , selig said a case could be made that steinbrenner became no 1 in 1998 , when selig became commissioner , but the selig interests continued to own and operate the brewers until mark attanasio became the owner last week steinbrenner is not likely to walk around with his right index finger raised in the air , but he would be justified in doing so because he has outlasted or outlived the owners who operated the 23 other teams when steinbrenner and his partners bought the yankees for 10 million \( actually a net of 86 million \) in 1973 steinbrenner initially owned far less than 50 percent of the team , but he was the managing partner , which means he ran the team and made all of the decisions john mcmullen , an early limited partner in the yankees ownership , aptly characterized the role of steinbrenner s limited partners with a memorable remark in 1979 there s nothing more limited than a limited partner in the yankees steinbrenner bought the yankees 32 years ago this month i was there the first day , and i am still here i have known steinbrenner longer than i have known my wife i thought longevity might prompt steinbrenner to do an interview for this historic development , as he did seven years ago on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his purchase but a request through his publicist , the ubiquitous howard rubenstein , elicited no telephone conversation , only remarks delivered through rubenstein i feel every minute of all these years , steinbrenner authorized rubenstein to tell me it s been a great experience , and i'm proud to hold that title the excitement of the game , the phenomenal support of the fans , just being in new york and representing the yankees has been one of the greatest experiences of my life i look forward to the years ahead , and i truly want to bring more championships to new york he really felt good about it , rubenstein reported , meaning his new status i was , in a way , disappointed that i did n't have the opportunity to speak to george directly i have n't always enjoyed talking to him in his talking days , he too often had a forum to make outrageous statements but now that he infrequently talks to reporters , it would be good to be able to have a chat every now and then mostly then but now would have been preferable even baseball people , however , have noticed that steinbrenner is more invisible than visible these days , more silent than verbose it s as if the yankees have constructed a shelter around him people in baseball talk about it and wonder if he has a health problem that he is hiding one report circulating among them was that steinbrenner had a stroke no way , rubenstein said i'm on the phone with him every day he s on the phone with randy levine , lonn trost , brian cashman , rubenstein said , naming yankees executives he lifts weights he s in a real training program he s really all together steinbrenner s fellow owners will be pleased to hear that some of them have n't been around long enough to know him but he has outlasted or outlived all of their predecessors , in many cases more than one a team when steinbrenner bought the yankees , the major league ownership roster read like a who s who of baseball club owners among the names on that roster , besides selig , were tom yawkey , john fetzer , calvin griffith , ewing kauffman , gene autry , charlie finley , jerry hoffberger , walter o'malley , horace stoneham , philip wrigley , gussie busch , joan payson , bob carpenter , john galbreath , charles bronfman and judge roy hofheinz at his first owners meeting , steinbrenner assured his new friends that mike burke would run the yankees , that he , george , was in the shipping industry and had no time to run the team on a daily basis he made the same declaration at his first news conference but mike burke did n't last long , and neither did steinbrenner s private and public assurance steinbrenner does n't go to many yankees road games anymore , but he used to go to milwaukee often , hoping to see his team beat selig s team i was n't a good sport when things were n't going well , selig acknowledged , recalling one game that he watched with steinbrenner we were in my box , and i was railing , slamming doors he said at one point 'the world thinks you 're this nice guy and i'm this miserable demanding person just listen to you if i said all those things , i do n't know what would happen ' then there was the day when selig was honored on the field before the game i came back to the box , selig related , and he said , 'if i went on the field to accept an award , there would be two weeks worth of garbage on the field ' there also was the day when steinbrenner was sitting in selig s glassenclosed box and reporters wanted to talk to him tell them i'm not here , steinbrenner told the team s public relations man while reporters watched from outside the box steinbrenner will be pleased to know that selig still has a gift the yankees' owner gave him i wear an old tshirt that george gave me , selig said there was a dispute about bowie kuhn when he was commissioner , and we were n't on the same side one day at a meeting george said , 'i got something for you' he had a shirt made up on one side it said , 'bowie s bobos' the other side was selig' with a one i was clearly the no 1 bobo and now steinbrenner is the no 1 owner
perhaps no other recently opened restaurant raises the question of how much originality matters , of innovation s importance , as pointedly as nobu 57 does the name says it all this is n't a new dining experience it s an old one on a different block , nobu in a different dress its menu and its food elicit not so much a stab as a fullon body blow of the familiar here they are , lightly battered rock shrimp in a gently spicy mayonnaise , a dish done with dozens of tweaks and an array of seafood in hundreds of restaurants over the last decade here it is , a plump wedge of misoglazed black cod , the culinary equivalent of a cole porter standard , covered and interpreted by so many artists that you may not recall where and when you experienced it first that place was probably nobu , and that time might have been 1994 , when the restaurant opened in tribeca , giving the chef nobu matsuhisa , who had already wowed diners in los angeles , his first new york stage stages in miami and milan , london and las vegas , would follow americans' ideas about what an upscale , mainstream japanese restaurant should serve \( sashimi salad , a pink puck of toro tartare with a black beret of caviar \) and how it should look \( somewhat whimsical , more spare or sleek than plush \) would be affected by nobu s concoctions and complexion the familiarity of nobu 57 reflects more than its sire s genes and zest for reproduction it reflects and is compounded by its sire s broader legacy nobu is to matsuri and koi as mcdonald s is to wendy s a tutor and template but nobu 57 gets exactly right what many of nobu s less direct descendants do n't the dependable fineness and freshness of product the calibration of sweetness , tartness , richness and modulated fire in many dishes the efficient service in fact the child may at present be bettering the parent , its managers more attentive , its kitchen hands more engaged on a recent night several friends and i ate almost precisely the same meals at nobu and nobu 57 , going directly from one to the other much about the original nobu had a frayed , complacent quality there were epic waits for dishes and sloppy applications of dressings and when i had called to make the 6 pm reservation , i was curtly told that we would have to leave our table by 8 30 we had yet to arrive and were already being shown the door nobu 57 could also benefit from better phone etiquette i was frequently put on hold while someone searched for the reservation book , the right computer file , jimmy hoffa who knew \? but nobu 57 was more disciplined on that doubleheader night and others , most of the food was terrific the rock shrimp in that famous , creamy tempura dish had been cooked beautifully , each bite yielding a tiny explosion of flavor and moisture the sushi was exemplary , including interesting selections , one of which our server identified as gen saba and called the toro of mackerel it tasted luscious enough , and felt buttery enough on the tongue , to live up to that billing the softshell crab in a cut roll was still crisp , still warm \( other restaurants prepare the cooked elements of rolls too far in advance , so that all the ingredients are tepid or cold \) the lobster in lobster ceviche was gorgeous and sweet it had been combined with red onions and cilantro , then wrapped in butter lettuce when it came to raw or almost raw fish compositions , the nobu way of adding lively accents without getting carried away distinguished a seafood triptych of octopus , uni and scallop , each seasoned with cilantro and a single bold red pinprick of peruvian chili paste many diners think only of japanese when they think of nobu but that paste , that ceviche and the recurrence of cilantro and jalape o \( as in another nobu classic , yellowtail sashimi with jalape o \) were reminders that mr matsuhisa is a fusion artist he brokered a partnership between japan and latin america nobu 57 adds only minor developments to that arrangement it has a woodburning oven , used for recurring nightly specials , including a pleasant arctic char a new king crab tempura dish came with an amazu sweet vinegar sauce on the omakase \( chef s tasting \) menu was an infrequently seen cut of bluefin tuna , the collar , which was very fatty , slightly gamy and altogether wonderful the lamb shank of the sea it had been grilled and placed beside a ramekin of the same wasabi pepper sauce that accompanies a dish of halibut cheeks nobu 57 has several new desserts , including a lovely one that mingles a pur e of white peaches with cold jasmine tea , peanut crumble and beer ice cream but the restaurant s biggest departure from nobu is its glimmer and size david rockwell again supervised the design , but this time around he traded blond for black and went heavy on a rattanlike material , making nobu 57 look a bit like an upscale pier 1 in which the lights have been doused it spreads over two floors and enough space to allow it something nobu does n't have a proper bar area as well as more tables it increases , at least slightly , the chance of a coveted nobu reservation the downtown restaurant is still consistently jammed , still a celebrity haven nobu 57 also has celebrities , including naomi campbell and a bevy of emaciated giantesses on a surreal night during fashion week but it can accommodate regular folk a bit more easily , and regular folk were my usual companions what mattered most to them , and to me , was n't whether nobu 57 was exploring new culinary horizons what mattered was how well it navigated terrain that s become common precisely because it s so appealing , and nobu 57 , under its executive chef , matt hoyle , navigated it expertly enough to compensate for any lack of originality what mattered was that black cod i'm almost convinced that mr matsuhisa maintains a secret tank in which the fish toss back jacques torres chocolates and watch finding nemo while they fatten the result , richer in the nobu family than anywhere else , was no less delovely for the number of times it s been performed nobu 57 rating three stars 40 west 57th street , midtown \( 212 \) 7573000 atmosphere two spacious floors of dark , glittering , busily decorated space try to add downtown style sound level noisy , but not impossibly so recommended dishes yellowtail sashimi with jalape o lobster ceviche rock shrimp tempura in spicy mayonnaise grilled baby squid black cod tuna collar with wasabi pepper sauce soft shell crab roll white peach pur e with peanut crumble wine list varied in geography and price , accessibly organized and supplemented by a range of sakes and many special cocktails price range cold dishes , 11 to 34 hot dishes , 9 to 36 sushi , 350 to 8 a piece desserts , 10 to 18 hours from 5 45 pm to 10 15 pm monday through thursday 5 45 to 11 15 pm friday and saturday sunday hours and lunch to be added by year s end reservations for prime dinner times , call exactly a month ahead credit cards all major cards wheelchair access entrance and accessible restrooms at street level elevator to main dining room upstairs what the stars mean \( none \) poor to satisfactory good very good excellent extraordinary ratings reflect the reviewer s reaction to food , ambience and service , with price taken into consideration menu listings and prices are subject to change past reviews from the times , with additional capsule reviews by times critics nytimescom dining
grand rapids , mich barbara amberg used her social security checks to fly to new york and see christo s gates in central park shirley malone lives on hers in subsidized public housing , sometimes washing her clothes in dish detergent to save money for joseph cohen , a businessman who lost his business , social security is the safety net he never thought he would need we 're talking about a fortunate guy who had assets to put away , mr cohen said but without social security i would be in bad shape as congressional republicans struggle to break a partisan impasse over president bush s plan to reinvent social security and shore up its finances , 32 million older americans are living the realities of the nation s biggest social program any changes will not affect people like mrs amberg , ms malone or mr cohen , who are already collecting their benefits but in the details of their daily lives , set out in indepth interviews , these grand rapids residents afford a nuanced working model of social security the bumps it cushions and those it does not , the dreams it fosters or leaves out of reach for many , it is the bedrock of their existence americans appear to overestimate how much money they will be able to put aside for retirement a new york times cbs news poll found that only 20 percent of americans who are not yet retired expect social security to be their major source of income when they stop working but 39 percent of retirees in the same survey said that social security was their major source of income nearly all americans over 65 collect benefits the social security administration says that about a third depend on social security for more than 90 percent of their income another third get half to 90 percent of their money from the program and a third rely on it for less than half about 13 million would fall below the poverty line without social security unless they found other sources each of these situations plays out in grand rapids , a riverfront city of 197 , 000 , where mansions built by the city s dutch industrial elite gaze across town at concrete grids of public housing in different neighborhoods , social security is an antipoverty program , a middleclass pension , a widow s survivor benefit , a disability check for some , retirement has brought trophy homes and donations to charity for others , bathroom sinks mended with adhesive tape and prescriptions unfilled for lack of money two brothers , the wards , capture the range in benefits norman , a former heroin addict who shuffled among lowpaying jobs , gets 502 a month , while luther and his wife , who had steady careers at the local school district , collect a combined 2 , 400 reeling from layoffs and plant closings and with a strong evangelical christian strain , grand rapids is tossup political territory , and opinions are varied about mr bush s efforts to give americans more say in how some of their social security payments are invested with the possibility of higher rewards and higher risk some people , like bill post , who helped invent the poptart and saved dutifully , support mr bush s proposals to create individual investment accounts within social security that s not a big risk , mr post said , that s a good opportunity but others , like james townsend , who worked as a forklift operator , defend the traditional program if they had n't had social security , i would n't have saved that money , he said if i 'd had extra money , i 'd have spent it i would n't have anything at all here as elsewhere , social security has paid back some more generously than others created to protect the most vulnerable , it redistributes money from rich people to poor people , and from men to women , who often have no pension or assets but as family structures have evolved from the oneearner nuclear model of the 1930 s , the program has not always kept up it rewards married couples more than single people , and couples with one stayathome spouse more than those in which both spouses worked groups with shorter life expectancies , like africanamericans , receive fewer benefits than those who live longer economists describe retirement as a threelegged stool supported by savings , pension and social security but as companies have moved away from traditional pensions , and more americans approach retirement with inadequate savings , many , like mr townsend , are adding a fourth leg work just four decades ago , 3 in 10 americans over age 65 lived in poverty after changes in social security benefits , that figure is now less than 1 in 10 , below the poverty rate for the general population the urban institute , a policy research group , recently found that working couples earning average incomes , if they retired today , would have benefits worth the equivalent of 439 , 000 in a 401 \( k \) plan , more than double what they would have had in 1960 , accounting for inflation but retirees here do not measure their benefits by such calculations social security is a car payment , cable television , a tithe , the freedom to volunteer in town , the dignity of a firstever savings account nearly a third of americans collecting social security benefits are single women many , like shirley malone , who is divorced and lives in subsidized housing behind a shopping center here , would fall into poverty without them a thickset woman who moves painfully from a car accident two decades ago , ms malone , 69 , gets 700 a month from social security and a 212 stipend from a volunteer program for lowincome seniors helping out in the schools she has no savings when i was young , i heard all these stories about the golden years , she said what happened to them \? each month ms malone gathers her bills before the social security check comes she pays 40 a month for car insurance , more than 100 for prescription drugs , 52 for basic cable television , 122 for supplemental health insurance , plus her rent , which is set at 30 percent of her income when she is finished writing checks , she said , there is no money left she has had to put off dental work and getting hearing aids because she cannot afford them i'm contemplating every month getting rid of my cable , but what else do i have \? she said there s no such thing as splurging i even do n't give my grandchildren presents none of this was planned my head was younger than the rest of me , she said i always thought i 'd be able to work ms malone married before she turned 18 and did not work until her children were teenagers when her marriage ended , she said , she came away with nothing but the children she had a high school education and no work experience she took a job as a cashier at a car wash , on her feet sometimes for 10 hours at a time when she retired at 62 , after 11 years , she felt lost the worst part was that i was n't busy enough , she said all the sudden , here i am all alone my grandkids were all grown up they did n't need me anymore she added , i never thought i 'd feel completely worthless though she still has blue days , working with children has made her feel useful social security has been a bureaucratic maze as well as a lifeline for ms malone for years she did not realize that she could collect before turning 65 , or that she could collect on her former husband s benefits she deals with a variety of health problems , including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recurring pain throughout her body , for which she can tolerate only tylenol , which gives her no relief osteoporosis , she said , is shrinking her to nothing still , she is happier now than she has been since her children were young the income from social security and the volunteer stipend are secure , if small she feels she has earned the benefit we 're not getting anything we did n't work for all our lives , she said there s a lot of us like this but mainly , it is the children of knapp charter academy , the ones who call her grandma shirley , that fill her life at her hallway desk , she smiled as she dispensed stickers or helped a student with her reading exercises i did n't have a lot of money to start with , so i do n't feel i came down , ms malone said at the school , she wore a bulky sweatshirt promoting the volunteer program she has resisted entreaties from her son to live with him the check is a lifesaver , she said of the stipend that allows her to live independently but if the program lost financing and could not pay her , she said , she would work in the school anyway they 're my therapy , she said there s nothing like feeling useful barbara amberg , who was born into privilege and married pedigree , represents the other edge of social security like 1 in 10 of the program s recipients , she relies on it for less than a fifth of her income , which is 50 , 000 to 100 , 000 a year hers is a retirement of comfort and choices without concern for costs , shown in scrapbooks that brim with the photographs and memorabilia of a busy traveler there is her annual summer pilgrimage to the stratford shakespeare festival in canada , and yearly visits to her children in san antonio , pennsylvania and los angeles group trips to art museums in chicago and detroit a fourday , 1 , 850 package tour to see the gates in february all courtesy of social security it pays for extras , mrs amberg , a widow who just turned 80 , said of the 924 monthly check mostly i use it for trips if mrs amberg does not exactly need social security , social security has always needed people like her the original architects of the depressionera program enlisted the crucial backing of the betteroff by selling it as a broadbased insurance program rather than a poor people s stipend indeed , when asked about shrinking benefits to richer recipients to preserve payments to the poor , mrs amberg was ambivalent , saying , somehow i have that feeling you have put in your amount , you should get back what you are owed she is open to the idea of raising the 90 , 000 cap on income subject to payroll taxes , or the age of eligibility but despite her own windfall from booming stocks like walmart and eli lilly , she remains skeptical of mr bush s desire to divert some of social security to individual accounts i know it has to be tinkered with , i just do n't think you should change the concept , she said who knows if they can get any extra money out of the market \? i just think that s such a foolish idea mrs amberg , who had a 7anhour parttime job at the pooh s corner children s bookstore for 15 years , has always used dividends from her family trust funds to pay for routine expenses , like a weekly 20 blowdry at the beauty shop and 45 monthly dues at the health club while she does not spend extravagantly i sort of have it in my head that i'm not going to buy a 500 dress neither does she worry about the price of her season tickets to grand rapids' symphony , opera and two major theaters she owns a spacious condominium here and a fourbedroom cottage on lake michigan she has given nearly half a million dollars in pretax bequests to her four grandchildren since 1991 , and signs over at least 5 , 000 in stock each year to a church and she maintains her 342amonth membership in the kent country club , where she and her daughter had wedding receptions , though three hip replacements have halted her golf game i think i would feel lost without that , she said mrs amberg and her late husband , david , a lawyer , both descended from old grand rapids families whose homes are among the jewels of the heritage hill historic district , an enclave built between 1848 and 1920 by the city s lumber barons and furniture moguls their nest egg was layered by inheritance , which also sent their children to princeton , tufts and boston university they never felt pressure to save hair coiffed , lipstick fresh , ears adorned with gold , mrs amberg is a genteel visage sipping chardonnay before dinner one weeknight at the victorian mansion of the women s city club , where her mother and grandmother were members before her she grew up on a family compound like the kennedys with an italianate building at its center housing a squash court and a 50foot lap pool her late husband s family helped settle grand rapids in 1834 mrs amberg s days overflow with activity two book groups , three bridge foursomes , lectures , reading on a radio station for the blind , serving as treasurer of the local smith college alumnae club one week in april , she was out every night i think you have to work at it when you 're a woman alone , she said you just do n't expect people to call you or to make up things to do , you have to make things happen several widows are among her closest friends , but mrs amberg is careful to keep up with couples so if you want to entertain , you can still find a few men to come to your party , she said but if you have a cocktail party , they 're the ones who ca n't stand up the men have to sit down not mrs amberg she is at the gym every wednesday morning for senior aerobics , strutting to a sinatra soundtrack , though she ducks out when stretching starts i ca n't get down on the floor and then get back up again , so i leave , she said if she goes a little slower these days , she still goes in may , she visited fallingwater , frank lloyd wright s masterpiece in western pennsylvania to celebrate her 80th birthday , her family joined her for a weekend in new york there are social security checks to spend , scrapbooks yet to fill between social security and a small pension , james townsend thought he had enough to retire but 10 years after he began collecting his checks , he greeted a recent sunny spring afternoon with a familiar ritual he put on his uniform and went to work from 4 pm to midnight eight nights a month , mr townsend , 74 , works as a security guard at a retirement community at the edge of town as he made his rounds that evening , mr townsend poked behind the furnace and paced a solitary , hourlong circuit of the carpeted hallways , empty except for a woman leaving the exercise area i 've been lucky , i 've never seen any strange people , he said mr townsend had not expected to be working at this age when he retired at 64 from his job as a forklift operator in an auto parts plant , he believed he could live on his pension of about 200 a month and his and his wife s social security checks , which added up to almost 1 , 100 the townsends' home here , a neat ranch house in a neighborhood that he calls the inner city , but not the ghetto , was paid off , and mr townsend thought he could cut back on a few activities or entertainment i just wanted to stop working in a factory , waking up every morning at the crack of dawn , he said i had put in a lot of hard time at the factory it was a relief to stop working but for the townsends , two small changes were enough to upset his plans mr townsend s old car gave out , and he bought a new 1999 dodge intrepid , with payments of 32755 a month at the same time , his doctor found he had high levels of cholesterol medication ran to 99 a month that s when things really tightened on me , he said i had to cut back on everything , even my tithes and offerings at church so mr townsend went looking for a job again almost five million americans over age 65 worked last year , up from fewer than three million two decades ago the rise counters a halfcentury trend toward earlier retirement in 1950 , nearly half of men over 65 were still working by 2000 , only 17 percent were some retirees miss the purposefulness of work some need the money mr townsend straddled both categories he could use the money , but he also had no hobbies to occupy his time work , he said , has kept him active a native of carbondale , ill , mr townsend moved to grand rapids to work in the factories here , and his finances have followed the unsteady rhythms of production good in boom years , fragile when the demand for auto parts or office furniture slowed in his first seven years here , he was laid off for part of every year his house , where he has lived for 40 years , sits on a block of weathered homes in a largely africanamerican section southeast of downtown when he goes out at night , it is to a sports bar in a mixed neighborhood to the north but my preacher do n't know it , he said when his car payments put the crunch on him , he called his network of friends , who told him about a parttime opening at the retirement community the added income of about 340 every two weeks covered his car payments and cholesterol medicine with his parttime job and his pension , the townsends earn more than 2 , 000 a month , about as much as they did before his retirement , and without the threat of having all their income wiped out by layoff or strike social security , which supplies the biggest share of their income , provides both stability and freedom i enjoy the way i work now , he said i work 4 days and then i'm off for 10 what kind of job is that \? it s not like the other work i did i hustled when i was in the factory with his job , he said , he has enough money to take his wife to dinner he is looking into supplemental health insurance , which would cost 200 or more a month to protect him against medical catastrophe he hopes that social security will continue as is he doubts he could have done as well on his own managing for retirement i feel it s scare tactics now , he added if the government would stop using that money for other things like this war , the thing would go on and on and on with a 75 , 000 pension , social security , ample savings and a series of real estate investments , bill post could be the model for retirement planning in the pre401 \( k \) era a son of immigrants from the netherlands whom poor people called poor , mr post went to work at the local keebler plant on his 16th birthday , putting pans in ovens for 38 cents an hour , and left the company 41 years later as a senior vice president with a 92 , 000 salary he then embarked on a second career as a 30 , 000ayear consultant for kellogg , the company for which he had helped develop the poptart now , he carves wooden santa claus statues in a basement workshop under an old sign that says nooitgedacht dutch for , as mr post put it , never woulda thought he never would have thought a cranberry jaguar convertible would sit in his garage hardly could have imagined retiring at 57 to a custombuilt dream home , never mind selling it later for 11 million i would never have ever thought that we would have such a good life , mr post , 77 , said he also never considered depending on social security he and his wife of 57 years , florence , avoided debt by spending frugally with the future in mind when his company provided executives with a financial consultant as a perk , mr post recalled , he came back and said , 'i never met a guy like you you 're living within your income' the posts are among 75 million of today s retirees , 29 percent , who collect private pensions , a middleclass staple that is fast disappearing they also have income from bonds and interest payments on two private loans , but the only stocks they own are kellogg shares he received as bonuses no gambling , mr post explained i ca n't see the principal shrink worked too hard for our money it is people like mr post who in future generations , under mr bush s proposals , could see their guaranteed benefits become much less generous than currently promised i would be for less benefits , mr post said , if that would promote the health of the program likewise , he supports mr bush s vision of individual accounts , saying , i know there are better investments than what s happening mr post , who dropped out of college to become personnel manager of keebler s bakery in grand rapids at 21 , was running the plant in 1963 when kellogg came looking for a partner to develop a toaster pastry he quickly greenlighted the idea despite the challenge of hoisting a huge piece of machinery to create the top layer and adapting an air clutch to squirt dollops of filling i was just the guy who said we 'd do it , said mr post , who still stocks his pantry with his favorite flavor , frosted strawberry as he climbed the ladder from cookie baker to corporate officer , mr post s biggest boon was real estate in 1971 , the posts bought a 100foot parcel on glen lake in northern michigan for 16 , 000 , building an aframe bungalow for weekend getaways they traded up twice to bigger lake properties , and after 18 years in their dream house , sold it to buy a 5 , 000square foot , 415 , 000 home in a grand rapids suburb mr post grew up thinking of as where the big shots lived it is at once an homage to their affluence and their humble roots they added a large master suite and furnished it with an antique wooden night table , bed and dresser they bought years ago for 10 mrs post weaves patchwork rugs out of remnants the couple eats off dinnerware with a french pattern by quimper fa ence that dates from 1690 and sells for 95 a plate what s enough \? mr post asked one afternoon relaxing on the expansive deck you know what enough is \? a little more than you got rather than revel in their bounty , though , the posts , who read scripture aloud after breakfast , glory in giving their money away 1 , 400 a month to thornapple covenant church \( plus an extra 1 , 000 on thanksgiving and easter \) 2 , 500 a year to gideon s , the bible distributors a recent 5 , 000 to a school for disabled adults 2 , 000 here and 2 , 000 there for missionaries to thailand or india he s opened up the floodgates for us , mr post said , referring to god s new testament promise to reward those who tithe we give , and he opens up floodgates , and we give more without a calculator , mrs post balances their three checkbooks one for their 2 , 000amonth social security checks , which includes her spousal benefits the others for the pension and interest one afternoon , she spent hours stuck on a 2 , 000 mistake in her favor the next morning , a fundraiser for an evangelical broadcaster came to pitch the posts for contributions of as much as 10 , 000 mr post chuckled at the numbers , noting , i was a cookie baker all my life he and his wife had agreed the night before to give 500 , and upped it before breakfast to 1 , 000 when mrs post pulled out the checkbook , though , she whispered , how about two \? and that is what she wrote the mistake i had made , she explained later i just felt that was the lord telling me , you have extra money in here , you should give it joseph cohen , 89 , was a millionaire once , with a stake in a family clothing business and the intention of working forever when the company collapsed in 1980 , mr cohen , then 64 , had a few outside investments , a house and an asset he never expected to need social security on a crisp michigan morning , mr cohen was having coffee and doughnuts with other retirees in the apartment complex where he now lives alone , near a cordon of strip malls and bigbox retailers by the airport he has a crown of white hair , a metallic chicago accent and a manner that is both genial and cranky when he had his business , he said , he never thought about social security or retirement i assumed we 'd be taking a month off and going to florida we used to do that mr cohen belongs to the uncounted but substantial population of americans who reach retirement age with less money than they planned , reliant on social security in ways they do not expect people who end up with less assets than they thought that s almost all of us , said alicia h munnell , director of the center for retirement research at boston college , who served in the treasury department during the clinton administration people have business reversals , or they lose money in the stock market , or they have medical expenses they ca n't afford anyone who ever worked for enron or worldcom knows how it feels to look in their retirement account and see there s nothing left mr cohen now lives mostly on the 1 , 800 he receives each month from social security , plus income from bonds he bought after he sold his house about 1 , 000 to 1 , 200 a month he does not own stock , a home or life insurance compared with most retirees , mr cohen is doing well he flies first class to see his children in new jersey and seattle , still has valuable art in his living room and has contributed money toward his grandchildren s education because he did not have to work , he volunteered extensively in his synagogue , the public schools and the local civil rights movement by his lights he did not retire until last year , when a small stroke forced him to stop volunteering but last year , when one of mr cohen s bonds matured , and he replaced it with one that pays dividends of about 100 less a month , he felt the loss i got clobbered , he said it does n't sound like much , but it means you have 25 a week less to spend mr cohen opposes individual investment accounts , because of the volatility of the stock market and the cost of managing the accounts we 're living in a society with an age group that have n't been through the depression and are n't cognizant of what can happen , he said how do you know that wo n't happen tomorrow \? i often wonder what happened to all the people who used to work for me mr cohen said he had spent a lot of his retirement savings on care for his wife , who died in 1993 , and son robert , who died of an inoperable brain lesion in 2001 his wife went from doctor to doctor all stupid sob s , mr cohen said before amyloidosis , a plasma cell disorder , was diagnosed she died after three years of treatment at the mayo clinic in minnesota insurance paid for some of this care but not all i 've never gone back and seen how much it cost at mayo s , he said word of honor , you never go over expenses and think about whether to get this treatment or this you just do it lately his own health has been giving him problems in april , while spending passover with his daughter in new jersey , he underwent an mri for pain in his back , and a ruptured disk was diagnosed he has not been back to grand rapids mr cohen can remember when he was like many young workers now , who do not think social security will be around when they retire when the program was enacted , the same year he finished high school , he put little faith in it it was introduced without a lot of people knowing what it was going to do , he said if someone had said , 'here s this program that s going to take care of you , ' i 'd say , 'yeah , wait and see' now it is the anchor of a retirement that mr cohen has come to accept it s not as much as i 'd like to have , he said , but i'm not worried social security was never intended as a family reunification initiative , but luther and norman ward show how far its safety net can stretch for years , luther , a school janitor and truant officer , hardly spoke to his brother norman , a heroin addict , because when he came to see me it was with a hand out now they sit side by side every sunday in church the social security check that lets norman , for the first time in his life , keep a small savings account , also allows luther to offer handmedown furniture and the occasional covered dish without worry that his brother s needs will overwhelm his own just as social security frees baby boomers from the financial and emotional burden of dependent parents , it has built a bridge between these formerly estranged brothers , who passed a recent afternoon feeding ducks at the grand river like boys i save every month i refuse to get broke , norman , 77 , said i love my brother and i would n't want to hurt him the wards , two of six sons of a steelworker and a laundress , embody social security s dual identity , as a return on an investment for people like luther , 71 , who play by the rules , and as an insurance policy that keeps even those who led largely unproductive lives from suffering on the street for luther and his wife , diane , a retired teacher , social security is one component of a relaxed retirement their monthly checks totaling about 2 , 400 provide 36 percent of their income , the rest coming from their solid school district pensions without it , luther said , i 'd probably have a parttime job for norman , who gets 502 plus 96 in state and federal supplements for the poorest recipients , social security is a savior his only other income is the occasional bounty when one of his six numbers hits in the michigan daily pick three without it , norman said , i 'd probably be dead now luther did decades of double duty as a janitor and truant officer , raising five children over two marriages he took the second school district job to cover child support for the four children from his first marriage , and ended up with combined wages of 60 , 000 after selling off his mutual funds a few years ago , he keeps his savings , about 14 , 000 , in the credit union earning 2 percent , and strongly opposes mr bush s proposal to turn part of social security into individual accounts at my age , i'm not thinking about 10 years it coming back , he said of the stock market norman , who never made it past 10th grade , got hooked on heroin while in the army back home , slurping cough syrup when he could not afford heroin , he got and lost jobs at general motors , steelcase , a forklift factory , a meat warehouse and , his favorite , as a bellhop at the old rowe hotel downtown , for 12 a week plus tips he did time twice , in 1961 and 1991 , after pleading guilty to drug possession , and checked himself into rehab half a dozen times he cared for his parents in their final years and inherited their house , but the 56 , 000 it sold for quickly disappeared into drugs when i blew that money , i got scared , norman recalled i used to take the cover and pull it over my head because i hate to see daylight come nowadays , in his onebedroom at the ransom towers downtown , norman is showered and with his bed made by 7 am , though he spends most days watching hours of backtoback courtroom reality shows from a raggedy lounge chair he pays his 170 rent , 45 cable , 25 telephone , 20 church dues and 13 for airconditioning in summer weeks in advance food stamps , 112 a month , fill his cupboards with canned vegetables and special k the nine pills he swallows daily for diabetes and high blood pressure cost him 3 for brand names , 1 for generics , under medicaid magic shaving powder , 125 a can , keeps his head bald still he has enough extra that at times he is like an atm , handing out two 20 s and a 10 to various neighbors one sunday before leaving for church i do n't want your reason , i just want it back , he said of his nointerest , noinformation approach if they ask for it , they need it across town , luther said he and diane never take out a loan we ca n't pay back in a year s time , so they are setting aside 1 , 000 a month to cover the 11 , 000 home equity line of credit that pays for remodeling the kitchen this summer they travel every other year to see her relatives in the netherlands or his son , an air force officer stationed in belgium , and the basement is lined with posters from the musicals they frequent here and in toronto for luther s 70th birthday , diane booked a suite at the bellagio in las vegas seven or eight years ago , norman asked luther to pick him up on the way to grace christian reformed church he called for a ride again the next saturday then he said , 'i do n't want to call you anymore , just pick me up every sunday , ' recalled luther , who is a deacon he already knew the minister because he had borrowed money from the minister on tuesdays , too , luther swings by norman s building for their weekly run to a food warehouse to stock the church pantry first time in my life i ever enjoyed it , norman said as he piled up potatoes and set aside a box of chocolate cookies for himself , never mind the diabetes doing something and not looking for nothing
a spicy feud between stockcar drivers apparently has a much shorter shelf life inside a racetrack than outside two drivers involved in a wreck usually grumble , sometimes curse , then put their broken cars into the hauler to hustle to another race you 've got to realize we 're all a part of a traveling circus 38 weeks a year , chad knaus , the crew chief for jimmie johnson , said friday if you sit there and hold a grudge over somebody s else head , you 're only going to hurt yourself johnson , who leads the nascar nextel cup standings going into today s aaron s 499 race in talladega , ala , would appear to be sitting in a stewpot of simmering disagreement with tony stewart , the 2002 series champion it s been a learning experience , being under the microscope , johnson said in a telephone interview thursday twothirds into a race last weekend in phoenix , johnson nudged stewart s car from behind , spinning out stewart and causing a fivecar pileup stewart said the wreck was johnson s fault he did not know what he was doing , stewart said besides , the two had a little history johnson and stewart bumped into each other late in the daytona 500 , the first race of the season knaus and stewart were reported to have had words after the race , in which johnson finished fifth and stewart seventh stewart is 14th in points entering today s race at talladega , one of two tracks that is so big , so open and so fast that nascar requires teams to put restrictor plates on the carburetors of their cars to limit airflow and horsepower \( daytona is the other \) stewart might have a score to settle with johnson , but he said friday that what had happened at phoenix might as well have happened 10 years ago he has positions in the standings to gain , and he cannot do that with rumpled fenders we had an accident , stewart said friday through a spokesman accidents happen it s over it s done with in fact , here it is friday , and it s kind of annoying talking about something that happened last saturday jimmie and i are friends , but it seems like everyone is making a big deal out of nothing in the new nascar , only the points seem to matter dale earnhardt jr said as much in a conference call last week with reporters his father , a seventime series champion , might have spun out a competitor to ram home a point although many race fans would relish a highspeed clash between two famous competitors that would bring back memories of the good old days for the good old boys , there is no room for that too much money is poured into the cars and into prize purses if i get an opportunity to talk to them after the race or somehow get a message to them verbally , it s a lot better to do it that way than to be on each other at the racetrack , earnhardt said last week johnson , who has a 173point lead after eight races over kurt busch , the secondplace driver , is piling up points at such an astounding rate that it seems as if no one will be able to catch him he had a big lead last year , too , but lost it because he encountered mechanical problems as knaus and his crew tried to make his car faster for the first chase for the nextel cup johnson finished second for the second straight season it s just the world of motorsports you change things , knaus said if you do n't change things , you 're going to get beaten with another points lead , though , comes another load scrutiny there were four other accidents in last weekend s race none were examined as closely as the one johnson was said to have caused the one they show in slowmotion , the one they show 15 times , is the one that i'm caught up in , johnson said with a soft laugh johnson , a 29yearold californian , is handsome , articulate and , at least before this season , he was generally regarded as a driver who did not cause wrecks he says he expects to be booed when the drivers are introduced before today s race part of his unpopularity at talladega may be because jeff gordon coowns johnson s chevrolet gordon won a race at talladega last year under caution dale earnhardt jr was denied a chance to catch him dale earnhardt sr won 10 times at talladega , and dale jr has won five races the fans pelted the track with garbage nascar later adopted a rule in which an attempt would be made to finish a race under the green flag the fans around here are very avid and emotional , and there are a lot of big earnhardt and earnhardt jr fans around here , gordon told reporters friday after practice any little tiny bit of controversy around here that s going to include him , you 're going to see that same thing no matter whether it s me or anyone else who s racing him rivalries lurk beneath the races themselves stewart , 33 , is regarded as a vastly talented driver with a testy disposition not unlike dale earnhardt sr johnson is poised and aggressive , like gordon why should n't there be a feud \? there are boos everyone wants to be liked and appreciated when you have the crowds the size we do , johnson said you want them to be cheering instead of booing i'm now being booed , and we 're selling the thirdmost amount of merchandise it s kind of weird you get booed , but you 're behind jeff and junior in merchandise sales he added you ca n't change i believe in myself i believe in the character i have i believe in the racecar when you 're under the microscope , you ca n't worry about , or pay much attention to , what everyone else is saying about you
dignelesbains , france , july 14 lance armstrong lost a valuable discovery channel teammate thursday when manuel beltran , a strong climber , crashed and withdrew from the tour de france armstrong nevertheless maintained his overall lead in the race it was a better day for the french david moncouti , a frenchman with cofidis , won the 12th of 21 daily tour stages , and sandy casar , who rides for fdjcom , was second another frenchman , patrice halgand of cr dit agricole , was fourth but angel vicioso , a spaniard with liberty seguros , prevented the sweep by finishing third it s fabulous to win on the quatorze juillet , or july 14 , bastille day , moncouti said , echoing the speech of the 28 previous french winners on this day since 1905 his victory , by 57 seconds over seven of his breakaway companions and by 10 minutes 33 seconds over the major contenders , had no effect at the top of the overall standings because the 13 men in the breakaway were all far behind when the stage started moncouti was timed in 4 hours 20 minutes 6 seconds over 1162 miles , on a day with temperatures exceeding 92 degrees armstrong finished 41st but continued to wear the yellow jersey by 38 seconds over mickael rasmussen , a dane with rabobank , and by 2 34 over christophe moreau , a frenchman with cr dit agricole beltran s mishap occurred on the last of three days in the alps , a stage with five minor climbs from brian on to dignelesbains in the lower alps of provence he crashed in the first hour of the stage and rode for several more miles , but he was riding without power , said johan bruyneel , the director of the discovery channel team beltran , 34 , said he did not remember that he had gone down and hit his head the race doctor examined him and recommended that he be sent to a hospital in the city of gap , where he was to remain overnight beltran gave strong support in the mountains when armstrong won in 2003 and 2004 during his run of six consecutive tour victories it could be very critical for the team in the pyrenees this weekend , armstrong said but what s happened has happened i'm confident we can handle the pyrenees with seven guys in support bruyneel added you need all the guys there s nobody to do his job because everybody already has a role but the most important thing is that he s safe another victim of crashes , tom boonen , the ace belgian sprinter for quick step and the leader in the points competition , also withdrew thursday he won two early stages in the tour , then had a series of falls , including one wednesday until thursday , none of the 30 french riders who started in the tour s 189man field had come close to a victory , and only moreau had finished in the top five , which he did twice so , what the french news media call moreaumania is spreading signs alongside the road not only exhort go , moreau , but also proclaim , moreau in the yellow jersey , meaning at the tour s end on july 24 in paris moreau , 34 , is in his 11th tour and has finished as high as fourth in 2000 and eighth in 2003 , raising french hopes early in the race , then dashing them he did this most notably in 1998 as a member of the festina team that was ousted for using illicit performanceenhancing drugs although moreau again carries a lot of hopes , casar , 26 , and moncouti , 30 , have supporters among the crowds many of the region s shepherds and farmers marked the national holiday but this being france , the day would not have been complete without a protest death to the wolf , announced a notice painted on the road just before the climb up the col saintjean one wolf killed , hundreds of goats saved , said a banner nearby this was the second antiwolf demonstration in three days according to leaflets distributed at the first protest , wolves are a protected species here , and a shepherd has been arrested for shooting and killing one when it eyed his flock hence the protest as moncouti might have said after his victory , vive la france
baghdad , iraq , sept 2 saboteurs shut down iraqi crude oil exports to turkey for virtually all of the past year , but the oil is flowing again after iraq s government put in place elaborate new security measures and decided to move its product in what is essentially a clandestine operation in the new export system , described over the last two weeks by officials in two stateowned oil companies , the iraqi armed forces and a deputy prime minister , officials secretly open iraq s northern pipeline to send batches of oil to turkey and then shut it down again before insurgents can attack the government has recruited , trained and equipped thousands of local tribesmen and stationed them at hundreds of new guard posts along the pipeline but disputes have already broken out within the government over who will pay the hundreds of millions of dollars it will take to continue that arrangement and expand it to cover all vulnerable points world oil prices , now just under 70 a barrel , have recently displayed strong sensitivity to fluctuating supplies , and iraq s northern oil fields , centered on the city of kirkuk , can produce close to a million barrels a day , according to estimates by the stateowned north oil company and the united states energy department oil from the northern fields also feeds crucial refineries and power plants in iraq the new system for moving that oil around relies on gradually filling up storage tanks in secure areas near kirkuk and then , at unannounced times , sending the oil in the tanks as quickly as possible through the pipelines still , as a result of the sporadic operation , a total of only five million barrels of oil flowed from the northern oil fields in august to the turkish export terminals at the mediterranean port of ceyhan , said mussab aldujayli , director general of iraq s state oil marketing organization this year iraq has exported an average of about 14 million barrels a day , mostly from its southern fields drawing on an arabic proverb , defense minister sadoun aldulaimi said the significance of the first trickle of oil from the north should not be dismissed one eye better than none , my friend , mr dulaimi said in english even in the south , power failures and other technical problems have limited exports , with serious implications for iraq s budget , which depends almost entirely on oil just before the invasion by the united states and its allies in 2003 , iraqi oil exports peaked at more than two million barrels a day , and the country s bottomless financial needs have placed enormous pressure on the rich northern fields to pick up the shortfall the north has failed to put a dent in the country s needs or to significantly affect the world market , even with the latest advances , said anne korin , director of policy and strategic planning at institute for the analysis of global security in washington , which closely follows the iraqi oil industry it s kind of like the red queen in through the looking glass , ms korin said , running like crazy just to stay in place even when you 're managing to get some flow out every once in a while , that s just not going to add up to enough the new security measures were evident during a trip along a critical stretch of pipeline between kirkuk and baiji last week in an armed convoy accompanying ahmad chalabi , the deputy prime minister whose portfolio includes energy infrastructure from baiji , 80 miles southwest of kirkuk , the export pipeline pivots north toward turkey every mile or two a handful of newly minted iraqi soldiers wearing camouflage uniforms were standing at attention next to ragged tents and huts as mr chalabi s convoy of about 30 white sport utility vehicles passed some four battalions , or more than 3 , 000 troops , were recently hired in this part of the country from local tribes and given basic military training as part of the new pipeline security program for the time being we have tents and whatever , said lt gen nasier abadi of the iraqi army , who supervises parts of the project but we are building them camps general abadi said the recruits , paid about 350 a month , were mostly drawn from sunni arab and turkmen tribes both ethnic groups have been accused of close ties with insurgent groups in this area of iraq , but the general said there had been no trouble drumming up interest in the security force since this part of the program began on july 15 lots of people would like a job that pays 350 a month , he said in another littleknown element of the initiative , the fledgling iraqi air force is flying three surveillance planes over the pipelines to scan for insurgent activity , said raoul alcala , an american who advises the defense minister on national security and works from the united states embassy in baghdad the planes , which originally came as a gift from the united arab emirates , have infrared and visiblelight cameras in their noses , and they can fly low and slow enough to actually see things , mr alcala said it s not just a blur but such initiatives do not come cheap , he said the tab just for three months of organizing , training and equipping the first four battalions will come to 35 million , he said if the initial phase is successful , he said , it will be expanded so that 15 , 000 new troops will guard pipelines across northern iraq , all the way south to baghdad and north to the turkish border that would be in addition to 30 , 000 men who are already guarding specific installations like power plants and oil wells , though not very effectively mr dulaimi , the defense minister , estimated that just the program to add the new troops would cost 375 million , and he added that it was unclear whether the defense ministry or the oil ministry would pay for it all so far , mr dulaimi said , we asked the oil ministry to support our budget , and the oil ministry just paid four battalions the oil minister was not on this trip and was unavailable for comment , but muhsin shlash , the electricity minister , did come along during a long stop for gas , mr shlash said that because the oil and electricity infrastructures were so intertwined , and because hightension lines often ran parallel to pipelines , a joint protection plan was being explored he pointed out that during the previous weekend , for example , coordinated sabotage attacks on power lines around baghdad had produced a nationwide blackout that had temporarily stopped all oil exports , including those in the south in addition to all of the other thousands of security troops looking after iraq s infrastructure , the electricity ministry employs 10 , 000 guards , mr shlash said but how effective they are , i'm not convinced , he added clearly relishing the trip through what often amounted to rebelheld territory , mr chalabi repeatedly said that because the oil generated so much revenue , financing for the new troops and surveillance efforts would be forthcoming mr chalabi particularly seemed to enjoy a boris yeltsinlike moment when he clambered up next to a big tripodmounted machine gun on the bed of a white chevy silverado pickup to survey a grassy area near a stretch of pipeline that had been the target of a mortar attack on aug 9 the shells fell harmlessly and the insurgents retreated , the local officers in charge said attacks have been reduced dramatically since you took over , mr chalabi said , standing in the back of the silverado we congratulate you but perhaps the most telling moment came at another stop , where he was surrounded by a crowd of soldiers who said they had not been paid their salaries in three months send me your names , mr chalabi said , promising that they would be paid
east rutherford , nj , dec 11 it was a grim tableau from a shattered season chad pennington , in his green sweatsuit , standing to one side of coach herman edwards as the national anthem was being sung curtis martin , dressed in street clothes , a black cap pulled low , stood to the other side the jets finally won again sunday at the meadowlands , beating the raiders , 2610 , for their first victory in more than two months but in a season that has robbed the jets \( 310 \) of two quarterbacks , their center , a linebacker and an iconic receiver , this was the final painful but achingly fitting blow martin , who had not missed a game since 1998 , succumbed to a knee injury he sustained in the second week of the season it was a testament to the depth of pain martin has endured this season that he finally made the decision to sit , ending a streak of 126 consecutive starts that included the postseason and a chance to be the first nfl player to gain at least 1 , 000 yards in each of his first 11 seasons but early last week , the pain prompted a visit to the coach s office herm said 'curtis , just for us to be having this conversation , it must be a very bad situation there is no way you 'd be sitting in herman edwards s office if this was n't drastic , ' martin said sunday afternoon it was yesterday , i felt like there was probably no way we 're going to be able to do it we got up this morning and said no if the raiders had said , 'curtis , we 're not going to tackle you' and gave me the ball on the 1yard line and let me run 99 yards , i do n't even think i 'd have been able to get it in each offseason , martin submits himself to savage workouts , to prepare his body for the inevitable punishment martin once played through a season with two severely sprained ankles he played through another even though a ligament was tearing away from the bone in his buttocks he played two consecutive seasons with torn knee ligaments that did not slow him martin prides himself in knowing how to position his body to avoid the blunt force of most blows he does not take so much as an aspirin to handle the pain of playing football and he hates needles so much that trainers have to hunt him down when he has to give blood but after he needed a painkilling shot before the game against new england last week , he knew his time had come the last time he had taken a shot before a game was for his first as a jet , in 1998 before the game sunday , martin found himself wandering through the locker room with little purpose he saw defensive end john abraham in the training room , and abraham told him that it did not look right , martin in street clothes on the sideline , martin looked around at a halfempty stadium and sat next to the rookie running back cedric houston , who started in his place martin said it was one of the weirdest feelings he had had in the nfl , but that was far from the only weird aspect to this game the jets held the raiders \( 410 \) to just 179 yards , despite the former jets running back lamont jordan wanting desperately to perform well and the jets ran for 184 yards , 74 of them by houston and 56 by quarterback brooks bollinger , though none , of course , by martin , a future hall of famer who needed 265 yards to reach 1 , 000 this season martin has said there are three things he never wants to play for records , money and fame , although he did say last week that the consecutive1 , 000yardseasons record would have been special edwards said the mutual decision to shut martin down was a painful one , coming as it did so close to a milestone that would have edged him past barry sanders for consecutive 1 , 000yard seasons from the start of a career and tied him with emmitt smith over all he s done enough for this team and done enough for the national football league , edwards said later , in a quiet moment in the locker room , edwards added , two hundred sixtyfive yards it breaks my heart so much about this season has been heartbreaking for the jets if martin and the backup quarterback jay fiedler , who had arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder last friday , are placed on injured reserve , the jets would have 12 players on injured reserve who have had seasonending operations that list does not include receiver wayne chrebet , who was put on injured reserve after sustaining a concussion and whose career is probably over all of those injuries mean the franchise faces offseason decisions that will shape its future now , the jets will have to consider martin s future , too he will be 33 next season , well past the prime for most running backs he will most likely be asked to restructure his contract it is even possible that martin has played his final game as the jets' feature back the victory sunday almost certainly derailed any chance the jets may have had to draft reggie bush , the heisman trophywinning running back from southern california , to be a potential successor to martin the houston texans , with one victory , will probably get the first pick this victory may have been a mixed blessing for jets fans but in a jubilant locker room , it was anything but i appreciate jets fans i understand why they like to say reggie bush , offensive lineman pete kendall said as players , we 're auditioning 16 games a season a season like this , there tends to be quite a bit of turnover i'm not playing to lose so we 'll be a better team next year they will surely not be a better team now , with martin gone and three games to go curtis is a special player in the history of this league , kendall said but like everybody else , we all are replaceable parts you do n't necessarily get equal value but the beat goes on we 've had to replace a whole bunch of people at some point , everybody gets injured or at least it seems that way for the jets this season
like many entrepreneurs in the united states , charlie mello dreamed of selling his wares in china and like most , he once viewed the challenges as somewhere between daunting and insurmountable how could a company like his american custom coach , with 22 employees and sales in the singledigit millions , master all the trade regulations and other red tape , overcome the language barriers and navigate an unfamiliar legal system and cultural environment \? but mr mello discovered that breaking into the vast chinese market was not just for general electric and goldman sachs it helps if you have an unusual product , and american custom coach , based in ontario , calif , does it makes mobile clinics , emergencyresponse trucks , mobile command centers and other custom vehicles but the key to making inroads into china is exploiting all the help that is yours for the asking , courtesy of federal , state and local governments in the united states eager to promote exports and economic growth on a trade mission to china in november organized by the city of ontario and the inland empire economic partnership , mr mello met numerous contacts and is now manufacturing a mobile crimescene laboratory for the hong kong police department the vehicle s price tag is 115 , 000 he is also negotiating two other contracts in china , worth a potential 700 , 000 while many dismiss government trade missions as costly excuses to visit the great wall of china and other tourist sites , without them many small businesses with promising products might never have the resources to expand into international markets although mr mello made contact with the hong kong police department independently , he said he would not have sealed the deal there or discovered further opportunities in china if it had not been for the trade mission i 'd been contacting chinese businesses and chinese officials for quite some time , he said and i 've been contacted by chinese companies but there was never enough strong incentive to take the time away from my business to go there and i was hoping that i could just make a deal over the phone he could n't in china , as in most countries , relationships need to be cultivated with china s trade surplus with the united states ballooning to 162 billion last year , government officials are doing what they can to promote exports to china , especially by the smallbusiness sector , which lacks the resources to handle the job alone the commerce department has 115 staff members in five china cities , its largest overseas mission , said scott dunaway , a department spokesman both the commerce department and the small business administration offer advice and potential opportunities for small businesses on their web sites on the local level , most states and many cities have their own programs to promote trade with china gov arnold schwarzenegger of california has scheduled a sixday trade mission to china later this year , for example in new york , groups like the new york state small business development center offer information for expanding into china in new york city , the office of the mayor lists seminars about china and other countries on its web site brian mcgowan , ontario s economic development manager , said the november trade mission had resulted in more than 100 meetings leading to more than 20 million in contracts under negotiation both the american entrepreneurs and the chinese business executives and government officials with whom they met were asked by the organizers of the mission to fill out detailed questionnaires beforehand to make sure the right people connected it s like online dating , but only for business , mr mcgowan said mr mello is a mechanical engineer with a degree in international marketing he started american custom coach out of frustration at the reluctance of his previous employer , a bus manufacturer , to expand abroad while working at his former job , he helped a friend on nights and weekends to design and build the bus used in the movie speed that experience inspired him to break out on his own to build custommade buses and other vehicles for a world market he started the business in 1997 , selling just four vehicles the first year last year , he sold 32 at prices ranging from 120 , 000 to 500 , 000 , while the brazilianborn mr mello is fluent in five languages , chinese is not one of them but he has learned a few words in chinese and hopes to study the language to help him communicate with potential customers in china china s a very big market , and in my line of business we create opportunities , we do n't wait for it to happen , he said , adding that the 2008 olympic games in beijing could lead to new sales millions of people will be traveling during the olympics and the government will need to have their hands on security so that s why i'm looking ahead mr mello said there had been interest from china in both his security vehicles and the mobile clinics , which he hoped the government would use to serve rural areas with no hospitals even so , he does n't underestimate the obstacles he faces in china , it is difficult , he said it s a very unique culture and it s very closed you really have to gain their confidence first even then , he said , chinese businesses sometimes inflate numbers and overstate their intentions chinese entrepreneurs , he said , tend to put on exaggerated displays of enthusiasm and say they plan to buy 10 or 20 vehicles , when really they might buy one or none i do n't know , maybe the chinese are too optimistic , he said but some experts say they think american entrepreneurs are the ones that are too optimistic about china tarun khanna , an international business specialist from harvard business school , said a herd mentality sometimes developed among american businesses when it came to china there s an element of 'everybody s doing this so we should do it , ' mr khanna said i think that degree of enthusiasm is laudable but unwarranted at the very least , small businesses should explore opportunities in other booming economies , like brazil or india , he said , which are less likely to show favoritism toward big multinationals the way china does small companies often do n't have the resources to roll with the punches if something goes wrong in china , he said and much can go wrong chinese companies follow dismal accounting standards , disclose little about their finances , have few if any builtin controls over the way they are managed and are not bound by a westernstyle legal system , he said none of that discourages mr mello he plans to return to china in september , timing his trip with the delivery of the crimescene laboratory to the hong kong police he hopes the vehicle will attract other clients

this month , if all goes according to plan , two very different impulses roiling inside of black hollywood will have met in the middle of the summer movie season with the release of 20th century fox s fanatastic four this weekend , tim story becomes one of the few africanamericans \( joining john singleton with 2 fast 2 furious , antoine fuqua with king arthur , and keenen ivory wayans with scary movie , for instance \) to direct a major studio popcorn film mr story , best known for his breakthrough movie barbershop , has thus made his mark as a major league director who only happens to be black two weeks later , a largely black cast and producing team working with the white writerdirector craig brewer will deliver hustle flow , a hiphop inspired picture from paramount classics and mtv films the movie is intent on turning its portrayal of a distinctly africanamerican popcultural icon the actor terrence howard s sympathetic pimp who dreams of the rap life into a broadly appealing story of human redemption both films share a fierce determination by their africanamerican principals to reach the mainstream audience , albeit by different strategies mr story s challenge does n't hinge on race he has to find something for everyman in the travails of his marvel comics heroes hustle flow , meanwhile , gives viewers a pass to the ghetto , to show that all the world shares its tragedies and triumphs as it happens , neither mr story nor the hustle flow team found it easy to crack a system where black talent , despite some enormous successes , is still finding barriers to be overcome yet their movies have arrived in the middle of a year that may someday be seen as at least a minor watershed in hollywood s long struggle with matters of race in february , jamie foxx \( in ray \) and morgan freeman \( in million dollar baby \) won oscars as their fellow black actors don cheadle and sophie okonedo joined them in picking up a record five academy award nominations the showing came as a startling string of boxoffice successes , as black actors rode \( or drove \) one picture after another to the no 1 spot in the early weeks of the year tyler perry did it hustle flow style , by making his lowbudget , overtly black diary of a mad black woman a crosscultural hit for lions gate , with over 50 million in domestic ticket sales it competed with sony pictures' hitch , in which will smith put aside racial stereotyping to play his first comicromantic lead \( following the colorblind impulse , and a trail blazed by denzel washington with dramas like the siege and the manchurian candidate \) , to score over 177 million at the domestic box office it was also up against are we there yet \? , with ice cube guess who \? , with bernie mac and coach carter , with samuel l jackson all of which were solid performers , and all , remarkably , playing theaters at the same time i do think the tide is turning , said john ridley , an africanamerican filmmaker who is writing and producing a barbershop television series for showtime networks things are definitely moving forward people look at hollywood and say , 'i wish it was changing here or there' but if i 'd come in the business 10 years earlier , i would n't be where i am today in interviews , black filmmakers and actors and those who work with them echoed that sense of progress , pointing especially to evidence that white audiences spurred by the 20yearold hiphop revolution are going to films that might once have been seen as an africanamerican preserve sony pictures , for instance , found the audience for are we there yet \? its star once best known for the brutal harshness of his gangsta rap with nwa was 43 percent white , 26 percent black and 18 percent hispanic music is always the first crossover medium , said david gale , executive vice president of mtv films , which is releasing hustle and flow hiphop is universal right now , or more universal right now than rock , and that s a big foundation for mtv in film , we just get the benefit still , several key africanamerican players cautioned that hollywood largely run by white agents and executives had yet to find its comfort zone with black talent and black themes i do n't think much has changed for black films , said jeff friday , who runs film life inc , a small distributor specializing in blackthemed movies they still think that we 're monolithic , and mostly the films are limited to urban themes and comedy don cheadle just got his first big lead role this year hollywood is risk averse , and i do think it s more economics than it is race but here s the thing about the economics piece when a black movie goes outside the box and does well , hollywood does n't follow up on it in the case of mr story , a 35year old los angeles native once known mainly as a director of music videos , fox actually did follow up on his success with mgm s barbershop by backing his taxi with queen latifah and the studio went the next step by assigning him fantastic four despite weak reviews for taxi and its modest boxoffice performance but he felt that , as a black director seeking a mainstream assignment , he could n't afford any weak spots i knew that if i got my chance , i would be better prepared than anybody out there , mr story said he added , it took a while for the implications to sink in a few people called me about the black thing and said 'this is major you 're a black director on fantastic four ' but all i was thinking was 'i just do n't want to screw up' but then people were like , 'if you screw this up , we all got a problem , ' and i said , 'oh , man , i got that on me now \? ' if mr story felt extra pressure in undertaking fantastic four , those behind hustle flow still found hollywood surprisingly slow on the uptake when asked to translate rap iconography to film stephanie allain , who helped produce boyz n the hood while an executive at columbia in 1991 , struck out repeatedly when pitching hustle to studios that were n't ready to accept a pimp a stock urban character who through rap has become a familiar of the mtv generation as a hero can he be a mailman \? can he be a ups driver \? , ms allain recalled being asked can he do anything but the lowest of the low \? there was this pc thing going on she joined forces with mr singleton and financed the film independently , then sold the completed picture to paramount classics after screening it at the sundance film festival earlier this year set for release on july 22 , it will forcefully test ms allain s theory that a substantial audience , having already embraced the harshest aspects of street culture in music , will now do so in film , provided the story s moral remains clear if a lowdown , dirty pimp can be redeemed , so can we some say the challenge in universalizing such projects may largely be one of marketing in making barbershop a crossover hit with 75 million in domestic ticket sales despite its cozy , insider s sense of black neighborhood life , mgm , at the urging of the producers robert teitel and george tillman jr , promoted the film well beyond the usual boundaries of black radio , bet and billboards on assorted martin luther king boulevards offhand , i would say our movie was about 60 40 blackwhite , said mr tillman they said they believed in 'barbershop' like any other film in tapping black experience for the broad audience , both barbershop and hustle flow have clearly pursued the promise of boyz n the hood , which 14 years ago proved the potential in a ghettobased drama with a solid 57 million in domestic ticket sales and jumpstarted the film careers of not just mr singleton , but also of ice cube , cuba gooding jr , morris chestnut and nia long yet hollywood quickly veered toward the somewhat harsher visions of pictures like the hughes brothers' menace ii society and dead presidents , which to many lacked the compassion and broad humanity that underlay mr singleton s debut film only lately , has it seemed to rediscover the potential commercial power in simple black morality tales like drumline , a low budget picture about a black high school marching band that two years ago took in 56 million for fox , or you got served , an inexpensive amalgam of clich and hiphop dance scenes that had 40 million in ticket sales for sony last year as such pictures complete their circle and mr smith , in colorblind studio fare , commands grosses to rival those of eddie murphy at his peak at least one major sore spot still remains in black hollywood its women none of the big hits anchored by africanamericans this year were carried by women the one major candidate was beauty shop , which starred queen latifah and , notwithstanding her muchlauded performance in chicago , brought in 36 million dollars at the domestic box office around half what the original barbershop and its sequel each did after halle berry does her films and latifah does her films , it s left to all the black , latino and asian actresses to fight over a couple of roles , said gabrielle union , who played alice kramden in paramount s poorly received blackthemed adaptation of the honeymooners this year i opted for some tv there just not a ton of work in film by early next year , even that may begin to change , as ms berry , putting catwoman behind her , returns in her third showing as storm in fox s xmen franchise , and beyonc knowles arrives as a fullblown lead in the director bill condon s adaptation of the broadway musical dreamgirls for dreamworks skg yet progress is n't victory indeed , mr gale of mtv warned that viewers tend still tend to polarize along racial lines if not encouraged to see common ground in a film there s still a lot of segregation among movie audiences , but the younger audience is more open , he said meanwhile , mr friday of film life cautioned that success and acceptance are n't quite the same , either and that the second may still be several beats behind the first we ate at the table this year , he said but we ca n't afford to get comfortable film correction july 17 , 2005 , sunday because of an editing error , an article last sunday about recent successes by africanamerican filmmakers and actors referred incorrectly to the plot of the 2002 film drumline it is about a black college marching band , not high school a frontpage picture with the article carried an incorrect credit from a publicist the picture , of terrence howard in the coming film hustle flow , was by john singleton and was supplied by paramount classics and mtv films
just about everyone in medicine agrees that a patient who shows up in the emergency room with a heart attack should be given aspirin that simple treatment has been proved to cut death rates by nearly a quarter but dozens of patients at hospitals in connecticut do n't get that aspirin , or nine other crucial therapies for heart attack , heart failure and pneumonia , a review of recently published hospital data shows some hospitals are better than others , but none delivered all the treatments to eligible patients , in spite of their wellknown benefit last month , the new england journal of medicine reported that , although their performance had improved somewhat from 2002 to 2004 , hospitals across the country were neglecting many lifesaving treatments the journal also reported on another study that found that hospitals around boston and oklahoma city performed better than those in other large regions , but that even in those places hundreds of patients did not receive basic therapies a review of the data by the new york times showed that hospitals in connecticut tended to perform better as a group than those in new york , but not as well as hospitals in massachusetts eight of connecticut s 31 hospitals were in the top 10 percent in the country for at least one of the conditions over all , connecticut hospitals delivered appropriate treatment to heart attack victims 94 percent of the time , to heart failure patients 89 percent of the time and to pneumonia patients 79 percent of the time , all better than manhattan hospitals only five manhattan hospitals were in the top 10 percent the hospital performance data are collected by the federal department of health and human services under a program called hospital compare and cover 10 treatments considered essential for most patients they include admissions from january to june 2004 detailed information is online at www hospitalcompare hhs gov we really should be close to 100 percent on all of these measures , said dr ashish jha , a boston doctor and author of one of the national studies published last month there s not much controversy about whether giving antibiotics to someone who has pneumonia is good or not besides aspirin for heart attack and antibiotics for pneumonia , the measures include beta blockers for heart attack , angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors for heart failure and heart attack , and vaccinations for pneumonia heart attack is an acute episode , usually requiring an emergency room visit , caused by constriction of flow in a coronary artery heart failure is a chronic condition , essentially the wearing out of the heart muscle to the point that it cannot pump enough blood connecticut hospitals performed better as a group than those in most states , but they also had a head start the state required hospitals to report their performance on these measures in 2003 , six months before the federal program started that has helped boost compliance , hospital officials said what is measured improves , and what is n't measured does n't improve , said ken roberts , spokesman for the connecticut hospital association it s an incentive providers do n't want to be at 85 percent when their neighbors are higher in spite of the head start , some hospitals still lagged midstate medical center in meriden was below the national median for all three conditions we think they 're fair measures , and they represent what was happening at that time , said barbara kaplowe , director of quality improvement at midstate we think we 're doing much better now ms kaplowe said the hospital had discovered that treatments , or the reasons for not giving them , were not being written in the charts we have this information available , and we go to the medical staff and present it to them , she said when they review them she said , we find sometimes it s not treatment issues , it s documentation but authorities said failing to document is also a quality issue if there are lifesaving treatments the patients have received and you do n't document it in the chart , that s a failure as well , dr jha said if i'm treating the patient later , and i have no idea they received an important treatment , or did n't receive it for a reason , that s not good at day kimball hospital in putnam , heart attack patients did not receive appropriate treatments 13 percent of the time , the highest in the state dr ann errichetti , the hospital s president , said the numbers were improving the proportion was 25 percent when the state first started to gather information in the third quarter of 2003 it is n't as simple as giving an order to doctors , you have to get physicians to partner with you , she said we have made progress and we 're moving in the right direction , but we 're not done hospitals that performed well found they had to acknowledge there were multiple opportunities for even welltrained , wellintentioned people to allow important things to fall through the cracks on average , for a general admission , 60 people touch a patient , and most of these with a high degree of independence , said dr steven strongwater , the director of john dempsey hospital in farmington the system has to acknowledge that , even with the best of intentions , when someone writes an order , it might not happen in the way the order was written at john dempsey hospital , a teaching hospital that is part of the university of connecticut health center , administrators have used a combination of checklists and what the hospital calls patient safety rounds to bring their failure rates down , nearly to zero for heart patients the hospital ranks in the top 10 percent in the country in delivering treatments both to heart attack and heart failure patients dr strongwater said everyone was trying to improve performance it s a question of how vigorously they 're doing it , he said the measures cover a narrow band of the range of care the hospitals deliver , and connecticut hospital officials stressed that there were many other ways to judge hospital quality dr jha s study showed that a hospital that did well treating one of the conditions did not necessarily do well treating another , so a hospital s overall quality would be better judged by a wider range of measures but , he said , these are common ailments , and the treatments are widely acknowledged to be necessary and crucial these are the bread and butter of medicine , dr jha said we know a tremendous amount about how to take care of these people we know that if you walk in with a heart attack and i give you an aspirin , your chances of surviving have improved dramatically and connecticut hospital officials said the measures can be good indicators of a hospital s quality if a hospital is at 100 percent on all the measures , that s not going to guarantee you a perfect outcome , but it s a pretty good indicator of their overall approach to care , said mr roberts of the connecticut hospital association i would n't base my decision solely on these measures , but i would look to them if i was to choose a hospital dr jha agreed that patients should use the ratings to choose hospitals they can say , 'i am not going to hospital x and instead go to hospital y , ' he said if circumstances make it hard to go to another hospital , he said , they can ask their doctors and nurses and administrators , 'why are we not doing better \? '
chicago todd a smith is one of the nation s leading medical malpractice lawyers , renowned and feared in the courtroom , having extracted a lengthy string of multimilliondollar settlements and verdicts from doctors , hospitals and insurers over the years though wealthy even by the standards of his profession , mr smith , 55 , seems to have lost none of the intensity and passion that fuel his 12 to 14hour workdays and make him a persuasive trial lawyer seated in his law firm s conference room , with an olympian view high above lake michigan , mr smith recited the details of his first courtroom victory in the summer of 1977 , when he was a 12 , 000ayear assistant public defender in the cook county criminal courts the defendant , he recalled , was an american indian who was accused of armed robbery in a case that was based mainly on his race the man was identified as the robber , for example , in a lineup that included him and a collection of offduty , white police officers it was terribly unfair , mr smith said what drives mr smith now , he says , is what drove him then a desire to seek justice for people who need it , whether criminal defendants too poor to hire lawyers or victims of medical lapses whose lives have been ruined and face huge bills for care you can make a significant contribution to someone s life , someone who might be in desperate straits , he explained that s as rewarding as it gets for me it s not really , or mostly , about money the bush administration wants to make mr smith s profession far less financially rewarding medical malpractice lawyers are cast as the marquee villains in the administration s war against what it regards as a litigious culture run amok if there were a face in the bull seye in this political battle , it would be mr smith s he is not only a bigname medical malpractice lawyer , but he is also serving this year as the president of the association of trial lawyers of america , the principal advocacy and lobbying group for trial lawyers and within conservative circles and inside the white house , the term trial lawyer is an epithet this month , the administration won the first round in its fight to curb litigation , as congress passed legislation to sharply restrict classaction lawsuits against companies next up is medical malpractice in his reelection campaign , mr bush repeatedly decried junk lawsuits as the bane of the nation s doctors the issue was deftly framed , and the subtext was clear greedy lawyers were attacking the marcus welbys of america , good doctors doing their best in a speech last month in illinois , mr bush again called for strict limits on medical malpractice suits , including a hard cap of 250 , 000 on what patients could recover for noneconomic damages like physical and emotional pain and suffering returning to his electionyear themes , mr bush said doctors should be focused on fighting illnesses , not fighting lawsuits we need to fix a broken medical liability system , he said , and he called on congress to act this year this month , a medical litigation overhaul bill , mirroring the administration s proposals , was introduced in the senate by two republican senators , john ensign of nevada and judd gregg of new hampshire the medical liability system , health care analysts agree , is deeply flawed but they also generally agree that the solution offered by the administration and the republican congress putting a ceiling on damages addresses only one aspect of the problem medical liability policy , said dr william m sage , a physician and a law professor at columbia university , should seek three goals restraining overall costs , compensating the victims of medical mistakes and providing incentives for doctors and hospitals to reduce medical errors there is a strong consensus among people who have really studied the issue that caps on damages would tend to keep costs down and make liability insurance more affordable for doctors , dr sage said and there is a universal consensus that caps would do absolutely nothing to reduce medical errors or to compensate injured patients if anything , caps on damages would make those problems worse medical malpractice laws vary state by state but california offers a glimpse of a future preferred by the administration and many republicans in congress in 1975 , california passed the medical injury compensation reform act , which included a cap of 250 , 000 for damages like pain and suffering in malpractice cases it did not limit economic damages for things like the cost of continuing care for a person disabled or wages lost because of medical errors the law also curbed attorneys' fees on a sliding scale that prohibited them from collecting more than 15 percent on award amounts over 600 , 000 , with higher percentages for the amounts below that sum \( in states without limits on fees , contingency payments to malpractice lawyers are typically about onethird of awards \) research varies on the likely impact of curbs on awards and fees , but a rand corporation study last year concluded that the california law had reduced the net recoveries for plaintiffs by 15 percent and had cut attorneys' fees by far more , an estimated 60 percent defendant liabilities , it calculated , were trimmed 30 percent because of the law california malpractice lawyers say the law also discourages them from taking wrongfuldeath cases if the victims are children or retirees those groups have no economic value by the cold logic of the courtroom because they are not earning salaries , so the maximum award would be 250 , 000 complex cases , which often require many expert witnesses and years of research , can cost that much to bring to trial linda fermoyle rice , a medical malpractice lawyer in woodland hills , calif , said she recently told the family of a 14yearold boy who died unexpectedly in a hospital apparently from medical negligence , ms rice said that she could not afford to pursue the case the law has made it impossible for many victims to get access to the court , she said even plaintiffs who get to court often come away emptyhanded nationally , defendants prevail in nearly 80 percent of the medical malpractice cases that go to trial many malpractice suits , legal analysts say , are filed by personalinjury lawyers , accustomed to handling simpler cases like those involving auto accidents , but not as experienced in medical negligence work in a 2002 survey by the trial lawyers association , only 11 percent of its 60 , 000 members said medical malpractice was their primary area of practice 40 percent replied that medical negligence cases were some part of their practice mr smith , a partner at power , rogers smith in chicago , resides at the top of the medical malpractice mountain he does some aviation litigation , but medical negligence claims account for 70 percent of his cases in the last 17 years , he has won more than 300 million in verdicts and settlements for clients contingency fees collected by his firm would typically be 20 percent of the total , a limit set by illinois state law on all awards over 1 million so how much does he earn \? far less than you might expect , mr smith replied his firm employs 11 lawyers six working on medical malpractice cases , the remainder focusing on other personalinjury claims it also employs four nurses as fulltime researchers complex cases can require reams of expert testimony , years of investigation and hundreds of thousands of dollars to prepare medical malpractice lawsuits are custom work , focusing on one victim at a time , as opposed to large class actions against an entire industry , like the 246 billion tobacco settlement that trial lawyers helped 46 states win in 1998 there are no hourly fees and no wellheeled corporate clients paying for expenses trial lawyers are the venture capitalists of the legal system , putting their money on the line and taking upfront risk the occasional big paydays cover the daily expenses for all the costs , there is still plenty left over for mr smith he wo n't say precisely , but he concedes that his yearly income is routinely in the high six figures , and seven figures in good years , which appear to have been plentiful recently that would put him on a par with partners at leading corporate law firms at one time , corporate law would have seemed the natural choice for mr smith in 1973 , he was a freshly minted mba from northwestern university s graduate school of business , now called the kellogg school of management , and most of his job offers were from banks in the chicago area but he says he balked at what struck him as an anonymous career within the crowded managerial ranks of a big bank he became intrigued by the law and enrolled at the loyola university law school while there , he started working for the public defender s office in that office , mr smith got his first taste of trial work , and he vividly described the thrill of standing in the huge courtrooms of the cook county criminal court and the exhilaration of presenting cases it was real life , and the outcome really mattered to people s lives , he said the most skilled trial lawyers , legal professionals agree , truly savor the theater of the courtroom , the adrenaline rush of verbal combat , the onthefly decisions made in crossexamination and the challenge of winning over an audience in the end , it all depends on the judgment of 12 people , mr smith noted but medical malpractice work requires more than a deft touch in court according to colleagues and courtroom adversaries , mr smith combines a relentless work ethic needed to absorb the arcane details of medical science and an underlying belief that his clients are victims who have suffered grave injustices the best plaintiffs lawyers in this field , like todd smith , almost have a crusader mentality , said brian c fetzer , a leading malpractice defense lawyer in chicago , who has represented physicians , hospitals and insurers in cases against mr smith for more than 20 years they are true believers joseph w balesteri , a lawyer who joined power , rogers smith in 2000 , after five years working the defense side of medical negligence cases , said of his colleague todd gets into the medicine he wears his emotions on his sleeve , and listening to him you really see that he believes what he says it s a credibility that is felt by the jury mr smith says his success rate is higher than 80 percent including jury verdicts and settlements far higher than the national average for medical malpractice plaintiffs' lawyers being picky in his selection of cases helps explain the high winning percentage he says he decides to take fewer than 3 in 100 cases that are brought to his firm we say to people right off that a bad outcome does not mean you have a medical negligence case , he said the plaintiffs' lawyer must argue that a doctor or hospital failed to meet the profession s acknowledged standard of care for a certain operation , test or treatment , and , more important , must be able to prove it cases worth pursuing , mr smith said , are typically ones in which the victim has suffered a major injury that results in continuing pain , suffering and disability brain damage , loss of a limb and facial disfigurement , he noted , are good candidates at his firm , potential cases go through rigorous screening that can take months and cost costs tens of thousands of dollars the victim s medical records are collected after receiving the authorization of the patient or family those records are reviewed , and one of the firm s nurseresearchers assesses the care that the patient received next , the case is sent to a consulting specialist often more than one if the case still seems promising , the accumulated information is sent to a physician who determines whether the care was negligent enough to write a certificate of merit , required in illinois and some other states , to be presented to the court in his speeches , bush makes it sound as if every lawsuit that is brought is junk or frivolous , mr smith said but we do everything we can to weed out cases that are without merit we have to our own money is at risk the work , time , risk and potential rewards in complex malpractice suits are illustrated by a 20 million settlement mr smith won last june the origins of the case go back to 1997 , when huong nguyen , then a 19yearold sophomore at the university of illinois at chicago , was experiencing shortness of breath doing ordinary things like climbing stairs she was diagnosed as having a faulty mitral valve , a pair of triangular flaps that regulate blood flow between two of the heart s chambers the valve had to be repaired or replaced the surgery lasted more than eight hours , though the procedure usually takes about half that long , mr smith said the next morning , ms nguyen could squeeze her right hand , but she was otherwise paralyzed and could not speak she had suffered severe brain damage a lawyer referred the family to mr smith , who began investigating after an initial screening by mr smith s firm , the family filed suit against the surgeon , dr bradley s allen over the next several years , in preparation for trial , the law firm spent 375 , 000 , much of it for the work of specialists like a cardiothoracic surgeon , neurologists , economists and a forensic videographer mr smith contended that dr allen did not properly remove air from the patient s heart during the procedure and that the resulting air embolus caused brain damage dr allen s lawyer , kevin t martin , said ms nguyen s resulting disability was a risk in this kind of surgery and very unfortunate , but not a medical error the surgery had been videotaped , but when a court ordered dr allen to produce the tape , there was a lengthy gap that included brief segments of television commercials had the case gone to trial , mr smith would have contended that the defendant tampered with evidence , an assertion denied by mr martin , who said the gap in the tape had resulted from a mechanical malfunction ms nguyen is unable to move her arms or legs and cannot sit up or speak on her own she communicates by tapping her right forefinger on a special keyboard she suffers from depression and seizures but is cognitively intact she is totally aware of her desperate straits , mr smith said this is as bad as it gets and she knows it mr smith s economists estimated that lifetime care for her would cost up to 20 million the settlement talks , mr smith said , began a few months before the trial was scheduled to start , with the defense offers starting at 5 million and the nguyen family deciding to settle at 20 million it was entirely the family s decision , mr smith said i think we could have gotten more in trial indeed , the risk for the defense , legal analysts say , is that the pain and suffering damages in such a heartwrenching case , handled by a skillful medical malpractice lawyer like mr smith , could lift the total award far higher there would n't have been a dry eye in the house if ms nguyen s case went to trial , said mr martin , the surgeon s lawyer , who estimated that a jury award could have gone up to 100 million in settlements , defendants make no admission of guilt and typically try to add confidentiality agreements to the deal mr smith s firm , as a matter of policy , does not sign such agreements in big malpractice cases , the administration s proposed cap of 250 , 000 for pain and suffering would change the terms of trade in settlement talks in the case of ms nguyen , for example , there were sizable economic costs for the care of the disabled patient though the defense would surely have argued that they were less than 20 million but it is the prospect of unknown , and potentially astronomic , damages in a trial that can give plaintiffs a powerful hand in settlement negotiations to mr smith , the administration s battle against medical malpractice lawyers is simple to explain it s about politics and money it s not really about health care , he said if you want to address the medical malpractice crisis in this country , do something about the medical errors that s the real problem the quality of medicine across the country is uneven , analysts agree , and that represents a huge problem medical errors are estimated to be responsible for 45 , 000 to 98 , 000 deaths a year more than those caused by breast cancer , aids or motor vehicle accidents , according to the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences so mr smith has a point but improving the quality of health care raises a separate set of complex issues about incentives for improvement , investment in information technology and changes in the culture of medicine pointing the finger elsewhere will not get mr smith and his fellow lawyers off the political hook there have been calls to overhaul medical malpractice before but this time the white house , doctors , insurers and other business interests , who see curbs on malpractice suits as one step in reducing their health costs , are pushing hard together the champions of tort reform are spending heavily last year , the institute for legal reform , an affiliate of the chamber of commerce , and the american medical association , the physicians' advocacy group , spent a total of 338 million on lobbying , according to politicalmoneyline , which tracks federal lobbying the trial lawyers' association spent 29 million on federal lobbying , politicalmoneyline reported we 're outgunned financially , and we 're being targeted because we have supported candidates who support americans' rights to access to a jury trial , mr smith said he has done his part in the 20032004 campaign cycle , he contributed just under 100 , 000 , nearly all of it to democrats and democratic political action committees , according to the center for responsive politics , a nonpartisan group yet even if the bush administration prevails and malpractice awards are curbed , the impact on mr smith will

artie shaw i once heard bob weir of the grateful dead insist , a little defensively , that great artists do n't retire he s almost right , of course the clarinetist artie shaw , who died on dec 30 at the age of 94 , quit bandleading in 1954 at the top of his game in his life he did many things created robust americana with bigband hits like begin the beguine and frenesi experimented with pianoless

retrospective that shaw himself conceived in 2001 if copies still exist , search for the last recordings rare and unreleased , an outofprint twocd set , on the musicmasters label \) including hank

jazz all the time , but do n't , really two tracks in particular , yesterdays and bewitched , bothered and bewildered , played quietly , are works of supreme insight , as much hank jones s perfect moments as shaw s only someone who had made art at this level could dismiss jazz after 1954 , as shaw once did , as esoteric and hatefilled denys baptiste over the last five years , this english tenor saxophonist has been working in london , making records and becoming an imposing figure in his local jazz scene because there s so little audience for english jazz here , neither he nor his records

ambitious piece of work for a 12piece band , and a good way to come upon an entire circle of players from a scene american jazz enthusiasts do n't know as well as they should manuel \( guajiro \) mirabal there have been many tributes to arsenio rodriguez , the bandleader who played the cuban tres \( a guitarlike instrument \) and turned around modern afrocuban music before his death in 1970 rodriguez favored deeperpitched drum sounds , a strong brass section and much more collective jamming after the melodic opening statement he was also a master improviser , and his solo breaks were cantankerous , brilliant things mr mirabal , the trumpeter , had a glorious career in latin music before he became more visible as part of the buena vista social club band this tribute to rodriguez is his first solo album it s a logical move rodriguez is the god of the music mr mirabal has played all his life i find it lovely , but it s a touch selfdefeating here are new versions , with oldsounding production values , of old tunes rodriguez performed i'm impressed by the elegant power of the rhythm section in el rinc n caliente and chicharronero , the powerful singing by carlos calunga , among the album s other vocalists , and mr mirabal s trumpet playing , in the old , dramatic , highnote style of felix chappot n \( papi oviedo is the tres player standing in for rodriguez \) but casual listeners must be made aware that some of these songs were nailed down in rodriguez s own time without room for improvement para bailar el montuno , for example , was recorded by rodriguez s conjunto in 1967 it s a jolting , deeply swinging performance that survives as a sharp and clear recording \( find it on cuban counterpoint history of the son montuno , a great compilation from rounder \) if

and true to the chicago experimental jazz scene that it sprung from , it has a straightforward sense about what it does , which is to reconcile the avantgarde with the traditional , blues and bop with free jazz but there s new life in the mission the band now includes the broadly learned and brashtoned young trumpeter maurice brown , as well as the subtly driving drummer isaiah spencer mr brown ,

the pilot of the corporate jet that crashed on takeoff at teterboro airport in new jersey on wednesday told investigators yesterday that the control stick jammed when he tried to lift off , a member of the national transportation safety board said the pilot , john kimberling , said that , with the plane moving fast enough to take off , he could pull back the steering yoke only about one inch , said debbie hersman , a safety board member normally , she said the pilot should be able to pull back the yoke three or four inches at takeoff , causing the nose to lift toward the sky ms hersman briefed reporters on an interview that investigators had conducted with mr kimberling at hackensack university medical center she said investigators had reached no conclusions about what might have caused the accident and had not ruled out any factors but ms hersman said a surveillance video from the airport revealed no frost on the windshield of the small plane she said that the plane s wings were not deiced before the flight and that only one plane was deiced at teterboro that morning , about an hour before mr kimberling tried to take off a freelance pilot from south florida , mr kimberling , 58 , commanded a threeperson crew that had intended to take eight financial executives to midway airport in chicago at about 7 20 am , they accelerated northward on the shorter of teterboro s two runways , reaching 153 knots , or 176 miles an hour , which ms hersman said should have been enough to get the plane airborne but , according to her description of mr kimberling s account , when the yoke would not pull back enough , he aborted the takeoff , hitting the brakes and deploying the engine thrust reversers knowing he could not stop before the plane broke through a metal fence and hopped a drainage ditch , he said he tried to steer across the highway toward the parking lot in front of a warehouse , ms hersman said none of the passengers was seriously injured but two men in a toyota on route 46 were seriously injured when the plane sheared the roof off the car one of those men , james dinnall , 66 , of paterson , is in critical condition at the medical center in hackensack the other , rohan foster , 35 , of paterson , was released on friday from holy name hospital in teaneck mr kimberling broke an ankle and has some other injuries to a leg his copilot , carlos w salaverria , 31 , is recovering from multiple leg fractures in hackensack university medical center and has not spoken to investigators the safety board s inquiry is complicated by a problem with the flight data recorder that was recovered from the plane it contains only 10 seconds of data that begins after the plane had reached takeoff speed and ends before it crashed during that segment the plane slowed from more than 175 miles per hour to less than 105 miles per hour , ms hersman said we 're still trying to find out why it started when it did and why it stopped , she said of the data recorder , which she said was installed in the bottom of the plane s baggage compartment in washington , analysts will try to sync up that short segment of data with the tape from the cockpit voice recorder to help determine what happened and when , she said investigators also will lift the damaged plane to look underneath for signs of mechanical problems in addition , they will weigh all the baggage as they remove it and try to determine how much the fuel weighed , to see if the plane was too heavy to take off the maximum weight for that type of plane , a canadair cl600 , is 41 , 000 pounds , ms hersman said the two side fuel tanks spilled their contents but the center tank still holds as much as 750 gallons of fuel , which she said may be left in the plane until after it is moved to a nearby storage facility where the investigation will continue another plane of the same type ran off a runway at teterboro in december 2003 and came to a stop in muddy ground , according to safety board records the pilot complained afterward that the aircraft did not respond when he pulled back on the control yoke leo knaapen , a spokesman for bombardier aerospace , which makes the planes , said that the investigation into that case concluded that the plane had been overweight that plane was too heavy , sir , mr knaapen said he said he would not speculate about what might have caused the problem mr kimberling and mr salaverria reported , but he said the company s 600 series of jets is known throughout the industry as mature , very reliable and remarkably accidentfree a lawyer representing mr kimberling and the charter company that hired him , platinum jet management of fort lauderdale , fla , said that mr salaverria was telling a similar story about the failure to lift off mr salaverria s lawyer , manuel epelbaum , said last night that the accounts of the two pilots were almost verbatim mr salaverria , who was sitting on the right side of the cockpit , said that mr kimberling called for his help and he pulled back on his own yoke , mr epelbaum said when neither one of them could pull it back , they decided to abort , he said mr salaverria told him mr salaverria turned on the thrust reversers and then , mr epelbaum said , they did everything they could to keep the plane on a straight path as it tore across the highway toward the warehouse if they had turned the plane to the left or the right , one of the wings would have hit the ground and that would have been it , mr epelbaum said those wings are full of fuel he said his client would cooperate and give a full statement to the investigators next week but first , he said , mr salaverria , whose right leg shattered , needs to have a missing chunk of his right calf replaced
beirut , lebanon , sept 5 pressure has been mounting in recent days for the resignation of president mile lahoud , who has clung to office even as his syrian backers have been forced to withdraw from the country lebanon s recently elected prime minister and his cabinet are avoiding mr lahoud , and his influence is hard to detect in most government offices he keeps a low profile , rarely making public appearances or giving interviews but as hard as he may try to remain out of sight , he has been on many minds here in recent days , as lebanese have taken to predicting his imminent political demise things appeared to come crashing down on mr lahoud last week , when four senior security men , including his current head of security , mustafa hamdan , were cited as suspects by a united nations investigation into the assassination of a former prime minister , rafik hariri it is all but sure now that he will have to step down the question is when , said fares boueiz , a lawyer who is a former minister of foreign affairs and the environment the man is no longer able to rule the country , and i do n't think this can last another two months the suspects jamil alsayyed , former chief of general security ali hajj , former chief of the lebanese police raymond azar , a former military intelligence chief and mr hamdan were charged with murder , attempted murder and carrying out a terrorist act the men , once feared as syria s proxies in lebanon , faced formal proceedings before a lebanese investigative judge over the weekend mr lahoud is not a formal suspect in the investigation , for which a report is expected to be issued next month , and has been cooperating with investigators , detlev mehlis , the chief united nations investigator , said last week but mr lahoud s close ties to the suspects and his unusual step of arguing mr hamdan s innocence with the investigators only deepened the suspicion of him they are the president s men , his collaborators , and even though they are not indicted yet , lahoud is politically isolated , said nawaf salam , professor of political science at the american university in beirut the closer we are to the date of the release of mehlis s report , the more isolated lahoud will become in a defiant statement last week , mr lahoud insisted that he intended to complete his term in office , which ends in 2007 i will continue to fulfill my responsibilities to safeguard the constitution , lebanese laws and the integrity of lebanese territory , the statement said mr lahoud served under the nationalist general michel aoun during the final years of the civil war of the 1970 s and 80 s , then crossed over into syriancontrolled west beirut when the war ended , breaking with general aoun mr lahoud made his name by uniting and leading the lebanese army for almost a decade , then ran for the presidency and won in 1998 his popularity reached a nadir , though , when syria helped force through a constitutional amendment extending his term last september , which became a touchstone for the political turbulence of the past year so far , he has survived thanks to the same force that has kept most other lebanese bosses in power sectarianism he has appealed to fellow christians who may despise his politics , but would hesitate to bring down one of their own earlier pressure to oust him failed because cardinal nasrallah sfeir , the influential maronite prelate , intervened and because of international pressure on the government not to do anything that would destabilize the country but much has changed the government of prime minister fouad siniora has sought to prove its mettle and build legitimacy , encouraging lebanon s judiciary to take a leading role in the investigation of mr hariri s killing the formal charges placed against the four men on thursday sent another significant message pointing to the security chiefs as suspects may have put lebanon on the track of stability and ended the cycle of assassinations and explosions , said mr salam , the american university professor now people realize that they are held accountable for any act of terror they might commit many government figures have begun publicly demanding mr lahoud s resignation these are the people who worked for mr lahoud , said nayla mouawad , minister of social affairs sheik hassan nasrallah , the leader of the militant hezbollah organization and a traditional ally of mr lahoud who had opposed his ouster , acknowledged over the weekend that the president was in an uncomfortable position perhaps the biggest factor standing in the way of mr lahoud s ouster is the difficulty of impeaching him the lebanese constitution has little mechanism for impeachment , short of treason legal experts say the only way to remove mr lahoud would be through a constitutional amendment with a requirement since the settlement at the end of the civil war that the president be a christian , there is also the problem of a lack of an acceptable alternative to mr lahoud while many christian figures have expressed interest in the job , none has the consensus or voting base to take over walid jumblatt and saad hariri , son of the assassinated former prime minister , lead the largest voting bloc in parliament , and are determined to keep general aoun , who returned from 15 years of exile to a substantial victory in the parliamentary election , out of that position christian leaders , meanwhile , are determined that they will not allow the ruling bloc to dictate to them what is keeping him right now is the lack of an agreement between the different powers controlling lebanon , nawaf kabbara , professor of political science at balamand university in beirut , said of mr lahoud but such an agreement will be reached by the time mehlis releases his report
st louis having seen firsthand what albert pujols did to the astros 48 hours earlier , roy oswalt took serious steps last night to make sure he could n't do it again once , as far as the astros were concerned , certainly was enough contrary to the cardinals' most fervent wishes , pujols s dramatic game 5 home run had a short shelf life it extended the national league championship series to a sixth game , but not to a seventh on the night that 40yearold busch stadium played host to its last game , the astros won a trip to the first world series in their 44year history the astros were born three years after the chicago white sox last played in the world series now they will seek to keep the white sox from winning the world series for the first time since 1917 in a game of turnabout is fair play , the cardinals , who had deprived the astros of clinching the series at home monday night , saw their opponents celebrate their triumph on st louis s sacred ground sacred , that is , until the next incarnation of busch stadium opens next year houston won the sixth game , 51 , as oswalt stymied the cardinals over seven innings on three hits , none by pujols , who for his night s work did n't get the ball out of the infield in four attempts the cardinals' first hit was a fifthinning single by yadier molina , and it led to yet another disputed call in a postseason punctuated by disputed calls by umpires abraham nu ez , following molina , hit a bouncer to the mound oswalt turned and threw to second , but his throw pulled shortstop adam everett off the base everett acrobatically swiped at molina , and umpire greg gibson ruled that he tagged the runner for a forceout however , television replays appeared to show that he missed tim mcclelland , the firstbase umpire , might have had a better view of the attempted tag , but he was n't asked and he did n't tell instead of having the bases loaded with no one out , the cardinals had runners at first and third with one out they scored a run on a sacrifice fly by john rodriguez , but that was all they scored as they had throughout the series , except for the pujols home run , the cardinals just did n't hit having batted 270 , tied for the secondbest average in the league , during the season , and having scored the thirdmost runs , averaging five a game , the cardinals batted 209 in the series and averaged 267 runs a game hal mcrae , the team s hitting coach , expected more it s tough to say why they have n't been hitting , mcrae said before the game i do know we 've had opportunities and we have n't got the job done with runners in scoring position in the series , the cardinals had 5 hits in 37 atbats , a 135 average that s no way to win a pennant we have n't played well , mcrae said in an understatement , we have n't swung the bats well , we have n't had many clutch hits i thought maybe we were a base hit away from winning some of those other games in their division series against san diego , the cardinals showed no signs of an offensive slump they scored a total of 21 runs in sweeping the padres in three games but then they encountered the astros' talented corps of starting pitchers i thought the astros pitched well , mcrae said my concern was n't how many runs we scored , but that we score more runs than the astros , regardless of how well they pitched my feeling is we should score one more run than the astros we have that type of offense we 're a good enough hitting ball cub that we should score more runs than they score and that s what we have n't done i think our offense is better than that oswalt , who also won game 2 and was named the series' most valuable player , was the reason the cardinals were not better last night i give them credit , said tony la russa , the losing manager they pitched very well the difference was oswalt he got them even in game 2 and then today just shut us down we could n't get anything going he pitched two games if he threw 200 some pitches , he threw 170 fastballs he just kept spotting them on both sides of the plate up and down he had great command of a really good fastball matt morris , who would have pitched game 7 had the cardinals forced it , said oswalt came out strong , stayed strong all game he had good stuff , kept us off the board early , took the crowd out of it they put up some runs and that s all they needed for oswalt , the key to the game was the astros' early scoring , three runs in the first four innings once we got the early lead , i knew i could go right at them with the fastball , mix some twoseamers coming in , fourseamers away , he said i did n't have to throw many breaking pitches as far as getting behind guys i threw a few short of the plate , trying to get them to fish for it , and if they did n't , coming right back at them as morris mentioned , the astros took the zealous , redclad cardinals fans out of the game early once you get the early runs , oswalt said , you put pressure back on them to do something , and the more guys you can keep off base , the less the crowd is going to get into it once you take the crowd out of it , it kind of takes a little bit of the air out of the team oswalt said his wife dreamed the night before that he was going to win she said , '10 , ' oswalt related i told her , 'i hope it s not that close ' he and the houston hitters made sure it was n't
baghdad , iraq , dec 6 standing at a courtroom lectern , his notes spread before him , saddam hussein delivered a long rambling diatribe on tuesday in which he complained about his prison cell , boasted that he had survived three death sentences and excoriated america for running a theatrical play which they call a trial but it was mr hussein who seemed most attuned to the theatrical potential of his trial he repeatedly stole the floor from the witnesses and the judge , who let him veer far from the subject , seemingly mesmerized by the performance the former ruler spoke as witnesses testified about torture and executions for a second day at his trial , which resumed monday unlike the witnesses on monday , who several times had furious facetoface exchanges with the defendants , the witnesses on tuesday spoke from behind a curtain that shielded their identities one witness , a woman identified as witness a , recounted how security officers forced her to strip and tortured her with beatings and electric shocks at a secret police center she was 16 they lifted my legs up and beat me with cables , said the woman , whose voice was electronically disguised several times , she broke into sobs she recounted how one guard told her that she was lucky she had not been sent to the general security department prison , where no one remains a virgin she suggested that she , too , had been raped , but never said so is this what happens to the virtuous iraqi woman that saddam speaks about \? she asked , her voice cracking later , she told how she was taken to abu ghraib prison , where torture and humiliation became routine she recalled that guards used to pull on the penis of a deaf male relative with women and children watching she said she had seen camels at the prison and envied their freedom god is great , oh , god ! she moaned , briefly unable to continue mr hussein listened impassively , taking notes on a pad later , other witnesses described mass imprisonment , torture and executions after an assassination attempt on mr hussein in 1982 in dujail , a shiite town north of baghdad one witness described having suffered beatings and electric shocks after being arrested in dujail , when he was 12 the judge asked all the witnesses against whom they were lodging their complaint all mentioned mr hussein none appeared to have direct knowledge that he had ordered the killings at dujail , a main goal for the prosecution in crossexaminations , defense layers sought to prove that mr hussein was not at the torture sessions and executions the judge often interrupted the witnesses , forcing them to talk just about crimes they had witnessed he seemed less strict with mr hussein and the other defendants , including barzan ibrahim altikriti , the former ruler s halfbrother as he did monday , mr ibrahim crossexamined the witnesses at length , often treating them dismissively he hailed a prosecutor as a fellow baathist , calling him comrade , perhaps in an effort to embarrass him or possibly have him removed from the trial later , standing and glaring at the judge , mr ibrahim spread his hands toward mr hussein , who sat in front of him , and said you should be true to yourself , your country , your leader this man has 12 million followers in iraq alone mr hussein , who has played to the cameras in all four sessions since the trial began on oct 19 , outdid himself stepping to the lectern , he began in a quiet , flattering mode , telling the judge , i do n't want to burden you with a lot of questions later , he grew animated , scowling and slicing the air with his hand above all , mr hussein seemed deaf to the nightmarish accounts from the witnesses , complaining at length that he was being mistreated i live in an iron cage covered by a tent under democratic american rule , he told the judge you should come see my cage he said , the americans and the zionists want to execute saddam hussein , but insisted , again and again , that he was not afraid he reminded the judge that he had been sentenced to death before , an allusion to his escape from iraq after an assassination attempt against the former president abdel karim qassem in 1959 as the court adjourned , mr hussein jumped from his chair and said he was exhausted and had been wearing the same clothes and underwear for three days he asked for a delay when the judge , rizgar muhammad amin , refused , mr hussein flew into a rage i will not be in a court without justice , he said go to hell , you and your agents of america !
michael r bloomberg s reelection last week achieved a largely overlooked political milestone in this lopsidedly democratic city after his second term , more mayors will have been elected as republicans or thirdparty candidates than as democrats since 1933 two years ago , mr bloomberg spent 75 million in a losing campaign to impose nonpartisan elections permanently by revising the city charter this time , investing 10 times as much to be reelected , he won by a record margin \( carrying 16 of the 6 , 000 election districts unanimously \) and tipped the historical balance at city hall over more than seven decades away from the democrats through 2005 , candidates elected as democrats \( vincent r impellitteri , a democrat , won as an independent in 1950 \) have been mayor for about 37 of the last 72 years but despite mr bloomberg s landside reelection , the democratic hegemony over municipal politics is n't dead yet the republicans did not even field candidates for the two other citywide offices the mayor had no coattails in city council races his enduring legacy on partisan politics , like those of his republican predecessors , remains debatable bloomberg s reelection does n't mean we 've achieved nonpartisan mayoral elections , said frank j macchiarola , the president of st francis college in brooklyn and chairman of the charter revision commission that advanced the nonpartisan election proposal what it means is that the democratic party is incapable of nominating popular candidates what it says to me is that the hold of the party is not persuasive , particularly with an emerging middle class and tremendous diversity people are more willing to look at candidates on the merits that view seemed to have been signaled last month by a new york times poll , which asked new yorkers whether it made any difference who is mayor threequarters of the respondents said it did , suggesting that mr bloomberg and his predecessor , rudolph w giuliani , had succeeded in reversing years of cynical grousing that the city was ungovernable chris mcnickle , author of to be mayor of new york , advanced another explanation for the new nondemocratic majority among recent mayors ethnicity , not party affiliation , is the organizing principle of local elections in new york city , he said this year , mr mcnickle said , bloomberg s base of support remains as it was jewish , italian and irish voters augmented by blacks , whom he aggressively courted so the decision comes down to trust , and most people have an easier time trusting someone who shares with them a fundamental aspect of their identity , mr mcnickle said often that means race , religion or heritage john h mollenkopf , director of the center for urban research at the graduate center of the city university of new york , generally agreed correlating party enrollment with the results , he found that partisanship explains about onethird of the vote choice what underlies the lack of a perfect fit between being a democrat and voting for a democratic nominee \? he said race , in the sense of being nonhispanic white and being less than enthusiastic about a nominee who is not nonhispanic black democrats were also unenthusiastic about a nominee who , if not white , was also not black mr mollenkopf also attributed the party disconnect to income , education and home ownership factors that mr bloomberg tapped into to forge a middleclass coalition that largely transcended ethnicity interviewed outside her polling place in crown heights , brooklyn , last tuesday , valerie fields , a clerk for the department of education , declined to say whom she was voting for , but explained i am a concerned citizen i have a child the schools are important i work for the city i am a democrat , but this turnaround , i have n't seen anything negative in what he has done i guess i am republican today few local republicans have hailed mr bloomberg s reelection and with it the promise of the longest period of republican rule in the city s history as an enduring republican resurgence in a city where enrolled democrats still outnumber republicans by more than 5 to 1 and despite mr bloomberg s record margin , he actually received about 20 , 000 fewer votes than in 2001 because overall turnout was down \( he won with about 18 percent of enrolled , much less eligible , voters \) none of mr bloomberg s republican predecessors not fiorello h la guardia , john v lindsay or mr giuliani revived the party much beyond their own mayoralties lindsay , rebuffed for reelection by republicans , won a second term as a liberal and independent and later became a democrat mr giuliani is a lapsed kennedy democrat mr bloomberg , a lifelong democrat , switched parties only because it was easier to win the republican nomination \( and in 2001 , the 9 11 attack skewed the outcome , as did mr bloomberg s record spending \) next time , my guess is that the democratic candidate should win , mr macchiarola said if the democratic candidate does n't in 2009 , then there really is a serious problem william t cunningham , the mayor s senior adviser and himself a democrat , said a republican is always going to be an underdog four years from now you wo n't have an incumbent , and it s very possible that if there s a republican who is just seen as a republican , the old party loyalties will hold sway again but when people judge you on the record , on demeanor , on your intangibles honesty , integrity , work ethic that will wash out party loyalty
as a rule , companies do n't often draw attention to business practices that could land their executives in jail but for partygaming plc , potential illegalities are n't just a secret hidden in its business plan they are the centerpiece of its business plan a giant in the online gambling business , partygaming is an oftenoverlooked megasurvivor from the dotcom crash of the late 1990 s as hundreds of profitless commercial sites disappeared into the digital ether , partygaming s popular gambling sites like partypokercom soared , with revenues and profits growing exponentially year after year this week , the company will go public in what is expected to be the largest offering in years on the london stock exchange , one that will make billionaires out of its ragtag assortment of founders and major stockholders including a california lawyer who earned her first fortune in online pornography and phonesex lines all told , as much as 9 billion is expected to be raised , with all of the cash going to private shareholders selling portions of their stakes but there will be no wall street investment houses lapping up fees in the giant deal , no victory dances in the offices of american corporate lawyers that is because partygaming , based in gibraltar , has no assets in the united states , and its officers or directors could risk being served with a civil suit or an arrest warrant if they came to the united states on business the reason \? the justice department and numerous state attorneys general maintain that providing the opportunity for online gambling is against the law in the united states and partygaming does it anyway indeed , of its 600 million in revenue and 350 million in profit in 2004 , almost 90 percent came from the wallets and bank accounts of american gamblers to justify this , partygaming walks a very thin line providing online gambling is not illegal per se in the united states , the company argues federal prosecutors just say it is the company has already received an email message from the louisiana attorney general demanding that it cease providing online gambling in that state partygaming simply ignored the communication and waited for additional action that never came the company s prospectus a british document that is not available in the united states at times reads something like a legal brief , citing american case law to support the company s position that no prosecution would ever take place still , in its offering documents , partygaming makes no secret of the fact that even if the company s view of the law proves wrong , it is banking on its executives' belief that there is little that law enforcement can do or will do to prosecute in many countries , including the united states , the group s activities are considered to be illegal by the relevant authorities , partygaming says in its offering document partygaming and its directors rely on the apparent unwillingness or inability of regulators generally to bring actions against businesses with no physical presence in the country concerned that type of unusual disclosure is typical of the entire partygaming story a strangerthanfiction tale laced with an unlikely combination of sex , money , technology and the kind of luck that is fitting only for a gambling company and there are already signs that before the tale is done , it could well inflame trade disputes between the united states and britain over america s arguably inconsistent behavior toward the gambling industry fergus wheeler , a spokesman for partygaming in london , said that the company and its executives could not comment , in part because no offering of shares was being made in the united states the story begins , improbably enough , at a collection of lucrative massage parlors operated in san francisco their owner , richard parasol , saw fabulous wealth from the businesses state property and business records show that mr parasol at times in deals involving his swedish wife , gunna moved his family into an upscale home in marin county and bought an array of investment properties while putting money into a leather goods concern and other businesses by the early 1990 s , mr parasol had a new business partner in his ventures one of his three daughters , ruth , the woman who ultimately would prove to be a driving force behind partygaming after spending years in private school , ms parasol attended college at the university of san francisco , state records show , before she moved on to western state university in fullerton , calif , where she earned her law degree ms parasol , now 38 and a resident of gibraltar with her husband , j russell deleon , has universally declined to be interviewed and did not respond to an email message but the lawyer s life of filing briefs and making court appearances was not to be for ms parasol instead , her father brought her in as an adviser on a phone sexchat business he had formed with ian eisenberg , a seattle businessman whose father , joel eisenberg , was a pioneer of sexoriented phone lines in the 1980 s quickly , ms parasol emerged as one of the small clique of prominent executives in the growing world of interactive pornography in 1994 , she split off from her father s business , forming her own sexchat phone business with seth warshavsky , another young seattle businessman who had worked with mr eisenberg but her business dealings with her father were not over california state business records show that ms parasol and her father established starlink communications , another phonesex business they also invested with mr warshavsky s biggest venture ever , the internet entertainment group cash was coming in by the fistful for everyone while online pet stores and cosmetics companies were struggling , internet pornography was a gold mine the phone lines almost printed money , and , through ieg , mr warshavsky became the most prominent businessman in online pornography , with hundreds of thousands of paying members time magazine called him the larry flynt of the internet but soon , everything began crashing down in a storm of unpaid debts and lawsuits mr warshavsky , for example , moved overseas , leaving behind a huge collection of unpaid bills mr eisenberg , meanwhile , had a falling out with mr parasol and his daughter and the dispute ended up in court mr warshavsky and ms parasol were codefendants in lawsuits contending improper business practices the federal trade commission sued mr eisenberg , accusing him of engaging in deceptive trade practices by tricking customers into authorizing billings to their telephone lines for internet access the pornography business was beginning to look dicey but ruth parasol had another idea while many of her former associates found themselves in legal trouble , she emerged relatively unscathed according to people who have spoken with her , she and her father sold their interests in electronic pornography , just as the litigation was heating up instead , ms parasol pursued a new venture online gambling it was the new buzz of the internet world , and ms parasol decided to apply the knowledge she acquired from her pornography ventures into the more reputable gambling business using her profits from the pornography business as seed capital , she and a handful of partners opened a web site called starluck casino in 1997 according to company records , starluck maintained all of its operations including servers and offices in the caribbean , beyond the reach of american authorities but the business was nothing special the software that drove the site was simply licensed from a third party then , the next year , ms parasol struck up the relationship that would transform her company into the giant it is today she spoke with anurag dikshit \( pronounced dixsit \) , then a 25yearold computerengineering specialist who had recently graduated from the indian institute of technology in new delhi , asking him to write a proprietary program for casino games within a year , as mr dikshit s skills were recognized as crucial to her company s future , he became an investor by 2000 , the new team of executives began exploring the idea that would bring them billions developing a platform to let gamblers from around the world play against one another online , either at individual virtual tables , or in larger tournaments partygaming is then paid a commission , known as a rake , for its role in hosting the games the timing could not have been more fortuitous at that point , a poker craze was about to sweep across the united states , pushed by the advent of televised poker events like the world poker tour and the world series of poker these programs helped to transform poker , once a pennyante game played out on kitchen tables by neighbors and friends , into a glamorous event with celebrity matches and color commentators helping to push the growth was the use of cameras under tables during the competitions that allowed viewers to see the players' cards and gain an insider s view of the unfolding game once mr dikshit s software was improved to allow for hosting as many as 70 , 000 players at once , ms parasol s company further fueled the game s popularity now , players could join a game anytime , from anywhere , without having to wait for their buddies or to restock on beer and potato chips players responded in droves , making poker by far the fastestgrowing segment of the online gambling market total revenue for online poker among all companies was already a healthy 92 million in 2002 , but it then exploded , surpassing 1 billion just two years later , according to christiansen capital advisors llc , a consulting firm in new gloucester , me , that specializes in advising gambling companies ms parasol s company , by then known as partygaming , did its part to fuel the mania to help introduce its poker web site , it hired a wellknown poker player named mike sexton as a marketing consultant , and with his help it developed the partypokercom million tournament a live contest played on a luxury cruise ship with a guaranteed first prize of 1 million with cable channels hungry for more poker programming , the partypokercom contest was soon on television featuring none other than mr sexton as a commentator the company s base of players and the cash they generated exploded in 2002 , the casino business at partycasinocom , which included slot machines , blackjack games and roulette wheels , was still the big piece of partygaming , with 535 registered players compared with 105 registered poker players by the end of 2004 , the number of registered casino players had jumped to 1 , 296 while the number of poker players had soared to 5 , 225 but that is only part of the story after a blitz of television advertising in the united states , the poker games attracted an escalating number of casual players at the end of 2002 , the average number of daily active players was 1 , 297 two years later , that had risen to 77 , 094 and by the end of march had reached 121 , 570 profits rode right along with that growth the company had revenue of just 9 million from its poker business in 2002 by the end of 2004 , revenue had climbed to more than a halfbillion dollars as the business grew , partygaming brought in more professional managers it hired richard segal , the head of odeon limited , britain s leading operator of movie theaters , as chief executive in 2004 , and hired michael jackson , the chairman of the sage group , a big british software company , as nonexecutive chairman ms parasol and her husband , mr deleon , now serve as consultants to the company and , after the offering , will retain the right to name one director to the board at the same time , partygaming adopted a longterm strategy for managing its growth , which is likely to continue to be robust according to the christiansen capital analysis , poker players should continue to migrate to online games over the next five years , even as new players are attracted to the game in the process , the firm estimates , the total online poker market will mushroom to 6 billion in 2009 from 1 billion in 2004 but there is a problem with these estimates players in the united states make up threequarters of the market , and even with all that growth they are expected to continue to be at least half of the overall business at partygaming , american players currently make up just under 90 percent of the company s business and american law enforcement argues that providing online poker is simply illegal it is called the interstate wireline act known colloquially as the wire act passed in 1961 and aimed primarily at mobsters , the law prohibits anyone involved in the gambling business from using wire communication to transmit bets on sporting events or contests the question becomes this is poker a contest \? the justice department has historically maintained that it is and , as a result , has argued that operators of online poker , including partygaming , are acting in violation of the law but it is hardly that simple in an astonishing bit of luck , in 2001 just as partygaming was preparing to start its poker business federal judge stanwood duval in new orleans ruled in a case pertaining to mastercard international that the wire act does not prohibit internet gambling on a game of chance that position has since been upheld by the fifth circuit court of appeals still , the justice department has maintained that such gambling is illegal , and numerous states have argued that it violates their laws as well some authorities have tried flanking maneuvers to frustrate online casinos eliot spitzer , new york s attorney general , for example , opened an investigation into how paypal , the online payment firm owned by ebay , helps online bettors pay gambling companies paypal agreed to suspend all such payments , as did the citibank division of citigroup , one of the country s largest issuers of credit cards and there have been rumblings in congress about toughening up federal laws to curb the business for several years , senator jon kyl , an arizona republican , has pushed for a federal law to prohibit the use of credit cards or other payment systems for online gambling but each of those attempts has collapsed , as various sectors of the american gambling industry including horse racing and indian casinos have sought to insert exemptions into the law for their businesses in an odd way , the questionable legality of online gambling in the united states ultimately proved to be a huge boost for partygaming even as hundreds of millions of dollars started rolling in from american players , gambling giants notably the operators of las vegas casinos stood on the sidelines with valuable assets and all of their executives in the united states , none of them were willing take a chance on where the law would finally settle that paved the way for independent virtual casinos like partygaming to succeed the company got a gambling license from gibraltar , where it established its headquarters it carefully made sure that none of its assets were in the united states , making it impossible for law enforcement to seize anything even the computer servers used to handle the poker games were located in canada , and will be moved to gibraltar by the end of this year now , as the largest company pushing into the united states market , partygaming is best positioned to benefit if the question of online gambling is decided in its favor already , the world trade organization and foreign governments are siding with companies like partygaming and against the united states late last year , for example , the wto agreed with the caribbean island nation of antigua that united states legislation criminalizing online betting based in other countries violated global laws an appellate body at the trade organization upheld the principal conclusions in that ruling in april indeed , among international bodies and foreign governments , the american position on internet gambling is becoming an object of derision a 2003 report by the department for culture , media and sport in britain , for example , found that there was a growing global market for online gambling where national boundaries no longer had any meaning nowhere is this better illustrated than in the usa , where despite the apparent illegality of crossborder gambling more of its citizens gamble online than anywhere else in the world , the report says to deny this appears in many ways to fly in the face of the reality of international banking and the inherently international nature of 21stcentury telecommunications with america s strongest allies throwing in the towel , partygaming may well have been successful with its risky roll of the dice on internet gambling and now this week , its owners can cash in their billions of dollars in winnings

on bitter afternoons , when the city asphalt pounds back like an insult at your feet , a nice place to go is broadway alley , in kips bay on the east side of manhattan it will not take long to explore it broadway alley is a short city byway , a single block in length , which runs narrowly from east 26th street to east 27th street , midway between lexington and third avenues it is 265 feet long , 13 feet wide and one of the last unpaved streets on the macadamized island of manhattan as such , it is one of those forgotten parts of the city with a power to recall to new yorkers that sometimes it really is the earth beneath their feet though it may not look so to the naked eye , the stuff that covers slightly more than half its length is an unfamiliar substance known as dirt about five years ago , residents say , a short piece of the northern stretch of broadway alley was , in fact , paved over to make deliveries easier for a restaurant that had just moved in the rest , however , has stayed untouched since the early days of the 19th century , making it a throwback to manhattan s gaslight past the department of transportation says that broadway alley has remained unpaved for nearly two centuries because it is a private thoroughfare , and thus not subject to the public appetite for asphalt department officials had a harder time determining if broadway alley was the last dirt street in manhattan craig chin , a spokesman , said if it s a private street , it s not maintained by us , which means it could be the only unpaved street , but we would n't know singular or not , the dirt of broadway alley littered with broken glass , spare change , smoked butts and the strawspiked tops of soft drink cups has seen a lot in its roughly 175year life it was laid out sometime around 1830 , presumably by charles lee and adam thomson , who bought its third avenue frontage in 1827 in 1863 the new york times noted in a column called city government that a certain alderman long had moved to shelve a resolution before the committee on lamps and gas to place gas lamps along the alley s length those lamps may have actually been useful considering its dismal look at least according to an unnamed times reporter who wrote about his sojourn there in 1879 on the one hand , the reporter wrote , are stables with ragged stable boys lying in the sun and enjoying more odors at a breath than coleridge found in cologne on the other is a broken and blistered and dingy and halfwindowless row of tenement houses with dusky african faces grinning from every pane it is clear from other published reports that in the early 20th century , broadway alley remained largely poor and largely black it also seems to have had a problem with crime , or at least with criminals , according to times stories from the early 1900 s one of them , which ran dec 29 , 1901 , beneath the headline lawyer caught in a raid , describes the plight of robert lowry , colored , 3 broadway alley , who was arrested on a gambling charge by the men of capt norton goddard s antipolicy society it seems that captain goddard s officers discovered a floating craps game in the basement of 352 third avenue , around the corner from the alley , and picked up , among others , mr lowry , who , according to the article , was taken with such a nervous attack when told that the place was raided that his fingers had to be pried open before the bits of bone could be released none of this history seemed to surprise arshag shegerian , 82 , a former upholsterer , who has lived at no 8 broadway alley in its current incarnation a small back alley with a single occupied building surrounded by the back of a restaurant and vacant , dirty space every now and then we get what you call characters going through , he said , adding with no trace of alarm one time i almost killed one he explained that years ago there had been a close call with a vagrant who had fallen asleep beneath his car but woke to the sound of the ignition and was able to scurry away mr arshag s building has entrances on both the alley and third avenue and , three years ago , he formally changed to an avenue address apparently to please the postman he recalled hearing that way , way back the alley s builders had given it the broadway name to give it an impressive theatrical aura the finest thing about it these days , he said , is the parking , which is free william morrison , of william morrison communications , who lives and works at no 8 broadway alley , said the short street , true to its history , once had a problem with drunkards and prostitutes alleys sometimes attract people you would n't want there , mr morrison said , adding that the problems were mainly solved 10 years or so ago with the installation of a chainlink fence the fence , which is locked each night , impedes nocturnal trespassers , though by day one is free to explore the alley s charms these include its dingy , almost stablelike atmosphere , the castiron type g wall lamps mounted at either end and the rare ability in new york city to dig one s toes in the dirt without being near a construction site or park then there is the fact that the barnum bailey circus once kept its elephants in the alley , which might account for the earthy smell it certainly left mohammad nasrood wondering a livery driver , mr nasrood parked his black sedan in broadway alley the other day dirt \? mr nasrood asked when told of the substance underneath his tires he had a quizzical look there is that in new york \?
cairo , dec 27 the american consulate here opened its doors to reporters on tuesday in an unusual step to dispel reports that it employed hardline islamists who kept posters of the militant group hamas on the walls in fact , the only posters were those of the blackrobed coptic christian pope , shenuda iii , and santa claus the mission was responding to reports published monday in the new york post asserting that the state department had been investigating up to 20 hardline islamic employees in the consulate section of the american embassy who had reportedly denied visas to the united states to thousands of coptic christians the newspaper also said there had been complaints that the egyptian employees kept posters of supporters of the palestinian militant group hamas , which the state department classifies as a terrorist group we do not see any hamas posters here , said the consul general , peter g kaestner it is difficult to be diplomatic and to describe the article appropriately the bottom line is there is no investigation , mr kaestner said none of my staff is under investigation for any purpose the consul spoke to reporters during a tour of the consulate section , where american employees conduct visa interviews about 25 egyptians , overwhelmingly coptic christians , mainly do paperwork to process the visas coptic exile groups in the united states often claim that in egypt they are the subject of virulent discrimination the post reported two cases of copts who said they were denied visas handled by the embassy in recent weeks and who charged bias mr kaestner said there had been nothing discriminatory about the matter in the consulate , christian employees had hung pictures of the coptic pope and various saints over their cubicles the closest any got to pictures of supporters of hamas were pictures of osama bin laden and other terrorists in the fbi list of most wanted terrorists
of all the advances in the last decades in arresting and prosecuting rapists , none have been more revolutionary than testing of dna , the genetic strands unique to each individual that can link a suspect to a sex crime with cool scientific certainty a tool more trustworthy than a witness s recollection , or a host of other forensic measures dna can remove much of the guesswork for the police and prosecutors , and it can reach back to grab those who committed crimes decades ago or were charged but dodged conviction at the same time , dna can relieve rape victims of the burden of identifying a predator who attacked from behind or in darkness , whose face they never saw , and it can bring a resolution to victims who gave up on justice years ago and learned to live with the injury but there is something dna cannot do replace the testimony of victims they must still take the stand , and with that can come a measure of pain kathleen ham was raped in manhattan 32 years ago she wants her name to be public along with her account of the crime to show that she is not ashamed , and today she will testify in state supreme court in manhattan , confronting for a second time the man accused of attacking her on a summer night in 1973 she will recall how a man came through the window how he pulled a sheet over her head , and held a knife at her throat how she screamed and fought him , but was not as strong how she never saw his face the first trial , in 1974 , ended with a hung jury ms ham , 58 , learned in april that the defendant , who is now known as fletcher anderson worrell , had been conclusively matched to the assault by dna since then , she has been forced to revisit the attack , and retrace the arc of a damaged life , the years of insomnia and selfrebuke that sometimes felt to her like a walking death he s been out there for 32 years , ms ham , a lawyer who lives in california , says in her warm voice turned gravelly by years of chainsmoking and i 've been in my own private jail dna helped to track mr worrell , 59 , back through the years , tying him as a suspect to at least 24 other rapes in new jersey and maryland , all of them committed after the rape of ms ham ms ham s threedecade story is framed by remarkable changes in the criminal justice system especially rape prosecutions prosecutors have become skilled in sex crime cases , and in respectful handling of victims revised laws place fewer burdens on those who were attacked , and juries are more sympathetic yesterday , she was torn with worry , but resolved i think underlying this , ms ham said , is a certain part of me that says that even if it hurts , things are supposed to be done right dna has transformed thousands of other sex and violent crime cases across the country the fbi , which maintains the national databank of dna criminal case profiles , says that dna has so far helped in the prosecution of 27 , 806 cases nationwide dna testing is unlocking old rape cases as fast as local law enforcement laboratories can analyze evidence and dispatch results to the databank in the last few years , dna helped to clarify seven unsolved rapes in new iberia , la , three decadeold cases in baltimore , dozens of cases in ohio dna testing has provided new leads in more than 200 old rape cases in new york mr worrell has sat calmly through a series of pretrial hearings , a stocky man of 5foot9 with broad arms and sloping shoulders described in court papers as a longpracticing muslim , he came to court wearing a bushy beard and a macram kufi cap mr worrell s lawyer , michael f rubin , has asked the court to dismiss the case , arguing that new york authorities had information on his whereabouts years ago and should have arrested him then the court denied the motion on the night of june 26 , 1973 , ms ham had just moved to manhattan , and was staying at a friend s studio apartment on west 21st street in chelsea she had been a student at berkeley in the 1960 s , and was still a free spirit in 1968 she had hitchhiked , on a whim , across europe to prague , to see the uprising there before the russian tanks rolled in i said , this is history , i have to see it , ms ham said , drawing on a cigarette and describing her fearless younger self like a character from a novel she read and put away long ago she is not tall , but has straight bearing , a sophisticate s language and a park avenue voice a photograph from 1975 shows a smiling , slim woman with hair flowing to her shoulders , classic cheekbones and bold red lipstick today she is heavier , and her curls are closercropped she had come to a city very different from today s new york shadowed with fiscal crisis , and crime so rampant that 13 police officers had been killed in the line of duty just two years before awakened by a noise that night , she saw the man s sneaker on the fire escape , then his hand on the window then the sheet was over her head she heard her own screams , but they seemed to come from a distance , as though she were standing to one side his knife left its serrated imprint on her throat the police report would show that a neighbor had heard the screams and called 911 when i saw i was still alive , i was disappointed , ms ham said she sensed that her life had been altered , but did not know how police officers quickly apprehended mr worrell on the street they let ms ham take a look at him in the back of the patrol car , and again at the station house , standing by himself behind oneway glass but she had not seen the attacker s face i do n't know , i do n't know , she told the police only later did she think that she could have identified his voice astonishingly , the 911 tape with the neighbor reporting her screams and pleading for help was erased during her examination at st vincent s hospital , ms ham recalled , she put up a front of cool control the doctor s official report cast doubt on whether she had been raped she appeared too calm , he wrote the night after the attack , when ms ham sought refuge in the home of old friends , a street noise made her scream that was when i realized that my life was taken away from me , she said then came the trial under the law at the time , the prosecutors had to prove that force was used on ms ham , and that the rape was consummated they had to have a witness mr worrell s defense lawyer , george c sena , kept ms ham under crossexamination for a day and a half his third question was whether she was a virgin he repeatedly suggested that ms ham had engaged in rough love with a pimp well , why did n't you get out then \? mr sena asked were both your legs broken \? the jury split , with 3 jurors unable to convict her retelling of the trial spills out in thousands of words , but when she reaches the end , she falls silent , exhausted my sense of fairness and justice just went out the window , ms ham said the rape was a simple accident , it was n't my fault the trial was no accident i had insisted on justice i stepped right in front of that truck but the case was n't closed someone set aside an intimate piece of evidence , a reminder of how she had been violated , though it had not been much use in the trial her underpants they went into a folder , and the folder was stored deep in the files of the manhattan district attorney s office while awaiting trial in ms ham s case , mr worrell , who used the name clarence williams at the time , sexually assaulted and shot a woman in queens , according to court documents on oct 31 , 1975 , 11 months after ms ham s trial , mr worrell wasconvicted in the queens attack , and was later sentenced to up to 10 years in prison after the conviction in queens , mr worrell also pleaded guilty to ms ham s rape but in october 1976 , based on a legal fine point , his queens conviction was overturned on appeal he then withdrew his guilty plea in ms ham s case and left new york , jumping bail in both cases not a year later , in september 1977 , mr worrell was arrested in washington for burglary under a different name , papers filed by his defense lawyer show but he persuaded the authorities that he was unfit for trial , and they sent him to a psychiatric facility for criminals three years later he was deemed healthy enough for release in 1980 , he enrolled at southeastern university in washington , and settled with a local family , according to his lawyer , mr rubin seven years later , a man who became known as the silver spring rapist started a fouryear spree of sexual assault in the montgomery county suburbs his method was distinctive he scouted a house with an open window and a woman who was alone inside he covered the victim s face at least 22 rapes fit the pattern there were at least two rapes with similar details in morris county , nj , in 1993 that year , mr rubin said , mr worrell left the united states for egypt , where he stayed for a decade he came back to settle in stone mountain , ga , working as an arabic translator in may 2004 , mr worrell went to brock s gun shop near atlanta and filled out an application under his own name for a 12gauge pump action shotgun he wrote that he had never been indicted for a felony or committed to a mental institution the background check brought up warrants for the two sexual assault cases in new york and with that , three decades of changes in criminal justice came rushing into the present two assistant district attorneys in manhattan , martha bashford and melissa mourges , were assigned the case both are veterans of cold case investigations and skilled in dealing with the sensibilities of sex crime victims in 1973 the prosecutor , the defense lawyer , the judge and most of the jurors were men among their first steps was checking the folder from ms ham s case and there , preserved in the dark , they found the underwear a spot of semen yielded a dna sample manhattan crime lab specialists compared it to a sample from mr worrell it was a statistically perfect match , the district attorney s office said the manhattan prosecutors sent mr worrell s dna profile to the fbi s nationwide databank of criminal dna profiles mr worrell matched dna evidence recovered in at least nine silver spring rapes , and the two assaults in morris county instead of calling ms ham directly , ms bashford contacted a friend of hers to break the news that the suspect had been found i became hysterical , i was sobbing , ms ham recalled i was frightened of the whole thing coming up again ms ham , who had moved back to california , became a successful civil court lawyer but friends knew she had quirks she could never stay anyplace without at least one exit door unlocked she sleeps only a few hours a night still she never married , and attributes that directly to the rape i just did n't want to be kissed , ms ham said i did n't like to be touched by strangers and in the early 1990 s , when her law practice was thriving , ms ham abruptly developed a phobia that made it impossible for her to enter a courtroom she had to give up trial litigation yesterday , as she prepared to testify , her mood careened she was hyperventilating , chainsmoking , taking hot baths , trying to focus on the crossword puzzle , her abiding solace all these years , i felt badly , she said i knew he would do it again she is set to take the stand this morning
geno auriemma , who has led the connecticut women s team to five national championships in 20 years , turned his back yesterday on the wnba s phoenix mercury , which is seeking a coach my family s grown up here , auriemma said on the uconn campus in storrs i 've done a million things here that i'm really proud of , and 9999 percent of the time i 've been treated better than i ever envisioned that i 'd be treated so i'm not looking to go anywhere i'm not looking to run away from anything i'm not looking to find greener pastures in january , auriemma signed a fiveyear contract extension worth 485 million whether it s phoenix or whether it s any other team in that league , they 're not going to be offering me more money than i make at connecticut , he said but if anybody thinks i'm staying here because of the money , they 're nuts if it s time for me to leave , i'm going to leave , whether it s for half the money or a third of the money or none of the money frank litsky
oakland , calif driving to a memorial service for his mother one day in late 2000 , alex briscoe took a wrong turn into the flat , forgotten streets of west oakland , finally idling his motor outside mcclymonds high school he saw a teenager smoking marijuana on the front lawn until a security guard gave chase he noticed the razor wire around the perimeter even as an educator who had worked in south philadelphia , no place for the na ve , mr briscoe asked himself , how can this be \? mcclymonds ranked by any measure among the worst handful of high schools in the entire state barely a fifth of entering ninth graders lasted until graduation virtually none of those survivors could qualify for admission to the university of california system just a few months earlier , an 18yearold senior , khadafy washington , had been shot and left to die on the school playground improbably , mr briscoe felt himself drawn to mcclymonds , attracted by the challenge he talked himself into a job as a dropout prevention counselor on the strength of his philadelphia experience and a graduate degree in social work from stanford one of his first steps was to convert a broom closet into a discussion room , off limits to administrators and guards , that he simply called sanctuary meanwhile , what mr briscoe found so shocking was , to dr barbara staggers , shocking only for being so typical for nearly 20 years , she had been practicing adolescent medicine at the children s hospital of oakland , fielding an evergrowing caseload of sexual abuse , hiv infection , gang violence , teenage prostitution and chronic asthma the leading causes of death for oakland s teenagers , her patients , were homicide and suicide during her decades in oakland , dr staggers had seen all sorts of panaceas come and go , everything from the black panthers to ebonics she had been part of inschool medical clinics in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s , until oakland s schools went into receivership and could not afford them what she had come to believe most deeply was that underneath medical trauma lay emotional turmoil , which was rarely diagnosed or treated until after the explosion these kids were stressed , depressed , ptsd , she said , using the acronym for posttraumatic stress disorder mental health undergirds everything in adolescent medicine to prevent things that are killing them , you have to address the way they feel about themselves tragically but perhaps appropriately , dr staggers and mr briscoe met after a mcclymonds girl had been raped asking to see mr briscoe on the pretext of having a headache , the student confided in him about the attack then dr staggers , legendary in oakland for turning nobody away , stayed at work late into a friday night to make the confirming medical examination out of that initial collaboration between doctor and social worker , black woman and white man , grew a partnership and a striking innovation in inschool medical care what began as sanctuary had evolved by january 2005 into a professional mental health clinic at mcclymonds , with three fulltime social workers and therapists , as well as a psychiatrist who is there one day a week the children s hospital operates the clinic , while its 1 million annual budget comes from various public and private sources instead of a broom closet , the clinic occupies mcclymonds s former wood shop , handsomely rehabbed with varnished floors , a sectional sofa and the only airconditioners in the entire school a separate entrance from the street allows students to come for appointments without being spotted by classmates in addition , the clinic provides art classes , recreation , physicals for team sports and screening for eyesight all of them worthwhile services , true , but all of them ways to give troubled young people a facesaving way to walk through the door of the 750 students in mcclymonds , almost half visited the clinic last year they want to get to know everybody , delvon napier , a recent graduate who has been involved since sanctuary opened in his freshman year , said of the clinic not just the ones who are bleeding on the floor the clinic uses about 15 mcclymonds students as peer counselors and , in effect , outreach workers one of them , xenia simms , was sharing some of her own boyfriend woes with a classmate several months ago when the other girl started talking about her feelings of being unattractive , her fear of physical intimacy ultimately , she revealed to xenia that she was raped during childhood by her stepfather for a minute i was just silent , xenia recalled she just kept going , talking about how it made her feel negative about her body when you 're going through something hard , you just want somebody to listen i was just trying to be an open ear in a gentle way , though , xenia mentioned the mental health clinic not advice , just an option and her friend eventually went there for therapy by the end of the academic year , the girl had become a peer counselor for all the idealism and compassion in the mcclymonds clinic , it also represents some very concrete thinking about finances until the clinic was installed , after all , mcclymonds was so starved for money it could n't even keep a school nurse the oakland public school system as a whole is now under state control for the second time , making it anything but a reliable benefactor instead , the children s hospital provides mental health care on a feeforservice basis most of the mcclymonds students , in turn , have health insurance under a state program for the poor by the hospital s projections , those reimbursements should provide 85 percent of the clinic s overhead expenses in coming years , supplying stability in a neighborhood that knows far too little of it the success at mcclymonds has led alameda county to open an even larger center , youth uprising , in a former supermarket next to another turbulent high school , castlemont in east oakland the 25 , 000squarefoot center includes performance stages , music studios , classrooms , computer labs and an internet cafe along with a psychiatry and counseling clinic if you combine your mental health with a spokenword workshop or a videography workshop , places where people are telling stories about their lives , it s a more effective way to wellness , said olis simmons , the project administrator it s mental health in disguise on education email sgfreedman nytimescom correction july 8 , 2005 , friday the on education column on wednesday , about a high school in oakland , calif , that has a mental health clinic on its premises , referred incorrectly to the stanford graduate degree held by one of the clinic s founders , alex briscoe it is in counseling psychology , not social work
point pleasant , nj fishing for sharks can be a little like being in a war it s all about waiting , waiting , waiting and then all hell breaks loose working a line with a 300pound mako shark at the other end may be exciting , especially if it is big enough to win a prize of 20 , 000 or more in the shark tournaments being run out of jersey shore towns like this one but it is also dangerous last year i had a mako come out of the water , just straight up like a rocket , 15 , 20 feet in the air , and it just put me right on my knees , said dennis west , captain for the 2005 jersey coast shark angler s mako fever tournament , which was based here last week and when you get them next to the boat , you hit them with a gaff , they just go crazy big fish , lots of teeth it s just very exciting the danger that is part of the excitement for shark hunters is there for beachgoers as well there has been a rash of attacks on humans recently a bull shark killed a 14yearold girl as she played in the florida surf at the gulf of mexico less than two weeks ago two days later , a 16yearold boy lost his leg after an attack along the same coast , and yesterday , a shark bit the ankle of a 19yearold man in gulf waters last month , a 17yearold surfer required more than 60 stitches to close a gash in his foot after a juvenile shark attacked him in the shallow water off surf city , nj shark numbers have been recovering after 12 years of federal protection , but northeastern fishermen are having a harder time this year finding sharks , all but the last of the big fish available to them the fishermen blame the cold spring and the lingering chill in the water for the lower numbers the shark is your last big major game fish out there , mr west said the marlins are off , they 're so protected nobody brings them in the wahoo , the bigeyed tuna are the same the swordfish are coming back , but the long liners beat them up pretty bad , and it s pretty rare that people go out for them shark tournaments attract hundreds of boats whose crews pay 300 and more for a day s fishing , and thousands more to equip and operate their expensive boats in open water even in good years , many boats return with empty holds in this year s tournament season , timed as always to the migration north of big sharks in june , the competition started out slow the south jersey shark tournament , a premier event held out of cape may three weekends ago , drew 217 boats competing for 230 , 000 in prize money , but only 37 sharks were caught in two days of fishing all but a few had to be thrown back because they were too small there just was n't a whole lot out there , said bob glover , the tournament organizer in previous years there have been hundreds more shark boats typically go from 20 to 50 miles offshore , particularly for mako , a deepwater loner the fishermen bait immense hooks that trail deep in the water as the boat drifts the crew ladles gallons of chum pieces of fish in the water in hopes of drawing prey most of the time is spent just waiting for a strike you go from sitting on the deck , taking a nap , to instant adrenaline rush , said mr pluta , who went out last weekend with his friends , mike petruzzi and eric jacobson suddenly the snap clips go , the drag is screaming on your reel , and you 're praying it s a money fish those moments of excitement make the tedium of waiting , not to mention the fruitless hunts on other days , suddenly worth it but with all the male bonding surrounding shark tournaments , catching a money fish is not the only reward there s a big macho thing in shark fishing , and in my opinion it s all linked to piracy , said tom delotto , the manager of the crystal point yacht club , the headquarters for the mako fever tournament not the burnandpillage kind , but the camaraderie and there s definitely a topofthedock hierarchy when they come in with their big boats and a big sharks and the gold reels and black rods and tens of thousands of dollars worth of gear they 're like pirates pete ernstberger , a general contractor from whitehouse station , nj , drew slightly embarrassed nods from a circle of friends when he put it down to darwin a shark is a giant predator and so am i , and i want conquer it , he said we 're two animals at the top of the apex yeah , animals you can quote me i 've been called worse the shark boats also seem to occupy a 100 percent femalefree zone none of the captains who were asked could think of a woman on a shark hunt not on my boat , mr petruzzi said bad luck the national atmospheric and oceanic administrating began managing shark fishing in united states waters in 1993 , and since then the atlantic sharp nose and the bonnet head have recovered so strongly that there are no longer any size limits on them so after several years of acute scarcity , sharks are pupping in the tidal flats along the jersey shore again , lured there by a recovery of the seal population , said robert schoelkopf , director of the marine mammal stranding center , in brigantine , nj that s why we 're seeing more seals come in with shark bites , he said other species are still struggling great white sharks , the villain of jaws , peter benchley s 1974 best seller and subsequent spielberg movie , are off limits to fishing and the most popular game shark still open to fishing , the mako , is protected by a limit of one fish per boat per day in the mako fever tournament , 182 boats paying 325 each and hoping for some 40 , 000 in prizes , did better , catching 261 sharks in three days of fishing still , that means most boats came up short bob rohlander and his crew spent the day chumming for sharks in the rough waters over the fingers , a favorite spot 30 miles off barnegat light they caught blue fish , ate their sandwiches and ran a chum slick a mile long without raising a mako like most of the boats , they returned empty an awful lot of work for no fish , he said
los angeles , aug 10 three years ago hollywood was asking whether jeff kwatinetz and his talent management company , the firm , had set themselves on the road to empire lately the question has been are they marching in circles \? over the last year the firm , based in beverly hills , has seen a string of senior executives depart to strike out on their own or join the ranks of rivals the executive exits are a sharp contrast to mr kwatinetz s drive for dominance , whose peak so far came with the 2002 acquisition of artists management group , the talent company assembled by michael ovitz , the former superagent last month joanne colonna , a manager of the company s film talent department , left for a job at rival brillsteingrey entertainment , taking with her a list of clients that includes anna paquin , sarah michelle gellar , brittany murphy and brendan fraser only weeks before , her comanager , aleen keshishian , had also left for brillsteingrey , along with the clients natalie portman , orlando bloom , laura linney and freddie prinze jr those moves followed the departures of the comanagers of the music department in april simon renshaw left and took with him the dixie chicks , clay aiken and anastacia in may andy gould left with rob zombie gayle boulware , who started as an assistant to mr kwatinetz in the early days of the firm and rose to become a manager herself , left to join mr renshaw s new venture officials at the firm declined to comment for this article , but to hear mr kwatinetz s allies tell it , the exits have been orchestrated largely by the firm s chief executive himself , part of an overdue move to streamline the company after its takeover of artists management , which left it saddled with millions in debt to another firm , it would seem like an exodus to another company it would seem like this company is taking on water , said jordan schur , president of geffen records and one of mr kwatinetz s closest friends in reality , it s a correction , of jeff taking out people who do n't want to work , people riding coattails others suggest that the departures are far from over and that the exits to date reflect a wider cash crisis as well as internal doubts about mr kwatinetz s strategies for expansion it means that the original vision that mike ovitz was able to achieve , his ability to create a brand for caa , never did get off the ground at the firm , said howard rosenman , former head of motion pictures for brillsteingrey , referring to mr ovitz s legendary tenure at the creative artists agency to create branding , even the geniuses of this town have trouble look what s happening to dreamworks while dreamworks has put its liveaction film business up for sale , mr kwatinetz has so far been able to count on the support of his most substantial bulwark in the movie world , rick yorn , a partner in the company mr yorn joined the firm with the artists management acquisition , bringing along heavyweight movie clients like cameron diaz and leonardo dicaprio despite lingering speculation that mr yorn would join the exodus , he has remained in place anchored in part by business debt that is personally backed by the company s partners , including mr kwatinetz , mr yorn and david baram the partners declined to comment , but a person with knowledge of the company management said none of them planned to leave even with the departures , mr kwatinetz still lays claim to one of the most potent talent shops in hollywood in music , the company represents kelly clarkson , linkin park , snoop dogg , audioslave and jennifer lopez , and in film its clients include ms diaz , mr dicaprio , martin scorsese , samuel l jackson and rachel weisz it also encompasses a film and television production unit , which currently has the series criss angel mindfreak on the ae cable network and was behind the exorcism of emily rose , a feature set for release by sony s screen gems unit next month the departures also do not seem to have dampened mr kwatinetz s appetite for majorleague dealmaking he has been pursuing an acquisition of the troubled paxson communications corporation , for instance and the firm has been hitting up private equity companies for financing to create a brand fund that would purchase brand names that could be combined with its efforts to market talent one drag on the company has been the outstanding debt it picked up in acquiring mr ovitz s unprofitable artists management venture the initial terms of the financing called for the firm to repay the debts over roughly 10 years , according to one person involved but shortly after the acquisition , the firm violated its bank covenant , and the bank shortened the term to just three years , this person said , forcing the company to devote much more cash to servicing the debt since then , the company has reduced the debt , with jp morgan , to less than 3 million from more than 12 million , this person said all of that has come against the backdrop of a weak music industry , with the company s troubles compounded by frustration among some of the departed executives , who privately complain of what they view as missed opportunities to sell the firm and cash in on its prominent place in the entertainment business last year the company with prodding from thomas h lee partners , an investment company that owns a small stake in the firm explored a plan to unite with irving azoff , the powerful music manager , who represents acts like the eagles , christina aguilera and jewel the deal would have paid the firm an estimated 60 million , according to people involved in the discussions mr kwatinetz , however , balked at the arrangement , in which his authority would have been diluted mr azoff declined to comment before that , mr kwatinetz had pursued a purchase of time warner s global music unit , a deal that would have placed him at the helm of a cluster of record labels and a catalog that ranges from led zeppelin to ray charles but thomas h lee partners , which with mr kwatinetz discussed the deal , ultimately backed a bid by edgar bronfman jr , and purchased the company for 26 billion mr bronfman became chairman of the independent warner music group mr kwatinetz received a multimilliondollar advisory fee as for mr kwatinetz , his drive and innovative urges appear to have survived the recent jolts intact he s got his eyes on the big prize , said mr schur , whose label releases music by firm clients including weezer i think its about controlling a real asset that s a real media giant he 'll know it when he sees it there definitely is a prize , but exactly what it is and what it looks like , only jeff could tell you but even some admirers have come to doubt mr kwatinetz s ability to realize the firm s grander schemes which called for crossbreeding actors , musicians , advertisers and other ventures in new business lines we tried to put something together that we thought would change the industry , because the record labels are inherently unfair and take away all the artists' rights , said mr gould , who remains a shareholder in the firm we talked about a lot of things in secret rooms , but we never did anything the experiment just did n't work
to the editor your jan 30 article entrepreneurs or tax evaders \? laments the fact that a few bad apples are giving the local turkish community a bad name regrettably , you have contributed to this unfortunate situation by erroneously implicating four individuals , sukru akkaya , mustafa catalbas , turhan ak and ahmet cayan , in crimes for which they are not charged and have not committed we can only presume that the reporter mistook them for other individuals but whether or not other targets of the government s raids last july may have been involved in alien smuggling , gasoline bootlegging , money laundering , or evasion of income or gasoline taxes , messrs akkaya , catalbas , ak and cayan were not and have never been charged with anything of the sort the only charge they faced , structuring of cash deposits in order to avoid currency reporting requirements , was dismissed over three and a half months ago a matter of public record that your article ignores as operators of several gas stations , they deposited cash after each station s shift , some of which were over 10 , 000 , and some of which were less than 10 , 000 , but none of which was structured to avoid reporting requirements apparently , law enforcement made the similar mistake of assuming that the illegal conduct of a few turkish individuals could be attributed to others in the industry simply because of their country of origin indeed , it is ironic that an article about a few bad apples who taint an entire community is itself guilty of tarnishing the reputation of four innocent people and causing further unnecessary pain and embarrassment to their families and their community andrew l crabtree joel weiss paul gianelli melville the writers are the attorneys for sukru akkaya , mustafa catalbas , turhan ak and ahmet cayan
washington , may 7 after spending more than 45 billion on screening devices to monitor the nation s ports , borders , airports , mail and air , the federal government is moving to replace or alter much of the antiterrorism equipment , concluding that it is ineffective , unreliable or too expensive to operate many of the monitoring tools intended to detect guns , explosives , and nuclear and biological weapons were bought during the blitz in security spending after the attacks of sept 11 , 2001 in its effort to create a virtual shield around america , the department of homeland security now plans to spend billions of dollars more although some changes are being made because of technology that has emerged in the last couple of years , many of them are planned because devices currently in use have done little to improve the nation s security , according to a review of agency documents and interviews with federal officials and outside experts everyone was standing in line with their silver bullets to make us more secure after sept 11 , said randall j larsen , a retired air force colonel and former government adviser on scientific issues we bought a lot of stuff off the shelf that was n't effective among the problems radiation monitors at ports and borders that cannot differentiate between radiation emitted by a nuclear bomb and naturally occurring radiation from everyday material like cat litter or ceramic tile airmonitoring equipment in major cities that is only marginally effective because not enough detectors were deployed and were sometimes not properly calibrated or installed they also do not produce results for up to 36 hours long after a biological attack would potentially infect thousands of people passengerscreening equipment at airports that auditors have found is no more likely than before federal screeners took over to detect whether someone is trying to carry a weapon or a bomb aboard a plane postal service machines that test only a small percentage of mail and look for anthrax but no other biological agents federal officials say they bought the best available equipment they acknowledge that it might not have been cuttingedge technology but said that to speed installation they bought only devices that were readily available instead of trying to buy promising technology that was not yet in production the department says it has created a layered defense that would not be compromised by the failure of a single device even if the monitoring is less than ideal , officials say , it is still a deterrent the nation is more secure in the deployment and use of these technologies versus having no technologies in place at all , said brian roehrkasse , a spokesman for the department of homeland security every piece of equipment provides some level of additional security , said christopher y milowic , a customs official whose office oversees screening at ports and borders it is not the ultimate capacity , he said but it reduces risk some critics say that even though federal agencies were pressed to move quickly by congress and the administration , they made some poor choices in some cases , agencies did not seek competitive bids or consider cheaper , better alternatives and not all the devices were tested to see how well they worked in the environments where they would be used after 9 11 , we had to show how committed we were by spending hugely greater amounts of money than ever before , as rapidly as possible , said representative christopher cox , a california republican who is the chairman of the homeland security committee that brought us what we might expect , which is some expensive mistakes this has been the difficult learning curve of the new discipline known as homeland security radiation at seaports one after another , trucks stuffed with cargo like olives from spain , birdseed from ethiopia , olive oil from france and carpets from india line up at the port newark container terminal , approaching what looks like an ezpass toll gate in minutes , they will fan out across the nation but first , they pass through the gate , called a radiation portal monitor , which sounds an alarm if it detects a nuclear weapon or radioactive material that could be used to make a dirty bomb , a crude nuclear device that causes damage by widely spreading low levels of radiation heralded as highly sophisticated when they were introduced , the devices have proven to be hardly that the portalmonitor technology has been used for decades by the scrap metal industry customs officials at newark have nicknamed the devices dumb sensors , because they cannot discern the source of the radiation that means benign items that naturally emit radioactivity including cat litter , ceramic tile , granite , porcelain toilets , even bananas can set off the monitors alarms occurred so frequently when the monitors were first installed that customs officials turned down their sensitivity but that increased the risk that a real threat , like the highly enriched uranium used in nuclear bombs , could go undetected because it emits only a small amount of radiation or perhaps none if it is intentionally shielded it was certainly a compromise in terms of absolute capacity to detect threats , said mr milowic , the customs official the port s followup system , handheld devices that are supposed to determine what set off an alarm , is also seriously flawed tests conducted in 2003 by los alamos national laboratory found that the handheld machines , designed to be used in labs , produced a false positive or a false negative more than half the time the machines were the least reliable in identifying the most dangerous materials , the tests showed the weaknesses of the devices were apparent in newark one recent morning a truck , whose records said it was carrying brakes from germany , triggered the portal alarm , but the backup device could not identify the radiation source without being inspected , the truck was sent on its way to ohio we agree it is not perfect , said rich o'brien , a customs supervisor in newark but he said his agency needed to move urgently to improve security after the 2001 attacks the politics stare you in the face , and you got to put something out there at airports , similar shortcomings in technology have caused problems the transportation security administration bought 1 , 344 machines costing more than 1 million each to search for explosives in checked bags by examining the density of objects inside but innocuous items as varied as yorkshire pudding and shampoo bottles , which happen to have a density similar to certain explosives , can set off the machines , causing false alarms for 15 percent to 30 percent of all luggage , an agency official said the frequent alarms require airports across the country to have extra screeners to examine these bags quick action after 9 11 because the machines were installed under tight timetables imposed by congress , they were squeezed into airport lobbies instead of integrated into baggage conveyor systems that slowed the screening process the machines could handle far fewer bags per hour and pushed up labor costs by hundreds of millions of dollars a year at busy times , bags are sometimes loaded onto planes without being properly examined , according to several current and former screeners it is very discouraging , said a screener who worked at portland international airport until last year , but who asked not to be named because he still is a federal employee people are just taking your bags and putting them on the airplane equipment to screen passengers and carryon baggage including nearly 5 , 000 new metal detectors , xray machines and devices that can detect traces of explosives can be unreliable a handgun might slip through because screeners rely on twodimensional xray machines , rather than newer , threedimensional models , for example the national academy of sciences recently described the trace detection devices as having limited effectiveness and significant vulnerabilities as a result , the likelihood of detecting a hidden weapon or bomb has not significantly changed since the government took over airport screening operations in 2002 , according to the inspector general at the department of homeland security transportation security officials acknowledge that they cannot improve performance without new technology , but they dispute suggestions that no progress has been made we have created a much more formidable deterrent , said mark o hatfield jr , a spokesman for the transportation security administration do we have an absolute barrier \? no counting machinery and personnel , aviation screening has cost more than 15 billion since 2001 , a price that representative john l mica , republican of florida , says has hardly been worthwhile congress is the one that mandated this , mr mica said but we should have done more research and development on the technology and put this in gradually concerns despite reliability some screening equipment has performed reliably machines that test mail at the united states postal service s major processing centers have not had a single false alarm after more than a year , officials said but the monitors detect only anthrax , which sickened postal workers in 2001 and only about 20 percent of mail is tested mostly letters dropped into blue post boxes , because they are considered the most likely route for a biological attack in about 30 major cities , equipment used to test air is also very precise there have been more than 15 million tests without a single false positive but only about 10 monitors were placed in most cities , and they were often miles apart , according to the inspector general of the environmental protection agency detecting a biological attack , particularly one aimed at a specific building or area , would require perhaps thousands of monitors in a big city in addition , as contractors hurried to install the devices before the start of the war with iraq the bush administration feared that saddam hussein might use biological weapons on american cities they were often placed too low or too high to collect satisfactory samples , the inspector general noted the monitors use filters that must be collected manually every day before they can be analyzed hours later at a lab it was an expedient attempt to solve a problem , said philip j wyatt , a physicist and expert on biological weapons monitoring equipment what they got is ineffective , wasteful and expensive to maintain homeland security officials say that they have already moved to address some of the initial problems , and that they are convinced that the monitoring is valuable because it could allow them to recognize an attack about a day sooner than if they learned about it through victims' falling ill at the nevada test site , an outdoor laboratory that is larger than rhode island , the next generation of monitoring devices is being tested in preparing to spend billions of dollars more on equipment , the department of homeland security is moving carefully in nevada , contractors are being paid to build prototypes of radiation detection devices that are more sensitive and selective only those getting passing grades will move on to a second competition in the new york port similar competitions are under way elsewhere to evaluate new airmonitoring equipment and airport screening devices that approach contrasts with how the federal government typically went about trying to shore up the nation s defenses after the 2001 attacks government agencies often turned to their most familiar contractors , including northrop grumman , boeing and saic , a technology giant based in san diego the agencies bought devices from those companies , at times without competitive bidding or comprehensive testing documents prepared by customs officials in an effort to purchase container inspection equipment show that they were so intent on buying an saic product , even though a competitor had introduced a virtually identical version that was less expensive , that they placed the manufacturer s brand name in the requests the agency has bought more than 100 of the machines at 1 million each but the machines often cannot identify the contents of ship containers , because many everyday items , including frozen foods , are too dense for the gamma ray technology to penetrate 'continually upgrading' the federal government will likely need to spend as much as 7 billion more on screening equipment in coming years , according to government estimates one department charged with coordinating efforts and setting standards will result in far better and more efficient technologies to secure the homeland , said mr roehrkasse , the department of homeland security spokesman some experts believe that this highpriced push for improvements is necessary , saying the war against terrorism may require the same sort of spending on new weapons and defenses as the cold war did you are in a game where you are continually upgrading and you will be forever , said thomas s hartwick , a physicist who evaluates aviationscreening equipment but given the inevitable imperfection of technology and the vast expanse the government is trying to secure , some warn of putting too much confidence in machines technology does not substitute for strategy , said james jay carafano , senior fellow for homeland security at the heritage foundation , a conservative think tank it s always easier for terrorists to change tactics than it is for us to throw up defenses to counter them the best strategy to deal with terrorists is to find them and get them
during the 1930 s thomas e dewey , then a prosecutor in manhattan , had the fabled mobster lucky luciano during the 80 s rudolph w giuliani , then united states attorney , had the entire mafia commission and prominent politicians today eliot spitzer , the new york attorney general , has theodore c sihpol iii who \? mr sihpol s lack of notoriety is what makes him significant improbably , he has emerged as the defendant in what may be the most important criminal trial of mr spitzer s tenure mr sihpol , a former broker for bank of america , is charged with fraud for making hundreds of improper trades in mutual funds to take advantage of price fluctuations after the market had closed his lawyers claim that socalled late trading is n't even against securities and exchange commission regulations , let alone criminal , and note that mr spitzer let off one of mr sihpol s biggest clients , edward j stern , a billionaire hedge fund manager , with a fine of 40 million and no admission of wrongdoing the importance of the trial , which began late last month , has nothing to do with the merits or gravity of the charges against mr sihpol the significant fact is that , for all its effectiveness in reforming the way wall street does business and all the favorable publicity it attracts in the press , mr spitzer s office has an unimpressive record of convicting those who actually work there and mr spitzer can hardly argue that he lacks the tools to do so , since new york s martin act allows him to bring criminal charges against any person or business involved in a fraudulent purchase or sale of securities in new york state true , mr spitzer can argue that federal prosecutors have traditionally been more likely to go to trial , and that the state attorney general s office has not been in the forefront of financial fraud criminal prosecutions in the past but mr spitzer has shown himself adept at outmaneuvering the sec on its own turf of securities law enforcement , and he has not been at all hesitant to use the powers of his office more aggressively than his predecessors it is also true that mr spitzer has picked most of the lowhanging fruit on wall street he has gained the reputation of an aggressive prosecutor without actually having had to prosecute when threatened with criminal prosecution by mr spitzer s office , for example , the insurance companies marsh mclennan and american international group basically ceded to his demands and opted to settle albeit at a painful cost yet the insurance company investigations yielded a meager catch of individual wrongdoers of the 10 insurance company executives who pleaded guilty to charges brought by mr spitzer s office , none were even remotely as prominent as chief executives like dennis kozlowski of tyco , bernard ebbers of worldcom or kenneth lay of enron , all of whom have faced , are facing or will face trial in federal court this contrast was underscored on friday , when it was disclosed that federal prosecutors have opened an investigation into whether maurice r greenberg manipulated stock of aig while he was its chief executive it s possible that mr spitzer lacks the evidence to bring criminal cases against more senior officers at financial services companies investigated by his office yet it s also true that , in case after case , the department of justice obtained convictions of upperlevel officers and directors of scandalridden companies could it be that , in the end , mr spitzer is hesitant to try the tough , highprofile cases against individuals \? perhaps , as he claims to be the case with aig , mr spitzer has overwhelming evidence and may yet bring criminal charges whatever the explanation , there s a strange disconnect between the magnitude of what happened to the bigcompany fish like marsh mclennan and aig \( both of which have thus far escaped criminal charges \) , and the minnows now struggling in the attorney general s net oped contributor gregory j wallance is a former federal prosecutor and whitecollar defense lawyer
arnold weinstein , the poet , playwright and librettist who wrote works performed on and off broadway , taught playwriting at yale and columbia , and collaborated with composers from william bolcom to henry threadgill to philip glass , died sunday at cabrini hospice in manhattan he was 78 the cause was liver cancer , said his niece , lisa hamm a selfdescribed theater poet , he was perhaps best known in recent years for his collaboration with mr bolcom , which included four volumes of cabaret songs as well as the operas mcteague , a view from the bridge \( with arthur miller \) and a wedding \( with robert altman \) the operas had their premieres at the chicago lyric opera a view from the bridge came to the metropolitan opera in 2002 affiliated with the group of poets , painters and musicians known as the new york school in the 1950 s and 60 s , he counted the poet john ashberry and the painter larry rivers among his close friends he collaborated with mr rivers on what did i do \? the unauthorized autobiography in 1999 among his own notable works were the red eye of love , a satire about an allmeat department store that had a long off broadway run in 1961 , and an adaptation of ovid s metamorphoses , which went to broadway in 1971 he had such a gift for writing words that were singable , and that gave character , mr bolcom said he was more influential on a lot of other people than people have taken into account arnold weinstein was born on june 10 , 1927 , in new york to englishborn parents he grew up in harlem and then in the bronx he enlisted in the navy during world war ii and served on a destroyer after the war , he attended hunter college on the gi bill , and later did graduate work at harvard , eventually earning a rhodes scholarship it was while he was living in florence , italy , on a fulbright fellowship that he came to the attention of darius milhaud , the composer milhaud loved his libretto a comedy of horrors , but found it too american for his own tastes he passed it on to his american student , mr bolcom , and a collaboration was born the result was a show , later rechristened dynamite tonight , an antiwar satire that opened at the actor s studio in 1964 , with a cast that included alvin epstein and gene wilder robert brustein later revived the piece at the yale repertory theater mr bolcom described his work with mr weinstein as a true collaboration , noting that he sometimes outlined the shape of words for mr weinstein to follow , or that mr weinstein in his bronx butcher s diction sometimes outlined an idea of a tune for mr bolcom but it was always hard getting him to sit still to work , mr bolcom said he was a real party boy we seemed to work better long distance for their opera collaborations , mr bolcom faxed vocal scores to mr weinstein s apartment in the chelsea hotel , where he lived for the last decades of his life since mr weinstein did not play piano , a downstairs neighbor would run through the music for him his work with paul sills , the founder of second city theater in chicago , helped cement mr weinstein s love of improvisational theater and adaptation an adaptation gives you a funny kind of limitation that makes it easier to improvise , he said in a 1992 interview in 1999 , he spoke to the new york times about working on mr miller s view from the bridge you 're not just rendering it , he said if that s all you do , the playwright loses he loses his nuances of language and he does n't have the fun of discovering anything new about the piece he said that he had told mr miller , this play is strong enough to take a lot of kicking around , and i think it wants the exercise he was married and divorced three times none of those marriages produced children , but he did have one daughter , cynthia slade , who died several years ago he is survived by a sister , gloria , in greenlawn , ny , and four nieces

moscow , nov 30 bruce morrow worked for three years on the shores of lake samotlor , a tiny dot of water in a maze of oil wells and roads covering more than a thousand square miles of icy tundra in siberia from the maps the russians gave mr morrow , he could never really know where he was , a misery for him as an oil engineer at a joint venture between bp and russian investors the latitude and longitude had been blotted out from his maps and the grid diverged from true north it was like a game , mr morrow said of trying to make sense of the officially doctored maps , holdovers from the cold war era provided by secretive men who worked in a special department of his company unofficially , anyone with internet access can take a good look at the samotlor field by zooming down through free satelliteimaging programs like google earth , to the coordinates 61 degrees 7 minutes north latitude and 76 degrees 45 minutes east longitude mr morrow s plight illustrates how some practices that once governed large regions of the former soviet union may still lurk in the hallways where bureaucrats from the communist past cling to power not only do they carry over a history of secrecy , but they also serve to continue a tradition of keeping foreigners at bay while employing plenty of people made dependent on moscow the misleading maps also reflect the kremlin s tightening grip on russian oil , one of the world s critical supplies , and one that is to become even more important in the future with plans for direct shipments to the united states by 2010 from ports in the far east and the arctic the secrecy rule over maps is enforced by the federal security service , or fsb , a successor to the old kgb it was written at a time the russians were suspicious of virtually all foreign businesses and fearful of a missile strike on their siberian wells those days are gone but as the russian government reasserts its control over strategic industries particularly oil it is not letting up on the rule the doctored maps belong to a deeprooted russian tradition of deceiving outsiders , going back to the days of potemkin villages in the 18th century and perhaps earlier during the cold war it was called maskirovka , soviet military parlance for deception , disinformation and deceit for decades , government bureaucrats created false statistics and misleading place names for instance , baikonur , the russian space center , was named for a village hundreds of miles away accurate maps of old moscow s warren of back alleys appeared only after the breakup of the soviet union even now , mr morrow and his colleagues can use only russian digital map files that encrypt and hide the coordinates of his location officially , only russians with security clearances are permitted to see oil field maps with real coordinates at scales greater than 1 2 , 500 it was totally futile , mr morrow said of the false coordinates on his fsb maps , created through an encrypting system none of us was particularly keen on pushing it there were rumors if you do that , you end up in the slammer a spokeswoman for the fsb confirmed that it controls maps around sites deemed important for national security , including oil fields asked whether the easy availability of accurate maps on the internet made such continued secrecy obsolete , she said the agency was interested only in national security and would not elaborate on its practices foreign business executives , though , say there is a secret behind the secret maps , and it has little to do with national security the rules are not only a way to maintain control over a strategic industry , but also form a subtle trade barrier and are a convenient way to increase russian employment after all , tnkbp , the 5050 joint venture where mr morrow works , pays scores of cartographers to encode and decode the maps , said frank rieber , a former engineer there the rules cover all oil companies , but are particularly pressing for tnkbp they provide a livelihood to hundreds of fsblicensed cartographers oil companies either outsource the work of stripping and restoring coordinates to independent institutes , or employ russians with security clearances to do the work , as tnkbp does the map orientations are shifted from true north the top of the map could be pointing slightly east , for example and the grid does not correspond to larger maps it makes us pull our hair out , mr rieber said yevgenia m albats , author of a 1994 book on the kgb , the state within a state , said the spy agency s interest in oil field mapping is just anther way of asserting its influence on society and business here , though one increasingly made obsolete by the internet the fsb knows about google earth as well as anybody , she said this does n't have anything to do with national security it s about control of the cash flow the agency is guarding the wells as much from foreign business executives as from foreign missiles these days , she said the laws about oil field secrets are used to persuade tnkbp to replace foreign managers with russians , more susceptible to pressure from the authorities , ms albats said russians are easier to manipulate , she continued they do n't want to end up in khodorkovsky s shoes , she said , referring to the former chief executive of the yukos oil company , mikhail b khodorkovsky , now in a siberian penal colony serving an eightyear sentence he was convicted of fraud and tax evasion after falling out with the kremlin over taxes , oilexport routes and politics the fsb has also pursued scientists who cooperate with foreign companies in other industries last winter it charged a physicist , oskar a kaibyshev , with exporting dualuse metal alloy technology to a south korean company mr kaibyshev objected in vain that the technology had already been discussed in foreign journals the case is pending on oct 26 , fsb agents arrested three scientists at a moscow aerospace company and accused them of passing secrets to the chinese another physicist , valentin v danilov , was convicted of selling technology for manned space flights to the same chinese company last year , though he also protested that the information was available from published sources at the same time , the kremlin is using oil to recapture status lost with the collapse of the soviet union , which explains the close attention paid to the industry by the security services foreign minister sergey v lavrov told a parliament committee in october that energy exports were russia s most powerful diplomatic tool in relations with other nations , according to a report in the newspaper nezavisimaya bp bought into the tyumen oil company , or tnk , in 2003 friction over the use of oil field maps existed from early on , geologists at the company said , but intensified this year the issue has risen to high levels in the government , with a faction that embraces foreign investment protesting that the fsb is hobbling the work of western engineers who come to help this country drill for oil , providing technology and expertise in the process in october , andrei v sharonov , a deputy economic and trade minister , said fsb pressure on the oil venture over the classification of maps had disrupted production in western siberia , an article in vedomosti reported it quoted mr sharonov as saying that the agency was pressing tnkbp to replace western managers with russians a spokeswoman for mr sharonov declined to comment an fsb spokeswoman denied any ulterior motives in policing oil field maps engineers call the practice a nuisance , but say it has not disrupted production the licensed cartographers are skilled in accurately translating between real and false coordinates , and so far , they do not know of any major mistakes , they say in a telephone interview from his home in santa barbara , calif , mr morrow , who worked as an engineer for tnkbp from 2002 until may , said he left partly because he became frustrated with the police controls he guided a reporter to lake samotlor on google earth the lake lies just north of nizhnevartovsk , a city on the ob river , as it loops in silvery ribbons through a background of dark green siberian wilderness in the middle of the lake is an island , like a bull s eye that was the folly of it , mr morrow said you could get this information anywhere the bureaucracy got in the way of common sense but that did n't make it any less illegal , or any less inconvenient
park city , utah , jan 24 this month marks one year since nick yarris was released from prison after having spent 23 years behind bars , many of them in solitary confinement and on death row , for a murder he did not commit dna testing proved his innocence upon his release , he was given no money , no housing , no training , no therapy and no apology but he is not an angry or bitter man in fact , mr yarris , 43 , is remarkably composed and articulate in discussing his fate and that of others who have been released after wrongful conviction they are featured in a new documentary , after innocence , at the sundance film festival , where viewers leaped to their feet , many in tears , at the end of the first screening on saturday what were my choices \? he said after seeing the film for the first time , when asked how he could seem so sane i could , a \) be really devastated and angry and let them continue to own me , or b \) i could have fun b sounds better he continued i realized at some point that everyone in my family was waiting for me , hoping for me the lowest insult would be if i came out destroyed , a broken man , bitter and angry and it was survival my survival technique was to become a good man for all his eloquence , mr yarris is far from on solid ground he still has no job , no permanent home and no money still , he is in much better condition emotionally than many of the other exonerees featured in the film , all of whom were released , often after years of struggling to get dna testing in their cases , with no amends by the state \( more than a dozen states have passed laws providing compensation for convicts who are later exonerated , though most of the men in the film , including mr yarris , who is from pennsylvania , are from states that have none \) jessica sanders , the film s director as well as its coproducer and screenwriter , met 30 exonerees at a conference in 2002 i was so moved by the stories of these men , and shocked that nothing was being done for them , she said i knew that a film had to be made showtime developed the project , though the producers are also seeking a theatrical distributor ms sanders was introduced to the men through the film s coproducer and writer , marc simon , who as a law student volunteered at the innocence project , a nonprofit group run by barry c scheck and peter j neufeld that focuses on freeing the innocent , frequently through dna testing while that effort continues the group has helped free more than 150 wrongfully convicted inmates in the last 13 years there has been little attention to what happens to the men after their release some depend on welfare and on their already burdened families without their families , these guys would be homeless , mr simon said wilton dedge , a softspoken , blondhaired man , was released five months ago after serving 22 years in prison in florida for sexual battery and burglary in 2001 , dna tests of a hair , a central piece of material evidence in his conviction , proved it was not his , but the prosecution continued to fight to keep him in jail more advanced dna testing of semen won his release last year if the state had their way , i 'd still be in jail , mr dedge said quietly , nursing a beer at the postscreening lunch they do n't want to admit they messed up mr dedge learned welding in prison and since his release has found some parttime work for a tree service all i got was a basic form letter apologizing for what happened , not admitting they did anything wrong , he said but it seemed pretty hollow , after all the names they called me in court they were n't man enough to step forward and apologize to my face that disappointed me last october , mr yarris traveled to london to address the british parliament about the death penalty and his proposal for an economic embargo against pennsylvania while there , he met karen karbritz , 30 they plan to be married in may , and he hopes to start a new life with her in england i'm going to go , to try my best to have the things i wanted , he said , adding , i was waiting , hoping for a chance just to live now the greatest respect i can have for her for trusting me is by loving her , and to thank her just for holding me
cambridge , mass since 9 11 , president bush and his advisers have engaged in a series of arguments concerning the relation between freedom , tyranny and terrorism the president s inaugural paean to freedom was the culmination of these arguments the stratagem began immediately after 9 11 with the president s claims that the terrorist attacks were a deliberate assault on america s freedom the next stage of the argument came after no weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq , thus eliminating the reason for the war , and it took the form of a bogus syllogism all terrorists are tyrants who hate freedom saddam hussein is a tyrant who hates freedom therefore saddam hussein is a terrorist whose downfall was a victory in the war against terrorism when this bogus syllogism began to lose public appeal , it was shored up with another flawed argument that was repeated during the campaign tyranny breeds terrorism freedom is opposed to tyranny therefore the promotion of freedom is the best means of fighting terrorism promoting freedom , of course , is a noble and highly desirable pursuit if america were to make the global diffusion of freedom a central pillar of its foreign policy , it would be cause for joy the way the present administration has gone about this task , however , is likely to have the opposite effect moreover , what the president means by freedom may get lost in translation to the rest of the world the administration s notion of freedom has been especially convenient , and its promotion of it especially cynical in the first place , there is no evidence to support , and no good reason to believe , that al qaeda s attack on america was primarily motivated by a hatred of freedom osama bin laden is clearly no lover of freedom , but this is an irrelevance the attack on america was motivated by religious and cultural fanaticism second , while it may be implicitly true that all terrorists are tyrants , it does not follow that all tyrants are terrorists the united states , of all nations , should know this over the past century it has supported a succession of tyrannical states with murderous records of oppression against their own people , none of which were terrorist states argentina and brazil under military rule , augusto pinochet s chile , south africa under apartheid , to list but a few today , one of america s closest allies in the fight against tyranny is tyrannical pakistan , and one of its biggest trading partners is the authoritarian communist regime of china third , while the goal of promoting democracy is laudable , there is no evidence that free states are less likely to breed terrorists sadly , the very freedoms guaranteed under the rule of law are likely to shelter terrorists , especially within states making the transition from authoritarian to democratic rule transitional democratic states , like russia today , are more violent than the authoritarian ones they replaced and even advanced democratic regimes have been known to breed terrorists , the best example being the united states itself for more than half a century a terrorist organization , the ku klux klan , flourished in this country according to the fbi , three of every four terrorist acts in the united states from 1980 to 2000 were committed by americans the president speaks eloquently and no doubt sincerely of freedom both abroad and at home but it is plain for the world to see that there is a discrepancy between his words and his actions he claims that freedom must be chosen and defended by citizens , yet his administration is in the process of imposing democracy at the point of a gun in iraq at home , he seeks to make our society more prosperous and just and equal , yet during his first term there has been a great redistribution of income from working people to the wealthy as well as declining real income and job security for many americans furthermore , he has presided over the erosion of civil liberties stemming from the patriot act is this pure hypocrisy or is there another explanation for the discrepancy , and for mr bush s perplexing sincerity \? there is no gainsaying an element of hypocrisy here but it is perhaps no greater than usual in speeches of this nature the problem is that what the president means by freedom , and what the world hears when he says it , are not the same in the 20th century two versions of freedom emerged in america the modern liberal version emphasizes civil liberties , political participation and social justice it is the version formally extolled by the federal government , debated by philosophers and taught in schools it still informs the american judicial system and it is the version most treasured by foreigners who struggle for freedom in their own countries but most ordinary americans view freedom in quite different terms in their minds , freedom has been radically privatized its most striking feature is what is left out politics , civic participation and the celebration of traditional rights , for instance freedom is largely a personal matter having to do with relations with others and success in the world freedom , in this conception , means doing what one wants and getting one s way it is measured in terms of one s independence and autonomy , on the one hand , and one s influence and power , on the other it is experienced most powerfully in mobility both socioeconomic and geographic in many ways this is the triumph of the classic 19thcentury version of freedom , the version that philosophers and historians preached but society never quite achieved this 19thcentury freedom must now coexist with the more modern version of freedom it does so by acknowledging the latter but not necessarily including it it is not that americans have rejected the formal model of freedom ask any american if he believes in democracy and a free press and he will genuinely endorse both rather it is that such abstract notions of freedom are far removed from their notion of what freedom means and how it is experienced the genius of president bush is that he has acquired an exquisite grasp of this development in american political culture , and he can play both versions of freedom to his advantage because he so easily empathizes with the ordinary american s privatized view of freedom , the president was relatively immune from criticism that he disregarded more traditional measures of freedom like civil liberties in the privatized conception of freedom that he and his followers share , the abuses of the patriot act play little or no part \( there are times , of course , when the president must voice support for the modern liberal version of freedom the inaugural is such a day , prescribed by law and marked by ceremony , as he ruefully noted \) yet while these inconsistencies may not bother the president s followers or harm his standing in america , they matter to the rest of the world few foreigners are even aware of america s hybrid conception of freedom , much less accepting of it in most of the rest of the world , the president s inaugural address was heard merely as hypocrisy oped contributor orlando patterson , a professor of sociology at harvard , is the author of freedom in the making of western culture and a forthcoming book on the meaning of freedom in the united states
disco was dead , but the floor lived on in the early 1980 s , i played bass in a band called the zones there were five of us , and we all went to edward r murrow high school in midwood , brooklyn we did a lot of shows , had a little following , but the performances i remember most vividly were the three that we played in bay ridge at 2001 odyssey the club was immortalized as the place where john travolta had danced in saturday night fever people seemed to get a kick out of seeing us there we 'd crowd on to the low wooden stage and blast through our set , the songs coming fast , one after another , the famous dance floor s geometric pattern of primary colors tinting our sweaty faces blue and then red and then blue again until it was blacked out by all those dancing feet now the club , renamed spectrum , is closing , and that floor will be auctioned off april 1 it will most likely be bought by someone attached to those disco years , either nostalgically or as a way to make money , and so the floor on which all those feet slid and bounced and spun on all those saturday nights will find a new home but for me , because of the shows i played there , 2001 odyssey has nothing to do with disco i'm too young for that nor does the place have anything to do with its most recent incarnation , as a dance club with a mostly gay clientele , where europeans with guidebooks in hand would stop by for a glimpse of the floor for me , 2001 odyssey exists somewhere in the middle , after its heyday , but before it became a tourist spot it exists forever in the early 1980 s when five teenagers keyboards , guitar , bass and two drummers performing a set of covers and songs they wrote themselves , could rent it out , fill it up and make a little money and it exists in what must be one of the stranger periods in its history , a period about which any future buyer of that floor should be aware at the time , 2001 odyssey was an allmale strip club do n't be alarmed our band had nothing to dowith stripping the place was open six days aweek we played on the seventh , when the strippers had the night off it was simple we 'd call up , tell them when we wanted to play , and we 'd be booked the charge at the door was 4 we 'd take 3 and the house would take 1 anyone who has ever played in a band will tell you that that s a generous deal for the musicians the house would take the bar profit , but since our audience consisted mostly of our fellow students and our parents , i'm not sure much liquor was consumed it was a big room with a decent sound system the bar ran along one wall , and small tables and chairs filled the back the only evidence of its sixdayaweek existence was in the little dressing room behind the stage , where management had posted a list of acts the performers were banned from engaging in none of them can be reprinted here , but none of them would have fit into our act , anyway we 'd arrive in the afternoon , the club dark and the floor dormant , and set up our equipment then we 'd wait in that little room as the place filled up outside the closed door our girlfriends would poke their heads in and shriek in happy embarrassment when we pointed out the list then we 'd take the stage the first time i played there , in december 1982 , we opened with a cover of i ca n't turn you loose , faked a fadeout , and then segued into an original number called jump the gun in which jamal , one of the drummers , sang , i just called to say hello and people in the audience yelled back hello ! at about this point the floor was switched on the audience gasped , and then applauded , and then the first pairs of silhouetted teenage feet stepped out , tentatively , until the floor was gone i'm not sure how we ended up with two drummers , but they sure looked great on that stage , all those cymbals swiveling around , the fills thundering and mirroring each other perfectly we were pretty active when we played , running all around , and by the time we were done , we were soaked in sweat we 'd break down our equipment with our ears ringing as the place emptied out , the floor dark again then we 'd get our share of the door take , mostly in singles funny thing about that floor and that money it allowed the zones to live forever the last time we played there , in november 1983 , we made 300 meaning 100 people came to see us we took that money , and dave , the keyboard player , booked us at a recording studio in the music building on eighth avenue in manhattan for some reason , he scheduled our hours straight through the night he said he did this to get us a better rate , but i'm not sure that s true i think he just liked the idea of a nocturnal recording session , everyone flying on coffee on six tracks we recorded our songs and the tracks went on quarterinch tape and the tape went in a box and the box went in a closet decades passed but not too long ago , dave , who lives in westchester and works in connecticut , found the tape , cleaned it up , remastered it and burned it onto cd s then he gave us all copies so now i can play that cd in my apartment , my 5yearold and my 1yearold running around , and in every note see and hear it all over again five teenagers , lots of greasy hair , swiveling cymbals , mirroring fills , thrashing guitar and shrieking keyboards and that floor , flashing on and off in red , yellow and blue , making the audience gasp , illuminating the bottoms of our girlfriends' sneakers
washington , oct 5 a growing chorus of conservatives from republican senators to the columnist george f will cast skepticism on wednesday on president bush s selection of harriet e miers for the supreme court , expressing worry not only about unanswered questions on her legal philosophy but also about her legal credentials there are a lot more people men , women and minorities that are more qualified , in my opinion , by their experience than she is , senator trent lott , republican of mississippi , told msnbc on wednesday right now , i'm not satisfied with what i know i'm not comfortable with the nomination , so we 'll just have to work through the process senator george allen , republican of virginia , considered a potential presidential candidate , said that people who i have a great deal of admiration for had said they were disappointed or deflated by the choice i want to be assured that she is not going to be another souter , mr allen said , referring to justice david h souter , a george hw bush appointee who has upheld abortion rights and other liberal precedents i understand the president knows her well , but i do n't the administration sent ed gillespie , the former republican party chairman helping to shepherd ms miers through senate hearings , to shore up support at a weekly meeting of conservative organizers convened wednesday by the strategist grover norquist there , mr gillespie was pelted by criticism that the president had failed to pick a committed conservative or a legal star there was pretty much unanimity , said one conservative who spoke anonymously because confidentiality was a condition of the meeting morale is low right now at the base ms miers , meanwhile , continued her rounds of capitol hill senator mike dewine , republican of ohio , pronounced her tough as nails after an hourlong meeting with her responding to criticism that ms miers had never been a judge , mr dewine praised the breadth of her practical experience in the white house and in her long career as a private lawyer she is somebody who has gone out late at night to get someone out of jail , mr dewine said she had told him none of the senators who spoke with her said they discussed constitutional issues she listens more than she talks , said senator orrin g hatch , republican of utah democrats , delighted by the division on the right , pushed ms miers to repudiate assurances about her views that the administration has reportedly made through private conversations or closed conference calls with conservatives no supreme court nomination should be conducted by winks and nods , said senator patrick j leahy of vermont , the ranking democrat on the judiciary committee referring to statements by the evangelical conservative james c dobson that he had been given confidential information about ms miers s views , mr leahy said i asked her about that specifically i said , 'has anybody been authorized to speak on your behalf or have you spoken to anybody about how you would vote \? ' she assured me , 'absolutely not' i said , 'would you disavow anybody who send out assurances that they know how you would vote \? ' she said , 'absolutely ' after a meeting on wednesday of the socalled gang of 14 , a bipartisan group of senators who agreed earlier to block filibusters against judicial nominees except in extraordinary circumstances , several members of both parties said they agreed that so far ms miers did not set off alarm bells , as senator susan collins , republican of maine , put it if the republican majority of 55 senators votes on party lines , a filibuster would be the only way democrats could block a nominee on wednesday , however , the democrats mostly stood back as conservatives took aim at the selection of ms miers mr will , a conservative essayist , made the case for her rejection in a syndicated column published on wednesday there is no evidence that she is among the leading lights of american jurisprudence , or that she possesses talents commensurate with the supreme court s tasks , he wrote if 100 legal experts had each recommended 100 top candidates for the supreme court , mr will added , miers s name probably would not have appeared in any of the 10 , 000 places on those lists mr gillespie , who also attended a lunch of the senate republicans to make the case for ms miers , acknowledged pointed questions from conservatives he said he had told mr norquist s meeting about her distinguished career as a lawyer , her work shoulder to shoulder with the president and her central work moving forward conservative nominees to the federal judiciary the more people on the conservative side of the spectrum know about her , the stronger their support will get , mr gillespie said christian conservatives , who see the vacancy left by justice sandra day o'connor s retirement as the chance to turn the tide in 30 years of culture wars over abortion and social issues , continued to complain that ms miers had no public record of her legal approach to such subjects dr dobson , founder and chairman of focus on the family and one of a handful of prominent christian conservatives to support the selection of ms miers publicly , said in his radio program wednesday there has been a firestorm of activity since then this nomination has angered and disillusioned many conservatives , many christian conservatives explaining his reasons for supporting her and praying for guidance , dr dobson cited her religious faith and said he knew her conservative evangelical church i know the person who brought her to the lord , he said i have talked at length to people that know her and have known her for a long time dr dobson acknowledged conversations with karl rove , the president s top political adviser , about the selection but declined to disclose their contents you will have to trust me on this one , he said , adding that if he was wrong , the blood of those babies aborted fetuses will be on my hands to some degree but gary bauer , president of the christian conservative group american values , said that he remained unconvinced about ms miers despite her religious views as of today , not one friend , associate , coworker or white house official is able to produce one sentence she has written or spoken in criticism of roe v wade , he wrote in an email newsletter to supporters her apparent silence is troubling at least to me senator john thune , republican of south dakota , said he , too , was nervous about ms miers but also about a fight within his party i do n't think that an intraparty battle is what we need , he said but i think before too long the left is going to go off on her , and that will effectively bring everybody together
albany , april 12 democrats in the state assembly closed the door tuesday on reviving the death penalty in new york state this year , handing a significant victory to opponents of capital punishment who are trying to build national momentum barring a longshot procedural maneuver by assembly republicans , the state s death penalty law now appears likely to stay off the books for some years to come new york s top court struck down the law in june , finding a central element of its sentencing provisions unconstitutional , and democratic resistance is unlikely to change soon because of entrenched incumbency in albany new york now joins a handful of states where politicians have stepped away from death penalty laws that their predecessors passed after the united states supreme court restored capital punishment in 1976 thirtyeight states have enacted capital punishment since then , the most recent being new york in 1995 , although no one was executed under the law this is a historic step by new york , which is the first state in a long , long time to scrutinize the death penalty with public hearings , debate it , and then essentially reject it , said richard dieter , executive director of death penalty information center , a nonprofit group that has been critical of capital punishment in practice opponents from around the nation helped pack a capitol hearing room on tuesday to mark the vote by a powerful assembly committee that effectively killed the legislation afterward , they hailed it as a signal moment in the legal and political battles around the issue , noting that some lawmakers who voted for the 1995 law had now changed their minds , citing fairness and fallibility , a shift they hope to encourage elsewhere there is going to be a ripple effect coming out of albany against capital punishment , no question , said shari silberstein , who attended the hearings and is codirector of the quixote center , a group that describes itself as faithbased and is pressing for moratoriums on executions when a major state like new york moves away from the death penalty , other states take notice and ask questions of their own the defeat at democrats' hands could also inject an uncertain political element into the 2006 races for governor and the legislature in new york george e pataki proved the emotional appeal of the death penalty in 1994 when he beat gov mario m cuomo in part by promising voters that he , unlike mr cuomo , would sign a capital punishment law mr pataki , a republican who plans to disclose by summer if he will seek a fourth term , said on tuesday that it was outrageous for democrats to derail the death penalty in a committee the assembly leadership s so what' attitude toward criminals , whether they 're sex offenders , deadly drivers , or heinous murderers , is simply shameful , mr pataki said the leader of the assembly republicans , charles h nesbitt , said the fight was not over , suggesting that the republican party might try to attach a death penalty amendment to an unrelated bill in hopes of forcing a floor vote while republicans predicted tough going , they also said they could threaten to use the issue as an electionyear wedge the likely democratic nominee for governor , attorney general eliot spitzer , also supports the death penalty , but it is unclear whether he would be drawn into a showdown on the issue darren dopp , a spokesman for mr spitzer , said yesterday that the attorney general would not comment lawmakers in connecticut , nebraska and new mexico have tried to overhaul or repeal their death penalty laws in recent years , but none have gone as far as the assembly in effectively consigning the law to limbo for the time being a moratorium is in place in illinois , and a lawsuit aimed at the kansas law is in the courts the assembly s action on tuesday came at a halfhour meeting of the codes committee , which voted 11 to 7 against allowing a full assembly vote on a bill to adjust the death penalty law and satisfy the constitutional objections of the state court of appeals the state senate approved a virtually identical bill in march by a vote of 37 to 22 , and mr pataki had pledged to sign the legislation the 11 nays came from democrats the committee s four republicans and three other democrats voted to send the bill to the floor of the assembly , where it was likely to have faced a close vote the death penalty is , in effect , killed for this year , said assemblyman joseph r lentol , a brooklyn democrat who is chairman of the committee a fiery 20minute debate among committee members preceded the vote , although its brevity contrasted with the 40 hours of emotional testimony at five public hearings held by the committee and two other panels this winter assemblyman mark weprin , a queens democrat , said he could not support the death penalty when he believed that there were innocent people on death row i just do n't know how you explain that to a mother whose child is completely innocent and who is murdered by the state for something they did n't do , mr weprin said that remark drew a measure of scorn from a republican on the committee , david r townsend jr , who implored the panel to permit all assembly members to have a chance to vote i would say to you , mark , and everybody here , what do we say to the innocent wife , mother , son , daughter , husband of the innocent police officer , the innocent firefighter , the innocent corrections officer , the innocent parole officer , the innocent ems person , whose had their life needlessly taken in a homicide \? mr townsend said mr lentol , mindful that the legislature once regularly sent death penalty bills to mr cuomo only to see them vetoed , assured his colleagues that the debate was sure to continue the nature of politics being what it is , it will be brought up again and again for years to come , mr lentol said

faizobod , tajikistan , feb 27 parliamentary elections on sunday in two of the former soviet union s most remote and impoverished republics , tajikistan and kyrgyzstan , were met early by complaints of violations and irregularities of the kind that led to challenges in ukraine and georgia preliminary results here and in kyrgyzstan are not expected until monday , but initial reports from international observers seemed to suggest that both governments were continuing on authoritarian paths , trying to shut out opposition groups despite promising free and fair elections it does n't look like there s any improvement over 2000 , when elections in kyrgyzstan were widely condemned as unacceptable , said an elections monitor for the organization for security and cooperation in europe , in a telephone interview from kyrgyzstan s capital , bishkek the observer insisted on anonymity until a formal appraisal of vote results on monday observers in tajikistan said the vote there showed signs of significant manipulation we are getting reports of widespread multiple voting and unrealistically high turnout figures , said peter eicher , the european monitoring group s head of mission in the country in tajikistan , president emomali rakhmonov has steadily moved to take power in his own hands since an agreement in 1997 ended a civil war and promised power sharing with the country s islamic opposition they pretend they are building a democratic society , because without it , the west will not cooperate with them economically and politically , said muhiddin kabiri , the leader of the country s largest opposition group , the islamic revival party so they announce they will have a fair election with a lot of fanfare , they pass improved election laws , and then a week before it , they start violating their laws and their promises and they go back to falsifying the results because they 're afraid to take any risks , he said sunday during a drive to his constituency in faizobod , near the capital , dushanbe the united states has been supportive of mr rakhmonov , who came to power in 1992 during a fiveyear civil war that killed 100 , 000 people the american ambassador , richard hoagland , said that since then , mr rakhmonov has done a remarkable job of bringing stability to the country but political analysts , including the international crisis group , a nonprofit group based in brussels that works for conflict resolution , say stability has come at a high price mr rakhmonov has amassed nearabsolute power , pushing through constitutional changes that allow him to be reelected until 2020 he held substandard elections in 2000 that gave two seats to the islamic party and none to other opposition parties , and two years ago fired all the opposition figures he had hired under the 1997 agreement pluralism is accepted as long as it does not threaten the status quo , the crisis group wrote in its latest report on tajikistan of the six existing parties , the president s popular democratic party , an offshoot of the old soviet communist party , dominates political and economic life in this nation of six million people membership is de rigueur not only for civil servants , but also for owners of large businesses the chairman of the party s central committee , muso asozoda , said that all parties should be represented in parliament and that the elections were fully free and fair he dismissed as hypocritical complaints that an 800 deposit imposed on all candidates returnable only if the candidate is elected and equivalent to eight years of average wages prevented many opposition figures from running those are lies , he said in an interview they all drive 30 , 000 mercedeses while tajikistan s election campaign was subdued to the point of near invisibility candidates were allowed a single 15minute speech on television a more liberal atmosphere pervaded in kyrgyzstan there , a physicist named askar akayev with no ties to the old communist power structure was elected president in 1990 and charmed the west with his embrace of nongovernmental organizations and western values but elections five years ago failed to meet international standards , and he has responded to accusations of nepotism and corruption by muzzling the news media he has come under criticism for helping the candidacies of his daughter and son last week , thousands of demonstrators protested the disqualification on a technicality of an opposition candidate and former diplomat , roza otunbayeva , who was running against dr akayev s daughter , bermet akayeva the elections in the two countries seemed to be continuing a rough stretch for democracy among former soviet republics popular uprisings overturned fixed votes in ukraine and georgia in the past year and an improved election law in kazakhstan seemed to make little difference in the parliamentary vote there last fall that ended in a complete shutout of the opposition the sole challenging candidate to win a seat refused to take it in protest

, but it offers up enough interesting fragments to make his sophomore effort worth watching for \( stevens \) 'a decent factory' \( no rating , 79 minutes , in english , finnish and chinese \) a cursory , irritatingly facile look at the human cost of globalization , this documentary film was shot and directed by a frenchman , thomas balm \? who tagged along with representatives of the finnish

many computeranimated features , this one , about four celebrityvoiced animals exiled from the central park zoo expends most of its imaginative resources on clever visuals these , in the end , are not

little more than glimpses \( scott \) 'march of the penguins' \( g , 80 minutes \) the sentimental but riveting documentary follows the oneyear mating cycle of emperor penguins in antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs narrated by morgan freeman , the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions \( holden \) 'mr and mrs smith' \( pg13 , 112 minutes \) what counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we wo n't really notice or at least mind the cutrate writing \( from simon kinberg \) and occasionally incoherent action \( from the director doug liman \) sometimes brad pitt and angelina jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait , sometimes they do n't , which is why their new joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag \(

pay attention next time you rip open a cardboard box you may be entering into a contract without realizing it a recent decision in the ninth circuit court of appeals reinforced the right of companies , in this case lexmark international , the printer maker , to legally limit what customers can do with a patented product , given that the company spells out conditions and restrictions on a package label known as a boxtop license clickable license agreements are common practice in software , where the buyer agrees not to tamper with the code or copy the program but slapping postsale regulations on patented goods could deny buyers the ability to make modifications or seek repairs on other products as well boxtop licenses could also theoretically hinder third parties from offering replacement parts or supplies for fear of a patentinfringement lawsuit \( meaning , for example , that a lighter might have to be refueled only with the manufacturer s brand of butane \) in the lawsuit , the arizona cartridge remanufacturers association , a trade group of companies that sell refilled printer cartridges , claimed that lexmark was engaging in unfair and deceptive business practices by promising price discounts on its laser cartridges if the customer promised to return the empty cartridge to lexmark lexmark s packaging for laser cartridges sold under this system \( called the lexmark cartridge rebate , or the prebate program \) includes a label on the outside of the box stating opening this package or using the patented cartridge inside confirms your acceptance of the following license agreement cartridges that are not part of the prebate program and not subject to the restriction are available to customers as well , but without the discount at the time of the case , lexmark estimated that cartridge returns had increased 300 percent since the prebate program began lawyers for the remanufacturers' association argued that lexmark deceptively suggested that the notice on the outside of the package created an enforceable agreement with consumers to return the used cartridges , and that the promise of a price discount was false because lexmark could not control prices charged by retailers lexmark also uses an electronic chip on the cartridges to communicate with the printer , which refuses to operate with cartridges that lack the chip the association cited that as an unfair business practice the court ruled in lexmark s favor on aug 30 , citing the previous case of mallinckrodt inc v medipart inc , a 1992 circuit court decision in a medical equipment case that allowed patent owners to limit the use of their products after sale the court also concluded that lexmark s pricing claims were accurate and that acra failed to establish that lexmark s cartridge chip amounted to unfair competition some frugal printer owners wondered if the decision would make it illegal to refill their inkjet cartridges at home , a concern that a lexmark spokesman dismissed lexmark s cartridge return program deals exclusively with laser printer toner cartridges it does not involve any inkjet products , said tim fitzpatrick , the vice president of corporate communications for lexmark , who said that the program almost entirely involved business customers the court s decision was very specifically about this program , he said fred von lohmann , a senior attorney with the electronic frontier foundation and author of a 2004 amicus brief supporting acra , said he was more concerned about future implications of the decision this certainly sent a very strong message to patent holders generally , and lexmark in particular , that you can use these labels in order to restrict what your customers can do with the product after they buy it , he said mr von lohmann gave several hypothetical examples of how boxtop licenses could be used , including automobile manufacturers who might put a label on a new car stating that by opening the door for the first time , the new owner agreed to use only the manufacturer s replacement parts and to avoid modifying the car owners of patents would love to be able to control what you can do with a product after you buy it , he said that s new the rule for most of a century has been , 'you buy it , you own it ' lexmark was recently involved in another lawsuit against a north carolinabased company , static control components in the case , lexmark sued under provisions in the digital millennium copyright act to keep static control from reverseengineering lexmark s cartridge chips so that remanufactured cartridges from other vendors would work in lexmark printers static control ultimately won the copyright fight after the united states supreme court declined lexmark s petition in june ronald s katz , a lawyer for manatt , phelps phillips , which represented acra in the suit , said that while the continuation of lexmark s return program would not put companies that reclaim and refill laser printer cartridges out of business , it basically makes it harder for them to compete the trade association , he added , is not pursuing the case further although legal analysts who followed both lawsuits expressed concerns that lexmark was trying to create a cartridge monopoly for its printers , the ruling in the static control case does allow that company to keep making chips that communicate with lexmark s printers this is about customer choice , said mr fitzpatrick of lexmark the court has ruled in favor of customer choice a footnote in the court s written opinion stated that the decision would not preclude a consumer from raising challenges to the boxtop contract in his supporting brief , mr von lohmann argued that the decision in the medical equipment case , which was cited in the lexmark case , was wrongly decided the courts started saying , 'well , you bought it , you own it unless they put a condition on it that you agreed to when you bought it , ' said mr von lohmann he cited the 1873 case of adams v burke , in which a coffinlid manufacturer attempted to restrict where its patented product could be used the courts correctly said that s ridiculous , mr von lohmann said when you buy a coffin , you can plant the guy wherever you want it s none of the patent owners' business once you bought that coffin and where you put it in the ground but would the coffin case have come out differently if the manufacturer had put a label on the outside \? that s the concern , he said
an hivpositive man admitted yesterday that he tried to kill four police detectives by spitting saliva and blood in their faces at a harlem police station in 2003 , the authorities said he also admitted to biting a psychiatric orderly a year later at a hospital where he was held after his arrest jury selection was to begin today in the trial of the man , robert murray , 32 , but he abruptly accepted a plea deal , in which he agreed to admit his guilt in five counts of seconddegree attempted murder , in exchange for a 13year prison sentence his case had attracted comparison in some quarters to the film silence of the lambs , in which the character hannibal lecter is so dangerous that he wears a restrictive suit in court appearances , mr murray had repeatedly threatened to attack people around him , including judges and his own lawyers , said his most recent lawyer , michael a rodi as a result , even though mr murray was found fit for trial by court psychiatrists , he was ordered to wear a shoulderlength spit mask , ankle shackles , handcuffs and hand mitts made from orange foam mr rodi said his client was warned by justice william a wetzel in court yesterday that he would have to wear this during his trial it started to dawn on him , 'how am i going to get a fair trial wearing this mask \? ' mr rodi said he said , 'i do n't want to go through with this , ' and decided to take what they were offering i think it would be hard to get a fair and impartial jury trying the case with him in the hannibal lecter suit and spit mask each of mr murray s victims was tested repeatedly over a year for hiv , but none contracted it , mr rodi said two victims who might have ingested mr murray s blood underwent an intense regimen of antihiv medication one of them , sgt margaret timlin , 35 , now of the department s internal affairs bureau , said in an interview last night that she helped arrest mr murray in 2003 on the prostitution charge he attacked her while she tried to handcuff him in the holding cell he spit in my face , eyes and mouth and then said , 'i have hiv , and i hope you get it , ' she said it was absolutely horrible your whole future flashes before your eyes the lead prosecutor on the case , an assistant district attorney , matthew bassiur , said that mr murray was scheduled to be sentenced on sept 7 this was a very serious case involving many victims , he told justice wetzel in court some of these victims lived in fear they had contracted hiv the trial in state supreme court in manhattan stemmed from charges that mr murray spit saliva and blood into the faces of four police detectives trying to process him at the 25th precinct station house in harlem after he was arrested on april 8 , 2003 , on charges of promoting prostitution he was also accused of biting a large chunk of skin out of the arm of an orderly on june 7 , 2004 , at a psychiatric hospital where he was being held after each attack , prosecutors said , mr murray screamed that he was infected with hiv and that the victims would contract the disease and die mr rodi , who was appointed by the court to defend mr murray , added i was his fourth lawyer and he did n't even want me he came after me a couple times in the courtroom , but he was always wearing the mitts he said that mr murray , if convicted , would have faced consecutive sentences of 25 years for each of the five charges mr rodi said that mr murray had no immediate family or friends , had been orphaned at a young age and had lived most of his life in orphanages , shelters and jails he s in this situation because of a breakdown by the mental health system , mr rodi said i mean , who s crazier than this guy \? he was institutionalized by age 8 he should n't have been out in the streets
islamabad , pakistan , july 19 three and a half years ago , in a speech that crystallized a postsept 11 turnaround , president pervez musharraf vowed to eradicate extremism in his country we will take strict action against any pakistani who is involved in terrorism inside the country or abroad , he said that was pakistan , jan 12 , 2002 this week , evidence that three of the four london bombing suspects had visited pakistan for up to three months last year has thrown new light on old facts despite government promises and denials , radical groups continue to operate in pakistan religious schools , or madrasas , still indoctrinate and recruit wouldbe militants to fight abroad several leaders and members of these extremist groups , arrested in 2002 , are back on the street militant training camps remain one western diplomat said they have just changed addresses now , pakistani officials have answered the london attacks with an investigation into any potential links here and calls for a fresh crackdown on militant groups but the question arises whether the new steps will be any more effective in snuffing out extremism than efforts past on monday , an editorial in the daily times , an englishlanguage newspaper , asked in a headline is pakistan still a launchpad for terrorism \? if the london bombing suspects did arrive here seeking contacts with extremists , they may not have been the only ones , american and pakistani officials say another young briton of pakistani descent , zeeshan siddique , was arrested on his visit here last may he is being investigated for ties to radical islamist groups and bomb plots in london a journal kept by mr siddique includes a march 6 , 2005 , entry , in which he laments that one of his contacts is chickening out a week later , he learned that wagon is now called off british officials are trying to discern whether wagon refers to a planned attack it s an embarrassment to say the least , said a close confidante of general musharraf , referring to potential pakistani connections to the london attack on tuesday , a leader of the country s islamist political alliance announced that the police had detained one of the group s senior aides for questioning about the london bombings in the heart of islamabad , the capital , the police raided two mosques , setting off protests by hundreds of angry religious students wielding sticks on the record , officials caution against jumping to conclusions about pakistan s role in the london attacks they vehemently deny the existence of training camps they say madrasa reform has begun and will be speeded up they point out that militant groups have been officially banned , and that hundreds of pakistani troops have died confronting al qaeda and taliban forces in tribal areas near the afghan border visiting pakistan does not mean there is a connection to the bombing , the foreign ministry spokesman , naeem khan , said tuesday president musharraf has repeatedly stated we will not let extremism and terrorism flourish in pakistan there is a total commitment on the part of the government of pakistan you have to do it step by step but diplomats , analysts and even some religious leaders concede that the words have lacked teeth off a narrow alley in lahore s ancient walled city , one progovernment religious leader said that , bans aside , some groups are quietly allowed to function what they were doing , they are doing still , said the leader , ajmal qadri , the head of a seminary inspired by the austere deobandi sect they are recruiting people they are having missions in kashmir their training is still going on officially they are banned actually they are working on the front of his seminary still hangs the signboard of the armed faction of his own group , jamiatulmujahedeen mr qadri insists his group is not involved in armed campaigns anywhere he said he admired general musharraf s principles of stamping out extremist activity he also recognized that there was no use coming down too hard on religious radicals with a large following , and he did not expect anything terribly onerous after the london bombings a case in point the former leader of lashkaretaiba , hafiz saeed , was arrested shortly after general musharraf s speech in january 2002 and released on the order of a lahore court a year later he has renounced his ties to the militant wing and spawned a new political party called jamaatuddaawa , with 137 madrasas under its wing through a spokesman , mr saeed refused to be interviewed by a woman journalist since general musharraf first vowed the crackdown , a familiar pattern has played out a brazen attack is followed by a widely publicized response groups are banned militants are arrested that s the usual pattern , they go after them , then after two months they relax , said hasan askari rizvi , a military analyst in lahore that gives these groups some breathing space so they can survive for years , a central question has been how to handle the militant groups unleashed 25 years ago by the pakistani military , with american backing , first to wage war in afghanistan and then in india today , even general musharraf s backers acknowledge that training camps continue to be used by groups favored by the government to fight indian forces in kashmir aides close to general musharraf warned that a sweeping assault on all militant groups could cause an open insurgency we do n't want to have an iraqlike or afghanistanlike situation in pakistan , said one close adviser it will be bad for pakistan and bad for the us government officials continue to make the argument that they made three years ago that the best way to contain extremism is to coopt some islamist groups , particularly those that enjoy popular support for fighting indian forces , and isolate others opponents of general musharraf , on the other hand , have argued for years that the government simply does not realize that the good jihadi bad jihadi strategy does not work once they leave training camps , militants cannot be so easily directed general musharraf s backers in the west , who also acknowledge that the training camps still function , counsel patience , even as they express frustration with the slow pace of change i do n't think they can say , 'damn it , we 're resolved and now those groups are gone , ' one western diplomat said there s a question of how aggressive they 're going to be at the same time , they say , to back away from general musharraf s government would be counterproductive for us to say , 'you 're part of the problem and not part of the solution' and pack up and leave would be catastrophic , the diplomat added on monday the president , in a speech to a youth group , called for a jihad against extremism and promised a robust crackdown on militant organizations and the madrasas that fuel them last week , he scolded his police chiefs for not doing enough to enforce a ban against militant groups , ordering them to defy interference from pakistan s notorious military intelligence agency it was an implicit acknowledgment of a longrunning complaint after militants are arrested , the police say , the intelligence agency then orders some to be freed the leaders of the religious groups have staunchly opposed general musharraf s proposed interference in their affairs banning religious organizations is not the solution , said qari habibur rahman , head of sipahesahaba in faisalabad , which was banned by president musharraf in 2002 they have banned such organizations and have seen the results as well muhammad yahya mujahid , 44 , a spokesman for mr saeed s group , seemed none too bothered about the president s latest promises i ca n't imagine a pakistan government crackdown on an organization that is permitted under the law , he said
it was eight months ago , on a frigid january night , that i met josh i was a lost cause i had just learned that my most recent boyfriend had cheated on me with one of my girlfriends in a moment of sheer insanity , i ventured out of my lower east side walkup to park slope , brooklyn , to cheer myself up at what promised to be a wild party at the home of a woman i 'd met via the internet i arrived at my destination , where my soontobeotherhalf opened the door he was the owner of the apartment and the host of the party we started talking and realized quickly that we had absolutely nothing in common from the type of music we felt passionately about to our upbringing to the type of lettuce we liked , none of our tastes were even remotely plausible to the other this could work , i thought to myself for the next three months , i saw josh every day it was a newfound bliss to feel so comfortable around someone i was dating so when he asked me to spend the rest of my life with him , i agreed , knowing that despite our sharply different tastes , not to mention our nineyear age difference , he was the one for me to survive in manhattan , you need three things a good neighborhood dive bar , a support system of friends and a plump salary i lacked the second , and josh was in desperate need of the third he had recently left a job at the gap with nothing lined up to take its place beyond a vow to never again boxfold a tshirt he had recently applied for a position at con edison , but it would be months before he received his blue hard hat three months after we met , josh moved into my twobedroom shoebox it made sense he was there every day , he already had a set of my keys , and we could save money i had never shared a room with anyone , let alone a boyfriend i was horrible at sharing and nervous about losing some of my coveted joke of a space to his enormous irish flag , bar glasses and other male paraphernalia giving up not one but three drawers in my second dresser was like undergoing a root canal complicating matters was the fact that my roommate was scheduled to stay until at least july , so josh and i had to wait it out together in a 9by10 bedroom piles of his clothing built up on the floor , and not a morning went by that i did n't trip over a size 11 hightop sneaker the need for the other bedroom became our obsession an excessively dramatic countdown was marked on my calendar , and each night the two of us dreamed up plans for exactly was going to happen over there the most practical idea was to convert the space into an office for me , a fulltime writer other ideas included a guitar museum , a music library , a walkin closet , a home gym and an entertainment emporium the possibilities seemed golden and endless it was an overly bright and hungover morning when the moving crew pounded up the steps of our building and starting slamming furniture out the door our roommate removed his final dentistry plaque from the wall , hugged us and handed over his set of keys it was an extraordinary moment after almost three months of huddling in space the size of a large walkin closet , the entire apartment was officially ours the first thing we did was enter the newly vacated room and dance but our joy was tinged with lingering anxiety we still tensed up when we heard keys jiggling in the hallway although it was time to begin transforming the space , we were frozen for the first week the entire apartment sat untouched neither of us dared make a move the most exciting feature of our new space was the prospect of moving all the possessions lingering at our parents' houses into our new space it would be a landmark event in adulthood , not to mention completely unrealistic the spare bedroom was eight feet square only in manhattan would a room of this size appear as a huge amount of space the first thing we moved into the room was my desk and office equipment i watched with clenched teeth as josh struggled to install the cable modem it was then that we had our first big blowout you 're going to break it ! i screeched as he maneuvered my printer in place you do n't know what you 're doing yes , i do , he shot back would you just trust me already \? trust now there was a new concept with two quick motions , the modem was installed i decided to ride the momentum , my target being a carton of items that included a santa hat , a rubber alligator and pictures of old girlfriends we are now going to go through your huge box of junk that is in the corner , i announced to josh fine , he replied with a smirk but it s not junk it s memories after almost a month of this sort of thing , the spare room still held nothing but my desk we hit the affordable marketplaces ikea , target , bed bath beyond , but although we had a list , we had no theme , no color scheme by the end of a long day , all we had bought was a cartload of cleaning supplies and a utensil holder our dream was quickly becoming our burden i summoned my mother , my teenage sister and my little brother to our aid , and equipped the three of them with a dailytask list my role became that of a drill sergeant when my 8yearold brother was n't walking fast enough , i barked at him to pick up the pace as a couple , josh and i were barely passing yet the extra bedroom was beginning to look good curtains were hung , a lamp was bought , my stereo was installed , art was hung a lounge chair with matching ottoman was purchased , and a bookshelf assembled although the room is still not finished , josh and i made our first big decisions as a couple and no one was murdered in the process not yet we still dance around in the new office and occasionally bounce off the walls we have found an excessive amount of happiness in an eightfootsquare rectangle we are trying not to think about next year when it will be not just be a single room but an entire new apartment that needs redoing i hope my troops will be ready
wimbledon , england , july 4 it was the beginning of the current tennis season , and the american player james blake was sitting in the sun in melbourne , australia , feeling sorry for roger federer s new parttime coach , tony roche federer had just finished off one of the finest years in tennis history winning three of the four grand slam singles titles , all without the benefit of having a coach man , i do n't know how tony can go into that job , blake said basically if roger loses one match , he maybe has n't done his job six months later , federer has lost three matches , but none of those were on grass , and on sunday , both federer and roche appeared delighted with the state of their affairs as federer , the swiss master , overwhelmed andy roddick in straight sets on the court that matters most , center court at wimbledon they lost the australian open and the french open together , but federer did claim his third consecutive wimbledon singles title on sunday , and the first with which roche has been associated though roche , an australian lefthander , won the french championships in singles a generation ago , his only titles at wimbledon came in doubles as a coach , roche s previous students , ivan lendl and patrick rafter , each played in two finals here but could not manage to win i did n't play today to try to get tony a victory , federer said after beating roddick i just thought for us it would be nice to get this together , because with the two losses we had in australia and paris , even though they were good tournaments for me , this was something special now , federer s wimbledon winning streak is still alive , and roche s run of frustration is over it s been a long time , roche said i 've had a lot of tough finals , but for me it was just great to see someone play that type of tennis it was something special rochie , as the australians call him , is not given to hyperbole he has long preferred to leave the public relations to his more charismatic doubles partner , john newcombe when they took over the australian davis cup team in the 1990 s , newcombe gave the pep talks and the interviews and sat on the captain s chair roche , who at 60 is federer s senior by 37 years , put rafter , lleyton hewitt and the others through their paces in practice so when roche takes the time to start playing with superlatives , it is worth taking note there is a lot that reminds me about rod laver , said roche of federer s play on sunday he is a genius , really genius is a word that seems bandied about too easily in this era s rush to judgment tennis might be racket science , but it s not rocket science what it is with its range of grips and spins and tactics is a craft federer worked no harder than some other players in the top 10 when he learned the game in switzerland but what often makes the difference at the highest level are the things you cannot teach nerve , innate competitiveness , natural grace and feel richard krajicek , the dutchman who won here in 1996 , is bowled over by photographs of federer in action , because his point of contact on his strokes is significantly farther out front than any other player even on grass , he s much more in front than most of the guys on a normal surface , krajicek said what that means is that he is somehow picking up the direction of the ball earlier than his rivals and then using his remarkable quickness and speed to full effect some of the approach shots andy hit were good approach shots , but federer moves so well that he makes them look like they are bad approach shots , said john roddick , andy s older brother and mentor who runs a tennis academy in texas obviously , you are disappointed , and i think more than anything , you are frustrated , because you get to the wimbledon final , and after the first set , it s like , 'do i even have a shot with the guy playing like that \? ' john roddick said the first game federer broke , he hit two shots that were ridiculous he hit a forehand pass from 18 feet behind the baseline for a winner and a running backhand pass from five feet behind the baseline , maybe six feet past the singles line , for a clean winner as a player , you 're always taught to think that your opponent ca n't keep that up , whereas he is the one guy who can those glorious passing shots were a sign of the change in federer s tactics at wimbledon when he won his first title here , in 2003 , he served and volleyed about 60 percent of the time this year , he did so less than 20 percent of the time , preferring to hang back , smack big groundstrokes and attack very selectively that was a concession to the slower conditions and higher bounce at wimbledon , as well as to the improvements in returns and passing shots because of changes in string and racket technology but though federer occasionally expressed frustration that he was not rushing the net more often , he is that rare modern player who can win big matches in different ways when you play a complete player and i played laver enough times it is very , very difficult because if you go out of your comfort zone then the player has already had a victory , roche said i think that s what happens when you play federer you try things that you are not comfortable with you should go out there and back your game that it s going to be good enough , but when you start the match and things are n't going well , you start to panic a little bit , and then you do n't even make your routine shots it was not all about federer on sunday , however roddick , who has now lost to federer here the last three years , said he believes that attacking remains his best strategy on grass but he could continue to improve his twohanded backhand and onehanded slice , could continue to improve his volleys and could also put more emphasis on a slice serve on grass he could learn , too , to use his enormous power more selectively to keep federer from sliding into that sublime groove andy could use his power just a bit smarter , said the former wimbledon champion boris becker but , when the nitpicking is done , it was mostly about federer , and perhaps it is for the best that tennis no longer stages three of its four grand slam tournaments on grass as fluid and spectacular as the swiss can be , the public appetite for outrageous domination has limits for the moment , the gap appears to have closed on other surfaces , with rafael nadal winning the french open on clay and nearly beating federer in the final in miami on a hardcourt but after sunday s wimbledon victory , federer told a group of reporters who visited his rented house near the all england club that he had every intention of fiddling with his schedule and focusing more on the french open , the one grand slam tournament he has yet to win for me , that is the big goal , he said i know i can always win the other grand slams if i'm feeling good , and i 've shown it before , whereas at the french i 've only given myself one chance the bad news for the opposition is that he remains only 23 , and now that he has helped roche win wimbledon , perhaps roche can help him win in paris before these two tennis traditionalists from different generations and hemispheres part ways
to the editor i was shocked to read brent staples s glowing review of japan s educational system i have been teaching english at a private girls' high school in japan for the last year and have witnessed none of the zeal for improving student understanding that mr staples so enthusiastically supports students' understanding is relevant only insofar as it increases their chances of passing university entrance exams classes consist of lectures , not discussions , and students are taught to memorize , not analyze japanese students may perform better than american students on standardized tests , but they lack critical thinking skills mr staples also cites several countries , japan among them , that have ministries of education responsible for educational quality control but quality control for japan s ministry means promoting the use of history textbooks that whitewash or omit information about japan s brutality against its asian neighbors in the first half of the 20th century is this the kind of quality we want in our educational system \? ellen rubinstein okayama , japan , nov 21 , 2005
in a move away from blanket prohibitions on seawalls and revetments on its ocean beaches , the town of east hampton is backing the use of shoreline armoring along a 3 , 000foot stretch of oceanfront in lowlying downtown montauk officials said they were forced to act because the peril the ocean posed to the downtown area and resort business crucial to its economy had become too great to ignore the proposed approach runs contrary to the views of state and federal agencies and environmental groups that say a retreat from eroding shorelines is not only advisable but also inevitable it also differs from the policy in neighboring southampton , where hardened structures , which are also implicated in worsening erosion on neighboring beachfronts , are not permitted under townenforced rules william mcgintee , the east hampton supervisor , said the structures envisioned in his town would protect businesses including seaside motels and condominiums as well as downtown montauk from storms and ocean waves he said business owners in the protected zone the beachfront commercial area south of route 27 from second house road eastward to surfside place would pay for the project we have a unique situation here that i do n't believe they have in southampton , mr mcgintee said we 've got a town right on the ocean , and we 've got businesses that at times are just a few feet from the breaking waves he said armoring would be allowed only along the 3 , 000foot area in montauk and nowhere else on the town s oceanfront southampton and east hampton are the only towns on long island with mainland shorelines that are regularly and directly exposed to ocean waves in both towns there are running battles between property owners and local and state officials over shoreline armoring the east hampton structures could take the form of revetments made of granite blocks , steel sheathing hammered into the beach or other temporary or permanent armoring built parallel to the beach they would be allowed under a coastal erosion management plan the town is completing the plan would need approval from the state department of state and environmental conservation to be enforced locally southampton has had a stateapproved plan for about two years larry penny , the director of natural resources for east hampton , said the montauk downtown was now so vulnerable that a major storm of a magnitude last seen in 1993 could undermine shoreline businesses and inundate downtown streets we 've been lucky we 've been spared , he said you do n't want to get to the point where you are just waiting for a disaster to happen mr penny estimated that the montauk shoreline had receded by 25 feet annually since 1990 , a sharp increase from the average annual loss of one foot in preceding years i do n't know what it is , but something has speeded it up , he said robert deluca , the president of the group for the south fork , an environmental and planning group in bridgehampton , said the town should be concentrating on poststorm recovery planning to avoid redevelopment that would be at risk from future storms a revetment or similar device , he said , would be little help a major storm is going to go right over it anyway , he said but john keeshan , a montauk real estate broker , said some protection would be better than none montauk is first and foremost a summer resort , he said and if you lose those motels , it s not just a private matter for the people who own them it s time that we took our head out of the sand and see what s happening with the weather around the world , he said we do n't want to be left with just a lighthouse the montauk lighthouse is six miles east of downtown the town s director of planning , marguerite wolffsohn , said town officials clearly agreed that protection should be allowed what they 've been saying is , oh my gosh , here is the atlantic ocean and here is our valuable downtown montauk can we just say oops , sorry , it s the ocean , no protection , and let it wash away \? we ca n't do that the town plan would leave it up to property owners protected by the armoring to replenish the beach with new sand , a difficult task because offshore dredging would require separate approval from the army corps of engineers onshore beachquality supplies , dwindling in the montauk area , would need to be trucked in at great expense steven kalimnios , the owner and manager of double k management corporation of montauk , which operates the royal atlantic beach resorts on south edgemere street , said he paid 100 , 000 to truck in sand when a september 2001 storm threatened to undermine the motel and condominium complex it was a minor storm , but it did a tremendous amount of damage , he said mr kalimnios said he would probably build a revetment if one were permitted , but he added that it would be of limited value unless it was accompanied by periodic replenishment of dredged sand the army corps was aware of the deteriorating conditions but could not help soon , said joseph vietri , the chief of planning and policy for the corps' north atlantic division federal assistance , mr vietri said , would come only in a longstalled omnibus project for protecting 83 miles of the south shore from fire island inlet to montauk we have to hitch our wagon to that , he said a nearly completed study for the project , known as the reformulation project , was not funded in president bush s proposed 2006 budget senator hillary rodham clinton led efforts to restore funding cut in the 2005 budget as some in montauk braced for the worst , others remained optimistic the beach is like everything else in nature , it changes all the time , said george mullan , the manager of the ocean end apartments on south emerson avenue people exaggerate photo east hampton is proposing armoring along a 3 , 000foot strip of montauk oceanfront larry penny , left , the town s natural resources director , said a big storm could inundate downtown streets \( photographs by doug kuntz for the new york times \) map of long island highlighting montauk
taji , iraq in a ceremony at this sprawling iraqi army base in early january that drew virtually no attention abroad , the iraqi military took what american officials say was a pivotal step and a calculated gamble in the effort to defeat the insurgency as nearly 100 iraqi tanks , gun trucks and armored personnel carriers rumbled by a reviewing stand filled with ribbonbedecked iraqi and american generals , the interim prime minister , ayad allawi , and top iraqi officers made an announcement iraq s national guard , a regional civil defense force formed less than two years ago , would be merged into the relatively small national army what at first glance appeared to be a symbolic shift of command and set of new uniforms is now coming to be seen as an important example of finding new ways to train and equip iraq s fledgling security forces to defend the country and to allow 150 , 000 american troops to leave , senior american and iraqi officers say the 38 , 000 national guard troops will swell the regular army s ranks to nearly 50 , 000 soldiers , creating a unified ground force that will have common pay , uniforms and standards being part of the army will make the former national guard soldiers more available for missions away from their home bases most guard units now conduct patrols and operations only in their region , often in tandem with american troops in places like baghdad and mosul gen babakir alzibari , chief of staff of the iraqi armed forces , said incorporating the national guard into the army would ensure unity of command and effort to meet the security challenges we currently face the iraqi army is trained and equipped at higher standards than the national guard , whose heavier weaponry will now be significantly increased lt gen david h petraeus , the american officer in charge of training the iraqi forces , said that in many of the 42 national guard battalions , the number of heavy machine guns has increased to 32 from 8 per battalion more radios , vehicles and other equipment are also flowing in as the transition takes place those changes come at a cost the pentagon recently asked congress for 57 billion in additional money to help finance the training effort this year , and it is spending that will not give immediate results in the near term we wo n't see much change , said brig gen carter ham , who until recently commanded american forces in northern iraq longer term , i think there is goodness that can come from having more units trained and equipped to the same standards across the nation important iraqi political and cultural considerations are also at work , some of which reflect iraqi officials' desire to exert more control since the elections held on jan 30 , american and iraqi officials said while the national guard has relied heavily on american and other allied forces in iraq , the regular army has more direct ties and answers more directly to the iraqi government perhaps most important , the iraqi army is a highly respected institution in the country , largely untainted from the threedecade rule of saddam hussein , who never trusted the army and created special military and intelligence units , like the special republican guard , to preserve his power it was no coincidence , for example , that dr allawi and top iraqi officers chose jan 6 , the 84th anniversary of the creation of the modern iraqi army in 1921 , to announce the merger of the national guard into nine new iraqi army divisions , officials said the national guard , originally called the iraqi civil defense corps , had none of that institutional loyalty or history civil defense connoted the fire department and emergency services , not military fighters , american commanders said incorporating the national guard into the army has given those units legitimacy in the eyes of many iraqis and has bolstered morale , commanders say it s a significant move for them to be part of the regular army , said maj gen charles h swannack jr , a retired commander of the 82nd airborne division , who spent two tours in iraq it s like saying , 'you 're a real warrior again ' but training and equipping the national guard is fraught with challenges , and converting its units into army forces is a calculated gamble , some american officials say while some national guard units have performed well , particularly in securing the elections , others are still battling high absentee rates some american advisers expressed concern that the iraqi army s command and control structure was not ready for the sudden integration of the national guard if that is not built up quickly , it will pose a major hurdle to the pentagon s plan to withdraw from iraq dispatching national guard units to trouble spots across the country can also pose steep challenges there are likely to be some concerns from former national guard units that may not want to leave their home areas , general ham said i have n't seen that manifested yet , but i feel it may be likely disbanded in the spring of 2003 by l paul bremer iii , the top american civilian administrator in iraq at the time , the iraqi military has been slowly reconstituted in several distinct units , along with separate police forces the original concept of the national guard was to have a modest military ability , largely to help at a local level , without adding those formations to a regular army that might become tempted to carry out a coup but in fighting the current insurgency , the level of force that even a welltrained guard unit can deliver is inadequate in the view of some field commanders and some iraqi officials who are pressing for a greatly increased military ability maj gen john batiste , commander of the first infantry division , said bringing the guard units' capacity up would be a consuming task the longterm goal is to get them all the same , he said that s where the ministry of defense has work to do in a national security strategy paper issued on jan 15 , dr allawi said the goal of training 100 , 000 iraqi soldiers by july would be increased to 150 , 000 fully qualified soldiers by the end of the year over all , according to the pentagon , iraq will have 270 , 000 trained soldiers and police officers by next year
washington , nov 16 senators from both parties demanded wednesday that several oil executives explain statements they made to congress last week about their ties to the energy task force led by vice president dick cheney i join my democratic colleagues in demanding that these oil executives be brought back to congress , sworn in and forced to testify again , said senator harry reid , the senate democratic leader at issue is a longrunning dispute over mr cheney s energy task force , which worked mostly behind closed doors in 2001 and 2002 and developed a broad array of industryfriendly energy proposals last week , chief executives from five major oil companies told a joint hearing of the senate energy and natural resources committee and the senate commerce committee that their companies had not been involved in the task force but on wednesday , the washington post reported that a white house document showed that executives from at least four companies had met with andrew lundquist , the head of mr cheney s task force two companies , exxon mobil and conocophillips , acknowledged that their executives had met with mr lundquist but both companies insisted that their executives had told the truth democrats and many environmental groups have long charged that the secretive task force worked handinglove with oil companies the white house fought a long and mostly successful court battle to avoid releasing information on who had participated in the meetings none of the executives testified under oath , which could have exposed them to charges of perjury indeed , the cochair of the hearing , senator ted stevens of alaska , firmly rejected demands by democrats to put the executives under oath at the hearing , lee r raymond , chief executive of exxon mobil , said his company had not been involved with the task force on wednesday , exxonmobil executives said mr raymond had testified accurately but the company did confirm that its head of government relations , james rouse , met with mr lundquist on feb 14 , 2001 another executive caught in the crossfire is james j mulva , chief executive of conocophillips mr mulva testified that his company had not met with the task force on wednesday , the company said mr mulva had been correct but only about the part of the company he had led in 2001 , phillips petroleum , which merged with conoco jeff callender , a spokesman for conocophillips , said mr mulva had been unaware that archie dunham , then chief executive of conoco , and alan huffman , another senior executive , had reportedly appeared at task force meetings mr reid , the senate democratic leader , said he wanted to recall all the executives and question them under oath he also linked the issue of their role in setting energy policy with the recent surge in oil profits senator pete domenici , republican of new mexico and chairman of the senate energy and natural resources committee , stopped short of saying that the executives should be summoned back but made his displeasure clear mr domenici and senator jeff bingaman , the ranking democrat on the senate energy committee , demanded a prompt explanation , in writing , of these inconsistencies and would consider further appropriate action once the explanations had been given
the doublecrested cormorants perch like conquerors at the tops of the spindly white pines , their driftwoodgray branches devoid of needles the trees were killed off , along with much of the other vegetation on the small rocky islands here in lake champlain , by the birds' highly acidic droppings as they have across the united states , doublecrested cormorants , large migratory water birds , have proliferated on the lake in recent years from none before 1980 to 3 , 800 breeding pairs last year the birds' ability to take over islands for use as nesting colonies where they can ruin the habitat for other birds and down tremendous amounts of fish has raised alarms among anglers , state environmental officials and wildlife biologists but while officials in new york have worked to control the population elsewhere in the state by oiling eggs , destroying nests and even shooting the birds they have been stymied on lake champlain the cormorants here nest on the four brothers islands , which are owned by the nature conservancy s adirondack chapter when the state s department of environmental conservation asked the environmental organization for permission to manage the cormorants there , the conservancy politely but firmly declined the organization , which is amenable to controlling invasive or nuisance species , even by lethal means , says that the cormorant problem is too complex and broad to tackle in a vacuum it plans to spend the next two years studying the issues before deciding what action , if any , to take on four brothers there really is n't any comprehensive regional management plan to deal with the population , said chris maron , the chapter s champlain valley program director we did n't say 'no' forever but we do n't want to have the treatment take place on four brothers and just force the cormorants elsewhere the response by the conservancy was a blow to some recreational fishermen on the scenic lake , bounded on the east by the green mountains of vermont and on the west by the adirondacks of new york they worry that the cormorants will eventually impinge on some of the popular catches they basically dive and feed and fly , said jim hotaling , of willsboro , ny , a charter boat captain on the lake i think they most definitely hurt the fishery the state of vermont , which has aggressively pursued the cormorants on young island , the site of the other major colony on lake champlain , was not happy either we were a little discouraged , said john gobeille , a district wildlife biologist with the vermont fish and wildlife department , referring to the four brothers decision for a second year , vermont officials are shooting cormorants on young , the sixacre island the state owns in lake champlain , once a lush preserve of basswood , elm , green ash and cottonwood trees that was host to blackcrowned night herons , cattle egrets , great blue herons , fly catchers and orioles not only do the cormorants destroy trees and shrubs with their droppings , but they break off twigs and branches to build their bulky nests there are only gulls and cormorants now , mr gobeille said of young island , adding that vegetation had been reduced to garlic mustard , stinging nettle and thistle this summer vermont plans to kill 440 cormorants , or 20 percent of the colony s population since the late 1990 s , vermont has also oiled thousands of eggs each year to prevent hatching those efforts have helped to cut the cormorant presence on young island from 3 , 000 nests in 1999 to 1 , 100 nests this year during that time , however , the cormorant population on four brothers doubled there is such a tight link among the cormorants on lake champlain , which is really just a small pond to them , mr gobeille said it should be looked at as one colony , but because there are different states and jurisdictions and ownerships , it s been difficult to manage historic records indicate that cormorants were present throughout the east when european settlers arrived , although none were documented on lake champlain in the 1800 s , cormorants were mercilessly hunted both for their feathers and because they competed for fish the pesticide ddt depressed their numbers further in the 20th century but since the 1970 s , cormorants have rebounded under an amendment to the migratory bird treaty act there are now an estimated two million in north america , according to the united states fish and wildlife service scientists and wildlife officials say the rise of sprawling fish farms in the southeast , where cormorants spend the winter , has provided the birds with a tremendous new food source scientists like david e capen , a research professor of wildlife biology at the university of vermont and an expert on cormorants , say that this should mean more support to control the population there s a human management of these populations in the wintertime by essentially giving them food , and to me , that s a very unnatural component , he said that s what justifies the management of the population on the breeding grounds
madrid , march 10 if sept 11 drew america together , at least temporarily , march 11 has pulled spain apart certainly , a year after the deadliest terrorist attack on european soil since world war ii , spain is poised to remember with sobriety and simplicity , as the official theme on friday , madrid s 650 church bells will ring at the moment the first bomb exploded the king and queen will inaugurate a symbolic forest of cypress and olive trees to honor each of the 191 train victims and a policeman who died after trying to arrest some of the suspects the spanish flag will fly at halfmast on all public buildings and all navy ships at noon , the country will observe five minutes of silence but the commemorative moment will provide only a respite from what has become a more pressing priority political infighting the centerright party of the former prime minister , jos mar a aznar , which lost at the polls three days after the bombings , believes that it was a victim of circumstances , that the socialist government is somehow illegitimate and that the election was a triumph for terrorists the socialists who came to power believe that the defeated centerright party is trapped in a web of lies and is seeking revenge for its electoral loss by sabotaging the current government s ability to rule the result is a struggle that replays the events of a year ago over and over it has destroyed the code of politesse that has governed political life during much of the three decades since the death of the dictator francisco franco , making dialogue impossible and decisionmaking difficult it is as if both sides are trapped in the frenzy of a permanent political campaign in fact , some political commentators have suggested that there is no way to restore the civility of the center until the next election there is immaturity and a lack of selfconfidence on both sides , said v ctor p rezd az , a sociology professor here despite more than 25 years of a seemingly successful democracy , so many issues have n't been resolved at a time when there is a need for voices of public wisdom , there are none the most recent sign of the split is the refusal of the opposition to endorse a series of parliamentary findings about how the march 11 bombing happened and how to prevent future attacks the parliamentary commission will deliver its preliminary findings on friday but without that crucial endorsement while the sept 11 commission in the united states was bipartisan , spain s version was dominated by the socialists and rapidly dissolved into a forum for political grandstanding and attacks after mr aznar charged the socialist government in his testimony last december with having lied and engaged in manipulation to bring down his administration , prime minister jos luis rodr guez zapatero accused mr aznar of destroying official computer records that would have proved he mishandled the crisis and lied to voters the socialists rode to victory on a wave of popular disgust with the conservatives , whom the socialists and most spaniards accused of trying to manipulate the bombing investigation to put the blame on the basque separatist organization eta rather than islamic militants \( having deployed troops to support the unpopular americanled war in iraq , the government was eager to avoid the appearance that al qaeda had carried out the bombing as punishment \) the centerright party announced this week that it could not endorse the report because the zapatero government had not fully investigated connections between eta and the islamic plotters that decision prompted gaspar llamazares , the head of a party aligned with the socialists , to declare at a news conference on tuesday that the popular party is anchored in the past and guilty of a delirium that makes it incapable of getting along with the rest of the political spectrum meanwhile , pilar manj n , the mother of a 20yearold man killed in the attacks and chairwoman of one of the victim support groups , has condemned all politicians , accusing them in a televised appearance before the inquiry last december of using the pain of the victims for party political ends she plans to boycott the anniversary commemoration on friday and mourn in private we have nothing to commemorate , she said at a news conference on tuesday , adding , we implore you to respect our silence even the victims' support groups are split most of the victims of the march 11 bombing were workingclass commuters and their advocates tend to be more supportive of the zapatero government advocates for victims of basque separatist terrorism tend to lean right , and they are enraged by mr zapatero s overtures to nationalists in the basque region and catalonia the political divisions have been aggravated by the determination of the zapatero government to promote a social agenda that includes , for example , the endorsement of widespread condom use and the legalization of gay marriage the government is not interested in governing it is interested in social engineering , said jos luis requero , the head of a conservative advisory body to the government on judicial matters , in an interview and all the experiments of social engineering in the 20th century hitler , mussolini , mao have been catastrophes of course , mr requero added , i'm not saying that zapatero is hitler or mussolini grotesque , is how justice minister juan fernando l pez aguilar characterized the statement when it was described to him then he denounced what he called the antisocial policies and abusive exertion of power during eight years of centerright rule aznar and his ministers said , 'there are no other spaniards than us and everyone else is an enemy and foe , ' he said they 're trying to spread discontent today they think that 'the sooner the spanish people are unhappy , the sooner we 'll get back what belongs to us ' by contrast , the tensions between spain and its muslim community seem mild it is still difficult for north african immigrants to get decent jobs and housing insults on the street and racist graffiti are not unusual but predictions of a backlash of racial violence against the muslims have not materialized on the calle de tribulete in the lavapi s area of madrid , where jamal zougam , one of the suspects in the madrid bombing , ran a cellphone shop , workingclass spaniards mix easily with north african arab immigrants in the neighborhood cafe on the corner near the metro , bluehaired grandmothers sip coffee and thick hot chocolate in the afternoons , oblivious to the young arab men in the room next door , who play video games , and \( since this is spain , where such things are tolerated \) deal hashish
when rafael palmeiro s positive drug test was revealed on aug 1 and he was suspended for 10 days , a question immediately arose throughout major league baseball , a question that is impossible to answer how many of palmeiro s 569 career home runs , people wondered , were influenced by the use of steroids \? it is hard to think that anyone , palmeiro included , would ever know the precise number , and it is quite possible that palmeiro will never accept one of his home runs being linked to steroids but suspicion will now shadow all of palmeiro s considerable achievements on the field , adding to the lingering doubts that already permeate baseball and hover over dozens of current and former players it is a state of mind that has now become part of the game players , managers , fans and reporters can watch a batter crush a ball 450 feet or hammer a ball to the opposite field and , even if the only evidence is their eyes , they will be tempted to issue a verdict on whether the home run was clean or tainted as this scrutiny of players continues , one statistic home run totals is being more closely watched than any other and in 2005 , the number of home runs is down significantly from last season it is a trend that began early this season , then subsided , with more home runs actually being hit this june than in june 2004 but the gap has opened again as the 162game campaign moves toward the threequarter mark through monday , 3 , 674 home runs were hit in 1 , 767 games during the first four and a half months of the season , which translates to 208 home runs a game that is down from 223 in 2004 , when 3 , 942 home runs were hit through the same number of games over all , that is a decrease of 67 percent if the 2005 pace continues through the end of the season , the decrease will be nearly 8 percent from last year s final figure of 225 homers a game there are other numbers to consider in 2003 , the first season in which major leaguers were tested for steroids , the average number of home runs a game was 214 it was 209 in 2002 , 225 in 2001 and 234 in 2000 taken together , these figures send out mixed signals , because the number of home runs actually increased 2 percent from 2002 to 2003 and 5 percent from 2003 to 2004 , although players were being tested in those years on the other hand , the 2003 testing was anonymous , with no penalties attached even in 2004 , firsttime offenders were not subject to a suspension or to being identified now , in 2005 , players who test positive are identified and suspended after the first offense , which some players said helped explain the current drop in home runs asked if he had expected a decrease this season , mets outfielder cliff floyd said , i 'd be lying if i tell you i did n't still , floyd added , he had quietly wished that the home run totals might not change at all as a player , you hope everything stays the same so it would show it was n't that big an issue , he said but despite floyd s hopes and those of countless others in the sport , steroids remain a dominant issue in baseball palmeiro s suspension came after a highly publicized congressional hearing on steroids in march , when sammy sosa and mark mcgwire , two of the dominant home run hitters of the last decade , testified , as did palmeiro in the months before the hearings , barry bonds , jason giambi and gary sheffield were among the players who testified before a federal grand jury in the bay area laboratory cooperative steroiddistribution case thus , the current reduction in homers , which players noted might still be minimized over the final six weeks of the regular season , will only fuel the debate about who was doing what when it is a tricky debate after all , bonds , who has 703 career homers , has not played this season because of a knee injury , and his absence obviously influences the total number of home runs and to some , the dropoff this season , bonds or no bonds , is not enough to be meaningful someone told me it was down 8 percent , derrek lee of the chicago cubs said i did n't know that i do n't know how much 8 percent is you know \? in two months , that could change eight percent does n't seem like a lot to me ben sheets , a pitcher for the milwaukee brewers , said he thought the home run totals would decline last season and was surprised when they did not since the totals have declined in 2005 , sheets said it was natural to connect the dots between fewer homers and the adjustments players might have made i'm sure people are being careful , sheets said i'm sure some guys who were taking straight supplements are probably scared to use the supplements they were on guys that were on the illegal stuff and even guys who were on the legal stuff are probably saying it s not worth it lee added , i think if anyone was doing anything , they 're probably not doing it anymore if they 're smart sheets said he stopped using creatine , a powdered protein supplement that is not banned by baseball , because he did not want to risk the possibility of testing positive while the focus on steroids is typically directed toward hitters , sheets noted that the testing also affected pitchers , who can use steroids to help their bodies recover quicker of the eight major league players who have tested positive in baseball s stricter testing program , four are pitchers sheets said that when he stood on the mound these days , 60 feet 6 inches away from the batter , the major difference he noticed was that hitters were no longer clobbering pitches to the opposite field so sheets can throw an outside fastball to a righthanded batter and not expect him to reach down , flick his bat and drive it 400 feet the good sign for me is that , even though they still hit them , you do n't see the balls going out to the opposite field like you used to , sheets said that s huge it gives you somewhere you can pitch to it gives you a safety zone if jim edmonds of the st louis cardinals , who is a strong oppositefield hitter , tags a ball the opposite way , sheets accepts that but sheets and doug melvin , the brewers' general manager , said there had been times in recent years when unidentified players took swings that surprised them there were guys who would go down and hit the ball the opposite way and you 'd wonder , melvin said some players cite the absence of bonds in wondering how drastic a difference there really has been in home run totals this season because bonds has been sidelined , and because jim thome , scott rolen and jeff bagwell , three other veteran power hitters , have had significant injuries , a chunk of homers has been missing this season in 2004 , bonds had 38 of his 45 homers before september rolen had 31 of his 34 , thome had 39 of his 42 and bagwell 21 of 27 this year , bonds has none , bagwell has three , rolen has five and thome had seven before his season ended if those four players were having their average seasons , the decrease in homers would obviously be smaller maybe the numbers are down because barry is out , lee said of course , there is a counter to this argument because , as in any season , there are also players who are hitting more home runs than before atlanta s andruw jones \( 37 \) , lee \( 35 \) , houston s morgan ensberg \( 33 \) and baltimore s brian roberts \( 17 \) have set career highs in homers with more than a month left in the season amid these varying factors , sheets still detects a change it s back to shortstops who will hit 15 or 20 , he said it ai n't top heavy anymore with guys who are going to hit 65 , 60 and 55 when john flaherty , a catcher for the yankees , was asked about players no longer putting up 60 or even 50plushomer seasons , he said guys or guy \? you only had two or three guys doing that anyway still , even if no one has hit 50 homers since alex rodriguez did it in 2002 , when he hit 57 , and even if fewer homers are being hit this season amid tougher testing for steroids , mike piazza of the mets said the approach to hitting would never change if anything , he said , the slightly fewer balls flying out of parks will make the pursuit of home runs even more intense power is what gets you paid , piazza said aside from the whole drug aspect , there is an emphasis on power guys are always swinging for power
it is so easy to sit back in the affluence of our comfortable lives , protected from scourges like malaria and extreme poverty and hunger , and nitpick to death the united nations' landmark action plan to eradicate poverty and hunger and the plagues they spawn indeed , no sooner had the longawaited report , bearing the stamp of the columbia university economist jeffrey sachs , hit the street this week than some economists took shots utopian central planning by global bureaucrats , carped one there is certainly much to debate about the details of mr sachs s report , which calls for rich countries like the united states to drastically increase foreign aid to poor countries in an effort to halve poverty in its many forms hunger , illiteracy , disease by 2015 but this is not a time for armchair quarterbacking the united nations report is a bold initiative that refuses to accept hunger as the inevitable fate of so many africans , latin americans and asians there will be and should be a debate about it as world leaders prepare to meet in september on the antipoverty goals , but it is vital that it not turn into another excuse for inaction mr sachs s report lays out , in real terms , the myriad ways to help poor people the beauty of his ideas is in their simplicity provide mosquito nets for children who live in malariainfested regions eliminate school and uniform fees to ensure that poor children do n't stay home because they ca n't afford to go to school provide farmers in subsaharan africa with soil nutrients to ensure healthier crops reform and enforce legislation guaranteeing women and girls property and inheritance rights none of this is rocket science , although many will try to make it seem so the strongest , and probably most legitimate , critique of approaches that flood poor countries with money is that many of these poor countries are run by corrupt governments that will stash most of the donor money in private swiss bank accounts that has certainly proved true in the past , particularly in africa , where the poor have stayed poor while a succession of despots have run country after country into the ground but it is counterproductive to make poor people suffer because they have bad governments mr sachs says now is the time to try the radically different approach of giving bigger amounts of real , quality aid directly to recipients on the ground that means money to clinics and schools , to build generators and buy medicine and food , instead of the usual lowinterest loans to benefit companies back home the united nations proposal calls for rich countries to increase their foreign aid to 07 percent of gdp by 2015 that s a target that these very same rich countries , flush with good will at the start of the new millennium , set for themselves in 2002 , world leaders , including president bush , supported a declaration promising to make concrete efforts toward the 07 percent target three years later , sweden , norway , denmark , the netherlands and luxembourg are already there the united states remains far behind , at 15 hundredths of 1 percent so , let s get started , america the world is waiting
albany carl m steubing , a decorated battle of the bulge veteran whose experience of war made him a pacifist but also instilled in him a zest for living life at full tilt , took his diagnosis of gastroesophageal cancer in 2001 as a challenge with a thatch of white hair and a rich baritone voice , mr steubing , at 78 , was not ready to succumb to illness a retired music educator and wedding photographer , he remained active as a church choir director , expert cook , painter , golfer and fisherman he was married to a woman 24 years his junior , and they had seven children and three grandchildren between them mr steubing jumped at the chance to participate in an experimental drug study at the stratton veterans affairs medical center in albany , believing it offered him the hope of surviving longer the research coordinator , paul h kornak , told mr steubing that he was just a perfect specimen , with the body of a man half his age , according to jayne steubing , mr steubing s widow he was not , though because of a previous cancer and poor kidney function , mr steubing was not even eligible to participate in the experiment , according to government documents mr kornak , however , brushed that obstacle aside he altered mr steubing s medical records , according to prosecutors , and enrolled him in the study he also posed as a doctor in 2001 , mr steubing endured about six periodic treatments with an aggressive threedrug chemotherapy combination each infusion made him violently ill and forced his hospitalization he died in march 2002 last month , at the federal courthouse in albany , mrs steubing glared at mr kornak , 53 , as he pleaded guilty to fraud , making false statements and criminally negligent homicide in the death of an air force veteran , james digeorgio when mr kornak admitted to falsifying the medical data of subject initials cms carl m steubing mrs steubing s face crumpled mr kornak , who is scheduled to be sentenced in may , also agreed to cooperate in a widening investigation of the hospital s cancer research program from 1999 to 2003 , when he worked there , scores of veterans were , at the least , put at risk but allegations of carelessness , fraud and patient abuse in the hospital s cancer research program predated mr kornak , and employees say that administrators not only dismissed their concerns , but harassed them for standing up for the veterans research violations were a way of life at stratton for 10 years , said jeffrey fudin , a pharmacist at the hospital stratton officials turned a blind eye to unethical cancer research practices and punished those who spoke out against them the whole kornak episode could have been prevented according to mr kornak s lawyer , e stewart jones , there was a clear systems failure , permitting a research culture where rules were n't followed , protocols were n't applied and supervision was nonexistent it was also a culture whose descent into criminality forced the department of veterans affairs nationwide to reckon with what an internal memorandum in 2003 described as systemic weaknesses in the human research protections program , especially in studies funded by industry excluding simple chart reviews , about 80 percent of the department s human research is financed by industry the private sector pumps considerable cash into the system in albany , it accounted for 500 , 000 of the 115 million in research funding in 2004 mr kornak , who declined to be interviewed , does not appear to have derived financial gain from his fraud the albany hospital s research program , however , stood to benefit from the enrollment of patients , pulling in 5 , 000 from the drug company aventis for mr steubing s participation although veterans knew him as dr kornak , mr kornak was not licensed to practice medicine mrs steubing first learned this a year after her husband s death when she read an article in the times union of albany by 1993 , mr kornak had obtained and lost medical licenses in several states by forging his credentials and had pleaded guilty in pennsylvania to felony fraud charges the albany hospital hired mr kornak , who did attend some medical school , as a research coordinator , not as a physician nonetheless , he performed physical examinations , and his veterans affairs business card identified him as an md james a holland , mr kornak s supervisor , was the real md and the principal oncology researcher federal prosecutors said in court papers last year that dr holland , too , was possibly facing criminal charges dr holland , who now works at archbold memorial hospital in thomasville , ga , declined to comment archbold , in a statement , said georgia s medical board had investigated dr holland s actions in albany and found no evidence of misconduct in september , however , the food and drug administration started proceedings to disqualify dr holland from conducting further clinical research because he had failed to protect subjects under his care in albany according to the fda , patients' medical records were altered in at least five experimental drug studies , enabling veterans like mr steubing to be enrolled in studies for which they were either too sick or too healthy to qualify a patient with coronary disease , for instance , was enrolled in a study that excluded heart patients because of a risk of hemorrhages a patient with impaired renal function was administered a drug toxic to kidneys that probably contributed to his death , the agency said it kills me to think that the va system deceived us , said mrs steubing , the director of an upstate school for emotionally troubled children you see these youngsters at walter reed now and everybody s raving about the care they get well , carl was one of those kids once , with a bronze star , a purple heart and at the end of his life , his treatment was the antithesis of what you see on tv it was such a betrayal it can be hard to determine whether an experimental treatment is the cause of a cancer patient s death mrs steubing will never know if her husband might have survived longer if he had undergone standard chemotherapy treatment or if he might have been spared the suffering he endured after each experimental infusion the questions will always plague her , she said but , as mr kornak s homicide conviction indicates , the authorities have attributed one death directly to his fraud in 2001 , mr digeorgio , 71 , declined precipitously and died within two weeks of being infused with experimental drugs that he should not have been given my husband trusted and confided in the va in albany , and he would n't go nowhere else , judith digeorgio , his widow , said it s a disgrace what they did to him jon a wooditch , a deputy inspector general for veterans affairs , said department employees were forbidden to answer questions for this article because of the continuing investigations officials from the inspector general s office have been questioning hospital employees in the last several weeks after mr kornak s guilty plea , the hospital director , maryellen pich , circulated a letter to the staff noting many improvements in research since the events , among them that credentials of researchers have been checked and confirmed and that researchers have undergone ethics training mr kornak , as it turns out , was so trained as a certified clinical research professional , he had passed an examination covering such ethical topics as informed consent and clinical fraud both mrs steubing and mrs digeorgio have sued mr kornak , dr holland and the department of veterans affairs mrs steubing s complaint , in a classaction suit , says that veterans were treated like guinea pigs overwhelmed watchdogs in the 1990 s , because of a marathon of new drug development , the field of clinical research grew into a multibilliondollar industry , overwhelming the systems developed to protect human research subjects the ethical model for those systems was born in 1947 after german physicians were convicted for performing crippling and deadly medical experiments on concentration camp prisoners but the nuremberg code did not stop unethical research well into the 1970 s , the federal government sponsored human radiation experiments and the tuskegee experiments , in which black men with syphilis were studied but not treated or told they had the disease outrage over the tuskegee experiments led to the gradual development of federal regulations governing clinical research these regulations established the cornerstone protections for human subjects a voluntary , informed consent process and oversight by an institutional review board , which would evaluate and monitor the scientific validity and ethical standards of studies in the 1990 s , however , the surge in drug research strained the institutional review boards and raised new questions about conflicts of interest and government oversight veterans affairs doctors have done pioneering research on spinal cord injuries and schizophrenia and helped develop the cardiac pacemaker but like universities and private research companies , the department has grappled with allegations of exploiting its human research subjects the veterans department s situation , though , was singular veterans , many unable to afford private health care , are a particularly captive and altruistic pool of subjects , easy marks , said alan milstein , a lawyer for mrs steubing and the department s huge , taxpayerfinanced health care system , despite reports of significant improvements in quality of care , has struggled with issues of mismanagement these problems include persistent complaints about abuse of power , cronyism and reprisals against whistleblowers speaking up , to no avail years before mr kornak arrived at the albany hospital in 1999 , mr fudin , a clinical pharmacist there , started expressing his concerns about the treatment of cancer patients beginning in 1993 , mr fudin variously alleged that patients were placed in experimental studies without their consent , that patients who were ineligible for studies were nonetheless enrolled , and that patients were given alternative therapies that should have been classified as research veterans , he said , may have died as a result the former pharmacy manager , anthony mariano , shared his subordinate s concerns every violation , i handdelivered packets of information to the chief of research , threw them down on his desk and demanded he do something to stop the research , mr mariano said instead , mr fudin and mr mariano found themselves under internal investigation in 1996 , mr fudin was accused of patient abuse for refusing to dispense a certain cancer therapy mr fudin said he thought the therapy amounted to unsafe experimentation on patients he was cleared of the charge , faced a second charge and again was cleared claiming harassment and reprisal for whistleblowing , mr fudin filed a complaint with the office of special counsel , a federal agency intended to protect federal employees in late 1996 , veterans affairs and mr fudin reached a settlement the department agreed to sponsor him for a doctorate in pharmacy by paying his tuition \( 21 , 986 \) and giving him a flexible work schedule it is regretful that these investigations of your clinical practices took place , a senior veterans affairs official wrote to mr fudin still , mr fudin said he was frustrated that his concerns about the cancer research program had not been addressed his allegations were investigated in the mid1990 s , but the doctor who conducted the inquiry , thomas ferro , said it was cursory and , ultimately , thwarted there is always a hidden agenda either to exonerate or convict in these internal investigations , said dr ferro , who is now at the veterans affairs hospital in richmond in this case it was to exonerate i was buddies with the doctor i was deputized to investigate dr ferro said he did a fairly superficial investigation only oriented toward uncovering egregious errors , of which none were found he reviewed about 10 patient charts , he said he found a consent form missing in one and consent form discrepancies in others dr ferro said he also found creative science in the use of alternative chemotherapeutic regimens he said he was convinced that the oncologist was genuinely trying to help patients survive longer but , dr ferro said , it did n't strike me as prudent to be using alternative regimens when there was no clearcut evidence they were helpful and the possibility that they might be harmful dr ferro said he watered down his findings in his final report , stating that no major violations were found , but that minor discrepancies were his superiors , however , did not like any mention of problems , and they whited out minor discrepancies and other negative phrases , dr ferro said they asked dr ferro to initial the deletions , and he protested , but eventually did so , he said , so as not to be a troublemaker dr ferro said he also recommended strict monitoring of cancer drug studies , and his ideas included having a chemotherapy expert review the consent forms and review the documentation to make sure the patients were eligible for the studies but the recommendations were shelved , he said the solution to the kornak problem yet to come was in that document , he said both mr fudin and mr mariano faced additional internal investigations mr fudin was dismissed in 2001 , and an administrative law judge ordered him reinstated in 2002 mr mariano , meanwhile , was criticizing a costsaving drug substitution policy involving hypertension medication that he contended was harming patients who suffered from congestive heart failure in 1999 , after he published an article in a federal medical journal questioning the department s drug policies , he was , at one point , reassigned from the pharmacy to a locked psychiatric ward and given no duties eventually , after a complicated legal process , mr mariano said , he resigned under pressure in 2001 , and he now works as a pharmacist for walmart mr fudin and mr mariano served as grand marshals for albany s memorial day parade in 2003 , selected by local veterans honoring what they described as the men s courage in blowing the whistle some veterans wore tshirts emblazoned with whistles and , on a rainy may day , blew whistles as they marched convicted , then hired in 1993 in harrisburg , pa , judge william w caldwell of united states district court sentenced mr kornak to a 2 , 500 fine and three years of probation for forging his credentials to obtain a medical license apparently , mr kornak s history of fraud began with the falsification of a college transcript , and lie followed lie until he lost a medical license in iowa , was denied one in new jersey and was arrested in pennsylvania as we all know , a house built on sand will eventually fall , and a career whose foundation is built on deception likewise has fallen , judge caldwell said i think the conviction for this offense is going to make it extremely difficult , if not impossible , for mr kornak to pursue a medical career six years after judge caldwell s pronouncement , mr kornak answered an advertisement for a research assistant position at the albany veterans hospital s research institute it was 1999 dr william hrushesky , then the chief oncologist , interviewed mr kornak , according to the medical research law and policy report , a trade publication \( dr hrushesky did not respond to inquiries from the new york times \) mr kornak told dr hrushesky that he had lost his medical license because he could not document a year of medical school in poland , according to the journal mr kornak gave us a r sum with an md on it and a lot of gaps , dr hrushesky told the journal we decided to give him a chance dr hrushesky also said he assumed that the research institute , a foundation that oversees industry grants for research , checked mr kornak s credentials before hiring him \( eventually , mr kornak was hired away from the foundation by the veterans department itself \) but at that point , the veterans affairs system did not require much background or credential checking for health professionals other than for physicians and dentists , and the system did not doublecheck to make sure that its hospitals actually did the required screening of doctors , according to a general accounting office report issued last year at the albany veterans hospital , dr holland inherited mr kornak as a research associate mr fudin , the pharmacist , and other employees said dr holland was swamped by the cancer patient load according to an fda letter to dr holland , he delegated far too much responsibility to unqualified subordinates in numerous drug studies mr steubing was not a regular patient of the albany hospital and , because he had private insurance , he was not a typical veterans affairs patient he sometimes went to the veterans' hospital in castle point , ny , for checkups , but he used private physicians for important health issues in early 2001 , when mr steubing s gastroesophageal cancer was diagnosed , doctors at the memorial sloankettering cancer center in manhattan recommended a widely used twodrug chemotherapy regimen , which was available at castle point , closer to their home in hopewell junction at castle point , an oncologist suggested that mr steubing see if he qualified for an experimental drug program , which added a third drug , taxotere , to the mix the study , sponsored by the drug company aventis , involved both sloankettering and veterans affairs in albany sloankettering had a waiting period , mrs steubing said she was told albany did not the steubings met with mr kornak kornak was your classic goodtime charlie , mrs steubing said carl thought he could pick out a phony a mile away , but he really loved this guy mr kornak never gave them any indication that mr steubing did not qualify for the study , mrs steubing said instead , he encouraged mr steubing to continue with the regimen even though it was devastating him kornak would say 'you 're going to beat this the odds are in your favor , ' mrs steubing said little did we know that what they were doing to carl was probably hastening his death rather than extending his life routine visit leads to an inquiry in december 2001 , a clinical research associate for ilex oncology made a routine visit to the albany veterans' hospital , where ilex was sponsoring a bladder cancer study ilex , a cancer drug company , was offering the albany research program 2 , 500 for each study subject such payments are a standard practice , and many researchers say that they barely cover the cost of conducting the studies critics of drugtesting practices , however , consider the payments a threat to scientific integrity ilex s research associate discovered some paperwork that raised suspicions , according to caren arnstein , a spokeswoman for the genzyme corporation , which bought ilex at the end of last year things about the dates did n't look right , ms arnstein said if the results of a pathology report for a biopsy are dated prior to the biopsy being taken something seemed off the discrepancies led to an audit by ilex in the spring of 2002 , the albany hospital began an internal review of the cancer research program , eventually referring the matter to the inspector general , according to the times union ilex shut down the albany study and alerted the fda the agency had also received another complaint , an fda official said in november 2002 , the fda sent an investigative team to albany on average , it takes about a week to investigate a complaint that team spent more than 50 days at the hospital it studied the files of more than 50 research subjects and found problems in almost every one , according to its investigation report in january 2003 , mr kornak and dr holland were dismissed mrs steubing got an unnerving call from a hospital official , telling her that her husband s care might have been compromised i said , 'well , dr kornak and dr holland were so wonderful to us , ' mrs steubing said there was dead silence on the line and i thought , 'oh , it s them ' shaking up the system , twice the year that the albany veterans research program hired mr kornak , 1999 , was supposed to be a year of reckoning for the 12 billion research program at veterans affairs federal regulators shook the system by suspending all human research at the west los angeles veteran affairs medical center , saying that it had been lax for years in obtaining informed consent and overseeing research news media reports about abuses of human subjects in west los angeles unleashed the fury of congressional watchdogs , who asked the general accounting office to assess the safeguards for veterans who serve as research subjects the office examined eight veterans affairs medical centers and reported a disturbing pattern of noncompliance with regulations for the protection of human subjects dr stephan fihn , the acting director of research and development for veterans affairs , said in an interview historically , we relied on the integrity of investigators in the vast majority of cases , that worked we did discover , well , the tendency is to say , bad apples there were some pretty egregious violations what congress basically said was that the va has to take a very active role what was lacking in human subjects protection was a strong oversight and enforcement effort but the department did not change overnight , as the general accounting office said in a followup report four years later it apparently needed a second shock to its system , and that came in 2003 when the problems in albany and the accidental fatal overdosing of a veterans affairs research subject in detroit came to light a new director of research for the department , dr nelda wray , ordered a nationwide review of research at veterans affairs medical centers and halted clinical research in fargo , nd , because the institutional review board there had all but ceased to function she also ordered credential checks on researchers and ethics training for them by early 2004 , the department s inspector general had accused dr wray herself of ethical problems and improprieties , including the mishandling of funds provided to veterans affairs by drug companies her lawyers called the investigation an easy and convenient tool to stop sorely needed reforms she eventually left the department but there does appear to have been a sea change in the department s approach toward protecting the subjects of human research an external nonprofit agency , the national committee for quality assurance , was hired in 2001 to accredit the agency s programs to protect human subjects the accreditation process , which requires medical centers to open up their research programs to full scrutiny , is rigorous at first , the committee met hostility we just showed up and started telling them what was wrong , and it was way too abrupt , said brian shilling , a spokesman for the committee but there s been a lot of education and culture change in the va since then just

pope benedict xvi is a pianist with a penchant for mozart , which he is said to find more manageable than brahms , given the limited amount of time he has to practice \( until his election , he was one of the busiest cardinals in his role as chief interpreter and enforcer of doctrine \) his brother , a priest , was a church kapellmeister the ratzinger boys were born in the part of bavaria long under the influence of salzburg , mozart s birthplace as a theologian , he has occasionally revealed some of his thinking about music when it comes to popular forms , he can be harsh in his 2001 book introduction to the spirit of the liturgy , he called rock 'n' roll an expression of base passions which , in large musical gatherings , has assumed cultlike characteristics or even becomes a countercult that is opposed to the christian worship pop music was a cult of banality on the classical side , he played music critic in a message to pope john paul ii on the 25th anniversary of john paul s pontificate in 2003 , when a concert in his honor by the mitteldeutscher rundfunkorchester included beethoven s ninth symphony addressing the 83yearold pope , cardinal ratzinger described the symphony as echoing the inner strife of the great maestro in the midst of the darkness of life , his passage , as it were , through dark nights in which none of the promised stars seemed any longer to shine in the heavens but in the end , he said , the clouds lift the great drama of human existence that unfolds in the music is transformed into a hymn of joy then he took a knock at schiller , the poet of the ode to joy , saying that his true greatness blossomed thanks only to beethoven s music unlike bach s christmas oratorio or the passions , which contain the intact presence of the faith , schiller s ode is characterized by the era s humanism , which places man at the center , he said with some disapproval but beethoven was a believer , he said , so the good father of the ode is not just a supposition but an ultimate certainty after all , he pointed out , beethoven composed the missa solemnis bach lovers will also be pleased by the new pope s taste in the message , he called bach perhaps the greatest musical genius of all time and in fact , as he was driven around st peter s square after his installation last weekend , loudspeakers played bach s toccata and fugue in d minor for organ when he received dignitaries later in st peter s basilica , the hallelujah chorus filled the air it was not known whether he had made the program choices daniel j wakin
washington iraq is not another afghanistan notwithstanding what president bush said in his speech on tuesday , our primary problem in iraq is not terrorism , and the administration s singleminded focus on terrorism may help explain why we have not yet adopted a true counterinsurgency strategy or properly tackled so many of the country s other problems nevertheless , critics of the president who make parallels between iraq and vietnam are equally wrong iraq is far more important because of its oil wealth , its location in the most politically fragile region of the world , and its importance in the eyes of arab nations that wonder if democracy is possible for them too , iraq is critical to american interests in a way that vietnam never was there is one way , however , in which iraq is like vietnam how the united states is handling it we lost in vietnam for a complicated set of reasons but the most important was that we refused to use an effective counterinsurgency strategy we focused more on hunting down vietcong guerrillas than on protecting the vietnamese people , which in turn prevented the south vietnamese economy from growing and giving the people an economic incentive to support our side of the war we also tolerated a series of corrupt , unstable south vietnamese leaders who made little effort to connect with the people and spent their time squabbling over power and graft iraq , however , may not be doomed to the same fate for one thing , prime minister ibrahim aljaafari and his government are far more popular and betterintentioned than president ngo dinh diem of vietnam and his kleptocratic colleagues ever were and , because the iraqi insurgents are as happy to blow up iraqi civilians as american convoys , they do not enjoy the broad appeal of the vietcong \( let alone the firepower of the north vietnamese army \) so it is unfortunate that we are squandering these advantages by repeating many of our own mistakes from 40 years ago , and in doing so alienating the iraqi people and raising the risk of chaos and civil war so how do we save the reconstruction of iraq \? again , vietnam as well as northern ireland and other guerrilla wars has much to teach there are at least five specific lessons that must be adapted to today s cause think safety first a main point of counterinsurgency operations is that ensuring the safety of the people and giving them an economic and political incentive to oppose the insurgency is more important than fighting the insurgents themselves insurgencies wither on the vine without popular support thus the first big change would be to deemphasize chasing insurgents around the sunni triangle , and to instead put a higher priority on protecting iraqis as they go about their daily lives many iraqis will tell you that they are less concerned about terrorist attacks than about street crime and the burgeoning organized crime syndicates , which scare them into staying home and hinder the distribution of goods , paralyzing iraq s economic and social life meanwhile , most of our operations against insurgents have done little but further antagonize the sunni tribes of western iraq we should instead be building safe zones in cities and rural areas , and guarding communications and transportation sites , to allow iraq s political and economic life to revive we need to shift the bulk of our troops from trying to pacify insurgent hotspots that may never support reconstruction and toward keeping the peace in areas dominated by shiites and urban sunnis , who for the most part want nothing to do with the insurgency but long to live normal lives \( fortunately , kurdish security forces are more than adequate to police their own streets without our help \) provide enough manpower for the job what is going to make or break iraqi popular support for reconstruction is safe streets , jobs , clean water , reliable electricity , ample gasoline and the provision of other basics achieving these goals will require more than the 155 , 000 troops in the country , and it is time for the bush administration to bite the bullet , whether by deploying additional standing forces , calling up reserves , or spurring recruitment by increasing pay and benefits \( and maybe even providing a rationale that the american people would buy \) moreover , we need to relearn the lessons that the marines and green berets learned in vietnam and the british learned in northern ireland american troops need to be on the streets , patrolling on foot with iraqis , to reassure civilians this is the only way to create a safe space for iraq s economy and society to revive let them learn when lt gen david petraeus took over the training of iraqi security forces last year , he told me that it would take three to five years before they could take over from american troops he is still right unfortunately , we have regularly rushed iraqi units into frontline duty before they were ready to try to make up for the shortfall in our troops it is not just that these iraqi units need time to train they need time , years perhaps , to develop command relationships , unit cohesion and a sense of commitment to the community another reason to have american forces deploy in mixed formations with the iraqis in the populated areas that support reconstruction is that this will create safe zones in which newly trained iraqi formations can cut their teeth before being thrown into the forbidding terrain of the sunni triangle history guides us here as well while conventional wisdom holds that south vietnamese troops were virtually worthless , many units that fought alongside american forces eventually proved quite effective get beyond baghdad the capital has become a giant bottleneck for everything going on in iraq this has been true throughout history to a certain extent , but there is no reason to perpetuate it iraq s transitional government consists of a large number of political parties whose true popularity is unclear at best many shiites , for example , voted for the united iraqi alliance list because grand ayatollah ali alsistani encouraged them to do so , not because they necessarily liked or knew much about its constituent parties many other political groups have even less claim to popular support yet , unsurprisingly , many of these parties are using their positions to secure as big a piece of iraq s economic pie as possible and to insure that they have a lasting role in future governments perhaps the most underreported story in iraq today is the theft of its oil revenues thanks to the high price of crude , iraq should make well over 20 billion from oil sales this year , yet almost none of this money seems to be going to actual reconstruction projects one senior iraqi official told me recently that the theft of oil revenues today is making saddam hussein s regime look frugal by comparison moreover , in their determination to snuff out competitors , many politicians have fought tirelessly to prevent any delegation of authority or direct distribution of money or supplies to provincial or local officials this tendency to keep things centralized is reinforced because the american embassy s personnel cannot leave the capital s heavily fortified green zone , and thus focus most of their efforts on the central government reconstruction is most likely to succeed if it can grow from the bottom up certainly the topdown approach we are now employing has rarely worked in the past we need more american civilians and international aid workers to move about in iraq and find out what the people are getting and what they desperately need and we need to push resources out from baghdad or circumvent it , shipping supplies directly into the hands of the iraqis who can help at the local level buy off the sunni sheiks there is no question that bringing the sunni population particularly the tribes that are the principal supporters of the insurgency into the iraqi government and making them feel that they have a stake in the system is critical to longterm stability in the shorter term , however , we can put a big dent in the insurgency by reaching out to sunni tribal leaders and paying them protection money buying your enemies may sound unamerican , but it is a timehonored tradition in iraq a great many of the insurgents are sunni tribesmen many were members of saddam hussein s security services who have been thrown out of work and marginalized under the new shiitekurd dominated government others are fighting on the orders of their sheiks , who also feel threatened by the new order and have been given no incentive to work with us but throughout the history of modern iraq , these chieftains were paid by whoever was in power in baghdad \( the turks , the british , the dictators , the baathists \) to refrain from attacking the roads and government facilities and to keep other groups from doing so already some prominent sunni sheiks have made overtures to the american authorities and the iraqi government they are willing to keep the peace if the price is right the course we have adopted in iraq so far is not working particularly well and it could fail altogether to date , most of the changes offered by both sides of the political aisle amount to little more than tinkering with the current strategy but if we 're going to succeed in stabilizing iraq and defeating its insurgency , we are going to have to make a radical shift to a traditional counterinsurgency strategy , even though it could be politically very painful no matter what one thinks of the invasion , it is clearly in our best interest , to say nothing of the arab world s , that we succeed in iraq to do so , we will have to apply some lessons we learned from bitter history oped contributor kenneth m pollack , director of research at the saban center for middle east policy at the brookings institution , is the author , most recently , of the

for nearly 70 years , biographers have ignored the former heavyweight champion james j braddock suddenly , he is the subject of four books braddock was not as popular as jack dempsey , as historically significant as joe louis , as outsize as muhammad ali or as ferocious as mike tyson but he is the hero of ron howard s new film , cinderella man , starring russell crowe all four of the braddock biographies were published within two months of the movie s release last week none were the basis of the screenplay , but one was written by the film s historical adviser , michael c delisa , and another is an official tiein with the film \( so far , the movie has been less than spectacular at the box office \) the saga of braddock , who was given the name cinderella man by damon runyon , is a biped version of the 2003 film seabiscuit the tale of an undersize , unheralded horse who electrified thoroughbred racing fans in the late 1930 s which was spawned by only one book , by laura hillenbrand braddock came to prominence as a light heavyweight in new york and new jersey , but he lost his pugilistic touch and , with his wife and three children , tumbled into profound poverty during the depression he rediscovered his skills in the ring as a heavyweight and defeated max baer in a stunning 15round decision at the madison square garden bowl in long island city , queens , in 1935 a rousing story \? certainly but is it worthy of four biographies in just a few weeks \? to compare , four major books about benjamin franklin have come out recently , but over a threeyear span the publishers of the braddock books said they knew they would be capitalizing on the film but were unaware that they would be part of a braddock literary glut we thought we 'd be the only one , said peter walsh , whose milo books is the british publisher of mr delisa s cinderella man the james j braddock story he added i 'd read about the casting of the movie and i thought it would make an interesting biography so i cast about for an author carlo devito , publisher of chamberlain brothers , a division of the penguin group , said he was certain he made the first move by signing jim hague , a sportswriter at the newark starledger , at the beginning of 2004 to write braddock the rise of the cinderella man we got into this as a onehorse affair , he said i did n't know the barn would grow so big mr devito said he then learned from an agent that houghton mifflin had enlisted jeremy schaap , an espn reporter and anchorman , for cinderella man james j braddock , max baer and the greatest upset in boxing history then along came another harperentertainment brought out cinderella man , by marc cerasini , the official tiein book based on the film s screenplay josh behar , who acquired the book for harper , said , i would rather there had been no books but my own , but braddock s a fascinating guy and a cool story but , he added , the market is small for this , and having four books out is difficult and it hurts every single one of them actually , five next month , newmarket press will publish cinderella man the shooting script , with historical notes following the final fade to black the unanticipated braddock abundance raises the inevitable question how does a reader choose among these books \? they have similar titles and basically tell the same story three have similar covers , with photographs of braddock the tiein s cover shows mr crowe kissing ren e zellweger , who plays his wife , mae i knew there 'd be other books , said mr behar of harper but we had the tiein art , and we knew if we did the right things , we 'd stand out cutting through the braddock clutter is our challenge , said susan canavan , who edited mr schaap s book at houghton mifflin our book is a hardcover , the rest are paperback , she said the schaap book is at least 10 more expensive this is a real , nuanced book , she added we feel like we have the author with the credentials will that translate to the average consumer \? we think so mr schaap is the best known of the four authors , with regular exposure on espn and a family legacy in sports writing his father , dick , who died in 2001 , wrote more than 30 books , most of them about sports figures mr delisa is a lawyer and boxing historian who runs cyberboxingzonecom , an online research site we 're committed to ferreting out every fact we can , he said for the book , i went back to old newspapers , and a lot of stuff about him was buried when he was in his 20 s , he corresponded with mae braddock after her husband s death , gathering information that would help his research many years later the back cover of his book cites his connection to the film , which he said should help differentiate it from the other three books so far , mr schaap s book is winning the battle of the braddock biographies according to the most recent figures from nielsen bookscan , which tracks retail sales in about 70 percent of the united states , his book has sold 6 , 500 copies , mr cerasini s 4 , 000 , mr delisa s 2 , 000 and mr hague s 1 , 500 but these are just the early rounds the real question is who will be left standing once the movie disappears from the theaters
in travel writing , the travel and the writing are important , of course , but do n't bother doing either unless you have a third element the gimmick that , at least , seems to be the lesson offered by many of this season s travel books , sometimes subtly , sometimes with a declarative squawk take , for instance , martin gurdon s travels with my chicken a man and his companion take to the road \( lyons press , paper , 1295 \) actually , this is barely a travel book , since gurdon stays fairly close to home , but when a fellow goes toodling around the british isles with poultry , attention must be paid attention was the whole idea gurdon s book relates the experiences he had while doing a publicity tour , with chicken , for his previous book , hen and the art of chicken maintenance the notion of people writing books about their own book tours needs to be pecked to death and quickly , but the main problem with gurdon s book is that it s not quite as fun as it sounds his adventures as he visits a bookstore in tunbridge wells , a preschool in blackheath , a prison in sussex are n't all that adventurous never does one of his birds escape and provoke a manic pursuit by a phalanx of bobbies and beefeaters and what at first seems like a good running joke gurdon is miffed that every interviewer asks him if he eats his own chickens becomes irksome upon further review there s something disingenuous about a guy who perpetrates an inane publicity stunt and then is annoyed when reporters ask him inane questions but gurdon s insights into the poultry universe can be amusing male chickens are not considerate lovers , he explains they like short , frequent quickies , and their idea of foreplay involves a running jump somewhat less gimmicky and much more effective is taras grescoe s new book , the devil s picnic around the world in pursuit of forbidden fruit \( bloomsbury , 2395 \) grescoe , who lives in montreal , roams the world to tell the stories of various passions , most of them edible , that have been or currently are banned by some official body his chapter on the chocolatiers of bayonne , france , will make american readers feel dismay over the comparatively

have you come to the wrong town why do you think i'm sitting on this bench \? \) the high point , though , is his chapter on a trip to madrid in search of bull s testicles , a foray that gives him an excuse to take note of an array of other revolting delicacies maggotcovered cheese and rotten herring , for instance grescoe hops up on an annoying libertine soapbox every so often to denounce things like the war on drugs , but it s just as well the bulk of his tale is so vivid and entertaining that you need a break now and then another foodandtravel combo comes from doris muscatine , who has elegantly distilled a lifetime of visits to italy into a memoir called the vinegar of spilamberto and other italian adventures with food , places and people \( shoemaker hoard , 25 \) it s a genial account full of interesting places and food tidbits \( except for a period of disdain during the middle ages , when they were known as 'witches' spit' because of their pungent aroma , truffles have always been prestigious , costly and suspected of having aphrodisiac qualities \) there are even a few recipes and while not generally going for grescoe s sort of shock value , muscatine offers one image that will be hard to get out of your head , from a visit to a seaside restaurant in naples as we glanced out over the sea crashing onto the beach below , a bikiniclad man emerged , glistening in the blazing sunlight with the droplets of water left from his swim in his large , powerful hands he held a thrashing octopus , tentacles encircling his arms , gyrating , waving to obtain release he held it aloft for a moment for all to see , then in a sudden , victorious sweep , he had it in his mouth and bit deep until the arms , one by one , shuddered and stopped contorting some follow food , others follow saints , or try to , as jeremy seal does in nicholas the epic journey from saint to santa claus \( bloomsbury , 2495 \) seal sorts through the various basilicas and religious relics associated with the real st nicholas , a man about whom surprisingly little is known he died around ad 352 , was buried in what is now southwestern turkey and , as seal points out , is lucky to have been remembered at all , given that what got a man to the front ranks of saints at that time was a brutal martyr s death and poor nicholas had none , only the good works from his life \( one of those works was a publicist s dream nicholas , so the legend said , anonymously tossed a sack of gold through the window of a man s house on three separate occasions so the fellow would n't have to sell his daughters into prostitution \) seal s efforts to walk in nicholas s footsteps are n't very enthralling , partly because the man he s chasing is such a shadow , partly because his prose has a turgid quality but things perk up a bit when he jumps to the early 19th century and describes the epic battle among nicholas , christkind \( the christ child \) and the italian crone befana for the role of holiday benefactor , a tradition that was still only in its formative stage with little more than the exchange of a few cookies , oranges and stockings , and the odd homemade toy , on a variety of dates , giftgiving hardly seemed to merit so much attention , seal writes which only went to show that nicholas , christkind and befana were an astute , even prescient trio prospectors who could sense

provide the same opportunity for whimsy as st nick , but francke finds some moments of droll charm on a visit to the cathedral of santa maria assunta in spoleto , she hopes to see a letter written by

east rutherford , nj , dec 18 when the architects of the nets buttressed their fort by trading for vince carter a year and a day ago , they had visions of a perimeter attack so speedy , so explosive and so accurate that it would dwarf any other in a glimpse of what the nets have missed for much of the season , they got stellar performances sunday night from their three allstarcaliber players carter , jason kidd and richard jefferson and the result was lethal for the golden state warriors setting the tone by hitting their first nine shots , the nets blew away the warriors , 11890 , at continental arena for their second consecutive victory it was their largest margin of victory this season , and in following up one big victory with another , they showed a level of continuity they had lacked the most pleasing sign for the nets \( 1112 \) was the almost robotic ease with which their backcourt stars were able to mesh kidd , carter and jefferson combined for 66 points and 27of44 shooting \( 614 percent \) we 've been waiting for that to happen , kidd said it shows we can all go at the same time and have success asked what it felt like to have the backcourt threesome clicking , jefferson said succinctly , the good old days kidd had 24 points , 13 assists and 9 rebounds carter , for the second consecutive game , was highly efficient from beyond the 3point arc , going 4 of 5 and finishing with 25 points jefferson scored 17 points none of the three played in the fourth quarter because the nets led by 31 points after three center nenad krstic was also impressive , making 7 of 8 shots from the field for 17 points the nets showed grit on defense , holding the warriors to 382 percent shooting in the games that we 've played well , there are certain characteristics in all those games , and that is important , nets coach lawrence frank said there is a defensive intent there is persistence in pushing the ball and having multiple people run the floor and different guys stepping and everyone doing their job two nights after the nets snapped a threegame slide with a thrilling overtime victory against the denver nuggets , frank s team respond just the way he wanted the nets had made a habit this season of slumping after crucial victories there was no sign of that sunday after making their first nine shots , they missed two , then hit their next seven they finished the quarter shooting 762 percent \( 16 for 21 \) from the field the first half was a carryover from the denver game , kidd said i think we understand the kind of consistency we need on a daily basis for the second consecutive game , carter hit three 3pointers in the first quarter though the nets are happy to have three stars share the ball , it is carter who has been a catalyst for them when he has been at his best on offense , the nets have been tough to handle carter talked about trying to get us going early to make the game easy for us once i get going , i think r j starts , and then jkidd starts , he said it just works down the line the big three really needs to continue to be aggressive the nets continued their dominance in the second quarter and shot 524 percent from the field by halftime , they had a 27point lead and were shooting 643 percent their 66 firsthalf points were a season high for the fifth time this season , the nets have won two straight games , but they have yet to win three in a row they will have a chance tuesday night against the los angeles clippers , and jefferson said the nets needed to show they could sustain their play i'm very excited about this win and the way we played the last two games , he said but i understand that we 're not through the woods
when the new york times book review published its list of 100 notable books of the year earlier this month , calculations from several readers and bloggers soon turned up in my inbox of the 61 nonfiction books on the list , they noted , six were by times staffers enough to pique my interest in the overall bookreview process at the paper readers and authors deserve a process that is as fair as possible in both reality and perception what s fair , however , is particularly challenging in the world of the book section there , reviewers are expected to express their opinions , but readers also have the right to expect that books are assessed based on their merits , not just on a critic s ideology or personal grudges and preferences the complications only grow when some of the authors are on the staff of the times because the section can have an effect on a book s success , its editors try to maintain distance from the players in the book industry sam tanenhaus , the editor of the book review , said he and his top editors do very few lunches with publishers or agents where they could be lobbied about decisions yet eliminating all connections appears nearly impossible mr tanenhaus and dwight garner , the book review s senior editor , are authors themselves and both have the same agent , the powerful andrew wylie this gives me some pause but they handle that relationship very carefully , mr garner said intentionally , he explained , over the years i have had the grand total of one lunch with my agent , and one lunch with my editor one thing is certain there is no shortage of books to review the section has logged more than 6 , 000 books into its tracking system this year , even after excluding all selfpublished , howto , diet and financialguide books about one in six will wind up getting a standalone review in the section \( the paper also publishes book reviews in the daily paper , but in this column i am just looking at the larger weekly operation \) getting a book picked for a review , no matter how it turns out , can seem hugely important to authors being ignored is the worst , said peter osnos , the founder and editor at large of publicaffairs , an independent publisher some writers feel they never authored a book if the times does n't review the book incoming books first go to previewers , who each go through 10 or so of them a week to identify books to review previewers write a skip memo on each book they reject , and it goes to mr tanenhaus for a second look he said books are most often rejected because they lack originality , are really packaged assemblages of smaller pieces or are simplistic redmeat rants this same process now applies to books by times authors robert harris , the deputy editor of the section , said that as recently as five years ago , times writers pretty much automatically got reviewed he said that these days the section does n't keep track of how many books by times staffers are considered or reviewed after a book is chosen to be critiqued , the selection of a reviewer begins this seems like the phase of the process where issues of fairness really emerge first , the previewer proposes four or five possible reviewers for each book recommended for review mr tanenhaus then decides which reviewer will be asked to do it his list of the main qualities of a good reviewer a willingness to take the book on its own terms , narrative skill , a track record \( because established authors have a right to be assessed by equally established reviewers \) , and professionalism in working with editors and deadlines most , but not all , of the reviews are written by people not on the paper s staff accounts of the recruiting and vetting of reviewers in recent months indicate that editors tend to first seek a commitment that the person will do it then it s time for what mr garner calls my kenneth starr questions , a reference to the former whitewater prosecutor do you know the author \? have you written about this person , or vice versa \? are there any other potential conflicts of interest \? mr harris uses a simple test to determine whether a relationship between a potential reviewer and the author is too close do you know the names of her children \? if the reviewer knows the names \? it s not good having the same publishinghouse editor or literary agent can also raise a yellow flag for the book review vet set the reviewer and the author having the same editor within a publishing division or house would be a stopper , mr harris wrote in an email to me the reviewer and the author having the same agent can be , but not always is , as sensitive as having the same editor but , he added , none of these things are set in stone unless alerted , readers have a right to expect critiques that are n't overly colored by personal animosity or grudges between the reviewer and a book s author authors , of course , are more directly affected by the review and more likely to raise such objections about reviewers authors such as jonathan kozol and maureen dowd have reminded everyone how sharply they had previously criticized a person whose recent review they found unfair their point being , of course , that the book review s reviewerselection process broke down generally , there appears to be substantial reliance on the potential reviewer s answers to the kenneth starr questions and the assumption that they will be truthful to preserve their own credibility and their relationship with the book review section the editors say they regularly use major databases and google to independently check on how friendly or adversarial a reviewer and author may be readers , it seems to me , are generally well served by the book review screening process in some situations , i think the editors probably could have done more to find a reviewer less vulnerable to the perception of a conflict kathryn harrison , author of the memoir the kiss , was chosen to write a november review of are men necessary \? by ms dowd , a times columnist the book review editors made the decision even though they knew about a 1997 dowd column in which she referred to the harrison memoir about a fouryear consensual affair with her father as creepy people talking about creepy people all this brings us to the book review s notable books , since only those that have gotten reviews during the previous 12 months are eligible for the list some of the readers and bloggers i heard from counted beyond the six times authors among the 61 nonfiction books listed cjr daily , a web site of the columbia journalism review , counted a book written by a former executive editor and one by a duo of regular contributors to the sunday magazine eric mulkowsky , of new york , suggested in an email that selecting or not selecting a book by a current or former colleague seems a serious conflict of interest for the editors who select the top 100 books , and one which is not resolved by merely noting the timesaffiliations of the authors the selection starts with about 400 reviewed books that had jumped quickly to the paper s bestseller list or been cited as an editors' choice during the year or are yearend suggestions by previewers mr tanenhaus , mr harris and mr garner then winnow the list to 100 by consensus the editors said they do n't give any special consideration to factors such as an author s staff position at the times they also pick the 10 top books a list devoid of times staffers this year \( for what it s worth , the washington post s yearend list of 69 nonfiction books included four by times staffers \) of course , much of the judgment about the books falls into the realm of opinion and beyond the public editor s mandate as for the process , my sense is that mr tanenhaus and his editors genuinely care about general readers and the literary world , and want their choices to have credibility yet the perception of a conflict of interest can hang over both the weekly review process and the notablebooks list when times staffers are involved a year ago , mr tanenhaus told me , my colleagues and i considered discontinuing this practice altogether and instead simply notifying readers of new books by times staff we set the matter aside for various reasons perhaps the time has come to revisit this solution i believe that it has my dec 4 comment on the times s not reporting the tax benefit its parent company derived from the acquisition of aboutcom deserves clarification i should have noted two other points the washington post quantified the benefit in a column rather than a news article , and major financial newspapers did n't report on the benefit
fernando ferrer , the democratic mayoral candidate leading in the polls , came under polite , persistent grilling last night during the first major televised debate of the race , as political rivals and reporters challenged him on abortion , taxes and spending , and his own campaign missteps hoping to put those episodes behind him for good , mr ferrer took an unusual step for a candidate trying to project strength and confidence to a primetime audience he expressed regret twice for speaking clumsily and badly in the past , most notably his remark in february that the fatal police shooting of amadou diallo , an unarmed black man , was not a crime he would not go so far as to say it was a crime , though mr ferrer may have emerged relatively unscathed during the often spirited 90minute debate , but the one rival who has been inching up in some opinion polls , council speaker gifford miller , had more difficulty with a question that led to the night s rockiest moment late in the debate , he was asked for a yes or no answer about whether he would send his two young sons to public school a resident of the upper east side who has cast himself as a champion of city schools , mr miller said he did not know , drawing so many jeers from the audience that he looked hopefully to his wife , pamela , in the audience at jazz at lincoln center , in the time warner center i do n't know , we have n't made that mr miller started , but the debate moderator , dominic carter of ny1 news , cut him off to remind him that he was demanding a yes or no answer as the crowd loudly booed mr miller sounded indignant and then somewhat angry as he sought to defend his own uncertainty we have n't made that decision , he told mr carter i do n't know the answer to that , my kids are 4 and 3 look , let me tell you what i'm not going to do i'm not going to give you a yes or no question to a question of where my children are going to spend the next 18 years of their education before i have a chance to look at every school redfaced and gesticulating emphatically , he finished by calling the question ridiculous another candidate , representative anthony d weiner , who used a sense of humor the most nimbly during the debate , tried to lighten the moment by replying to the same question yes but i need a wife first but mr miller did not seem to recover easily , responding tartly , unsmiling , to later questions \( mr ferrer , for his part , said his daughter had graduated from public school , but she actually graduated from a catholic high school after attending two public schools \) mr miller also drew some hoots from the audience when he was the only one of the four democrats to criticize requiring developers to set aside a mandatory number of housing units for lowincome new yorkers mr miller said he preferred voluntary setasides if you set the setasides too high , in a mandatory , what happens is that nobody builds at all , he said until last night s gathering , the four democrats had only occasionally distinguished themselves from one other with sharply different stands , in a primary race that some voters have criticized as a bland , blurry affair seeking to counter that , mr carter used what he called a lightning round of pithy questions to demand clear yes or no answers there were illuminating moments besides the query about sending their children to public schools , the democrats were forced to offer hard opinions instead of more politically nuanced answers that try to please all the people all the time among those questions was michael r bloomberg a better mayor than his predecessor , rudolph w giuliani \? only mr weiner thought mr giuliani was better is new york city better off today than four years ago \? mr miller and mr weiner said that after four years under mr bloomberg , the answer was yes as mayor , would they ride the subway to work \? mr ferrer and mr weiner said yes , c virginia fields said no , and mr miller s attempt at humor fell flat well , you know , it s a long walk from gracie mansion before saying no did the candidates want the endorsement of the rev al sharpton , a black democratic leader who has withheld his support so far \? ms fields , the manhattan borough president and the only black candidate , said , yes , yes , yes , yes mr ferrer and mr miller agreed , if less enthusiastically mr weiner , who is courting some of the white middleclass voters who are skeptical of mr sharpton s genuineness , said , i used to say no , now i say yes would they take the yankees over the mets \? mr weiner , who represents queens , crossed his arms and said , no way mr miller said yes , ms fields said no , and mr ferrer the former bronx borough president said , only in the american league pressed further , he said , ah , you beat it out of me yes the democrats agreed that they would not rescind the smoking ban imposed by mayor bloomberg , and they all said they would sign legislation that provided translation services in city schools the four also said they had never crossed party lines and voted against a fellow democrat in an election asked if they could imagine being arrested in an act of civil disobedience in the future , only mr weiner said no , noting , i'm going to run the police department a second unusual aspect of the debate format allowed the candidates to question each other once each took aim at mr ferrer in hopes that he might stumble , their advisers said yet he gave mostly general answers , saying he supported abortion rights \( in response to a query from ms fields \) and skipping over his criticism of lateterm abortions years earlier a day after mr weiner proposed cutting the city budget by 5 percent to pay for new priorities , he criticized mr ferrer for proposing tax increases and challenged him to name three specific city programs he would cut mr ferrer said he would reduce waste and fraud in medicaid , but was vague otherwise mr ferrer , meanwhile , tossed a softball question at mr miller , asking about the specifics and source of financing for the candidate s housing plan mr miller said he wanted to build more housing and lower rents , but he did not lay out a comprehensive approach to pay for his ideas besides housing issues , the debate also included questions about social promotion in the schools , which the four opposed on principle but offered differing strategies to manage ms fields , for one , proposed a massive intervention in children s lives before they reached kindergarten , and pledged to provide the right teachers and the right resources what about investing the necessary resources \? she said the democrats repeatedly attacked mr bloomberg , none in especially new ways , although mr weiner suggested that the mayor had faltered in handling security in the city washington , george bush , the republicans in washington , and his republican friend here at city hall has made us less safe , not more , said mr weiner the four candidates also criticized several major labor unions for endorsing mr bloomberg s reelection bid , and again mr weiner , as is his custom , spoke the most harshly these labor leaders should hang their heads in shame , he said they should hang their heads in shame each candidate entered last night s debate with specific goals , according to aides and advisers mr ferrer leads the democratic field in most opinion polls , but none of the surveys show him winning the 40 percent or more of the sept 13 primary vote needed to avoid a runoff he saw last night s debate as another step toward reaching that level aides said he wanted to project energy and statesmanlike grace in the face of any criticism from his rivals , who have struggled with whether to attack him frontally or subtly the most recent poll , on aug 9 by marist college s institute for public opinion , gave mr ferrer 30 percent of the vote down 6 percentage points from its july poll and ms fields 19 percent , mr miller 15 percent , and mr weiner 13 percent twentythree percent were undecided ms fields , whose campaign has been buffeted by some missteps and a falloff in fundraising , saw the debate as a crucial chance to describe her record as manhattan borough president to a wider audience , according to some advisers in recent weeks , she has felt unfairly treated by the news media last night , she spoke passionately about assisting female day laborers and building more affordable housing , and her campaign manager was so pleased that she declared her the winner more than the others , mr weiner wanted to make as many attentiongetting splashes as possible , to help lift him out of last place in the polls his day did not start well , though , when he checked himself into a hospital emergency room at dawn for treatment of a kidney stone the possibility that his discomfort would deprive the debate of its live wire became a topic of chatter for political analysts they breathed more easily when word came at 5 15 pm that he would participate
the country singer bobby bare stood onstage under a low ceiling , chewing gum and wearing a cowboy hat and running shoes the battered acoustic guitar around his neck belonged to his son , the rock musician bobby bare jr mr bare the elder is nonchalant , if not inscrutable on this smallroom gig , it was hard to tell if he was excited , or if he felt he had come down in the world , or neither i usually perform naked , he drawled , smiling infinitesimally but i'm wearing clothes to cover up all the hickeys pause 'course , they 're all selfinflicted he played the opening guitar line to detroit city , his hit song from 1963 about a southerner missing home , and sang it beautifully in his lazy baritone mr bare , 70 , made his last album , drinkin' from the bottle , singin' from the heart , in 1983 , and now plays mostly at casinos and state fairs this show , early this month , was at grimey s basement , a club beneath nashville s hippest record store , and the audience was an unlikely scramble of generations and aesthetic points of view mr bare s yearold granddaughter sat in the front row his wife , jeannie , sang backup vocals representatives of the older nashville were in the crowd , including chip young , the guitarist who played on all of mr bare s sessions through the 1970 s , and the songwriter jerry chesnutt , who wrote trouble for travis tritt but also in the crowd were david berman , the poet and leader of the indierock band silver jews , who has been living in nashville recently , and ken coomer , who used to play drums with wilco the occasion was mr bare s surprising , sometimes stunning new record , the moon was blue , coproduced by his son and out next week on the nashvillebased independent label dualtone recorded among nashville s underground , indierock musicians including members of the younger bare s young criminals' starvation league , silver jews and lambchop it presents songs from mr bare s era that he never got around to recording himself there are ballads , vocal choruses and modest string arrangements , references to the plush nashville sound of the 60 s and 70 s it is full of oldschool , woundedmale sentimentality but there are strange , otherworldly touches as well loops of noise and feedback , low whistles , a little too much reverb the whole record is a game of balance between respect toward the past and a little critical distance it s embracing this genre , sincerely , with one arm , explained the junior mr bare and then with the other arm , molesting it , without ruining the songs in the 1960 s and 70 s , mr bare sr was famous , with songs like detroit city , 500 miles away from home , dropkick me , jesus and a string of hits written by shel silverstein also famous for his children s books that walked a line between sentimental and bizarre one of them , on the more sentimental side , was daddy what if , a spoken duet with bobby jr , who posed cosmic questions to his dad about love and death in a 5yearold squeak by his mid30 s , recording for rca with chet atkins , he started to figure out what stratum of nashville interested him the most when other people were off at parties , chasing celebrity , i was hanging out with songwriters , he said i really love songs and the way guys put their heart into writing them i'm about half an introvert anyway as the head of return music , a music publishing company , from the mid1960 s to the mid70 s , he encouraged the loosening of nashville songwriting beyond formulaic topics billy joe shaver was signed to his publishing company , but mr bare s larger posse included mickey newbury , tompall glaser , mr silverstein , waylon jennings and a nashville dj known as captain midnight \( he had three pinball machines installed in his music row office , mr bare said , and there would be epic sessions of pinballshooting and songwriting , with most of his visitors high on speed he was never much interested in drugs , though he took up chewing tobacco for the buzz \) he operated under the certainty that songwriters were more important than singers , and he promoted new ways of presenting songs mr bare became the first country singer to produce his own records in nashville , and the first to make a concept album lullabys , legends and lies , a collection of songs written by mr silverstein he and his wife live in a ranch house in hendersonville , half an hour northeast of nashville , on old hickory lake , where many countrymusic potentates bought property in the 60 s \( george jones and tammy wynette lived next door for a few years , during the happy stretch of a doomed marriage \) his three children live less than an hour away in the summer , he nightfishes on dale hollow lake , with the singer and guitarist jerry reed in december , he travels to florida to fish and watch football with little jimmy dickens , the longtime grand ole opry star , who is now 84 casinos and county fairs are his only gigs that s about all i want to work , explained mr bare the morning after the show , over coffee at his house he has invited his son as well i'm fishing a lot bobby jr cut in now i gotta talk him into making less money the thing about living to be 70 years old is that so many of my friends are dead , mr bare reflected me and ray price are about the only ones left there s kris kristofferson , but he s a little younger reed s health is not good but he lives on the other side of town , and we meet out here to fish bobby bare jr is tall like his father , with hunched shoulders and curly hair , perpetually tired , friendly , forthright and easy to read the topic of many of his own songs is wretched living not necessarily for fun , but out of selfdefeating compulsion still , he likes to play felix to his father s oscar they spend most of the summer together , bobby jr said , in mild protest over the jerry reed and the dale hollow situation they wake up in the mornings , watch the braves play baseball and fish in the evening it s a mess they live like pigs no , it s great ! protests the father i 've been out there , and it s a mess , insists the son there s stuff thrown everywhere oh , well , sighs mr bare anyway , it s probably the clearest lake you 'll ever see he will not take credit for conceiving the moon was blue that goes to the younger bare and another producer , mark nevers , who worked on nashville s music row for 10 years , recording alan jackson and others \( mr nevers is also a member of lambchop \) they saw the potential he s a real entertainer , said bobby jr , and nobody my age or younger knows who he is mr bare seems completely set in his ways up to a point beyond that point , open , free , a little perverse he loves the new record , space noises and all i told bobby and nevers , i 'll just sing the song , he explained because if i throw my weight around , you 're gonna wind up with just another country record it s great , because none of the strange sounds are distracting , and it always makes me smile when i hear it what he likes most , he said , is the restraint , the delicacy of the radical touches , like the feedback solo in the middle of the old triplet ballad am i that easy to forget mr nevers made it with an electric guitar , a kitchen knife and a delay pedal it could have been disruptive , but it is n't it s kind of like being weird and not weird , mr bare decided
the lady and the panda the true adventures of the first american explorer to bring back china s most exotic animal by vicki constantine croke illustrated 372 pages random house 2595 in the preface to her book about ruth mccombs harkness , vicki constantine croke describes being struck by a veritable bolt of lightning ms croke realized that there was book material in ms harkness s 1930 s adventure story , and the idea had the impact of an epiphany i felt the tug of something deep , a bond , perhaps , that had crossed the passage of time , she explains beware such confessions the fact that an author has gotten lucky does n't mean the reader has , too but the harkness story is right for ms croke , even if she has a tendency to exaggerate its fabulous , madcap angle regardless of whether ms harkness was part myrna loy and part jane goodall , whether she was as quintessential a flapper as clara bow or a cando girl who had beaten the odds , ms harkness was certainly a pioneer in the panda world and the author s photograph on the book jacket flap in which she hobnobs amicably with a panda that is chomping on a snack dispels any doubt about her feeling for this subject matter it was ms croke s pandaphilic journalism that brought her this bonanza in the first place she had heard of ms harkness while doing research for the modern ark , her 1997 book about zoos \( coincidentally , a giant panda was born last week at the national zoo in washington , the first at the zoo in 16 years \) she wrote a harkness article for the washington post magazine she was then contacted by the granddaughter of ms harkness s best friend , who had saved hundreds of letters in her dauntless travels across asia in search of what would become time magazine s animal of the year , ms harkness had the foresight to bring a typewriter sometimes it helps to have the whip hand that even a small amount of money gives one , ms harkness wrote in the midst of her unique 1936 expedition yes , other explorers had sought and found pandas theodore roosevelt s sons kermit and theodore had famously hunted this prize as an animal that had never been killed by a white man but ms harkness was the widow of a panda seeker , william harvest harkness jr she designed dresses before she took up her husband s quest she was also the kind of festive socialite who once said , a dash of absinthe and you analyze the hell out of everything the book describes the sea change that prompted ms harkness to take over her husband s expedition , going first to shanghai \( perfumed by a great gurgling and vivifying ooze and later up the yangtze in a darling little river boat heading for tibet china gets to you , my dear , she wrote so the book incorporates background research about china s culture , geography and extreme political turmoil during the 1930 s it also very nearly bears out the words of the poet li po , who wrote , it is more difficult to go to sichuan than to get into heaven but as its title \( taken from ms harkness s own memoir \) makes clear , the lady and the panda is primarily a personal story and it conveys the unusual blend of imperiousness , caprice and affection with which ms harkness approached her undertaking at a time when adult pandas were considered too difficult and perpetually hungry to transport alive , she fastened on the idea of finding and nurturing a tiny one \( a newborn panda has the weight of a stick of butter \) she would make a surrogate child out of sulin , the rare panda to leave china as anything better than a pelt never mind the fact that sulin s mother met the same fate as bambi s once ms harkness had spirited the creature out of china with a deliberately misleading permit \( one dog , 20 \) , the explorer and the creature became media sensations this book is about the hoopla , too about the absurd extremes it would reach \( ms harkness turned up in an advertisement recommending quaker oats to anyone who sought adventure \) and the damage it would inflict after the glory of her celebrated journey , ms harkness would never reach those heights again her next trip to china did n't sparkle , and she wrote about one stop slowly but inevitably i am losing my mind , she confided in a letter it did n't help that her chinese exlover was now married , her baby panda consigned to a zoo and her book dismissed for its distaff concern with clothes , medicines , the handsomeness of hunters , as time put it even sulin was described as a lonely female hoping for mr right even though sulin had been misidentified and turned out not to be female after all surprisingly few worthwhile photographs accompany ms croke s account ms harkness s camera malfunctioned , reducing the hoped for 700odd photographs of her trip to none but ms harkness s writing is spirited and ample enough to be a great help and ms croke herself writes with palpable enthusiasm and admiration she was the hushhush toast of the town , traipsing from one party to the next , always lugging the rarest animal in the world with her , causing a stir wherever she went , she writes about ms harkness s first , triumphant return to new york in the town that lived to hobnob , the panda was invited to lunches , dinners , and even to tea the lady and the panda winds up stranger than fiction but no less poignant ms croke has worked hard with an effort that often shows to give it dramatic shape she summons just enough romance , rivalry , victory , disappointment and redemption to make this book reflect a woman who wore lipstick in the jungle like its heroine , it stakes everything on exotic glamour
arad , romania seated on a bed in her firstfloor apartment here , katrina stoica held her 3monthold daughter , elizabeth , close and made what might seem like an unremarkable comment i'm glad to be with my baby , she said i have to be with her i'm her mother such an apparently normal scene is a significant achievement in this country , notorious for the rate at which impoverished families have given up their children to state care until recently , ms stoica , 23 , with no job or family to support her , would have been expected to hand over her daughter to a governmentrun orphanage in some cases , mothers have been forced to do so instead , she and four other women living in the same apartment are being encouraged by the city s social services agency to keep their children a nurse teaches them how to clothe and feed their babies social workers counsel them and help them look for jobs and a new place to live the apartment , which is run by arad s child care department , is just one of several new services in romania in the last five to seven years aimed at curbing the flow of children into the orphanages , which earned romania the worst reputation of any country in europe for child care first revealed to the world after the collapse of the communist government in 1989 , the orphanages were found with children in squalid conditions , frequently tied to beds or locked in rooms , and receiving little or no personal care and affection in the west , this country is best known as the home of dracula and orphanages , said theodora bertzi , secretary of state for adoptions but since 1997 , romania has been developing alternatives to the largescale orphanages , putting greater emphasis on keeping children with their mothers or extended families now we have a completely different situation , ms bertzi said new services are being built up from scratch social workers are employed in hospitals to work with new mothers thought to be at risk of abandoning their children foster parents and family homes where couples care for small groups of children have been introduced , providing homes for just over 50 , 000 children who would otherwise have been sent to large residential institutions around 32 , 000 mainly teenage children remain in staterun institutions , down from 100 , 000 in the mid1990 s but there is still abundant evidence of child neglect by the system in cities , children as young as 3 can been seen begging , or sleeping outside the government estimates that about 5 , 000 minors are homeless , but it is trying to address that problem with its revamped child care services , as in ms stoica s case ms stoica was given up by her parents soon after her birth , and grew up in orphanages they abandoned me when i was just like this , she said looking at her baby it was very sad i did n't feel the love of parents homeless at the time of her daughter s birth , and sleeping in a shelter , ms stoica was referred to social services in arad , a town 265 miles northwest of bucharest i am a little bit nervous , she said , talking about the prospect of bringing up her daughter by herself i do n't have anywhere to go when i leave here but , she added , she was certain about one thing i'm not capable of abandoning a baby persuading young mothers to keep their babies has been a struggle , health care workers say since the 1960 s when nicolae ceausescu , then romania s leader , banned contraception as part of an effort to increase the population , the abandonment of babies has been widespread as the state assumed an omnipresent role , many poorer families who could not afford to bring up children thought little of leaving them to the state to look after doctors were as responsible as parents for encouraging the culture , according to a senior member of arad s child protection services mothers could not take a child home without the signature of a doctor , said rodica crainic , the assistant director of child care services in arad if they saw the conditions a mother was living in , they could decide even before the baby was born if she could keep her or not a child might be taken into care if the mother was not married , ms crainic said that was the attitude at the time , she said those attitudes are hard to change ms bertzi said some doctors still resisted allowing social workers , who counsel and monitor new mothers , into maternity wards , a crucial step in ensuring that a mother establish a bond with her child , and helping them find financial aid in arad , local child care officials say conditions of those put into the state s care have markedly changed in 2002 , the city closed its main orphanage , one that used to house more than 200 children the county of arad now employs 111 foster mothers to take care of children under the age of 2 , and 116 social workers there were none before 1999 nationally , the rate of child abandonment is disputed a recent survey by the united nations child rights agency , unicef , estimated that 10 , 000 children were left in hospitals each year for at least seven days , a figure it says has changed little in a decade but romania s national authority for the protection of child rights says the numbers have sharply fallen in 2004 , the agency said , 4 , 502 children were left in hospital care more than half were eventually returned to their parents , leaving 2 , 113 abandoned over all , the number of children in government care is now comparable to what it is in other countries in eastern and central europe , according to the government placing children with adoptive parents is one of the weakest links in preventing children from growing up in the care of the state , ms crainic said international adoptions have been banned , and while there are more romanian parents who want to adopt than there are children available , ms bertzi said new rules introduced in january made adoptions slower and more complex there were 10 adoptions in arad county last year and none so far this year
five american muslims will file a federal lawsuit today after they and dozens of others were detained last december by united states border agents as they returned home from a religious conference in toronto , their lawyers said the muslim men and women , all american citizens who live in new york , said they and others were held up to six and a half hours at border crossings , interrogated , photographed and fingerprinted simply because they told customs agents they had attended reviving the islamic spirit , a large annual conference organized by muslim organizations in canada none of those detained had engaged in unlawful activities , their lawyers said border agents near buffalo searched the cars of those detained and confiscated some of their cellphones after they tried to call lawyers , according to the complaint their lawyers plan to file in united states district court in brooklyn the three men and two women include an orthodontist , a teacher , a hotel manager and a graduate student , and are represented by lawyers for the new york civil liberties union , the american civil liberties union and the council on americanislamic relations the complaint charges that the detention , interrogation and other treatment of those held by customs officials violated their constitutional rights homeland security officials have acknowledged that at least 34 people were stopped by border agents after attending the conference in response to questions about the suit , valerie smith , a spokeswoman for the department of homeland security , said the mission of the department of homeland security is to protect americans from terrorism and the mission of customs and border protection is to prevent terrorists and their weapons from entering our country it is incumbent upon customs officers to be right each and every time terrorists only have to get it right once she said she could not discuss the details of the case none of those detained were ever charged with any crime the detentions have drawn national attention citizens have a right to go to religious conferences and governments do n't have any authority to question them whether it s out of the country or inside the country , said christopher dunn , a lawyer with new york civil liberties union it s no different than if this happened in madison square garden named as defendants in the complaint are michael chertoff , secretary of homeland security , and two officials with united states customs and border protection a spokeswoman for customs and border protection , kristie clemens , has been quoted widely in newspapers as stating that muslims who attended the conference were stopped because the government had ongoing credible information that islamic conferences may be used to promote terrorist activities , including fundraising several calls to her were not returned the annual conference draws thousands of muslims from canada , the united states and elsewhere and features lectures by islamic scholars , music concerts and other cultural activities among the conference s keynote speakers was hamza yusuf , a prominent imam from hayward , calif , who has advised president bush on islamic issues , according to the complaint organized by college students , the conference promotes peace , tolerance and unity , said several people who attended it asmaa elshinawy , 20 , decided to attend the conference after reading about it on the internet , she said she wanted to learn how to improve the image of her faith among her fellow americans , she said we have a responsibility to show people living in this country what islam is really about , said ms elshinawy , a preschool teacher who lives in brooklyn , where she was born and raised by her egyptian parents it s about peace and loving your neighbor ms elshinawy and five friends from brooklyn and new jersey rented a van and attended the conference for three days on their way home on the afternoon of dec 27 , a border agent at the lewiston bridge border crossing asked them if they had been at the conference , according to the complaint when they said yes , they were told to pull over , and then were detained in a building , she said i walked in and i saw all muslim families inside , she said it looked like an arab cafe ms elshinawy recognized some of the people from the conference agents took away the women s cellphones and interrogated some of them about why they attended the conference , she said their fingerprints were taken , and they were photographed when they were released around 9 pm , they found their van in disarray , she said a video camera was open and its contents appeared to have been viewed , according to the complaint the lawsuit seeks to have the government s actions declared unlawful , and an injunction against further enforcement of such policies and practices , according to the complaint the men and women also want all information , fingerprints , and photographs obtained during the detentions to be expunged customs has fairly broad latitude in terms of searching for contraband , said david cole , a professor of constitutional law at georgetown university and author of enemy aliens double standards and constitutional freedoms in the war on terrorism but they do n't have a broad latitude for seizing citizens and taking their fingerprints

crawford , tex , dec 27 the bush administration announced new sanctions on tuesday against stateowned chinese companies that it accused of aiding iran s missile and chemical programs , insisting that beijing cut off the trade at a time when mr bush is trying to persuade china s leaders to condemn tehran s nuclear program the sanctions , announced by the state department , are part of a diplomatically complex effort to cut off the flow of technology into iran that could aid its weapons programs , while pressing both china and russia to threaten action against tehran at the united nations security council included in the latest sanctions , first reported tuesday by the washington times , are two companies closely tied to the chinese military the china north industries corporation , known as norinco , and the china aerotechnology import and export corporation , or catic , which is one of the country s largest producers of military aircraft the sanctions will have little practical effect on most of the nine companies cited , including two indian companies and one austrian one that makes assault rifles and other small arms the chinese companies are already barred from doing business with the united states but adam ereli , a state department spokesman , called the move an important and effective tool in constraining iran s efforts to develop missile and wmd capabilities he added , it does have an impact , i think , particularly in alerting governments to activity taking place in their countries and instituting measures or taking actions to prevent those kinds of activities administration officials said they had no evidence that president hu jintao or other chinese leaders were aware of the sales , and they said the chinese had been sporadically helpful in cutting off shipments of crucial technologies to the iranians but the announcement on tuesday was the third since july 2003 in which the administration released a list of chinese companies that officials say are bolstering iran s missile and chemical programs there is little evidence so far that china has cracked down on the companies that are owned or effectively controlled by the military while the state department announcement did not describe the technology exported to iran , information that is classified , officials said none of it specifically dealt with nuclear weapons or the integration of iran s nuclear program with its missile program nonetheless , they said , they were concerned that iran was strengthening its missile technology at the same time that its new president had declared that israel should be wiped off the map , and that new evidence , acquired from a stolen laptop computer in iran , suggested that iranian engineers were grappling with the technical difficulties of fitting a nuclear device atop a missile iran does not yet possess such a device , american intelligence officials say there is a serial proliferation issue under way here , and the only way we know to deal with it is to keep up this pressure , said one senior administration official , who asked not to be identified because the administration was trying to impose the sanctions with little fanfare the announcement comes at a particularly delicate moment in the american effort to win support from china and russia for acting against iran earlier this month , american , british and french officials met in paris to draft a statement condemning iran s nuclear program they are circulating that draft to china and russia , two officials said tuesday , in hopes of getting all the permanent members of the security council to sign on so far china and russia have resisted any move toward sanctions , saying any overt confrontation would be counterproductive mr ereli said that austria had been cooperative in the investigation leading to sanctions against the company there , steyrmannlicher gmbh , but that the company had continued to do business with iran he said nothing about india s dealings with two chemical companies on the list sabero organics gujarat ltd and sandhya organic chemicals pvt ltd the other chinese companies were the hongdu aviation industry group , the limmt metallurgy and minerals company , ounion \( asia \) international economic and technical cooperation ltd and the zibo chemet equipment company
albany , july 31 tiki barber has seen much in the giants' futile search for a reliable backup for him at running back the team has all but installed a revolving door in his eight seasons , barber has lived through the onagainoffagain ron dayne experiments , which finally ended in the offseason and he has seen a trail of players , like dorsey levens , delvin joyce and joe montgomery , come and go but barber has seen nothing like the giants' newest addition , the fourthround draft pick brandon jacobs at 6 feet 4 inches and 265 pounds , he can rest his chin on top of barber s head he is a monster of a man , said barber , who is generously listed at 510 to go with his 200 pounds during an early blocking drill here at training camp , with just the running backs , they lined up across from each other and jacobs nearly lifted barber off the ground you like that \? barber said , laughing i told him i was going to make him a star jacobs would fit in seamlessly along the defensive line , a thought many coaches have entertained , to no avail , during his career he has stubbornly stuck with the idea of being a running back , becoming the latest eyepopping example of the inflation of the skillposition player minnesota s daunte culpepper became the nfl s first linebackersized quarterback now the giants have a defensiveendsized tailback he s the type of running back , when you 're playing madden football and you can create your own back , that s the guy that you want to have , running back mike cloud said , referring to the video games that the television analyst and former coach john madden helped develop you can say , 'i want him this tall and to have this much strength and speed' that s what you do in those games he s brought it to life jacobs s college career carried him from junior college to auburn to southern illinois he spent two years at coffeyville community college in kansas , rushing for a total of 3 , 248 yards and 37 touchdowns and earning junior college allamerican honors in 2002 at auburn in 2003 , he shared backfield time with ronnie brown and carnell williams , who were selected second and fifth over all in the draft in april jacobs then transferred to southern illinois , where he rushed for 922 yards and 19 touchdowns last season along the way , coaches have broached the topic of changing his position at auburn , he tried tight end and linebacker when he realized he was not the top running back none of it worked , he said none of it was me i tried , but i had to do what was best for me he parlayed that into a chance with the giants , a team with an annual vacancy for a backup running back barber said he thought cloud would fill the role admirably this year and that jacobs and derrick ward , a secondyear player , represented the future in recent seasons , it has been far too easy for giants coaches to leave barber on the field for nearly every play he has been increasingly productive he rushed for a careerhigh and franchiserecord 1 , 518 yards last season , despite playing behind a leaky offensive line he is the franchise leader in rushing yards \( 6 , 927 \) and receptions \( 474 catches \) despite his age , 30 , and his highmileage body , barber says he believes he has several seasons of success ahead i think it s a myth that s being disproved as the years go on by , guys like myself and curtis martin and corey dillon who s 30 as well , barber said it s all a function of how much work you put in , how you take care of your body , how you keep yourself healthy i 've been able to do that the last few years as long as you still have the desire , you can play this game as long as you want eventually you 'll slow down but barber is eager for a reliable backup he said he would be happy to trot to the sideline more , particularly on shortyardage downs he wants younger , fresher legs to earn those yards cloud , also 30 , is not any younger but he is fresher in his six nfl seasons , he has 169 carries barber had 322 last season but the 510 , 205pound cloud knows he is seeing the future in jacobs i do n't know too many guys in the league who are going to want to tackle a guy who s that big and can run that fast , cloud said they might get him one or two times but he s going to be dishing out a lot of punishment the question for jacobs is how he will do against an nfl defense his size also gives defenders more surface area to tackle he inherited dayne s no 27 jersey , but unlike dayne , he said he was not bothered by the idea of starting out as a shortyardage back i'm just practicing and doing my best for whatever they do decide to use me for , jacobs said that s what i want to get done first is short yardage i'm a big back and big backs are used for that i 'll be whatever back they want useful would be a good start extra points giants secondround draft pick corey webster , a cornerback out of louisiana state , has still not signed receiver plaxico burress said the knee he injured saturday was stiff when he woke up sunday morning , but he participated in sunday s practices with no limitations
like big businesses , many households now have several computers running on a single network but the methods used by corporations to make files and programs accessible from computer to computer are probably not something most people want to try at home in many cases , companies keep their computers in sync by using centralized servers to store information , an approach that may be too much bother for home users and software designed for corporate use is usually priced for corporate budgets but for consumers who open their laptop on the road only to find that a critical file is back at home or who are frustrated by having different sets of contacts and browser bookmarks on every computer they use there are some simple alternatives they take somewhat different approaches to the job , but all use the internet to some degree , and are best put to use with a highspeed connection the three pieces of synching software i tried are designed primarily for home users to varying degrees , and depending on employers' rules and systems , that may make them unsuitable for anyone wanting to synchronize data between the computer at home and the one in the office otherwise , while there are some systems for keeping a limited amount of data in sync \( microsoft s still experimental windows live favorites , favoriteslivecom , for example , deals with browser bookmarks only \) , the members of this threesome have broad ambitions microsoft effectively acknowledged that it was not easy or convenient to set up and use the filesharing built into windows xp when it purchased foldershare last month from bytetaxi , the small software company in texas that created the service it swiftly reduced the price to free and promised that existing subscribers would get refunds foldershare does not rely on a centralized computer instead , it is a variation of the peertopeer filesharing technology that is the bane of the music industry setting up the system is fairly simple users first establish an account on foldershare s web site , foldersharecom , and then download a small piece of software onto every computer they want to keep in sync \( if you are running firewall and antispyware programs or security software from internet service providers , additional adjustments may be needed the support section of the company s web site offers some solutions \) of all the filesynching options , foldershare is the most inclusive , allowing information to be exchanged between computers running windows and macintosh operating systems during setup , users select which specific files or groups of files they want synchronized but foldershare cannot deal automatically with some kinds of data or programs the most glaring omission , perhaps , is its inability to synchronize microsoft outlook email data and contacts between computers one other major decision must be made during setup when the computers should do their synching , automatically or on demand the automatic setting , of course , is the most appealing when switched on , the feature allows the program to work quietly in the background , keeping everything in check unfortunately for some users , the automatic setting may not be practical the system can make a mess of intuit quickbooks accounting files , for example , when that program is running on more than one computer during synching sessions similarly , synching large files or folders can slow home networks and internet connections , turning foldershare into an intrusive irritation for that reason , its maker suggests synching large files only on demand the program does not offer an option of scheduling synchronization so that it occurs , for example , in the middle of the night adi ruppin , vice president for marketing at foldershare s chief rival , beinsync , said that because of the compression technology his company uses , even home users can synchronize files and folders holding gigabytes of data with its software that may be so but doing so requires exceptional patience beinsync \( beinsynccom \) estimates that anyone with typical highspeed internet connections from the telephone company should expect to exchange only about 60 megabytes of data an hour for microsoft word documents , such a stately pace is acceptable but the program can handle only about 30 digital snapshots an hour from a sixmegapixel camera in the jpeg format at that speed , the idea of copying an entire digital photo album becomes daunting beinsync s setup and operation , from a user s perspective at least , are broadly similar to the foldershare experience unlike its rival , beinsync can automatically synchronize the inbox , sentmail and contact lists in outlook \( outlook express users are limited to contacts , and users of other email programs are out of luck \) mr ruppin said the company might include qualcomm s eudora email software in future releases but it has no plans to offer a version of the program for macintosh owners those with limited ambitions can use beinsync at no cost but the free route allows only 10 files a day to be synched and a maximum of five computers to share data a subscription service that costs 7 a month or 60 a year removes the daily limit and triples the number of computers that can be on the system if the emphasis for beinsync and foldershare is on files like spreadsheets and word documents , apple s mac sync focuses on personal data like contact lists , web browser bookmarks and digital calendar entries it also borrows from the corporate world by relying on data stored on a centralized server to make everything happen the mac sync is included in the macintosh operating system but making it work involves subscribing to the apple mac service \( maccom \) , which includes features like email , web site host operations , online data storage and a file backup system the service costs 100 a year for one user with one gigabyte of storage or 180 a year for a family pack that adds four additional users , each with 256 megabytes of storage as with the two other products , users can choose what they synchronize but mac is limited to bookmarks , calendars , contacts , passwords , mail account settings and email box rules the settings are made directly through the operating system rather than online a pulldown menu provides a variety of scheduling options for the synchronizing sessions , including immediate or automatic the relatively small amount of data being moved during the sessions means that it does not noticeably slow the computer or its internet connection while mac sync is not billed as a backup system , it did come in handy when one of my computers irreparably failed i was able to restore all of the data and email settings on its successor immediately and easily by synchronizing mr ruppin said many beinsync users have told his company that its system also proved to be an easy way to recover otherwise lost data for now , mac sync has the smallest potential audience of the three systems its software is supplied only with , and can be used only on , the current 104 version of the macintosh operating system , mac os x 104 \( owners of older versions of os x 10 , however , can use a simpler version called isync , which also requires a mac subscription somewhat confusingly , the new operating system has a different program with the isync name it is for transferring data into ipods , cellphones and handheld computers \) of these three programs , mac sync may have the narrowest scope , but that is probably why it is the easiest to set up and use and none have the scope or ability of the systems many people take for granted at work but then again , none of them require users to establish a tech support staff to make them work
consumer technology seers say they think they have a good idea about the home of the future it will be a place where photos , television shows , movies and music will be stored centrally and available in any room on demand it is called the connected home , where television sets , digital video recorders , dvd and music players and computers are all tied together but an important question must be answered before the connected home becomes a reality how will everything actually be connected \? a number of electronics companies and industry groups are working to answer that question , developing standards for connecting home entertainment devices consumers who have created a small home computer network know of a few solutions that at first glance seem like candidates , like ethernet cables and wireless but while tying together two or three computers to share an internet connection and swap the occasional music or photo file is one thing , a home entertainment network can be another thing entirely it can involve many more gadgets television sets in the family room , kitchen and bedrooms cable boxes satellite tv receivers dvd and audio players in the den amplifiers and speakers scattered throughout the house and one or more computers and multimedia files like highdefinition video or movies can be enormous , requiring lots of bandwidth running ethernet wire throughout a house to connect so many devices can be very expensive , particularly in an older home and current versions of home wireless technology are not good contenders for home entertainment signals can be erratic , depending on the time of day , distance from the router and factors like interference from other home appliances move a wireless television like sony s locationfree model around the house , and watch the picture come and go so the ideal solution for the connected home would seem to be to find some wiring already in the house that digital data could share fortunately , most homes already have electrical wiring and coaxial cable baby boomers may recall that a home s electrical wiring has been called into alternative service previously in the 1970 s , various companies sold devices with such names as the little wonder tv antenna plug it into the wall , and it promised to turn a home s wiring into a giant tv antenna , forever ridding the set of ghosts and snow unlike those novelty items , today s radically different technology actually works companies like netgear already sell products that extend wireless signals by transmitting them through electrical wiring to other rooms to pick up the signal , users plug a network interface box into an electrical outlet the technology uses a standard called homeplug 10 , developed by an industry group called the homeplug powerline alliance the group hopes an advanced version of that standard , homeplug av , will become an industry standard for homeentertainment networks backed by companies like comcast , echostar and radioshack , the group is designing its homeplug av standard to reliably carry 150 megabits of data a second over home electrical wiring a highdefinition video stream uses about 24 megabits a second , so the standard should provide enough capacity to simultaneously send multiple streams of hd video from room to room not everyone thinks the homeplug approach is such a great idea another group of semiconductor and electronics companies , including dlink , motorola , panasonic and thomson , wants to use existing coaxial cable , now used for cable tv , as the network link many homes already have coax going to at least several rooms last week , the multimedia over coax alliance announced that it had successfully tested the technology in more than 200 homes , and that it was able to deliver data at a rate of 100 megabits a second in 95 percent of the wall outlets it tested the 5 percent that did not achieve that rate have problems like deteriorated cable and are easily fixable , said ladd wardani , president of the group in the worst case , we 'd just have to run another coax cable , he said but if that happened with power lines , you 'd need an electrician to fix it mr wardani also argued that coax cables were not subject to line interference from other devices , as the technology operates in a different frequency range homeplug proponents naturally disagree with such conclusions various errorcorrecting technologies eliminate problems like noise , according to oleg logvinov , president of the group mr logvinov said that the coaxial cable approach had problems because many consumers use cable tv splitters , coax will not be easily suitable for twoway communications , he said the fundamental issue is , what is the convenience factor \? mr logvinov said where i would place my lcd tv is not necessarily where i would have a coax outlet consumer electronics companies continue to hedge their bets , supporting either multiple connectivity approaches or none at all panasonic , a former member of the homeplug alliance , has left the group together with sony and mitsubishi it has created the cepowerline communications alliance , which advocates another version of power line technology homeplug s specification does not adequately address interference issues , according to paul liao , panasonic north america s chief technology officer yet at the same time , panasonic is also working with the coaxial cable group its partners sony and mitsubishi continue as members of homeplug and sharp , while also a member of the homeplug alliance , is in no way committed to one technology or organization , said deepak ayyagari , principal scientist with sharp laboratories no matter how ubiquitous coax or electrical outlets may be in a house , there will always be some place in a room that does not have easy access to either all too often , that is just where someone will want to put a new flatpanel tv to tackle such problems , a new shortrange , highdatarate wireless technology is being developed proponents of both coax and home wiring see it as a natural complement to their own hardwired schemes known as ultrawideband or uwb , this new wireless technology promises to deliver data at 480 megabits a second at distances up to 30 feet while the range is too short for wireless networks , it could be ideal to provide the last few feet of connectivity needed for tv s and other consumer electronics devices that need to be placed a few feet away from an electrical or coax outlet homeplug and uwb can be a remarkable marriage , mr logvinov said he envisions a day when ultrawideband is used to beam a television program guide to a handheld organizer , while the shows themselves are sent via power lines products using these three technologies will begin to appear this year or in 2006 at first , interface devices will be sold , small units that plug into an electrical or cable outlet , and then transmit their signal to a television or other device through an ethernet cable or other means only later will chips and other hardware using these standards be incorporated in products like television sets and dvd players the cost may be low enough that all three standards could be incorporated in a single product , letting the market decide which ones to adopt there will be a place for all of this stuff , said mr liao of panasonic you wo n't need it all , but it will become cheap enough to get it all circuits correction april 18 , 2005 , monday a circuits article in business day on thursday about prospective networking methods for digital entertainment devices in the home , and a related chart , referred incorrectly to the involvement of two companies in efforts to promote the use of coaxial cable the companies , thomson and dlink , have demonstrated products to be certified by the multimedia over coax alliance , a group developing technical standards , but they are not members
the row house that collapsed in brooklyn on thursday , injuring 11 workers , had warped wooden joists and an old , weak brick support wall that appears to have given way as workers were rebuilding it , the engineer overseeing the project said yesterday the engineer , brian flynn , who submitted plans for renovating the building to the city , said that a bearing wall had buckled , perhaps because the joists were overloaded with construction material or the wall s mortar had disintegrated it obviously was a very old building that the owners were trying to rehabilitate , mr flynn said it just was n't , i guess , strong enough the building , at 103 meserole street in williamsburg , was demolished yesterday a spokeswoman for the department of buildings , ilyse fink , said the department s investigation into the cause of the collapse was still under way the adjoining buildings remained evacuated yesterday as engineers sought to evaluate the structural integrity at 105 meserole street and workers made the side wall at 101 meserole street watertight a spokesman for the fire department said that one worker remained in critical but stable condition at bellevue hospital center in manhattan none of the workers' names were released , and the fire department had no information on the conditions of the 10 other workers the building had not been occupied since august 2002 , when an engineer working for the city s department of housing preservation and development determined that it was unsafe on april 30 , 2003 , the department filed plans with the department of buildings to construct a wooden support on the first floor to maintain structural integrity , ms fink said a spokeswoman for the housing preservation department , carol abrams , said the department s last involvement with the building was in 2004 , when an administrator overseeing the building was discharged because the building was empty mr flynn , the engineer , said that before the renovations began , all the floors were sagging , not dangerously but not something you 'd want to live in city finance department records list the current owner as an entity called meserole street associates , represented by adam luckner of woodmere , ny reached by telephone , mr luckner denied ownership of the building , saying that a title company had failed to file records of its sale four months ago buildings department records list the applicant to make renovations as meserole shitfas a call to a number provided by the city for that entity was answered by a man who also denied ownership and who did not give his name a woman who answered the telephone at the number provided by the city for the contractor , precision construction of brooklyn , said she was just the cleaning lady a message left for officials of the company was not answered city officials suggested that the difference in their records could indicate that meserole street and meserole shitfas were parts of related companies mr flynn , the engineer , indicated that both were involved in the building s ownership construction accidents have recurred in the city in recent years , including a balcony that collapsed in brooklyn last may and a concrete wall that collapsed last june workers were killed in those collapses ms fink , of the buildings department , said the volume of construction work was a factor in the spate of collapses the issuance of work permits citywide has increased 20 percent over five years ago , she said , adding that when there s more work , there s more accidents mr flynn said the age of the city housing stock added to the danger construction in new york city is going at an alarming pace , he said , and a lot of it is in older buildings correction june 16 , 2005 , thursday an article on may 21 about an engineer s theory that the age of a brooklyn building undergoing renovations contributed to its collapse included outdated ownership information from city records the listed owner , meserole street associates , sold the building in august to meserole shitfas llc , according to the deed , which was not filed until may 24 , five days after the building fell
jackie mason and raoul felder who cares about the food , or the service , at ben jack s steak house when a nightly cast of new york city characters straight out of broadway danny rose occupies center stage \? woody allen , of course , sits in the back room , where the spotlight shines not on the guests but on a lifesize golden bull or is it a fatted calf \? in fact , who needs peter luger when several of its former waiters and a grill cook , following in the footsteps of those who went to wolfgang s , have decamped to this latest attempt to imitate that legendary steakhouse in brooklyn \? it s unfortunate that the food at ben jack s strives to mimic peter luger s , rather than to aim higher the prices for steak are within a nickel of each other 3695 at ben jack s in manhattan , 3690 in brooklyn the question is whether either one is worth it and at ben jack s , when the service is off , the answer is definitely no on my visits the service was generally very pleasant \( if absentminded \) especially the night when two guests at my table fell into the category of boldface names although it could be rockbottom insulting for example , the night of the almost three hour dinner from hell , when it helped to pass the time speculating on what mr felder , the celebrity divorce lawyer , who observes kosher dietary laws , was going to eat in a nonkosher steakhouse \( salmon and spinach \) still , it was annoying to wait 30 minutes for a waiter to take the drink order we were further riveted by mr felder s pal mr mason , with his paleorange coif touched by hints of pink , snacking on the bottled salad dressing \( another luger derivative \) and proclaiming it delicious , delicious but celebritywatching barely kept our minds off the 60 additional minutes it took for the first course to arrive we were not alone patrons at several tables around us \( feldermason excluded \) kept looking from their watches to the empty spaces where their plates should have been finally someone at my table practically tripped our waiter to inquire about our longlost meal we have a lot of private parties , and they have to be served first , was his brutally honest reply he was not just harried he was insulting and who can forget the sight of the ma tre d'h tel or was he an owner \? chewing gum while pacing the dining room the food at ben jack s is equally uneven , though the onion rolls , described by one guest as very brooklyn , are just like the famous ones at the mother ship one night some slices of a porterhouse were tough , but on two other visits , all were tender , juicy and full of flavor what you always hope a steak will be , but seldom is then on a fourth visit the steak was slightly chewy and not very beefy in flavor filet mignon , though cooked to death at the diner s request , was still tender another evening , a mediumrare fillet was also tender , with flavor as good as that cut of meat can have but it was dry a ribeye steak was tender but flavorless lamb chops were not memorable in both cases the meat was not much different from what i had recently sampled on a visit to luger in keeping with the expected overthetop steakhouse experience , there was far too much of everything but it s hard to come to grips with the practice of pouring sizzling butter over a grilled steak is it to add flavor to flavorless meat \? to make dry meat juicy \? or simply wretched excess \? weighing in at four pounds , the lobster was rubbery and tasteless from stem to stern most of the meat ended up in a doggie bag , in hopes that it would make a decent lobster salad the lobster cocktail fared no better but the crab meat cocktail was deliciously sweet that sort of inconsistency plagued the rest of the menu there was perfectly cooked tuna one night nicely grilled outside , rare inside on another evening the chilean sea bass was inedible , and the shrimp were overcooked one night the oysters were tasteless on two other visits they were briny and sweet there was a nice caesar salad , but at the height of tomato season where was the restaurant buying such hard , notveryred tomatoes for its mozzarella salad \?

moscow , june 12 a bomb derailed a passenger train traveling from chechnya to moscow on sunday , injuring at least 15 people in what officials described as a terrorist attack the bombing occurred around 7 am as the train approached uzunova , a village roughly 90 miles south of moscow , officials cited by news agencies said nikolai n zakharov , a spokesman for the federal security service , said in televised remarks that an improvised remote control device was found about 50 yards from the site of the explosion the force of the blast derailed the locomotive and four passenger cars , but did not overturn them the train had been traveling slowly , minimizing the number of casualties there were no immediate claims of responsibility for the bombing , but the timing and the target suggested a link to the war in chechnya the train only last year resumed regular service between moscow and chechnya s capital , grozny , and previous attacks have come on holidays sunday was a national holiday commemorating the russian republic s declaration of independence from the soviet union in 1990 none of the injuries were reported to be serious only a handful of passengers were hospitalized , the interfax news agency reported
the national association for the advancement of colored people is locked in a standoff with the internal revenue service , preferring to risk its tax exemption rather than hand over documents for an irs review that the civil rights group contends is politically motivated while it is rare for an organization to defy the irs openly , the naacp is not the only group that believes it is being made a government target for its positions on issues roughly a dozen nonprofit organizations have publicly contended that government agencies and congressional offices have used reviews , audits , investigations , law enforcement actions and the threat of a loss of federal money to discourage them from activities and advocacy that in any way challenge government policies , and nonprofit leaders say more are complaining quietly in previous administrations , there s been the occasional instance of what might appear to be retaliation , but when it started happening in a serial way , it began to look like a pattern to us , said kay guinane , counsel for the nonprofit advocacy project of omb watch , a government watchdog group that has published two reports on the issue government agencies , which are under increasing financial pressure themselves , say they are merely enforcing rules on use of public money and nonprofit assets federal law prohibits organizations from using government financing for lobbying purposes , and tax law limits the use of charitable assets in general for lobbying in the 1990 s and early 2000 s , some of our grantees had n't been reviewed , had n't had a site visit in some time , said kathy harben , a spokeswoman for the centers for disease control and prevention in october 2002 , the financial management office renewed its commitment to reviewing funded programs through regular site visits gauging whether liberal groups are being singled out for review more than conservative ones is almost impossible to determine because audits , investigations and threats are rarely made public liz towne , director of advocacy programs for the alliance for justice , a group that educates charities about how to avoid running afoul of tax laws that restrict their ability to lobby , said , when we talked to the brain trust of lawyers who represent nonprofits around the country , they were saying , 'well , i do n't know if we see a pattern that goes beyond the usual kinds of complaints and investigations ' but , she added , the group sensed a higher level of attention to nonprofits and their activities and that people are getting more sophisticated in how to get nonprofits to back off their message the review of the naacp comes after the organization s chairman , julian bond , gave a speech at its 2004 convention sharply criticizing the republicans , president bush and vice president dick cheney the tax agency reminded the naacp that taxexempt organizations were barred from supporting or opposing any candidate after the organization complained that it was a political target , the irs commissioner , mark w everson , asked the inspector general of the treasury department to review the irs process of choosing which groups to investigate for politicking last month , the inspector general concluded that political considerations had no role in the irs s selection of an organization for review of 40 cases studied by the inspector general , 18 were characterized as involving prorepublican organizations , 12 prodemocratic and one progreen the inspector general was unable to determine the affiliation of the other nine the inspector general also looked at 20 cases the irs declined to review and found 8 were prorepublican and 4 prodemocratic the agency also heard complaints of selective enforcement under the clinton administration , but a study by the general accounting office , the investigative arm of congress , found no evidence then of irs wrongdoing a spokesman for the naacp , john white , said last week that it was waiting for the irs to make the next move the tax agency says it does not comment on specific cases another agency that says it has been singled out for government scrutiny is advocates for youth , which operates programs that educate young people around the world about reproductive health and has received federal money for various programs for more than two decades it opposes the bush administration s push for the adoption of programs that advocate abstinence as the only way to prevent childhood pregnancy and sexual transmission of diseases in september 2002 , 24 republicans in congress sent a letter to tommy g thompson , then the secretary of health and human services , demanding an audit and accusing advocates for youth of violating the law by using federal money to support lobbying its activities included visiting congressional offices to distribute a report by the institute of medicine that questioned the efficacy of abstinenceonly sex education james wagoner , the president of advocates for youth , said the group has strict internal procedures to ensure that federal support backs only programs for children it was bareknuckled intimidation , mr wagoner said of the congressional request a month later , the cdc , which is part of the health and human services department , asked advocates for youth to demonstrate with documentation that none of its money had been used for lobbying activities in january 2003 , the general accounting office , now known as the government accountability office , informed the group that at the request of representatives christopher h smith of new jersey and joe pitts of pennsylvania , both republicans , it was investigating how much federal money advocates for youth and organizations like it spent on international and domestic activities the gao review documented how the groups spent their federal financing , but did not touch on the issue of lobbying two months after the report was released , the centers subjected the organization to a business and financial evaluation , also at the behest of the two congressmen advocates said it spent 100 , 000 , or more than 2 percent of its annual budget , responding to the agencies' requests to date , it says it has not been told the results of the cdc reviews another organization , the global health council , lost financial commitments from the united states agency for international development , the cdc and the health resources and services administration for the council s annual conference last year the centerpiece of the conference was a debate on preventing the transmission of hiv among youth dr nils daulaire , president and chief executive of the global health council , said he believed the group had lost the money because a representative from planned parenthood was invited to the debate and a representative of the united nations population fund was the host of another discussion both organizations support a variety of approaches to sex education a spokeswoman for aid said the agency had concerns because moveonorg , a political group that opposed president bush in the 2004 election , was set to participate , which the agency saw as an increasingly partisan bent to the conference ms harben , the centers' spokeswoman , said , the agenda submitted with the application indicated some of the conference activities would support lobbying , and the budget that was submitted was not able to show that federal funds would not be used for lobbying activities the latest groups to complain that a congressional inquiry is really an effort to punish them for opposition to republican policy are the state and territorial air pollution program administrators and its sister group , the association of local air pollution control officials three days after one of their officials went before the senate environment and public works committee and criticized the clear skies act of 2005 for being too lenient on power plant emissions , the groups were asked by senator james m inhofe , republican of oklahoma and the committee chairman , to supply several years of tax returns , lists of contributors and other documentation the legislation , which president bush supports , stalled on march 10 when the committee deadlocked on whether to send it to the full senate will hart , a spokesman for the committee , said no one had accused the organizations of wrongdoing he said the request for information was made as part of a formal review of organizations that receive grants from the environmental protection agency after a critical gao report in 2003 that said the agency needed better oversight of its grantees hindsight being 20 20 , should we have included those questions relating to the investigation with questions about the testimony on clear skies \? probably not , he said then the perception of them might have been different s william becker , the organizations' executive director of 24 years , says senator inhofe s inquiries were an effort to intimidate his organizations and silence their dissent there is no way of sugarcoating it , mr becker said
jeff koons s 1991 wood sculpture of a vase of colorful spring flowers , from an edition of three , is expected to sell for 22 million to 28 million on may 11 in christie s sale of postwar and contemporary art when estimates for contemporary floral art reach this level , it is easy to see why collectors flock to antique botanical prints they are affordable , attractive and still original works of art , said danielle ann millican , one of 30 dealers participating in the new york botanical garden s 2005 antique garden furniture show and sale today through sunday and they are cheaper than watercolors or oils ms millican , a private dealer based in new jersey , specializes in woodcuts , engravings , lithographs and other illustrations of botany , zoology , architecture , world exploration and maps from the 15th through the 20th centuries she is also an appraiser and professional picture framer who offers archival matting , mounting and framing services her prints range from 200 to 25 , 000 this weekend she plans to show 16 prints , both framed and unframed , from the temple of flora , a popular illustrated book on flowers by a london doctor , robert john thornton \( 17681837 \) , who may have been the first to include landscape backgrounds with floral subjects thornton was more a romantic poet , writer and producer than an artist he hired painters to depict the flowers , saving only roses for himself he literally directed his flower pictures , ms millican said he chose the plants , arranged the symbolism and the backgrounds she has his print of a nightblooming cereus , in which the moon illuminates a clock at midnight , the hour when the flower is open thornton plates depict both ordinary flowers like primroses , carnations and lilies and plants like the narrowleafed kalmia and the winged passion flower no other book of english flower illustrations has quite the celebrity , geoffrey grigson wrote in an introduction to a 1951 edition of thornton s book naturally so , for its appeal is to the emotions and not to the botanical scientist or even to the scientific or painstaking gardener gordon dunthorne , author of flower and fruit prints of the 18th and early 19th centuries , was equally candid thornton s work has no enduring scientific importance its text is full of irrelevant triviality , pomposity and sentimentality , he wrote in 1938 indeed , his prose can be fully ludicrous nevertheless , the pages of 'the temple of flora' are well worth perusal redolent of the romantic spirit of their age , these plates still cast their spell of enchantment thornton s venture was a financial disaster his flower plates used several techniques mezzotint , aquatint and stipple engraving and were often finished in watercolor by hand they cost a fortune to produce and initially did not sell well he ran out of money and his family was nearly destitute when he died he s still my very favorite botanical illustrator , ms millican said sentimental , sensational , glorious , garish , exotic , exaggerated all are fitting descriptions of his work i think he must have had great fun the market for antique botanical prints is currently quite good last week , at the new york international art and antiques show in new york , andrew koromvokis , the owner of odyssey fine arts in london , nearly sold out his botanical prints , as well as his late 18th and early 19thcentury french and italian antiques andrew always does well because he has great style , said meg wendy of wendy management , the show s organizer it s all about presentation he shows the prints in sets of handpainted frames that he designed himself mr vokis was selling work by some of the bestknown botanical artists he sold prints by the english naturalist mark catesby , an amateur artist who painted birds , fish and reptiles in the american south and the bahamas in the early 18th century , 100 years before audubon he always drew from the living plant 'fresh and just gather 'd' , the british art historian wilfrid blunt wrote in 1950 in the art of botanical illustration , an authoritative book on the subject some drawings in catesby s natural history of carolina \( 173143 \) were by georg dionysius ehret \( 170870 \) , a talented german artist who was trained by the swedish naturalist carl linnaeus \( mr volkis sold a set of six prints of tulips by ehret \) a man of modest background , ehret became a gardener as a teenager and drew plants in his leisure time he quit to travel around europe , often supporting himself by copying botanicals of others in 1736 , he moved to london , where he worked for aristocratic patrons by 1740 the artist had made himself complete master of his technique , and during the next 10 years an endless flow of magnificent paintings came from his brush , blunt wrote his approach was a fine compromise between that of the artist and that of the scientist he did not slavishly imitate what he saw , as do so many botanical draftsmen with a purely scientific training nor did he allow his feeling for color and design to distract him unduly from the fundamentals of plant structure the complicated history of botanical illustration is well covered by blunt \( brother of the notorious anthony blunt , the art historian late in life identified as a soviet spy \) beginning in the 16th century , both england and the continent produced many fine artists , each of whom gets his due in the book perhaps none was more celebrated than pierrejoseph redout \( 17591840 \) , a belgianborn flower painter who settled in france in 1782 known for his ravishing watercolors of roses , redout had a brief connection with the court of louis xvi but found true fame and fortune under napoleon in 1798 , josephine hired him to record the flowers in her resplendent gardens at malmaison he later worked for charles x and continued to paint until he died at age 80 redout claimed to have invented a method of color printing called stipple engraving , which used etched dots rather than lines on the plates botanical artists like redout can easily be tracked in the database of the luesther t mertz library at the new york botanical garden , which has 15 , 000 original botanical illustrations in various media , including line drawings , prints , watercolors and oil paintings the morgan library in new york , temporarily closed during its building expansion , also has a rich collection of herbal and botanical illustrations from the middle ages through the 19th century , including watercolor and gouache flower portraits by ehret , ink and gouache drawings and watercolors of roses by redout , and gouaches by catesby
mortimer b zuckerman has pulled the plug on radar magazine after just three issues radar employees had just celebrated the publication of its third issue surpassing the two issues it published in its previous incarnation in 2003 and were scrambling to close the fourth mr zuckerman , the publishing and real estate mogul who also owns the daily news and us news world report , said in an interview last night that radar had failed to attract enough advertising to keep it afloat it s too difficult a climate to start magazines in , given the advertising conditions for this period of time , he said what is more , he said , advertisers schedule their spending months in advance , making it hard for new magazines to break in maer roshan , editor of radar , an urban pop culture magazine , could not be reached for comment he told his staff last night the magazine was closing , but friends said he was trying to find a way to keep it alive or at least to print the fourth issue , which was supposed to have closed this week and was due out at the end of january mr roshan had been seeking investors to take over the magazine from mr zuckerman , friends said , but it was not clear if he would be able to bring them together in time to keep the magazine going without mr zuckerman mr zuckerman and jeffrey epstein , the financier , agreed last fall to invest 25 million in radar that was after mr zuckerman failed in his bid to buy new york magazine and it was after radar had failed the first time around , when it ran out of cash after just two issues mr zuckerman said at the time he wanted to revive the magazine because he believed in mr roshan , who had worked previously at new york and at talk i 've always believed that a great editor is what makes the difference , he told the new york times in april , adding , if it were n't for maer , i would n't be doing this the first issue appeared this summer with an advertising rate based on 150 , 000 readers notable articles in the magazine , known for its irreverent approach to gossip and pop culture , included one on scientology and tom cruise and one about employees at disney world but radar failed to catch on with advertisers a staff member at the magazine said mr zuckerman , who has been cutting costs at us news , appeared to be growing impatient and told mr roshan a month ago that he should find a new backer four potential buyers were looking at the magazine as of yesterday , this staff member said , but none of them were ready to close a deal
the recent bankruptcy filing of winndixie stores , the supermarket chain , would seem to be the latest evidence that walmart , dreaded by competitors as retailing s 24houraday death star , has lost none of its pricecutting potency the company s apparent invincibility is part of what galls its critics , whose opposition led to the cancellation of a proposed walmart in queens the conventional criticism of walmart is that it s an insatiable capitalist juggernaut , reaping private benefit at the expense of the public good the view retains some currency , i suspect , because many of walmart s critics have n't really shopped there the funny thing is that , for quite a while , this view has had the situation almost exactly backward instead of producing private benefit at public expense , walmart has been producing public benefit at private expense and the equation is likely to become ever more lopsided like the airlines , whose investors generously provide low fares and convenient service while forgoing gains for themselves , walmart has kindly mustered considerable capital from investors with the goal of providing all kinds of basic goods under one roof at convenient locations and amazingly low prices these investors must be charitably minded because they are n't the main beneficiaries of walmart s business for several years now , the shareholders , who have more than 200 billion tied up in the company , have not done especially well since the end of 1999 , walmart stock is off 23 percent , while target is up 43 percent and lowe s is up 95 percent the big winners during this period were the juggernaut s customers , who gained by having walmart drive down the price of consumer goods assuming that walmart investors are more affluent than its shoppers , the system offers a progressive transfer from rich to poor from capital owners to less prosperous american consumers and hardworking chinese factory hands it s like robin hood , only with parking it s tempting to say that some of the benefits to shoppers come at the expense of walmart s roughly 12 million employees , but it s a tough case to make many walmart employees presumably ca n't get better jobs if they could , they would by continuing to work at the chain , they are showing that they prefer the jobs they have to no jobs at all if walmart vanished , in fact , they would be in big trouble indeed for walmart shoppers , the good news is that , for a variety of reasons , they can expect the investors' largess to continue if you shop at walmart or its sam s club unit , you know that the company cannot afford to raise prices much , because prices are almost the only reason to go to these places i shop at walmart stores occasionally , and the ones i visit are poorly lit , poorly organized and unenthusiastically staffed the clothing is mostly relentlessly unfashionable , and the groceries far from tempting when compared with those of a firstclass supermarket chain like wegmans , based in rochester that chain is a perennial on fortune magazine s list of best places to work if walmart does improve its stores , it s hard to see how customers will be made to pay for it without the risk of sending them elsewhere walmart s low cost of labor , meanwhile , appears to be under pressure sooner or later , union organizers may succeed at some of its stores , and in any event , the company may have to spend more on wages , benefits and working conditions , if only to improve its public image and to keep the unions at bay then there is sheer arithmetic walmart is already so big that it simply will not be able to match the hypergrowth of its own past unless it soon employs everyone in the world if you do n't have much money , walmart is a godsend , and , in a way , that s the trouble walmart s hold on its shoppers is largely mercenary , and therefore tenuous to me , shopping at walmart feels like a chore , and sam s club is better only if there s no costco nearby in other words , i think the juggernaut is vulnerable it may well be , for the foreseeable future , that it s smarter to buy stuff at walmart than to buy stock in walmart the stock may or may not be a good deal the stuff is a sure thing on the contrary daniel akst is a journalist and novelist who writes often about business email culmoney nytimescom
east rutherford , nj , dec 16 nets coach lawrence frank will almost certainly continue to preach hard work , a shortterm memory and a teamfirst approach as the season goes on if he needs an example , he can simply point to what scott padgett did here friday night against the denver nuggets two nights ago , a couple of nets complained that they were not getting enough playing time , and the team appeared on edge after its third consecutive loss on friday night , padgett , who had remained quiet at the end of the bench most of the season , made all five of his 3point attempts in the fourth quarter and in overtime to help the nets win , 115106 , at continental arena the victory snapped the nets' fourgame losing streak at home and moved their record to 1012 padgett , who finished with 15 points , was a prime example of what frank has talked about in recent days stick to the game plan , forget the past , play loose , and everything will work itself out while padgett provided a surprise boost , vince carter asserted his dominance he led all scorers with 34 points and set the tone with three firstquarter 3pointers padgett said he had taken frank s message to play stressfree to heart his teammates also seemed to do so , especially in overtime , when the nets made eight of nine shots and outscored the nuggets , 2112 it was a small insight to the bigger picture , guard jacque vaughn said of padgett s performance i played with scott in utah , and the one thing that we both were taught was to not play backwards and to play forward i think he did a great job of that tonight in the sense that the first couple plays did n't go right for him , but he remained poised , and when he had the opportunity to knock down shots , he did padgett missed his first three shots , all layups but there was no stopping him in the game s crucial moments padgett made four 3pointers in the fourth quarter , perhaps none bigger than the one with 536 seconds remaining that left the nets trailing , 9290 after earl watson missed a 3point shot , richard jefferson drove on kenyon martin , a former net , at the other end and was fouled jefferson hit one free throw to make the score 9291 with 251 seconds left andre miller , who led denver \( 1212 \) with 22 points , made two free throws with about 20 seconds left to make the score 9491 jason kidd then made a 3pointer with 113 seconds to play to send the game into overtime kidd got an open look because the defense charged toward padgett , who had swung the ball to kidd padgett made his final 3pointer with just under four minutes remaining in overtime to give the nets a 10096 lead , and the nuggets did not come back i think everybody played looser , not worried about making mistakes , padgett said i think we played free tonight kidd had 15 points and 16 assists , and jefferson scored 21 points after missing all eight of his shots in the first half , nuggets swingman carmelo anthony gave the nets a late scare he scored 15 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter and overtime , including 11 consecutive nuggets points in the fourth we bent , but we did n't break tonight , kidd said hopefully we can build on that rebounds kenyon martin made his second return to continental arena since leaving the nets before last season the fans gave martin an ovation when he was introduced martin , who finished with 16 points , 9 rebounds and 3 blocked shots , chuckled when he was told the nets were still seeking an athletic power forward to replace him they had one , he said strange things have happened in sports , like the red sox getting rid of babe ruth
houston , feb 24 a federal judge here dismissed on thursday night an effort by the russian oil company yukos to seek bankruptcy protection in the united states , thwarting its hope of putting some american legal hurdles in front of the international banks involved in the russian government s breakup of the company the ruling may set an important precedent for financially troubled foreign companies seeking haven in bankruptcy courts in the united states , one of the few nations where executives of debtor companies are normally allowed to retain control after filing for bankruptcy protection yukos s opponents argued that its chief financial officer , bruce k misamore , had essentially manufactured a commercial presence in houston during a few days in december in a bid to retain control of the company i hope this convinces us bankruptcy courts to pull back from their foreign adventures , said lynn m lopucki , a specialist on bankruptcy law at the university of california at los angeles who has criticized courts that accept foreign bankruptcy cases worth millions in fees for lawyers the lawyers in turn , mr lopucki said , often lobby for the appointment of friendly judges the decision , by judge letitia z clark , could also pave the way for the renationalization of some of the commanding assets of russia s oil industry under control of the government of president vladimir v putin the russian government has been seeking to strengthen energy companies under its control while sparring with yukos in russian courts over unpaid tax bills estimated at 28 billion yukos , in a lastditch effort to prevent russia s sale at auction of a major subsidiary to a large governmentcontrolled energy company , had filed for bankruptcy protection in houston in december , after mr misamore fled here from moscow with little more than a laptop and several million dollars hastily deposited in american bank accounts to pay lawyers' fees that move prompted judge clark to issue a ruling in december that effectively prevented a group of international banks , including deutsche bank and jp morgan chase , from financing the takeover of yukos by gazprom , a natural gas monopoly controlled by russia s government instead , a shadow bidder won control of yukos in a deal widely seen as a preliminary transaction for folding yukos into a larger governmentcontrolled entity while there is precedent for maintenance of a bankruptcy case in the united states by corporations domiciled outside the united states , none of those precedents cover a corporation which is a central part of the economy in which the corporation was created , judge clark wrote in the ruling issued thursday night michael lake , a spokesman for yukos , said thursday night that the company was not sure what it would do next because its lawyers and representatives had not had time to thoroughly read judge clark s decision but mr lake said yukos was considering several options , including an appeal or a motion for reconsideration
mike breen , the lead playbyplay announcer for the new york knicks , knew at an early age that his life as an athlete was limited when it came time for mr breen , then a yonkers teenager , to look at colleges in the late 1970 s , no athletic recruiters materialized he did have a backup ambition , though mr breen s boyhood friend , tony minecola , had set up a pretend radio station in his mother s basement and , the two recalled , mr breen would entertain friends by calling games the question then became how to make a career in sportscasting the answer came in the form of a university he chose primarily for its 50 , 000watt radio station by choosing fordham university and then going on to success in sports broadcasting , mr breen is typical of a long line of students who have worked at wfuvfm \( 907 \) , the public radio station licensed to the school in particular , they work on its saturday afternoon sports callin show , one on one , now in its 30th year the station s alumni are working the microphones for teams in the metropolitan area and across the nation bob papa , the voice of the new york giants , is one , as are chris carrino , the nets radio voice , and michael kay , who calls yankee games vin scully , who has called los angeles dodgers games in elegant tones for decades , is also a wfuv graduate others are working in the studio , like peter ciccone , espn s radio network news editor , and mike rizzo , executive director of news and sports for abc news radio about two dozen students take part in one on one each year this year , they include greg giombarrese , a senior from westwood , nj , who is doing playbyplay for many football and basketball games i played baseball in high school , but i was n't good enough to play in college , mr giombarrese said i guess i'm not alone in this sort of story he is part of the television generation that came of age in an era of nearly limitless cable stations the same students were also raised on sports radio , which became common more than two decades ago these days , in addition to wanting to be the next mike breen , students are likely to aspire to have a talk show like mike and the mad dog on wfanam \( 660 \) on days when there are no fordham games to broadcast , one on one carries talk of current issues in sports , as well as reports by station beat reporters assigned to the area s professional teams students who work at the station are paid as part of a workstudy program bob ahrens , the executive sports producer of the station , is a 68yearold with glasses and a gruff facade who grew up in brooklyn and still pines for the dodgers \( mr ahrens also teaches a course on ethics in sports broadcasting , which some think is an oxymoron , he said \) to those announcing games , he emphasizes the importance of learning the vocabulary of court and field geography and to realize that , at least on the radio , you can almost never err by frequently giving down and distance , score and time to those on talk shows , he preaches preparation and candor keep your foot out of your mouth by admitting you do n't know something to show students how improvement is possible , he likes to play old tapes of the more successful announcers dan flanagan , a junior playbyplay man with a midwest cadence , said the most important lesson he learned at the station came in the form of a metaphor announcing baseball , he heard at a seminar arranged by mr ahrens , is like sitting in a rocking chair when there is action you lean forward when there s none , you lean back and tell stories both mr flanagan and mr giombarrese were interns last summer as announcers in remote minor league outposts summer jobs set up by mr ahrens he calls to the point of annoyance , said mr breen , the knicks announcer , but it s not annoying because you know how much he is trying to help the kids before they get regular air time , students are given editing and scheduling tasks there are also regular seminars by the likes of mr breen , who encourages students to send him tapes to review he , along with other graduates , also come back to call portions of fordham games beside the student announcers eric spitz , the program director for wfan , recently gave about 20 students a seminar he is not a graduate but is one of many outsiders who come to speak , mostly at mr ahrens s request for those who want to follow in the footsteps of mike and the mad dog , considered secular saints by the students , mr spitz stressed the importance of developing a contrarian streak a speaking style is important , whether for calling games or commenting on them afterward , he said to mr breen , the chance to work in other parts of the radio station proved advantageous as a freshman , he spun records during an overnight shift when he was the only person at the station as it happened , he was there , the only one there , on the december night in 1980 when john lennon was killed i was a geeky freshman , said mr breen , who recalled playing a lot of beatles songs and reading news in stilted fashion from the associated press eventually , he had to call the program director for help calls kept coming in from

golden globe voters turned their backs on hollywood s major studios tuesday , spreading best drama nominations among small , arthouse films including the director ang lee s brokeback mountain , about a romance between cowboys george clooney s good night , and good luck , about the television newsman edward r murrow , and woody allen s thriller match point in doing so , the hollywood foreign press association , which awards the globes , ignored pedigreed oscar aspirants like steven spielberg s munich , about the assassination of the killers of israeli athletes at the 1972 olympics , and rob marshall s memoirs of a geisha , a sweeping japanese epic mr spielberg received a nomination for directing munich , and ziyi zhang was nominated for her role in memoirs of a geisha , but neither film was nominated in the globes' bestpicture categories other nominees for best drama were fernando meirelles s constant gardener and david cronenberg s history of violence in a somewhat curious twist , nominations for best musical or comedy went to two movies that seemed to be neither joe wright s pride prejudice , a romantic adaptation of the jane austen novel , and james mangold s walk the line , a drama based on the life of johnny cash other nominees for musical and comedy were stephen frears s mrs henderson presents , about a wartime widow in england who puts on a nude revue susan stroman s producers , a new version of the hit broadway show and remake of the cult classic film and noah baumbach s squid and the whale , a wry comedy about a teenager s experience of his parents' divorce brokeback mountain took the most nominations , seven , but the broad range of choices across the board indicated that there were few frontrunners in this year s awards race based on a story by annie proulx , brokeback won the venice film festival in the fall and has been a critics' favorite heath ledger received a globe nomination as best actor for his touching portrayal of a tormented cowboy in love with jake gyllenhaal , while michelle williams was nominated as best supporting actress for playing mr ledger s wife mr lee was nominated as best director none of the films nominated for best drama had a budget of more than 30 million , said philip berk , president of the foreign press association , as the nominations were announced in beverly hills early tuesday morning indeed , brokeback had a budget of just 13 million , a quiet rebuke to the hollywood entertainment machine that has seen a number of bigbudget star vehicles like bewitched with nicole kidman and will ferrell and cinderella man with russell crowe fall short at the box office so far this year , no highbudget epic like the lord of the rings or the aviator has cornered attention on the awards circuit in the globes' best director category , nominations went to peter jackson for king kong , and to mr allen , mr clooney , mr lee , mr meirelles and mr spielberg for their films after failing at the box office earlier this year , cinderella man , ron howard s movie about a depressionera boxer , received nominations for mr crowe as best actor and for paul giamatti as best supporting actor other surprises were gwyneth paltrow s nomination as best actress for proof , a film that had little impact on critics or audiences , and terrence howard s nomination as best actor for his portrayal of a pimp aspiring to a music career in hustle flow the film was the sensation of the sundance film festival , but did not ignite the expected excitement with audiences golden globe nominations are often an early indicator of oscar prospects but they use dual categories for dramas and comedies in the best picture and acting areas , spreading recognition far more widely than the oscars , which use only one the hollywood foreign press association comprises 86 voters , most of them freelance writers for foreign publications , while the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has 5 , 800 who are eligible to vote for the oscars the foreign press association members have been criticized in the past for being open to influence by hollywood studios because they are annually wined and dined by aspirants to the awards and because they are such a small group of voters indeed , though the association has officially banned gifts in recent years , the studios still send annual goodies last week the group voted to send back free dvd players sent by upn to promote its show everybody hates chris , after variety carried an article about the players among television nominations , everybody hates chris was nominated this year as best musical or comedy series , along with curb your enthusiasm , desperate housewives , entourage , my name is earl and weeds the golden globes will be presented on jan 16 and televised on nbc oscar nominations are announced on jan 31 , and the awards will be presented on march 5 photos brokeback mountain received the most globe nominations seven \( photo by

philadelphia , dec 14 there was something insufferable about benjamin franklin , and many of his contemporaries knew it john adams wrote , had he been an ordinary man , i should never have taken the trouble to expose the turpitude of his intrigues , or to vindicate my reputation against his vilifications and calumnies franklin could change positions when they seemed unpopular , compromise on principles and turn statecraft into a matter of personality when he achieved any post of power , he stuffed relatives into remunerative positions while proclaiming that public servants should expect no payment at all in other contexts , franklin s treatment of family could have made poor richard blush through his almanack he began a threegeneration tradition of siring illegitimate children he made sure to spend 15 of the last 17 years of his marriage away from his wife in foreign lands , making no effort to see her in her final years to his children and heirs he was capable of stunning callousness mixed with bouts of devotion nor was his later reputation sterling among literary figures melville referred to franklin s primeval orientalness mark twain , only partly in jest , accused him of animosity toward boys with his pert maxims about propriety d h lawrence , who could have been franklin in a funhouse mirror , called him a dry , moral , utilitarian little democrat no , franklin , the middleclass materialist and moralist , has not had an easy time of it , particularly during much of the 20th century when he was often considered annoyingly bourgeois it is even difficult to clearly define his contribution to the founding of the united states unlike jefferson , he was not a devotee of high principle and a practitioner of high prose unlike washington , he could not have led an army through adversity or channeled a fledgling country through birth pangs unlike madison or even hamilton , he was no theoretician but none of this really matters compared with what franklin did achieve nor can it dampen the celebratory impact of an exciting new exhibition about franklin s life and achievements at the national constitution center in philadelphia , or slight the imposing sobriety of the 10 display cases stocked with franklin documents at the library of congress in washington on jan 17 , the 300th anniversary of franklin s birth will be celebrated , notably in philadelphia , which he was instrumental in establishing as a modern city by helping to found its major institutions america s first nonsectarian college \( ancestor to the university of pennsylvania \) , its first public hospital , its first subscription library and its first propertyinsurance company he will also be celebrated for his exploration of electricity \( saving cities with his invention of the lightning rod \) for slyly courting the french during the revolutionary war \( yielding a treaty that helped turn the tide against the british \) and for spurring a stalled constitutional convention toward compromise and a bicameral legislature in fact , the difficulty we find in placing franklin or in defining him is inseparable from the complexity of his achievements in the last five years he has been the subject of at least four biographies a gracefully intelligent survey by walter isaacson , a forceful and meticulous recreation of his french years by stacy schiff , major scholarly books by h w brands and edmund s morgan franklin emerges in these reconstructions as a founder of not only american institutions but of an idea of america itself like whitman , he contained multitudes and in his refusal to devote himself to a single dominating theory , in his skepticism about sweeping universals , in his devotion to compromise , in his forthright embrace of material prosperity , in his belief in community organization , and in his distinctive mixture of cynicism and idealism about humanity , he shaped a pragmatic temperament that can still be associated with the country he helped create if franklin were to mount a museum exhibition about himself , it might very well resemble in its variety , intelligence and pleasures benjamin franklin in search of a better world the curator of this philadelphia show is page talbott , a specialist in decorative and fine arts it contains more than 250 artifacts , ranging from one of jefferson s drafts of the declaration of independence \( his originally held truths to be sacred and undeniable franklin transformed them into truths held to be selfevident \) to franklin s fossilized mastodon tooth \( found near the ruins of his market street home \) to important paintings portraying the senior statesman almost no aspect of franklin s enterprise is left untouched printer \( the only surviving copy of franklin s first poor richard s almanack from 1733 \) , civic leader \( a suggestion box from the subscription library \) , scientist \( a modern version of his electrical apparatus , producing sparks by turning a handle \) , diplomat \( including a lifesize diorama of franklin facing british parliamentary accusations of fomenting american rebellion \) , inventor \( of bifocals , for instance , or the glass armonica , in which spinning bowls dampened by water created ethereal sounds that inspired compositions by mozart and beethoven \) and scattered throughout the exhibition are usable replicas of an armchair franklin invented slight pressure on a foot pedal waves a fan above one s head in creating such a show , franklin might have also done as this one does , and elide the shadows of his life and temperament , leaving behind only slight hints did franklin himself listen to poor richard s advice \? the exhibition asks about franklin s proverbs sometimes sometimes not there is also a tendency here at times to seek a kind of sensation that franklin would have looked askance at , simply because it adds so little to understanding one example is a giant model of a tree veined with colored fibers meant to symbolize franklin s junto society , made up of 12 citizens who met weekly for debate and civic planning press a button next to each member s name and the tree s fibers light up , leading to hanging signs displaying the philadelphia institutions that that member helped establish but one walks through the 8 , 000 square feet of this exhibition astonished at the fecundity of franklin s imagination and the range of his inventions something is reproduced , too , of his practical and playful spirit visitors will be challenged to flip numbers on a giant magic square to make all rows add to 15 the kind of puzzle that franklin turned into a specialty and just as franklin was remarkably attentive to younger children \( though he tended to become almost cavalier about their needs as they aged \) , the displays aimed at the younger set are whimsical without a hint of condescension \( men and melons is the first half of a maxim displayed in a participatory exhibit about poor richard visitors try to match the second half stink in three days , are hard to know or should not go barefoot missing in this chronological survey , though , is the kind of complication that accompanies darker shadows we learn , for example , that franklin s initial support of the british stamp act in 1765 led to serious problems with his american reputation , and we learn too that he hoped for some sort of reconciliation with the british empire when many of his compatriots had already committed to independence but it is at the library of congress that visitors can see one of the bald propaganda exercises franklin used to rescue his reputation when he returned to philadelphia from england in 1775 a furious letter to a british friend \( you are now my enemy \) that he never sent , but just showed around town \( the washington exhibition also shows the handwritten personal liturgy that franklin wrote for himself at the age of 22 as a substitute for attending church there could be more explanation in the philadelphia show , too , of what was at stake when franklin spent eight years in france as a representative of the continental congress , and of how difficult his task was persuading the continent s most traditionbound court that this creditless assemblage of colonies should be taken seriously , while also persuading representatives of the colonies that the court in paris could not simply be armwrestled into a treaty franklin used a chess metaphor , echoed in the philadelphia exhibition , to explain his actions , but we do n't really learn enough of the moves to understand toward the end , this extraordinary exhibition almost peters out into generalities and gimmicky display a real exploration of franklin s impact would have meant showing just how controversial a character he had become , partly because of his long tenure in france even the newly formed united states senate \( as one of its number reported \) refused to wear crape on their arms for a month as the house did after franklin s death in 1790 upon the whole , franklin wrote in 1771 , i am much disposed to like the world as i find it , and to doubt my own judgment as to what would mend it that made him a pragmatist and a compromiser , a nonutopian , a man with bifocals but what could he hope for \? the greatest political structure human wisdom ever yet erected that made him a visionary he is celebrated for being both benjamin franklin in search of a better world is at the national constitution center in philadelphia through april 30 and then travels to st louis , houston , denver , atlanta and finally , in december 2007 , to paris benjamin franklin in his own words is at the southwest gallery of the thomas jefferson building of the library of congress in washington through june 17
german civilization has had a lot to answer for in the last 200 years , but exhibit a in its defense might be carl maria von weber no one else s music could be purer of heart and yet so unmistakably german people confuse moral behavior and art at their peril , but weber s last opera , oberon , like so much of his music , tempts us to do just that it emits an uncomplicated humanity an implied goodness that in our more cynical time is received with undeserved wariness good does not signify na ve weber s lyrical impulses knew exactly where they were going , and his clarion ear for orchestration was deeply admired by those who came after him by debussy and berlioz in particular so acute are his treatments of the clarinet and the horn that those instruments almost become people none of which changes the fact that oberon , available in a new philips recording conducted by john eliot gardiner , is a complete mess it was written for the covent garden opera house in london , and by the time of its premiere in 1826 , weber was more than half dead of consumption james robinson planch s libretto creates geographically insoluble problems for its resident fairies , heroes and heroines , called on to leap from one fantastic locale to another as theater , oberon might work in movie form , although getting a modern audience to swallow the overstatement would require script revision sir john has spent much of his conducting career at restoration work scraping away accumulations of surface dirt and getting old music back to something closer to its original state much of oberon , on the other hand , is beyond repair we can and do extract the music indeed , most know oberon for its overture sir john , the monteverdi choir , the orchestre r volutionnaire et romantique , seven soloists and a narrator have made a reclamation project out of this sublime wreckage oberon without a theater is incomplete , this version seems to say so in addition to the music and the singing , there is a speaker \( roger allam \) to introduce the players and set the scenes the recording , in other words , is not a damaged antiquity restored but rather a guided tour through an ancient ruin the strategy is abetted by the fact that oberon was written for an englishspeaking audience , giving libretto and narration a certain continuity sir john s excitement over this music is palpable the famous overture puts listeners at the edges of their seats but never sounds feverish the chorus is crucial to weber s operas , and this one sings beautifully sir john has always had a sentimental feeling for original versions over later revisions , but oberon seems to have said to him , intervene , or forget it how often otherwise would we hear the likes of the heavenly mermaids at the end of act ii or reiza s act iii cavatina \? steve davislim sings the title role hillevi martinpelto is reiza and jonas kaufmann , sir huon those mermaids , by the way , are katharine fuge and charlotte mobbs bernard holland
hudson county investigators are studying video surveillance tapes made at automated teller machines where money was withdrawn from the account of a jersey city man after the man and his family were stabbed to death in their home , the hudson county prosecutor said yesterday the prosecutor , edward j de fazio , said withdrawals were made numerous times over five or six days from the account of hossam armanious , 47 , after he , his wife , amal garas , 37 , and their daughters , sylvia , 15 , and monica , 8 , were killed they were found dead on jan 14 , after worried relatives called the police the police said the four were each bound and stabbed to death the atm card of mr armanious was used fraudulently on a number of occasions after the murders took place , said mr de fazio we believe the fraudulent use began the day after the murders the withdrawals have bolstered a possible robbery motive for the killings , which have sent shock waves through the egyptian community in the region and raised allegations about a possible religious feud the family belonged to the coptic orthodox church , the principal christian church in egypt , and mr armanious was said to have been threatened with death by someone in an internet chat room during an argument about christianity and islam nothing has been discounted , mr de fazio said of the possibility of a religious feud but , he added , we have found no substantial corroboration of the chat room internet angle investigators had previously said that drawers in the house had been rifled , that mr armonious s wallet was empty and that essentially no money was found in the home certainly we believe that the financial motivation exists , that s fact , he said mr de fazio said the card was used , with mr armanious s personal identification number , to take out thousands of dollars from a number of locations in the heights section of jersey city and in midtown manhattan he would not say how many times it had been used , or exactly how much money had been taken from the combined checking , equity and savings account , nor would he say which bank had held the money in no way was this account looted , he said , meaning that money remained in the account he said he believed the maximum amount that could be withdrawn in a single transaction was 400 to 600 that s the area we 're talking about with the various hits , he said mr de fazio would not say what , if anything , investigators had already seen on the surveillance tapes , nor would he say whether they believed the person who made the withdrawals was the killer there s no suspect at this point , but we 're guardedly optimistic that we will identify the person who was using the atm card , he said investigators learned of the card s use after submitting court orders for all the family s financial records , said mr de fazio , who would not specify when the atm visits were discovered so far none of the family s credit cards have been used after the killings , he said mr de fazio said the family did not appear to be in financial trouble the father worked for the banquets department of the westin princeton hotel , and the mother worked for the united states postal service in kearney both girls attended school they were living modestly , but apparently there were resources , he said there s nothing to indicate any sort of nefarious activity going on , as far as the family goes family members have not seen the video yet , mr de fazio said , adding , we have n't reached that point in the investigation where that s required the use of the atm card was first reported yesterday in the starledger news of a possible financial motive was greeted with skepticism by relatives and members of the coptic church first of all , i do n't believe that story , it could be just camouflage for anything the fbi wants to discover , to try to make it like robbery , which is nonsense , said monir dawoud , acting president of the american coptic association the fbi is assisting in the search for the killers it did not make sense that someone would be stupid enough to use the card after all the attention given to the killings , he said ayman garas , amal garas s brother , also said he did not believe robbery was behind the killings i do n't want to accuse or judge , i have to just wait the final results of the investigation , he said

millburn , nj , dec 28 two 8yearold boys fell through the ice on a private pond on wednesday and narrowly escaped serious injury after a neighbor heard their cries for help and called the police one police officer and two firefighters swam into the pond to rescue the boys , who had walked 40 to 50 feet from the shore , said battalion chief edward wade when we got there , the one boy was hollering that he could n't feel his legs , said capt shawn daly of the millburn fire department one boy was sitting on the ice , and the other had fallen through into water up to his neck , said captain daly , who swam through 15 or 20 feet of water to get closer to the boys , then used his elbow to break the ice to reach them i could n't tell you how thick it was , but not thick enough to support an 8yearold boy , he said in a telephone interview from the hospital , as he was being released wednesday evening with temperatures in the mid40 s , much of the ice had melted along the shores of the pond , which is surrounded by houses on lake road , chief wade said the boys live near the lake , chief wade said it is in the short hills section of this essex county township officials did not release the names of the boys in a statement released by overlook hospital in summit , where the boys were treated and released , the father of one boy said the children were in good condition and the families were relieved the firefighters and the police officer in the water were also taken to the hospital , but none were admitted , chief wade said the other rescuers were firefighter sam caivano and police officer brian gilfedder it could 've been different if no one was around to call 911 , captain daly said i do n't know how much longer the boy could 've lasted in that water he said while he swam back to shore , the boy asked him if he was going to die i said 'no no way you 're going to be fine i 'll get you through this , ' captain daly said
remember the debate about the accounting treatment of employee stock options \? the fight was intense one side said that companies should be required to count options as expenses , in order to give a truer picture of profits , while the other said that such a move would lead to some companies' financial ruin well , the rules did change the shifts were announced in december and took effect in june the stock market , however , has had remarkably little reaction to the enactment of the new rules there is a lesson to be learned in this collective shrug , and it is n't a pleasant one for investors put simply , it is that the odds of outguessing the stock market are steep until the rule changed , of course , companies were not required to record an expense when they granted stock options to their employees supporters of the old accounting rule said it gave startup companies a fighting chance to succeed , because they typically do not have enough cash to attract and keep highly qualified employees companies in the technology sector , in particular , lobbied strongly against changing the rule proponents of the change argued that accounting for options as an expense was a matter of honesty allowing a company to hide the expense of those options enabled it to report artificially higher profits , they said , giving it an unfair advantage last december , the financial accounting standards board voted unanimously to change the rule , and the securities and exchange commission is requiring companies to expense options granted during fiscal years beginning after june 15 that means the new rule has already taken effect for companies whose fiscal years began on july 1 the remaining companies will fall under its provisions within the next 12 months so far , the change has had little perceptible impact on stock prices investors do not appear to be behaving any differently toward companies where the rule has already taken effect in fact , the technology sector has outperformed bluechip stocks since the board s announcement in middecember the dow jones us technology index has risen 04 percent over that time , versus a loss of 02 percent for the dow jones industrial average there are many possible explanations for the muted reaction one is that many investors were already taking option grants into account when interpreting companies' income statements , according to clifford s asness , a managing principal at aqr capital management in greenwich , conn even before the rule change , companies were required to divulge details of their option grants in footnotes to their accounting statements so what they are now being required to report on their bottom line could have been easily deduced by anyone willing to spend 10 minutes with a financial statement , mr asness said to be sure , not all investors were willing to do that work some dug no further than the headlines on companies' news releases , and no doubt their na vet inflated the share prices of companies that relied heavily on options after all , according to owen a lamont , a professor of finance at the yale school of management , it was in the hope of influencing this dumb money that many companies fought the new accounting rule so vehemently we should not exaggerate the market impact of these na ve investors , however with thousands of hedge funds looking for overvalued stocks to sell short , there is plenty of smart money , in professor lamont s parlance , to take the opposite side of the dumb money s bets before the rule change last december , this smart money could have sold short the shares of companies that tended to grant the most options to the extent that it did so , professor lamont said , these companies' shares would have been beaten down in advance of the accounting change that , in turn , would have reduced the reaction the market would have had after that change was announced yet another reason for the barely perceptible impact is provided by jennifer n carpenter , an associate professor of finance at new york university s stern school of business in the long run , the change could very well help the companies that grant the most options to their employees , professor carpenter said , because the discipline of having to expense options may lead firms to grant them more thoughtfully and efficiently what should we make of all this \? mainly that stocks' movements are very hard to predict even if investors had known in advance that the accounting standards board was going to change the rule , and when it would take effect , it is still not clear that anyone could have made much money this conclusion dovetails with the results of past research into what makes the equity markets go up or down one widely cited study was conducted in the late 1980 s by three economists david m cutler and lawrence h summers of harvard \( mr summers is now harvard s president \) and james m poterba of the massachusetts institute of technology the professors found that news events accounted for a surprisingly small amount of the stock market s movements none of this relieves investors of the need to view companies' financial data skeptically at the same time , it s important to remain skeptical about our own analysis whenever we interpret the data differently than the market as a whole more often than not , we 're wrong strategies mark hulbert is editor of the hulbert financial digest , a service of marketwatch email strategy nytimescom
vincent van gogh considered drawing to be the root of everything he once confided to his brother , theo , that he could not stop drawing because i really have a draftsman s fist , and i ask you , have i ever doubted or hesitated or wavered since the day i began to draw \? i think you know quite well that i pushed on , and of course i gradually grew stronger in the battle although his career lasted only a decade , van gogh created about 1 , 100 known drawings , capturing everything around him , from peasants and postmen to landscapes and interiors drawing was as important a way to record his thoughts as the letters he wrote to his family and friends yet the public is far more familiar with his 800 paintings images like a corridor in the asylum at the metropolitan museum of art , the starry night at the museum of modern art and irises at the j paul getty museum in los angeles are among the most famous images in the history of art that situation may change next week , when the met unveils vincent van gogh the drawings , the first major exhibition of the artist s drawings ever held in the united states \( a version of the show was on view at the van gogh museum in amsterdam this summer \) the exhibition , which opens next tuesday , includes 113 works from public and private collections around the world , 20 of which were not shown in amsterdam drawings have always been the ps part of van gogh s work , said colta ives , a curator of drawings and prints at the met yet he was a letter writer , a guy with a pen in his hand ms ives and susan alyson stein , a curator of 19thcentury , modern and contemporary art at the met , teamed up with two of their colleagues from the van gogh museum sjraar van heugten , head of collections there , and marije vellekoop , curator of drawings to put the show together their mission was to tell the story of van gogh s work through his drawings and watercolors sitting in the met s galleries , surrounded by packing crates and work tables , as the exhibition was being installed , ms stein said she had been thinking about a show like this for 20 years as coordinator first of the met s blockbuster 1984 show van gogh in arles and van gogh in saintr my and auvers two years later , she was introduced to the artist s drawings as exciting as the paintings are , she said , the drawings were a revelation for three years she and ms ives have immersed themselves in van gogh s world , traveling extensively throughout the united states and europe people opened their collections to us , ms stein said so did the van gogh museum , which has the largest number of the artist s works on paper in the world we borrowed judiciously , ms stein said deciding what not to show was as difficult as what the curators chose for every drawing on view , at least 20 were reluctantly rejected the exhibition also includes eight paintings three from the met s own collection , two from the van gogh museum , and three loans , from the rodin museum in paris , the pushkin state museum of fine arts in moscow and a private collection each was chosen for its relationship to his drawings rather than tackle the subject strictly chronologically , as most curators have done , ms stein and ms ives decided to underscore relationship between drawing and painting in van gogh s work and how he reinvented certain recurring themes in different ways when they began conceiving the show , ms stein said , one of the first things she did was to put together 86 pages of excerpts about drawing from all three volumes of van gogh s letters we wanted to hear his discussion , she said , to know what mattered to him as an artist throughout his life van gogh embraced drawing for many different reasons at first he felt it necessary to master blackandwhite before tackling color sometimes it was a question of economics paper and ink was far cheaper than canvas and paint he also used drawing as a way of working on subjects that interested him , like wintry trees or treelined roads or expansive views of wheat fields drawing did n't always come easy he struggled with black and white , ms ives said but when he got to arles in 1888 , he discovered the reed pen , and it was then he developed a more comfortable relationship with his tool as reed wears down , it becomes softer , more flexible and responsive to his gestures on paper it is generally assumed that most artists make drawings as studies for larger , more complete paintings but sometimes van gogh did just the opposite he would reproduce some of his paintings in pen and ink he would then send them to his artist friends mile bernard and john russell , and to his brother , theo , as a way of letting them know what he was up to none of these drawings were exact copies each contained spontaneous details often even scholars have n't been sure which came first , a painting or a drawing three images of a zouave solider a watercolor from the met s collection , a painting from the van gogh museum and a penandink drawing that belongs to the solomon r guggenheim museum have been the subject of scholarly debate it s been long accepted that the watercolor came after the painting , ms stein said but when we looked at it , it seemed there were hesitant passages the background , for example , is unresolved first the curators looked at the met s watercolor next to the guggenheim s penandink drawing , which they knew came after the painting it s harvest time it s raining , ms stein said he has a model , he spends five days and writes his brother and his friends that he s finally painting portraits he does n't mention the watercolor six weeks later he sends the penandink rendition of the portrait to john russell but because the watercolor is n't mentioned in the letters , it s one of the many riddles we addressed marjorie shelley , a met paper conservator , subjected the works to technical analysis , including infrared reflectography that revealed the artist s graphite sketch underneath the finished work , showing how he was struggling with his subject , something he did not do with either the painting or the later penandink drawing ms ives was curious about street in saintesmariesdelamer , an 1888 series of drawings and one painting of a dirt path with a row of thatched cottages on one side and tangled vegetation from his letters it is known that a penandink drawing was made before a painting of the same subject he did the drawing in saintesmaries , in the camargue region of provence , then returned to nearby arles and made the painting noticing the similarity in size between the drawing and the painting , i wondered if there might be a still closer link between them , ms ives said perhaps it was n't a freehanded interpretation in oil or , she said , he may have been so happy with his drawing that he traced it onto the canvas , which is unusual , because he generally painted freehand so ms ives made copies of both the painting and the drawing to scale , then superimposed the drawing on the painting she deduced that van gogh had indeed traced the drawing s outline onto the canvas as the structure of the composition , then added more sky at the top and more pathway at the bottom to fill the squarer canvas but drawings and paintings were never exactly the same in a drawing he made for bernard , he added a tiny boat in the horizon there is no boat in the painting , ms ives said the way van gogh grabbed onto a theme , composed it in his mind and then tried it out in different variations fascinated the curators very few artists do that , ms ives said often we tried to get into van gogh s shoes and walk with him to see what was catching his eye a series of watercolors van gogh created of the plains of la crau , three miles northwest of arles , is one example the curators persuaded the van gogh museum to lend them harvest in provence \( 1888 \) , a rarely lent painting , because they were able to borrow a watercolor that preceded it and a penandink drawing from the national gallery of art in washington that the artist did after it each has a distinctive character , ms ives said during the harvest he was out there every day , tromping through the fields , and certain motifs like fences , haystacks , clumps of reeds and rushes he keeps repeating in all different media and scales as an art form , however , works on paper are extremely delicate and cannot be subject to light or to changes in temperature as a result , many of the drawings and watercolors in the show have rarely been exhibited , and it may be some time before the public will see them again the problem with drawings is they have to have a rest , ms ives said the next generation wo n't be able to play in this garden for quite a long while

ben who \? benq , a new and almost unknown supplier of liquidcrystaldisplay televisions , hopes consumers will know the company s name in the next few months along with lesserknown brands like norcent and syntax , benq has jumped on the flatpanel tv bandwagon all are attempting to capture market share from wellestablished consumer electronics manufacturers like panasonic , philips , rca and sony by using the same tactic low prices but the secondtier companies including some using betterknown brand names like polaroid and westinghouse have a long way to go none of the new brands appear in the top 10 list of flatpanel tv unit sales or revenue according to displaysearch , a research firm , even the bestperforming secondtier lcd company , syntax , captured just 4 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2004 benq held 1 percent as flatpanel televisions remain costly , these companies have chosen to compete at the bottom of the scale , hoping to attract buyers who lust after the latest technology but are unable to afford units made by the betterestablished brands in contrast to early analog picture tube companies that manufactured their own sets and did not share their technology , display panels and integrated chips for digital television are made by various companies for sale to virtually anyone yet despite such availability , established television makers argue that their brand recognition and reliability will allow them to dominate the market a consumer spending 2 , 500 for a tv will take a careful view of how long it will last and how long it will be supported , said jeff cove , a vice president at panasonic he cited his company s distribution and service networks as reasons it does not expect to lose market share to new , lowcost entrants bharath rajagopalan , an executive with rca s parent , tclthompson electronics , said that all televisions were not created equal each toptier manufacturer adds its own secret sauce to the mix algorithms and filters that reduce visual noise , plus other technologies that smooth out images , he said but james li , chief executive of syntax , which sells televisions under the olevia brand , argued that such socalled secrets are only marketing gimmicks the fundamental components that make the picture are the panel and the chipsets , he said syntax gets those items from the same suppliers that some of the brand names use , he noted few of these companies' products are available at the larger mass merchants instead , they tend to be sold through internet retailers , regional electronics stores and specialty stores this is absolutely a price play , said glenn cunningham , amazoncom s director of electronics the internet retailer sells secondtier flatpanel brands , including westinghouse and olevia when i look at the customer reviews , they say 'great tv for the money ' people purchase noname brands opportunistically , said ross rubin , director of marketing analysis for the npd group they say , 'i just need something flat and sexylooking in a room ' experience with pc monitors has given some entrepreneurs the impetus to make televisions william wang , the former head of princeton graphics , began v inc in 2003 it employs just 28 workers in the united states , using contractors in asia to assemble plasma and lcd displays the company sells televisions in such stores as costco , where its 42inch plasma hdtv is priced at 2 , 500 models of the same size from panasonic and sony typically cost 4 , 000 to 4 , 500 about the same time that mr wang created v , doug woo , his former colleague at princeton graphics , started his own company and licensed the westinghouse name from its owner , viacom younger people know the westinghouse brand , mr woo said they have a vague recollection of it they do n't know what the brand does but under35yearolds are now beginning to recognize it as a tv brand westinghouse has positioned itself as one of the least expensive suppliers of lcd televisions during the holiday season , it cut the price of its 30inch model to 1 , 700 , 23 percent less than in the summer today the model is available for 1 , 500 at such retailers as best buy and amazoncom the samesize set from philips is priced 400 higher today our major benefit is pricing , mr woo said that s how we 'll become a major player we 're not ashamed of that westinghouse digital has formed a partnership with cmo in taiwan , its sole supplier of displays this relationship is the bedrock of our company s future , mr wang said we source only from them we can release products in sync with their supply , and we can take advantage of whatever cost efficiencies there are , and bring lower costs to the street really quickly and because these new startup manufacturers are selling in small volumes , they are able to ship merchandise soon after they buy it they offer an attractive time to market , said ross young , president of displaysearch by ordering 50 , 000 units , a company can receive a shipment soon after payment , keeping prices in line with costs sony s december product could have been paid for in june , mr young said , when parts prices were higher sony recently cited rapidly falling flatpanel tv prices as one reason its consumer electronics division s operating income dropped in the third quarter yet there is the danger that if lowcost brands do gain significant market share , the larger players , with deeper pockets , will reduce prices to compete as soon as samsung , sony and sharp see a viable threat from these guys , they 'll do something about it , said chris chinnock , of insight media , a research firm i ca n't see all these competitors surviving even five years from now mr li of syntax said his company was in for the long term to dispel customer concerns about buying the olevia brand , the company offers inhome service for its lcd televisions during the first year of ownership at no extra charge once available only through the internet , the company s sets are now sold at regional retailers like abc warehouse and fry s , as well as some staples stores in its first full year of operation , the company sold 95 , 000 televisions the company expects to double its revenue this year in april it will introduce a 42inch lcd television , with a 47inch model following by the fall but mr young of displaysearch said he believed the success of the secondtier brands would be confined to the smaller screens if you are buying a large tv , you want that to be a recognizable , prestige name , he said if you buy a knockoff tv , your friends will ask you why
moscow , may 9 president vladimir v putin , joined by president bush and dozens of other leaders , commemorated the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany on monday with a resplendent military parade in red square that was steeped in soviet symbols and new russian pride standing in front of lenin s tomb , not on it as soviet leaders once did , mr putin expressed no contrition for the soviet domination of eastern and central europe that followed the end of world war ii , as some leaders from that region had hoped he would instead , he said the war s legacy demonstrated the need for unity with russia against new threats the lessons of the war send us the warning that indifference , temporizing and playing accomplice to violence inevitably lead to terrible tragedies on a planetary scale , he said faced with the real threat of terrorism today , we must therefore remain faithful to the memory of our fathers it is our duty to defend a world order based on security and justice and on a new culture of relations among nations that will not allow a repeat of any war neither cold nor hot despite concerns here and abroad about russia s commitment to democracy , mr putin assembled one of the largest gatherings of world leaders in years part of the kremlin s efforts to resurrect a sense of a great and powerful russia among the 57 dignitaries were leaders of the victorious and the vanquished nations of the war , including chancellor gerhard schr der of germany , president jacques chirac of france , prime minister silvio berlusconi of italy , prime minister junichiro koizumi of japan and president hu jintao of china mr bush , customarily the center of attention even at international summit meetings , had a seat of honor next to mr putin , but did not speak publicly , effectively ceding the stage to mr putin and the day s pageantry mr putin paid tribute to the veterans of all allied nations but emphasized that the greatest sacrifices of the war were paid by the citizens of the soviet union , who persevered despite the deaths of 27 million people through the liberation of europe and the battle of berlin , the red army brought the war to its victorious conclusion , he said , indirectly but unmistakably brushing aside recent statements by leaders of poland and the baltics that hitler s defeat did not result in liberation for them , but instead suppression under a different ideology before and during his trip to latvia , mr bush endorsed that historical interpretation in a speech to latvian leaders on saturday , he acknowledged that the united states and britain shared some responsibility for the soviet annexation of the baltic nations through their participation in the 1945 yalta agreement , in which europe was carved up by roosevelt , churchill and stalin this attempt to sacrifice freedom for the sake of stability left a continent divided and unstable , mr bush said the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history a senior white house adviser , dan bartlett , said monday , though , that mr bush had not raised the issue personally with mr putin during meetings on sunday they did n't spend a lot of time having a history debate , he said indeed , despite diplomatic tensions over american advocacy of democracy in russia and neighboring countries and a pointed dispute over mr bush s itinerary on this trip , the two leaders appeared determined to display their collegiality and mutual respect mr bush spoke animatedly with mr putin on monday as thousands of russian soldiers and war veterans paraded across the cobblestones of red square and again as the two men walked with other leaders to the nearby tomb of the unknown soldier , where they laid red carnations after mr putin concluded his speech and returned to his seat , mr bush appeared to compliment him mr putin responded by putting his hand lightly on mr bush s knee and mouthing a reply mr bartlett said mr bush felt no discomfort about appearing as a prominent actor in a tableau of soviet imagery , including flowing banners bearing the hammer and sickle and a martial parade that evoked past soviet celebrations though without the displays of tanks and missiles that once rattled cold war nerves mr bush did meet with 18 leaders of civic organizations , including some prominent critics of mr putin , during a brief private gathering in mr bush s hotel lyudmila a alekseyeva of the moscow helsinki group , a human rights organization , recalled afterward that mr bush had maintained that his relationship with mr putin allowed him to raise concerns about democracy and freedom frankly mr bush , she said , noted that mr putin had used a recent national address to promote a democratic course a statement at odds with his efforts to tighten control over political parties and to eliminate some regional elections mr bush made it clear , she added , that he placed great importance on the development of democracy in all countries , including in russia while mr putin did not on monday publicly answer any of the concerns raised in europe and america in recent months , he included in his address an oblique reference , often stated here , that countries should decide their own fate without what russians believe to be external pressure from the united states and europe our policy is based on the ideals of freedom and democracy , he said , referring to russia s postsoviet history , and the right of every nation to chose its own path of development mr putin used the anniversary of victory day which was celebrated as a soviet holiday and is now a russian national holiday to try to rally russians behind what is arguably the soviet union s greatest achievement but the celebrations managed to stir diplomatic rancor , internal debates over how to remember stalin s leadership and street protests the presidents of lithuania and estonia conspicuously refused the kremlin s invitation in a sign of the resonance the issue still has in regional politics so did president mikheil saakashvili of georgia , whose popular uprising against eduard a shevardnadze in november 2003 inspired similar ones after flawed elections in two other former soviet republics , ukraine last fall and kyrgyzstan in march the events in those countries rattled the kremlin on monday , several hundred protesters , young and old , jostled with police officers in riot gear near the belaruskaya train station , a few miles northwest of red square at least 50 protesters were detained there , the radio station ekho moskvy reported , prompting clashes with the police through the afternoon putin is a fascist , shouted one demonstrator , a bearded older man who refused to give his name in a separate demonstration , about 30 members of a nationalist party , motherland , were detained outside the latvian embassy they were protesting the visit of that country s president , vaira vikefreiberga , who has angered many russians by criticizing the soviet occupation of the baltics after the war , even though she joined the other leaders in moscow on monday after the parade on red square and a lunch in the kremlin , mr putin conducted separate bilateral meetings with mr hu of china with mr koizumi of japan , which has a longstanding dispute with russia over the kurile islands and with prime minister manmohan singh of india although none of the meetings produced diplomatic breakthroughs , they showed that russia remained an important diplomatic player in arenas from peace between the israelis and palestinians to the confrontations over nuclear programs in iran and north korea monday s commemoration took place in the shadow of another war arena chechnya fearing terrorist attacks from chechnya s separatists , the authorities closed much of central moscow and urged muscovites to avoid the city and spend the holiday instead at their dachas , or country houses in chechnya , officials reported that eight fighters had been killed in a clash with security forces in the village of tsentoroi ms alekseyeva , who was 17 when the war ended , expressed disappointment that the official celebrations remained out of the reach of all but the participants there was an impression , she said of the authorities , echoing a complaint voiced by some veterans , that it was their celebration , not ours
