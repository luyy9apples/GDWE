there are 108 licensed dogs in this village of 4 , 800 , but as so often happens elsewhere in the county and in communities far beyond , none of them are free to roam unleashed on public property that , however , is about to change the village is officially opening its first offleash , fencedin dog park today in a quarteracre plot at the corner of north evarts and winthrop avenues , a former staging site for transportation workers just off interstate 287 elmsford s mayor , robert williams , a selfdescribed dog lover who does not own a dog at the moment \( his last one , a shih tzu , died about a year ago \) , said the park was right in the middle of the village , which is nice , but it s also close to 287 , so it wo n't bother the people who say that dogs bark too much twothirds of the park s area is reserved for large breeds , while the rest is for small ones , he said the process of creating the dog park seems to have unfolded with none of the squabbles and controversy that have mired them elsewhere in pound ridge , dog owners have lobbied the town unsuccessfully for three years to designate a leashfree play area for dogs in greenburgh , the town board has not approved a proposal to construct a dog park , mainly because of liability concerns , said paul j feiner , the town s supervisor mayor williams said he was not worried about lawsuits in elmsford the village s insurance company will treat the dog park just like every other municipal park , he said if something happens to a dog or to a person , he said , it should be handled the same way as we handle a kid who falls off a swing the town s insurance rates will not rise because of the dog park , he said the village will ban violent dogs and allow only those who have had their shots to enter the park , mayor williams said he said the police would conduct spot checks of vaccination tags there are two other dog parks in westchester county , in ossining and in white plains , county officials said in white plains , which opened its dog park off belway place in 2004 , liability is assigned to the dog owners , who also play a role in keeping the park clean , said arne abramowitz , the city s commissioner of recreation and parks it s pretty much selfpolicing , mr abramowitz said if you do n't clean up after your dog , people will say , 'this is not appropriate , ' or 'this is gross and you should n't do it' the dog park has also become a popular spot for singles , especially on fridays , when dog owners meet and make dates for the weekend , he said mayor williams said that dozens of residents in elmsford had asked officials over the past two years to create a dog park last winter , the town picked the site , fenced it in during the spring and installed benches , a water fountain and garbage cans to collect dog waste , at a cost of less than 5 , 000 angela white , 37 , has two labrador retrievers , biscuit and donut , whom she keeps on a leash when she takes them for a walk ms white said that she , her husband , martin , and their two children planned to celebrate donut s 7th birthday today by taking the dogs to the park for their first free run since puppy school the dogs love icecream cake , so we 're going to have to bring a cake down , she said it should be a little party for our family , but if other dogs feel like it , they 're welcome to join in photo play angela and martin white with their 5yearold son , anthony , and their labrador retrievers biscuit , jumping , and donut in elmsford s dog park , which officially opens today \( photo by alan zale for the new york times \)

we 've lost our power where i live , there is nothing spiritual , psychological or political about these words they are dire , referring to a physical circumstance they mean that a utility pole or tree has fallen somewhere , wires are down , and the house has no electricity tropical storm ernesto in september was the cause of our most recent power failure , and while it lasted a mere 13 hours , shorter , more spontaneous power failures that seem to occur in the absence of any weatherrelated event have become routine in our area as well there is something about a house without power it has no hum , none of the soft background noises of the furnace , pump or refrigerator , none of the chirping of the computer , phone and fax that subtly reassure you that life is going on a silence and stillness , an invasive quiet , or maybe disquiet , settles in and with it comes uncertainty , because when the power is to be restored is as unpredictable as when it may go later , sometimes much later , comes that slightly magical moment when the house springs back to life , lights on , all the appliances resuming their improvisational rondeau part of the relief of coming through a blackout lies in knowing we have just endured an excursion to some province of uncertainty in his essay selfreliance , ralph waldo emerson observes that with consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do while i lay no claims for my soul , i know that a blackout is a genuine cure for consistency routines are upended , schedules are thwarted , work remains undone still , we manage to manage , bearing out another of emerson s assertions , which is that we thrive by casualties but whether our casualty lasts for three minutes , three hours or three days , it still always raises the question of whether to get a generator so far , we have n't not that we do n't think about it with winter upon us , i leaf through homeequipment magazines and tool catalogs and review my options with the obsessive fascination of paris hilton eyeing the runway during fashion week smart homeowner magazine assures me that power failures lasting more than 24 hours have tripled in this country since 1978 , presumably on account of our ravenous energy consumption and wornout infrastructure and i learned from a phone call to the new york state public service commission that while the frequency of power failures in the state has leveled off in the last five years , their duration has increased the web site for a manufacturer of generators went so far as to track the path of hurricane florence churning its way up the atlantic , all but promising me a blackout in my immediate future generators fall into two categories , standby and portable , the chief difference being that the first comes on automatically within seconds of a power failure while the other needs to be switched on manually standbys are generally installed permanently on concrete pads outdoors , while portables are just that \( all of them , though , must be operated outside , as they produce carbon monoxide fumes \) my head is turned by a standby liquidcooled number that runs on natural gas and has something called an ultraquiet whisper test feature , but its price tag of close to 8 , 000 seems extravagant , and i know i could get by just as well with a lowrent option priced under 1 , 000 with a sixgallon fuel tank , it provides continuous power for 10 or 12 hours if the power failure lasts longer , you can just refuel the one i would probably settle for lies somewhere in between , a portable unit with a 16gallon fuel tank that costs 2 , 000 there is something reassuring about knowing that it can generate electricity for a full 24 hours without refueling there is no such thing as too much power , says its ad copy , underscoring its dependability and like anyone newly infatuated , i reconsider my future , in which our old clapboard farmhouse becomes some epicenter of power and productivity yet for all the lust i try to summon up for one of these , no one i know who has a generator loves it all that much for all the security it offers , it s a piece of equipment that seems to elicit nothing so much as ambivalence it is an essential evil , says anne kreamer , a former neighbor of mine in dutchess county who bought a generator for her house there its smell , fumes and noise are all loathsome , but i would do anything not to have my pipes freeze years earlier , she and her family had come home one frigid night after a power failure to find the interior of their house encrusted with glaciers a generator , she says , is lifesupport for the house it s not about a freezer full of rotting meat it s for the pipes and she made it a point never to turn on the generator during summer blackouts the windows are all open , so with all the noise and fumes of the generator , it s like sleeping next to the bqe instead , she would light the coleman lanterns and just make do that ambivalence makes sense to me it is , after all , at the root of my own indecisiveness , which i know is not just about the house , but about whether owning a generator signals efficiency and resourcefulness or coddled incompetence i also know that the purchase of a generator that offers 3 , 000 hours of uninterrupted power is only partly about excessive cold or heat , a refrigerator full of spoiling food , empty faucets , the darkness , the silence what it is most about is the acknowledgment that we 're on our own indefinitely continuity and constancy are at the core of our sense of security today , and i suspect that unexpected disruptions whether they are a few dropped minutes of cellphone service , the unannounced arrival of an electronic worm or a twoday power failure undermine it deeply which brings me back to emerson , who urged his readers to become conversant with the unexpected the world uncertain comes and goes , he said in a simple statement that implies gracious acceptance of that fact i consider as well the stamina that his particular brand of thriving takes and try to imagine whether i can summon up a similar resilience but then , i remind myself , emerson never had the option of owning a guardian quietsource that promised him power anytime , anywhere drawing \( drawing by matt collins \)
night at the museum , directed by shawn levy , is one of seven films on the academy s shortlist of special effects nominees the movie stars ben stiller as a bumbling night security guard who unwittingly unleashes a curse that brings to life the creatures and historic characters at a museum of natural history , including a trex sunday night at the premiere at the american museum of natural history , the baguette waited her turn to speak to mr levy on the red carpet a children s sleepover was to take place at the museum that night , which may be why the man standing next to the baguette holding a microphone was dressed in pajamas i was the comedy guy , mr levy told the baguette , noting that he had directed the pink panther and cheaper by the dozen but for this film he had to master the language of computergenerated imagery , or cgi you learn things like negative space , he said you learn things like pinch the edges , which is basically a way of integrating characters who are computer generated into the plate which is the background image , so that they look organic in the space none of this comes cheap the film cost north of 100 million , mr levy said , adding that most films built around cgi effects cost considerably more at the afterparty the baguette caught up with ricky gervais , who is also in the film as he passed dioramas showing how humans had lived as long ago as 5000 years , mr gervais said i wouldn t go further back than 1971 because that s when dentists got really good i wouldn t like to go back to the 15th century and get a toothache , before anesthetic and worse , they sawed legs off that s one of the reasons i ve never time traveled , he added helpfully
wendy perelman spent 10 years working as an actress in new york and los angeles before she had children she was startled by just how much her life changed i thought you literally carry your kids around like a purse , you just keep doing what you did , ms perelman said on a recent afternoon , shooing her sons , aaron , 8 , and caleb , 4 , out of the house to play on the lawn i did find the life of housewife and mother and minivan driver to be less than what i had hoped , she admitted ms perelman , who is 43 , moved from santa monica to long island in april with her husband , jeremiah bosgang , a television executive four years ago , looking for a project that would make her feel more fulfilled , she decided to create a musical revue about women in their 40 s that grew into having it almost , a twoact book musical that was one of 34 shows selected from 400 submissions to be staged at the new york musical theater festival s equity showcase in manhattan this month having it almost aspires to fill the gap between the off broadway shows i love you , you 're perfect , now change and menopause , the musical it will be presented at the new world stages from sept 13 to 16 ms perelman , whose credits include the national touring company of my one and only , portrays a frustrated stayathome mom other characters include a mother who works outside the home , a woman who is single by choice , a woman who is single unwillingly and a happily married woman who is infertile the five women get stuck in a blackout at kennedy airport we all think everybody else s choices are more glamorous than ours , said ms perelman , who says she has a penchant for striking up conversations in waiting rooms and airports , divulging intimate secrets with women she has never met before and will probably never see again my girlfriends who are n't married and do n't have kids think 'oh , you 're so lucky you 're married with the minivan , and you have kids' and i'm thinking 'oh , you 're so lucky you 're single in the city' ms perelman initially solicited submissions for a revue from composers and lyricists for songs on her theme so called trunk songs that may have been cut from a show or did not fit into another project among the 200 unproduced songs she received was code of silence , a poignant piece about a longmarried couple who never tell each other what is really on their minds , by stephen schwartz , the composer of broadway s wicked impressed by the submissions , ms perelman realized she had struck a chord too rich for a revue , so she fleshed out the characters and story line with david goldsmith , a friend from her years at the collegeconservatory of music in cincinnati he composed much of the rest of the score , including songs like date is a fourletter word and the day i left my house in my pajamas with another former classmate , john kavanaugh , a composer the show will also use mr schwartz s song and works by three other composers steve marzullo , associate conductor for mamma mia ! on broadway , is conducting the show s six performances at the festival mr bosgang , who is executive vice president for television of sony bmg music entertainment , is the producer he and ms perelman coproduced the film good money , which mr bosgang directed and ms perelman appeared in it won the 1997 new york comedy film festival s award for best feature juggling motherhood with creating and rehearsing a new musical has made her a bit worse mom , ms perelman said , though she is happy her children now realize she can do more than cook spaghetti in the show , ms perelman said , the women initially judge each other by their shoes but after 12 hours together come to appreciate their life choices ultimately , none of them have it all , she said , clearly including herself they have it almost having it all is a myth photo balancing act wendy perelman , who created the musical revue having it almost , and her husband , jeremiah bosgang \( photo by kirk condyles for the new york times \)
as his red sox blew apart this august like a graying dandelion , david ortiz looked at the tigers , specifically the hardthrowing rookies justin verlander and joel zumaya , and issued a warning to the rest of baseball they 're going to cause trouble , ortiz told sports illustrated you know why \? power pitching that s what wins in the playoffs baseball tends to sprout more aphorisms than blades of infield grass speed causes errors and , 90 percent of the game is halfmental , which studies have confirmed to be at least 80 percent not halftrue the granddaddy of them all is pitching wins championships , the rough equivalent of saying that money buys houses but what type of pitching is best , particularly in the playoffs \? most traditionalists cite another baseball axiom , that the location of pitches matters as much as their velocity in other words , wily moundsmen who understand the nuances of pitching are just as important as young galoots who simply bring it several major league hitters , however , join ortiz in contending that hard fastballs are most effective , period and statistics back them up according to baseball info solutions , which records the velocity and type of about 80 percent of pitches thrown every season , the speed of a pitcher s fastballs has a strong correlation to his earned run average in postseason games from 2002 to 2005 , pitchers who averaged 88 miles an hour or slower \( in at least seven innings \) allowed a 471 era those who threw an average of 89 to 92 had a 418 era and those who threw 93 or above were by far more effective , yielding a 342 era starters and relievers , who tend to throw harder , exhibited the same pattern this trend held in the regular season as well , but was considerably stronger in the postseason to me , the fastball sets the tone for everything else , said the yankees' gary sheffield , a veteran of five postseasons with three teams strikeouts in the playoffs mean more every run counts small ball wins games , and that limits your chances when i was with the marlins and we won it all , we had a bunch of power pitchers kevin brown , al leiter , robb nen to close it out with power pitchers , guys are a little behind when they 're trying to get that big run sheffield is on to something postseason games are indeed lowerscoring an average of 832 total runs compared with 913 in the regular season which puts greater emphasis on advancing runners and therefore benefits a strikeout pitcher \( one surprising aside these lower scores do n't make for significantly more close games according to data supplied by retrosheet , 29 percent of regularseason games from 1980 to 2005 were decided by one run , and 19 percent were decided by two in the postseason , 31 percent were onerun games and 18 percent tworun games the upshot \? postseasons have fewer blowouts , with only one extra close game out of 50 \) but even if postseason games are n't much closer , highvelocity pitchers have still fared much better than their slowtossing counterparts \( another explanation proffered is that , on a somewhat off day , pitchers who rely on finesse and location can find themselves with few weapons against the more disciplined hitters generally found in october \) regardless , all this is good news for the tigers and the twins , and perhaps ominous news for the mets detroit has the american league s hardestthrowing starter \( verlander , an average of 9521 mph per fastball \) and reliever \( zumaya , 9860 \) , and with several other hard throwers in the bullpen , it had a team average of 9194 the twins topped that at 9208 , but their hardestthrowing starter \( the rookie francisco liriano , 9467 \) is injured and they now rank slightly behind the tigers the mets' pitching shakiness is no secret , yet their velocity numbers are shocking the staff has averaged a majorleagueworst 8886 mph this season , and none of the three primary starters orlando hern \? ez \( 8825 \) , tom glavine \( 8533 \) and steve trachsel \( 8705 \) will blow fastballs past anyone closer billy wagner was the league s hardest thrower \( 9627 \) , but there is n't much after \( or in his case , before \) him despite the stark data , not everyone in baseball agrees that playoff baseball is better for fastball pitchers if you can pitch , you can pitch , said the yankees' derek jeter , citing the success of former teammates like the softtossing jimmy key and the dodgers' greg maddux essentially dismissed the notion , joking , i guess i should throw more fastballs then then again , perhaps maddux who averaged an extremely slow 8347 mph on his fastballs this season is one of the reasons onlookers started noticing a trend in 11 postseasons from 1989 to 2003 , maddux posted a 322 era , more than half a run higher than his era during those years' regular seasons better competition had something to do with that , but he still managed only an 1114 record his braves , with the fellow brainsoverbrawn pitcher glavine also taking the ball regularly , always tended to disappoint fastball pitchers have an intimidating edge , said the dodgers slugger jeff kent , a veteran of five postseasons players do n't like to admit it , but it s there
click more for playbyplay of the match , as it happened at the arena auf schalke in gelsenkirchen our server crashed ! too much volume but i did keep track on a separate file , and now that we re up again you can follow along below to see what we missed the blackout started in the 50th minute or so , and the entries appear below as they were typed while the action was happening by the time you read this , the game will have long been over , 30 for the czechs but anyway , as i write this moments after the whistle was blown i m trying to think of a single american who played well , and i can t the sam s army player ratings tomorrow are going to be low indeed for everyone keller was blameless , certainly i d probably give him the highest rating of all the yanks , a 5 for average and the rest would be below average just a horrible performance flat , uptight , unimaginative and for all of bruce arena s secrecy in concealing his lineup and formation , the czech coach bruckner had the tactical answer for everything the americans tried for the czechs , a terrific result and a terrific performance rosicky and nedved were playing out of their minds , and the defenders were awesome but the dark cloud is the loss of koller if he s able to return , say , for the knockout round , then it ll be all right but a hamstring pull as severe as the one he seems to have suffered might put him out of the tournament for good hopefully we ll have the site up in time for the 3 pm match between italy and ghana austin kelley will bring that one to you on this blog in the meantime , thanks for looking in congrats to the czech fans , and to the american fans don t lose hope ! 90 2 game over czech republic 3 , united states 0 arena strides away from the bench grimly the czechs have made a perfect start , and the americans are in deep , deep , deep trouble 90 1 stajner gets loose at the edge of the box , but instead of taking the open shot he tries to get closer and loses the ball thankfully 90 two minutes added que fracaso para los norteamericanos ! 88 every time today an american gets free in box for a shot , he s closed down by a czech defender it just happened to josh wolff the czech republic has been flawless today they seemed nervous before the start too , but unlike the americans they ve played with maximum poise and effectiveness 87 a yellow shown to grygera don t know what he did , though i must admit that between the score and the server problems , i m pretty deflated at the moment 85 sub rosicky out didn t see who took his place , but there s that rosicky chant again from the czech fans stajner is his replacement 84 not only are the amerks losing , which puts them in a bad place in this group of death , but they ll also now have to make up a huge goal difference against the likes of italy this may not be a replay of france 98 it may be a replay of italia 90 ! let s hope not 82 sub podborsky out , what a great game he had , and replaced by jan polak 81 a yellow for rosicky for almost kicking a prone johnson at the edge of the czech area , and as everyone sorts themselves out the yanks do a quick restart that sees johnson shoot just over the bar 80 the czech fans are doing that chant europeans do when they want to salute someone who s got a fivesyllable name tomas rositchky ! \( clapclap clapclapclap \) tomas rositchky ! 77 sub for the yanks josh wolff in at striker for the uncharacteristically ineffective brian mcbride 76 goooalllll czechs ! 30 ! nedved springs rosicky for a run right down the middle , and he outruns the american defense and slots home as keller comes out to cut down the angle deadly ! 75 convey crosses from the left , and with johnson closing in on goal to head it in cech dives bravely and catches the ball inches before it reaches johnson s head great play all around ! 71 johnson free in the box on the right side ! he cranks and shoots , but jankulovski blocks it beautifully good defense ! 70 johnson turns and shoots from 24 yards out , and just misses the post ! nice try ! 69 rosicky hits the crossbar ! he fires from just beyond the halfmoon about 23 yards away , right in the middle , and it goes over the leaping keller and strikes the bar ! his shot is lethal ! 67 shots of some us fans in the stands they look pretty subdued 65 beasley saves the day ! nedved finds jankulovski wide open in the 6yard box , but beasley tracks back just in time to break up the shot 63 the yanks have very little the czechs are in control they re winning comprehensively 61 close call ! podborsky sets up someone , i didn t see who , and keller had to make a diving save a few seconds later , podborsky broke in and took a cross from the left that he put just over the bar 60 bad foul by reyna , a rash slide tackle that took the legs out from under plasil a yellow for the american captain plasil has to be stretchered off according to regulation , but he s holding his ankle let s see if he has to stay off 59 nothing much has happened the last seven or eight minutes or so , so fear not still 20 for the czechs note blog server crashed here 51 podborsky on a free kick from the right side nodded on by ujfalusi just wide of the post ! the czechs almost had a third ! 49 convey crosses into the box , but there are so many czech defenders there that ball simply cannot get through halftime right , gromit x the midnight oil singer was peter garrett ! this is not the time to quibble or bring up old obsessions of mine , perhaps , but the americans looked so tight in the tunnel and during the anthems , and during the early stages of the game as well i still think they should ve played one game in europe in the last couple of weeks just to get used to the idea as abc pointed out before this game started , the amerks , er , yanks alltime record in europe is no victories and no draws in seven matches but really , forget i said that the hope for the americans is that they can somehow draw inspiration from the aussies fightback victory over japan earlier today and now subs for the americans cherundolo and mastroeni are out ! john o brien is in at midfield , and speedster eddie johnson is up front with mcbride now it ll be a 352 , in hopes of generating some kind of consistent attack kickoff ! halftime looking over some of the comments you ve sent in hey , amerks i ve been saying that all my life ! it might be a lower great lakes thing , but it s a real word ! they re replaying the goals from the first half grygera was wide , wide open on the right to set up that first score no one on him lewis must have been running up the field on the attack or something , cuz there was no one near him and koller was too open in the box gooch and pope had given him a couple of feet of space , and you juts can t do that with such a deadly striker on the second goal , wotta shot by rosicky it went right in the side netting nothing keller could ve done 45 1 the whistle blows czechs 2 , us 0 what a catastrophic half for the americans ! they ve got to get one back , at the very least , in the next 45 minutes this is , after all , a group of death , and every point , every goal , counts enormously 45 just got a text message from stuyvesant high school in manhattan they want to know the score aren t they showing this game in the auditorium or something \? come on , stuy administration ! 44 substitution lokvenc in at forward for koller if koller s hurt badly and out of the tournament , this might rank as a pyrrhic victory for the czechs if they hold on and win , that is 43 koller goes down in a footrace with onyewu in the american area he s in obvious pain , rolling around on the ground , grabbing his right hamstring he s out of the game for sure you don t come back from hamstring injuries can t see if onyewu touched him at all during that , but i don t think it would ve made a difference 42 the americans have had the ball 58 percent of the time , a graphic says , but of course that means very little in a soccer game now the czechs control the ball skillfully in midfield , waiting calmly for an opening they can afford to be calm , having forged this big lead 40 the univision announcers point out that arena has not sat down once on the us bench who s in the stands today \? beckenbauer , maradona and bora milutinovic , the coach who molded the us from amateurs into a real team during the 90s 38 that was exactly the kind of goal keller was talking about a couple days ago there have been a lot of longrange spectacular golazos already in this tournament , perhaps attributable to the new ball , perhaps not , but that was certainly one of them tomas rosicky ! and now the amerks are in a deep , deep hole 38 golaaaaaaazooooo czechs ! what a goal ! nedved running wild on the left , giving cherundolo fits , he crosses in front , but it s cleared out rosicky takes it 25 yards away and rips a screamer that keller dives for but can t get to ! it goes in the upper right corner czech republic 2 , usa 0 ! 34 the americans favorite tactic , of attacking from the flanks through eddie lewis and damarcus beasley , is not working the czechs know about it , and they re covering the flanks well the us will have to strike through the middle that s where their one real chance came from 32 great defensive play by pope to neutralize nedved as he took a long pass in the area nedved touched it with his hand , but unseen by the ref the czechs get a corner , but nothing comes of it 30 that was a ray of hope for the team in blue they found a way through on the counter , and it s the first truly positive glimmer for arena s squad 28 the yanks hit the goalpost ! they hit the goalpost ! convey to donovan to reyna in the middle of the field on a fast break , and reyna s shot from 20 yards and right out in front beats cech , but it strikes the left post and is cleared ! 27 convey stuffed cleanly as he tries to break into the area there s no way in for the yanks ! 25 the game lacks flow the czechs are caught offside on a long pass again , as the us offside trap works well but the americans have not been able to get into a similar position on the attack , because the czechs are being very conscientious about getting back in numbers 22 the yanks work and work , and find a way through , but reyna s cross is cleared away it took a full minute s constant labor to get from the halfway line to the czech end the czechs are laying back well , and now it s incumbent on the americans to do the attacking at the other end , cherundolo falls near the end line , looking for a foul , and nedved gets free in the area his cross is headed over the bar , but that was kind of dangerous 21 well into the game now , and the amerks have not given cech anything to worry about yet also true the czechs have had only one chance so far and they cashed it in 18 koller takes a long looping pass skillfully with his left foot , settling the ball in the box instantly but he s offside he looks like the guy who used to be the singer for midnight oil he s standing next to gooch , and he fairly towers over the american , who s the tallest on the team ! 16 donovan takes off in midfield with a full head of steam he s fast ! and he s tripped at midfield by rozehnal , who gets booked for a yellow  14 i promised not to do this , but the abc announcers are prattling on about minutiae instead of describing the the gotterdammerung taking place before their eyes please , don t send in your comments about this ! but i m moving over to univision for a few minutes 11 cech dives out to cut off a cross , taking it easily the chelsea keeper is unquestionably one of the very best in the world now a corner for the us donovan goes short to beasley , to reyna at the top of the box he serves it up , but it s headed well wide they show a replay of the goal , and we see that koller beat eddie pope cleanly in the air 10 now the question is , will the czechs fall prey to the same errors the english , dutch and portuguese made taking an early lead , then going progressively flatter as the game goes on only problem none of their opponents were able to equalize it s up to the americans to get back into this match 8 reyna cut down as he runs toward the area with the ball , but the ref says fair tackle , the czech defender got all ball play on ! 6 goooaallll czechs ! grygera comes down the right side to the corner and crosses it beautifully , and big koller is right in front of the net to head it in emphatically ! it s 10 already to the czechs ! 4 nedved taken down hard as he runs over the middle having received a long pass it was dangerous , and onyweu trips him , hard nedved seems ot have hurt his wrist a bit on that , and senor amarilla has given onyewu a yellow card deserved 3rd minute grygera takes the first shot of the game , from about 30 yards out way , way high and wide probably just getting the butterflies out the teams run out i can t take the pressure i can t imagine how these players are dealing with it the americans huddle , as they usually do for big matches and now they take their places the czechs will kick off it s on !  the teams are emerging from the tunnel ! they come up the stairs to the cheers of the crowd the yanks are in blue shirts and shorts , the czechs in white shirts and shorts both sides seem nervous , serious tremendous pressure ! and now the national anthems first , the american anthem the players hold their hands over their hearts some sing , some don t they look grim only keller seems relaxed what \? ! abc cuts away for a commercial ok then , to univision for the czech anthem koller sings lustily , his eyes closed the other players also look sort of grim some sing , some don t man , both sides are tense ! peter cech , the goalkeeper , actually looks downcast the song ends a huge cheer !  now they re showing shots of the schalke arena lots of czechs on hand certainly some of them have driven over the border for the day from their homes in prague , pardubice , ceske budejovice and all the other places i love from following the hockey teams in the czech extraliga and there are lots of american fans there as well everyone seems to have their faces painted and their scarves over their heads and still 15 minutes to kick off !  a look again at the lineups shows that bruce arena has put donovan in something of a forward role , but he s really still a midfielder so that makes mcbride a lone striker , which means the americans will be in a 451 designed to absorb the potent czech attack and hope to make hay on the counterattack for the czechs , milan baros is hurt and out of action today , but they ve got rosicky and nedved and podborsky and big jan koller , who presumably will be marked by big oguchi onyewu that is a worldclass collection of star players  send your comments in to worldcup nytimescom , or use the comment function a request we ve had an awful lot of comments the last few days criticizing the american announcing crews and praising univision s , so we ve pretty much had that topic covered if you feel compelled to comment about it again , please try to limit yourselves to something new on the subject , ok \? and one more request , because traffic is heavy and also on general principles if you ve posted something , please try not to to post something a few minutes later in other words , don t hog the comment board but i also must say that the comments all of you have posted , from all over the world , have been fantastic the first few days of this tournament many thanks to all of you !  hello everyone this is it ! the united states vs the czech republic ! now we will see will the us follow through on the bright promise of 2002 \? was bruce arena s strategy of not playing any pretournament tuneup matches in europe a wise one \? can claudio reyna stay healthy to manage the midfield \? and the czechs are they over the hill , as some observers say , and are they healthy enough after a series of nagging injuries or is the side that karel bruckner selected truly one of the very best in the world \? will their giant , 2metertall striker , jan koller , dominate the goalmouth as he has done so often in the past \? this is jeff z klein charged with the apocalyptic task of transcribing the action to you , live , as it takes place in gelsenkirchen a personal memory before we get down to business , if that s all right i was at the usaczechoslovakia match in florence during italia 90 , the opener for both teams in that tournament the czechoslovaks mauled the us , 51 , though i remember the amerks goal , scored by paul caligiuri , a beauty that came after he ran about 50 yards and slalomed through three or four opponents i ve never seen that goal on video , but i remember it well , one of the best i ve ever seen however , the thing that was most amazing about that match was that it took place the same evening that czechoslovakia had just conducted its first free elections of the postsoviet era the czechoslovaks were so proud and happy their velvet revolution had come all the way to fruition that day , and the victory was the ribbon on top it seemed as if they embraced every american fan outside the stadium that they could find i traded flags with one of them , and he insisted that i and a couple of other americans pose for a photo with a group of them i still have the flag they gave me now it s 16 years later there has been a velvet divorce during that span of time and now it s the czech republic the americans will face , but the czechs expression of joy through their sport remains an inspiration , and i m thinking here of their celebrations in old town square and wenceslas sqaure in prague in 1998 after their hockey team won the olympic gold medal it s hard not to wish them well at this world cup as well but full disclosure i m american , so you know how i feel but i ll try not to let that get in the way of a fair playbyplay all right then ! it s a hot day in gelsenkirchen , 84 degrees fahrenheit that s 28 degrees for everyone else in the rest of the world the referee today will be carlos amarilla of paraguay , and let s hope he does better than the paraguay soccer team did the other day no puns about amarilla showing a yellow card , i promise a word of caution we ve been having problems at the web site today apparently the volume of traffic is overloading the blog server our able tech crew will try to keep things running , but bear with us if the blog goes down now and then well , no you probably should run out and find a tv set , because you can t miss this match !

we are squatting here in the media center \( thanks , houston chronicle ! \) and can t help noticing folks coming up to the guy sitting behind us since the open started , our rowmate bud collins has been interviewed , asked for autographs and shuttled off for oncamera appearances we were thinking of our favorite open matches and thought , why not ask him \? none of us are in the international tennis hall of fame , so we figure his selections carry more weight than the average blogger s men s or women s \? he asked and generously gave us both on the men s side , the andre agassimarcos baghdatis match thursday night is definitely one of them , he said another was the pete samprasalex corretja quarterfinal match in 1996 , when sampras was throwing up on the court and was down match point but managed to win the fourhour , fiveset match and the tournament and of course , rocket rod laver s completing his second grand slam in 1969 at forest hills , where according to bud , he practically played in the mud against tony roche to do it on the women s side , he chose the martina navratilovasteffi graf semifinal in 1986 , when steffi had six match points but martina battled back to win the match 61 , 67 , 76 and the tournament he also picked the first time martina navratilova beat chris evert to win the open , in 1983 collins said that despite being harangued by prochris fans , martina dominated , 62 , 60 and finally , he chose the time billie jean king beat evonne goolagong in the 1974 final , 36 , 63 , 75 evonne never won the open , he said , but she was a wonderful player and woman so , do you agree with bud s best \? what are your favorite us open moments \? also , collins has contended since spring that the newly renamed tennis center should be called the billie another writer suggested the bjk yet another pointed out that calling it the king center would honor not her but her former husband what should the bjkustantc be called \?
to the editor david brooks \( hating the bomb , column , jan 22 \) finds that all four ways of thinking about iran s nuclear ambitions stink they seem the only ways conceivable to him preemption , sanctions , hope for reform in iran , and fatalism all start from the premise that iranian nukes are unacceptable , but none hold out the promise of deterring them this is an intellectual impasse of mr brooks s own making nations want nuclear weapons because other nations have them they feel threatened and wish to neutralize the threat to them or they wish to be able to wield the threat and play the role of a world power along with those nations already in that game the basic problem , thus , is not that some nations want nuclear weapons it is that some already have them the solution to the threat of iran s nuclear ambitions is to bring about a reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons wherever they exist everyone now knows that nuclear weapons do not ensure anyone s safety they only ensure the proliferation of nuclear weapons there is a fifth alternative , mr brooks why is it so hard to keep it in mind \? george hochfield berkeley , calif , jan 23 , 2006
they had finished in last place the previous three seasons and had reached the 1991 allstar game nine and a half games behind the los angeles dodgers but now , on the nexttolast day of the season , the atlanta braves were a game ahead of the dodgers they were in the ninth inning , and they led the houston astros , 52 with two out and luis gonzalez at second base , andujar cede \? ofted a john smoltz pitch to right field , where david justice was waiting neither justice nor any other member of the braves player , manager , general manager , scout , clubhouse attendant knew what significance that out would have how could they know \? it would take 14 years to find out that when that ball settled into justice s glove , the braves had embarked on a remarkable run of unparalleled proportions the braves , with general manager john schuerholz and manager bobby cox leading the way , would win 14 consecutive division championships their victory that day , oct 5 , 1991 , clinched the national league west title for the braves , and 13 more division titles , west and east , followed there will not be a division title this season having fooled their opponents and many experts who believed in some recent seasons that they could not win , the braves are out of tricks they come to shea stadium tomorrow night on the brink of elimination from division contention any combination of mets victories and braves losses totaling 9 over the rest of the season would make the braves former champions i was a liberal arts major , not a mathematics major , schuerholz said , but i can figure out the meaning of the gamesbehind number and the reality that brings clearly into focus it is not a surprising development , so you just have to come to grips with it cox is n't surprised either we knew this winter we had problems , he said we tried to address them , but we could n't referring to one of the problems , cox added , there was a huge market for relief pitching and there were only a couple guys available too late , the braves acquired bob wickman from the equally disappointed cleveland indians by the time wickman registered his first save for the braves on july 24 , they were 12 1 2 games behind the mets we have n't played the kind of baseball we had hoped or what we felt we were capable of , schuerholz said the braves were n't sure what to expect in 1991 it was unreal , recalled tom glavine , who finished in last place his first three years in the major leagues and in first for the first 11 years of the 14year run to begin with , the expectations of doing that would have been extreme nobody expected us to win in '91 , let alone the 11 years that followed but it was so much fun to go from a lastplace team whose season is over by the start of summer to a team that wins and is in the playoffs every year after that it was a quick and dramatic turnaround as uncertain as 1991 was , glavine added , 1992 might have been shakier you win in '91 with a team no one expected to do anything , he said , and we come back in '92 and had to prove it was n't a fluke after that , every year we expected to win and every year they did you almost went into the year knowing it was an insurmountable task , said omar minaya , who was the general manager of the montreal expos and the mets during the braves' run you were in awe of their mystique last year was probably the first time you said to yourself , 'maybe they wo n't win with all those young kids' but win again the braves did , restocking themselves with young players who played better than many teams' veterans the braves took command of first place july 26 and quickly built a lead that grew to seven games they have not been so fortunate or so talented this season from what i gather , it s been a strange year in that they 're not used to dealing with it , said glavine , who has talked to some of the coaches and smoltz , the only player who was on all 14 division championship teams nobody s going to give up the division title until they 're mathematically eliminated it s been a different summer a lot of guys have n't finished anywhere but first nevertheless , the braves would settle for second this year if it brought them the wild card it means a lot to have won 14 of these things , cox said , but there s no shame in being the wild card the braves began the weekend four and a half games off the wildcard lead , not a great distance , but as schuerholz said , the wild card s ok , but half of north america is still ahead of us if the braves do n't make the playoffs for the first time since 1990 , he added , they will make no excuses we 'll say we did n't get the job done , he said it will be the best motivator to make sure this does n't happen again despite the 14year run , or perhaps because of it , the braves have their critics , those who say they should have won more than one world series we 're proud of what we 've done , cox said we were in five of them and won one sure , we would have liked to win more , but it s a crapshoot glavine , who had a 43 record in the braves' five world series appearances , acknowledged the disappointment in not winning more than the 1995 series
two years ago this month , the florida football program was in crisis mode after a loss at mississippi state things had become so bad that in less than three seasons under ron zook the gators had lost six home games , more than in steve spurrier s 12year tenure so the athletic director , jeremy foley , fixed his own mistake by firing zook the monday after the mississippi state debacle the move , considered unusual and controversial at the time because it was so early in the season , looks ingenious two years later now , under urban meyer , florida is 60 for the first time since 1996 and is ranked no 2 in the associated press poll for the first time since 2001 in two years , the gators have gone from a complete mess to the elite team in this footballrich state , rocketing past miami and florida state , both unranked for the first time in 24 years one of the legacies of this swift and stunning florida revival may be a blueprint of how to fire and hire a head coach i do n't want to advocate firing coaches , but if someone is headed down that road , i think it does help , foley said of a dismissal early in the season you need to do your due diligence , especially in a highprofile program where the scrutiny is going to be very , very high i do n't think i 'll have to , but i would not hesitate to do it again and with this season crossing its halfway point on saturday , there is the potential for a slew of highprofile jobs to open last season , only four jobs changed hands among the 65 in the six major conferences only one of those , colorado , came from a university firing its coach in this shortfuse world of college athletics , where instant results are not quick enough , that low job turnover led to predictions last offseason of an avalanche of job openings most of the speculation will revolve around bobby bowden at florida state and larry coker at miami both programs are mired in relative mediocrity it is unlikely both of those jobs will open but if one does , those universities will probably be competing with several others for the top available coaches topping the list of jobs likely to be open are north carolina , michigan state and arizona state none of those jobs are the caliber of miami and fsu , but they offer good tradition , salaries in excess of a million dollars a year and good facilities i think what foley did was astute and showed clearly there was a strategy , said neil cornrich , a lawyer and agent who represents numerous college coaches , including iowa s kirk ferentz and oklahoma s bob stoops i think that s the trend the smart athletic directors will follow foley what the early firing of zook did was give foley five weeks to thoroughly research meyer , who was coaching at utah , and other candidates while foley did not contact meyer until after utah s regular season ended in late november , he did talk to meyer s former bosses and players and his friends foley said he ended up with a notebook full of material he would not have gotten had he waited to fire zook how do i make calls about urban meyer when i still have a coach \? foley said the week that florida hired meyer , three other programs illinois , washington and notre dame were trying to do the same representatives from washington and notre dame ended up in his living room but foley had an advantage when his turn came to try to lure meyer to gainesville through his research , foley knew exactly what meyer wanted instead of dropping off clunky piles of books with generic information about the university of florida , foley gave him an itemized book with sections on everything he knew meyer cared about it was very succinct , very clear , meyer said it was about how the athletic department worked , the academic structure and where my kids would go to school and where we 'd live foley knew from his research how important family was to meyer so foley had florida s basketball coach , billy donovan , call meyer and donovan s wife , christine , call meyer s wife , shelley they talked about schools , neighborhoods and living environment if those interactions and early research had not happened , foley is not sure things would have worked out the way they did to be honest with you , i do n't think he 'd be here , foley said of meyer urban is a thorough guy who does n't leave many stones unturned one reason among many he s here now and not in south bend is because we did our research and established a relationship as soon as the season was over meyer has long loathed the way coaching searches are handled , saying they can be a distraction to a team and often force a coach to make a momentous decision with little time to research meyer did not even have a chance to visit gainesville before taking the florida job you 're making career decisions and decisions that affect a bunch of young people and universities and you basically have 24 hours to do it , he said with the college coaching landscape appearing ripe for an overhaul this offseason , it will be interesting to see who strikes first the timing allowed us to do our job and allowed us to be where we are today , foley said and no 2 in the country two years later shows that a quick hook can yield big results photos jeremy foley , florida s athletic director , introduced urban meyer as florida s coach , top left , in december 2004 on saturday , meyer , bottom left , celebrated a victory against lsu that vaulted the gators to no 2 and gave their fans , right , something to celebrate \( photographs by phil sandlin associated press \) the sophomore quarterback chase daniel has helped lead no 19 missouri to a 60 start , its best since 1973 \( photo by jack schoellkopf associated press \) \( photo by doug benc getty images \)
violence is n't pretty in the listless but eventful world of the end of reality , the hypnotic new play by richard maxwell at the kitchen of course , you could n't say it s ugly either nor is it fast , furious , pulseracing or any of those exciting adjectives usually applied to action movies no , violence according to mr maxwell and there s plenty of it in his latest work is something more awkward and ordinary it does n't so much explode into the lives of his hapless , lonely characters as drip , erratically and mundanely , like water from a leaky faucet the urban security guards and criminals who make up the cast of characters of the play , are beaten bloody and choked and kicked and jumped upon but their expressions rarely change , and their voices remain calm and neutral , with just a buzz of irritation at their edges somehow , though , all that flatness starts to sound like a sustained cry of pain more than seven years after making his name with house , a pokerfaced little drama with songs about a family in mysterious and mortal jeopardy , mr maxwell remains the king of affecting disaffection whether portraying a romantic triangle , prematurely burnedout boxers or the route from cradle to grave in one man s life , his works have always been notable for their air of electrified lethargy and actors who speak with all the intensity and animation of performers in training films from the 1950 s his style of willful numbness seemed destined to wear out its novelty how many notes can you find in a monotone , after all \? yet mr maxwell , who as a writer and director controls his work with a tightness exceeded in new york theater only by richard foreman , keeps digging deeper the end of reality is his most eloquent statement to date on the blurring of despair and apathy in american lives it is also his longest and wordiest show \( unless you count his misfired staging of shakespeare s henry iv , part one at the brooklyn academy of music \) and it features production values that are positively deluxe by his usual roughhewn standards designed with immaculate blankness by eric dyer , reality is set in the sterile white security station of an institutional building \( of unspecified purpose \) in what is obviously a very rough neighborhood there , a team of guards , headed by an avuncular type played by thomas bradshaw , fill the silence with talk on subjects small and large , while images of the rooms in the building , projected by security cameras , flash onto oversize screens sometimes people materialize on these screens , fuzzy but identifiably human , before disappearing in sections , as if by some computerized conjuring trick by the evening s end , you have the feeling that the fleshandblood figures onstage are not much more real to one another than are the twodimensional passersby the guards of reality , portrayed by members of mr maxwell s new york city players , sometimes speak in those elliptical fragments that have become this playwright s signature and that have the fascinating banality of conversation overheard in a supermarket or on a subway car as is always true of the maxwell style , the uninflected delivery of these lines seems to magnify and dissect what is spoken i'm frozen with fear , says a new member of the team \( sibyl kempson \) , after one of her colleagues has been spirited away by an anonymous thug that ms kempson says this as if she were reading a bus schedule perversely makes the fear more credible a fact of life instead of a moment of selfdramatization the catchphrase of a cocky guard played by brian mendes what s up \? becomes funnier with each repetition , precisely because it sounds so empty but mr maxwell has given his characters fuller powers of articulation than usual , and an itchy philosophical bent that does n't really do them any good mr bradshaw s character who would love to get a job as an extra in a movie so he could exist forever on screen quotes from the bible and considers the way time has warped his old neighborhood we 're in the future now , he says i can feel it marcia hidalgo , playing mr bradshaw s goddaughter \( and temporary employee \) , says she senses something vague but significant happening around her , that no pattern , no religion can claim , in which she ca n't even participate many of these observations are made in the presence of a silent and largely ignored witness a hoodlum \( jim fletcher \) who has broken into the building and been taken prisoner by the guards , after a painstaking , slowmotion struggle that fight is one of several \( overseen by mr mendes \) , all of which register as martialarts ballets of comic clunkiness their lack of drama and energy not only deglamorizes violence but also suggests it has become an accepted aspect of everyday existence references to beliefs in things mystical , from christianity to horoscopes , abound but everyone is ultimately a resigned fatalist fate is in control , one character says one thing equals another , and it feels so random , says another , with a baldness that obviates pretentiousness the conversation gets personal now and then mr bradshaw and ms hidalgo s characters argue about the boys she dates mr mendes makes a pass at ms hidalgo but no one is really connecting in these moments they 're not even connecting when they 're kicking the stuffing out of one another the end of reality finds in the early 21st century an echo of t s eliot s wasteland of the early 20th century , of hollow men reaching without conviction for anchors of hope and faith when mr bradshaw delivers a eulogy for an abducted coworker \( alex delinois \) who may or not be dead , he keeps promising to describe the real man that none of the others knew , but somehow he never gets around to it and there is one gorgeous , simple moment when mr mendes realizes he is the only person onstage and stares into the audience , looking fierce but kind of lost , like an amateur actor in a gangster melodrama i am alone , he says his stiff selfconsciousness only adds to the pathos the end of reality written and directed by richard maxwell set and lighting by eric dyer costumes by kaye voyce fight trainer consultant , brian mendes stage manager , scott sherratt set construction , joe silovsky and gary wilmes video consultant , jonathan gabel photographer , michael schmelling production assistants , shoshona currier and christopher maring producing director , barbara hogue general manager , christina masciotti presented by the kitchen and the new york city players at the kitchen , 512 west 19th street , chelsea \( 212 \) 2555793 , ext 11 through jan 28 running time 1 hour 40 minutes with thomas bradshaw , alex delinois , jim fletcher , marcia hidalgo , sibyl kempson and brian mendes

sacramento , sept 6 \( ap \) katie smith scored 22 points , and cheryl ford had 13 points and 10 rebounds as the detroit shock disappointed a sacramento crowd anticipating a championship celebration with a 7252 victory over the monarchs in game 4 on wednesday night the series will move back to detroit on saturday for a decisive fifth game it will be played at the downtown joe louis arena because the palace in suburban auburn hills will play host to a mariah carey concert swin cash and deanna nolan scored 8 points each for the shock , which made a remarkable turnaround after appearing to be disorganized and disinterested in most of the first three games after taking a 6point lead into the fourth quarter , the shock held the monarchs to 2 points on 1of12 shooting in a onesided fourth quarter the monarchs intended to duplicate last season s title celebration at arco arena , where they had not lost a playoff game in 11 attempts since 2001 but the shock broke the streak and survived elimination with smith s scoring and the defensive tenacity demanded by coach bill laimbeer , who publicly challenged his players to hate the monarchs the shock danced and waved towels on the sideline in the closing minutes , then gathered at midcourt for hugs and highfives nicole powell scored all 13 of her points in the first half for the monarchs , who shot poorly and were outrebounded , 4026 , showing none of the playoff tenacity they had displayed under coach john whisenant although detroit seemed finished after game 3 , laimbeer still had a couple of motivational tricks to use he ripped the officiating , earning a fine from the wnba , and repeatedly emphasized an usagainsttheworld mentality you have to hate the other team to win a series like this , laimbeer said hating the other team is the natural instinct any time , but you have to take it to the next level in a championship series all successful championship teams absolutely have to have it sacramento led throughout its 20point victory in game 3 , but the shock clearly had more focus with elimination on the line detroit went ahead on smith s 3pointer midway through the second quarter and led , 4337 , at halftime detroit led by 11 points before going scoreless for nearly five minutes in the third quarter sacramento made it 5450 , but the shock responded with a 122 run capped by smith s 3pointer with 4 minutes 40 seconds to play excuse our performance tonight , but we re definitely going to be better next game , yolanda griffith said to the crowd after the game

dennis w zilinski ii was the child that so many parents strive to produce , but few actually pull off always punctual , said his mom , marion , a legal secretary he woke each day smiling she raised five children , loves them all the same but there was something about dennis , her fourth a maturity , a purposefulness somehow a grown person was lodged inside him even while he was still a boy at 11 he was volunteering to deliver holiday baskets to the poor the family s pastor at middletown reformed church thought he was joking when , at 14 , he raised his hand to be on the worship committee , which was all adults it was no joke he pushed them to reinstate the sunday sunrise service he said , 'my parents will make everyone breakfast , ' recalled his dad , dennis in school , when his class had to write about a hero , most boys chose ballplayers , but he picked his father , big dennis , a new jersey state trooper for 32 years little dennis grew big 6 feet 1 inch , 200 pounds but was not a natural athlete , and worked to make himself a competitive swimmer , picking the toughest stroke , the butterfly he was on the red bank ymca team , and his parents drove all over the state , sometimes , as his dad said , spending six hours at a meet to watch dennis swim a 30second relay a lot of times , he did n't win , his father said and yet by senior year at christian brothers academy in lincroft , nj , an allboys' catholic school and state swimming power , he was captain he swam to his own beat others played heart of a champion by nelly on their psych tapes he was listening to oh holy night , by neil diamond he was an average student , but none tried harder if they gave him a report due in two weeks , he 'd get his index cards together right away to plan it out , said his mother he was accepted to the united states military academy at west point , and though the swim coach at the time was n't interested in him , by senior year he was team captain raising an idealistic son can make parents fearful he wo n't be shrewd enough to look out for himself in the summer of 2002 , between dennis s sophomore and junior years , his mom and dad made a special visit to west point cadets can quit with no military obligation until the first class of junior year and though the zilinskis loved west point , they asked their son about leaving i said , 'dennis , the country s going to war , ' recalled mrs zilinski , 'you can still drop out' he said , 'you do n't quit when your country needs you most , mom' she urged him to choose a branch of the army like finance or law he picked infantry before deploying , he arranged his life as neatly as those index cards he proposed to his girlfriend , marie cicerelle , a fellow cadet , in central park , and they planned a 2007 wedding , for after their return from iraq in august 2005 , he went to a lawyer to do his will we 're driving there and he asks me , 'how much do you have to leave someone \? ' recalled mrs zilinski i said , 'it s up to you' he said , 'how much would i have to leave the church \? ' i said 'it s very personal if you leave 500 they 'll be thrilled' lt dennis zilinski , 23 , arrived in iraq in early october 2005 his parents emailed and sent letters daily he was so busy , they said , several days could pass with no email messages back they heard from him nov 14 any time you have contact , it erases all those days you heard nothing , his father said you know you 're that much closer to him coming home 'as of today , he s safe' there were no email messages the rest of that week mrs zilinski had a recurring nightmare of a coffin draped in an american flag and that friday night , she woke in a panic while the neighbors along their suburban culdesac slept , she sat at the computer i wrote , 'i know you 're busy , i just need to hear , even a oneliner' mr zilinski checked the defense department web site daily , and on saturday morning , nov 19 , read of five deaths in bayji , iraq , where a roadside bomb blew up a humvee there were no names , but it was the 101st airborne , their son s division i did n't tell marion , said mr zilinski i figured every hour that passes and we do n't hear , the chance is better that we were ok at 11 pm he was showering when his wife came upstairs as soon as she came up , there was no question what happened , he said two officers were at the door dennis had told us , if they 're dressed in bdu s battle dress uniforms it means injured , mr zilinski said if it s class a uniforms , you 're dead unfortunately , they were in class a s , so that was it soldiers write a letter to be mailed in the event they 're killed three weeks after he died , lt zilinski s letter came home mom and dad , he began , if you are reading this letter , then i have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country he thanked them for a wonderful life , said he enjoyed every single minute of it i love this country , our friends , and most importantly our family he wrote that his spirit would always be with them and he knew they 'd meet again in heaven i do not want your life to be too affected by my loss , he wrote he also enclosed a list of how i want my stuff handed out to everyone this included his 100 , 000 death benefit , which he left to their church my reaction \? said mrs zilinski i said , 'holy smoke , ' only i did n't use the word smoke' if you knew dennis , that said everything about dennis a year has passed and despite their son s wishes , every day is too affected by his loss they hear him in the music at the beautiful white church in middletown about half his gift went to buy a new church organ mrs zilinski s faith remains strong , but mr zilinski says , my faith is still up and down because of what happened they 've attended several ceremonies honoring their son , and sunday morning , nov 12 , is the first annual lt zilinski benefit run at the pnc bank arts center in holmdel for a year their dining room was cluttered with his things the shells from the 21gun salute when he was buried at west point the cd of the memorial service in iraq his medals , and all the cards and letters an idealistic young man s death can generate i could n't go in there , mrs zilinski said i could n't breathe mr zilinski said , you 'd pick up something , read it , look at it , but it could n't go anywhere only in the last week have they got it into boxes you think of him when you wake up and go to bed , mr zilinski said they look for signs of him when the phone rings , and there s no one there , mrs zilinski says , i believe it s a signal from dennis and when mr zilinski runs , he talks to dennis i cry and it clears my mood they support the war and are grateful that even those who do n't seem to support the troops but they are amazed at how disengaged most americans are every day after work , mr zilinski changes his clothes , has dinner with his wife , then goes to the computer i'm consumed by that web site you see six killed , five , one you think of the families i know i'm them a year ago , and i still feel this way think what s in store for them , mrs zilinski said photos on display mementos of lt dennis w zilinski ii s brief military career , in his parents' dining room he was killed in iraq last november \( photo by laura pedrick for the new york times \) \( pg 1 \) mourning a year after their son s death , marion and dennis zilinski have only recently been able to sort through his things \( photo by laura pedrick for the new york times \) \( pg 4 \)
readers respond to thomas friedman s march 10 column ,  michael mavroidis , weymouth , mass although your suggestions for knocking heads together to force an iraqi settlement make some sense , i doubt the bush administration s thinking is based enough in reality to see the merit and , i m surprised you didn t add that , if dick cheney is too busy , john bolton seems to have the personal style this task would require robert stannard , manchester , vt in your column today , you call upon dick cheney to step up and broker an end to the war in iraq you make the assumption that he , and presumably the bush administration as well , wants it to end i can see why , with the current poll numbers showing the president in the tank however , i m not so sure they want it to end they don t talk like they do they ve created the war on the terror bogyman add to that the fact that halliburton , et al , are making millions what s the incentive to stop it \? or worse yet , go somewhere else \? lev raphael , okemos , mich so , dick cheney should tell the kurds that they ve behaved responsibly , and we ll take care of them should iraq collapse that s commendable , except we have a bad track record of keeping our promises to the kurds but more importantly , there s nothing in those remarks that would encourage them to do anything that would keep them allied to the iraqi state even dick cheney can t stop what s coming a truly independent kurdistan , long overdue rick whelan , stratford , ontario i think you have misread the vice president he may growl a tough game , but when push comes to shove , mr cheney is , like most bullies , a coward at heart as he displayed when he had a chance to go to vietnam and further his country s cause what did he say about his avoiding the draft three separate times \? i had another focus during that time of my life send cheney to broker a deal in iraq and he ll come away with no solution but he will have several new defense contracts for halliburton in his back pocket jh , atlanta why should the shiites compromise with the sunnis \? the shiites won the election the sunnis in the government are the equivalent of the political wing of the ira they handle the bargaining while letting the insurgents do the bombing if the shiites cave to sunni violence , and give them more power than they won in the election , it will be pure appeasement and just lead to more violence many sunnis still think they can take over the government if they are just ruthless enough after all , such tactics allowed them to rule iraq for hundreds of years the last thing we should do is to tell the kurds we ll look out for them if the country falls apart this will just encourage them to vote for secession as soon as the constitution allows it there s no reason to govern from the center either , except the threat of sunni violence the shiites won the election and just like the republicans who won the us election , they see no reason to compromise if you ve got enough votes to get your way democracy is messy , as donald rumsfeld says we should accept that fact , bring our troops home , and let the elected government of iraq solve their own problems frieda nelson , hillsborough , nj i agree with your idea about the reconciliation conference , but if we truly want to build a new paradigm , we must have builders who can communicate in other words , hear and speak thoughtfully we live in a time when we have a very sophisticated means for communication , but communication has become very difficult between individuals and groups of people that is why restoring communication is the basic work for peace , and our political and our spiritual leaders have to focus all their energy on this matter eugene colon , lido beach , ny asking iraqi leaders to fix the current mess by an act of political will is like asking someone to quit smoking by will power alone to achieve success , you need to provide the right tools and support system scare tactics don t generally work you can t just create democracy by fiat or at the end of a gun barrel you have to develop and support the social and economic institutions that are the underpinning of democracy in order for there to be any chance of success in iraq , we are going to have to do much , much more to support and strengthen other iraqi institutions that were either nonfunctioning or shattered by the toppling of saddam if we don t try to provide realistic underpinnings that permit an iraqi democracy to function in a meaningful way , no government , however constituted , will survive for very long , and we will leave iraq in a worse mess than before we came don t look only for the easy way out there is none if i had done that , i d still be smoking henry ehrlich , brooklyn , ny i am curious as to why you think cheney is the right man to deliver this message to the iraqis cheney s skill is getting others to do the dirty work , not doing it himself his record is exemplified by his recent hunting trip he no longer stalks anything that has a chance of getting away he has been reduced to riding around in an suv until someone flushes a flock of domesticated game birds he doesn t bother to aim before he shoots , and he usually gets away with it

the player market did n't offer a lot of talent this winter , but it did feature a smorgasbord of catchers and if the 23 catchers who were available as free agents were n't enough , another halfdozen or so were traded most of the catchers who were available are backup types , many of whom drift from team to team each winter , depending on a team s preference at the time the yankees , for example , are on their sixth backup catcher \( kelly stinnett \) in eight seasons but 5 of the 26 catchers who started 94 games or more behind the plate last season have left their 2005 teams one , ramon hernandez , has signed with a new team , moving to baltimore from san diego two have been traded paul lo duca to the mets from florida , and johnny estrada to arizona from atlanta two , mike piazza and bengie molina , remain unsigned a sixth regular , brad ausmus , was a free agent but resigned with houston another , dan wilson , retired , and seattle replaced him with a free agent from japan , kenji johjima contrary to widespread rumor and speculation , jorge posada will not be traded by the yankees , general manager brian cashman said , but will remain for his ninth season piazza , on the other hand , will not be the mets' catcher for a ninth season except perhaps for occasional duty , piazza is n't expected to be anyone s catcher next season it s not even clear , a month before pitchers and catchers begin reporting for spring training , if he will serve as someone s designated hitter american league teams have not worn out his agent s cellphone battery calling with offers piazza s agent , dan lozano , did not return calls seeking a status report two teams that had some interest in him have changed their plans i was sniffing around that we needed a dh , minnesota general manager terry ryan said but we got rondell white , so i do n't need a dh , first baseman or catcher i'm pretty well set there familiarity with the american league was the reason ryan gave for preferring white , who has played more than two of the past four years in the al the angels had been considered an ideal home for piazza , but nothing developed there general manager bill stoneman declined to talk about the 37yearold piazza or any interest he might have had in him but stoneman was quoted in the los angeles daily news as saying that rather than to get somebody that had a name that people knew but who would n't necessarily impact the club the way we wanted , that we had some very young talented players to give a chance the angels let their catcher , molina , leave as a free agent the mets , seeking a replacement for piazza , made simultaneous offers to molina and hernandez for 18 million for three years neither , however , leaped at the offer , and the mets jumped into the marlins' market correction plan and traded for lo duca hernandez subsequently signed with baltimore for four years and 275 million alan nero , molina s agent , said three teams seemed to have significant interest my feeling is something could happen by the end of the week , he said last week some speculators thought the yankees might trade posada and sign molina , but cashman scoffed at the idea we 've never tried to trade jorge posada , he said i 've had teams express some interest in him , but i 've never picked up the phone and made a proposal for jorge posada but that s been written about quite often the theory behind the idea that the yankees would trade the 34yearold posada stems from the option in his contract for the 2007 season if he is the starting catcher in 81 games next season , the option becomes guaranteed for 12 million and he receives an option year in 2008 with 4 million guaranteed in addition , 87 days into next season , june 27 , posada becomes a 105 player \( 10 years in the majors , the last 5 with the same club \) and gains tradeveto rights when you assess the market , cashman said , posada is one of the premier catchers in the game even though his numbers might be declining if he s with us the next two years , we 'll be comfortable with that my concern is n't what am i going to do having jorge my concern is what are we going to do when we do n't have jorge in posada s tenure as the starting catcher , the yankees have had as backups joe girardi , chris turner , todd greene , chris widger , john flaherty and now stinnett , who became a free agent when he declined an outright assignment to the minors by arizona the yankees opted to sign him instead of flaherty , who had been the backup for three years we had three backup choices that we looked at seriously , cashman said flaherty was one after that there was quite a dropoff it s a very thin spot flaherty signed with the boston red sox , who needed a backup because they traded theirs , doug mirabelli , to san diego for second baseman mark loretta seeing boston from cleveland cleveland s unexpected run at the american league central championship last season validated the outstanding work mark shapiro has done in four years as the indians' general manager the job he has done integrating minor league talent with veteran players makes his assessment of the red sox all the more interesting boston is positioned extremely well for the future , shapiro said they have a good farm system with upperlevel players and a depth of pitching talent they 've rebuilt the farm system from a dilapidated system to a productive one if they take a small step backward this year , at some point they will go on a run that will be an impressive run they 're a short period away for yanks , no move was the move contrary to appearances , as it turns out , before the yankees gave johnny damon 52 million to be their center fielder , they tried to get juan pierre from the marlins but , brian cashman said , any deal for pierre had to include cano that would be robinson cano , who blossomed into a fine young second baseman , and whom the yankees understandably do n't want to trade no way i was going to do that for a player who would be in the last year of his contract , cashman said the marlins' owner , jeffrey loria , and their general manager , larry beinfest , made overtures to cashman , he said , each time naming cano as the price for pierre at one point the marlins offered to include ron villone , a relief pitcher the yankees subsequently acquired for a minor league pitcher as far as i'm concerned , we did n't make a mistake , cashman said the marlins wound up trading pierre to the chicago cubs for three young pitchers , none of whom has proved himself in the major leagues , as cano did last season had the yankees traded cano for pierre , they would have had their center fielder , but then they would have had to find a second baseman sosa and the nationals a year ago , the washington nationals tried to obtain sammy sosa from the chicago cubs but failed because the teams could n't agree on how much of sosa s 17 million salary the cubs would pay major league baseball s ownership of the nationals compounded the issue because they were n't free to pay sosa as much as they might otherwise have been willing to pay him now , after an injurymarred season with baltimore in which he endured his lowest offensive production since 1992 , the 37yearold sosa is a free agent , and the nationals are interested again but the two sides have yet to hold substantive talks , so no agreement is imminent photo mike piazza , 37 , the mets' catcher for eight seasons , has yet to sign with a major league club for the coming season \( photo by

the portable global positioning systems that drivers have been increasingly putting into their cars have become the new targets of thieves in westchester county police departments are reporting that there have been a wave of thefts of the units , which often cost 300 to 1 , 000 there has definitely been an increase , said lt robert koziak , of the mamaroneck police department , who said seven units had been stolen in town in the last few months we had seen none of these six months ago more than 20 gps units had been taken from cars parked in shopping centers in yonkers and greenburgh this year , but the pace of thefts slowed after the greenburgh police arrested two men in september when we arrested them , they had two gps units taken from cars parked along the central avenue corridor , one from near the yonkers border and the other from the white plains border , said capt joseph delio of the greenburgh police and westchester is not alone while the connecticut state police said they had not seen an increase in gps thefts , the police in new jersey have , although they said they believed the thefts were tied to one man in paramus , about 60 units were taken from shopping center parking lots earlier this year before the police arrested a queens man in may and charged him with burglary , theft and possession of stolen property he would break the window and look under the seat and grab the device , said capt kevin smith of the paramus police department he told us he got 75 to 100 per unit in the bronx in the four months since his arrest , we have had maybe four or five thefts the portable units that often attach to a windshield or sit on the dashboard , not the factory installed systems , are the ones primarily stolen by thieves , said detective sgt scott sullivan of the westchester county police department i liken this phenomenon with what we 've seen with airbags , xenon lights and certain radio systems , sergeant sullivan said it s a matter of where there is a market for these things so far this year , the units have also been stolen from cars parked at several train stations , including in white plains , new castle and croton falls , he said the number of portable units delivered to retailers has risen , according to steve koenig , a spokesman for the consumer electronics association this year , an estimated 23 million units are expected to be delivered , up from 700 , 000 last year manufacturers like garmin and magellan are encouraging their customers to remove the system , its mount and any mark left by the mount when they leave their car garmin also offers password protection on some models even if portable units have passwords , thieves may not get the word , said frank scafidi , a spokesman for the national insurance crime bureau , which specializes in auto theft and insurance fraud research most of these knuckleheads will think that they can plugandplay these in another vehicle , mr scafidi said we saw that same application with the headlight thefts that were occurring in the northeast a few years ago after manufacturers made it almost impossible to use the headlights unless you had the factoryinstalled wiring , they were still getting ripped off photos recovered detectives paul r fertig , left , and robert prescott of the greenburgh police department with gps units on display gps devices and tools used to get in cars \( photographs by alan zale for the new york times \)
everybody in new york has a bitter divorce story , even if it s not personal we all know the friend who can pay either the lawyer or the rent battles over children become so brutal that they and their parents are left traumatized it can never be pleasant to end a marriage , but it does not have to be as awful and take as long as it does in new york state while most other states have some kind of onestep no fault divorce provision , new york still requires most couples to figure out who caused the marriage to fail under present law , a marriage cannot merely die it must be killed by one spouse or the other , through adultery , cruel and inhuman treatment , or abandonment even when none of these things have actually occurred , and even when both people agree on all the particulars this means , in effect , that people have to lie they have to go before a judge , swear to tell the truth and then not tell the truth those who deal with these issues day in and day out have concluded that pointing the finger at one spouse makes negotiations uglier , costlier and longer after two years of surveying new york s matrimonial law , a commission appointed by the state s chief judge , judith kaye , recommended last month overhauling divorce and child custody rules the centerpiece of those recommendations is onestep , nofault divorce that would make it easier for couples who want to end their marriages by mutual consent to do so in the past , with opposition from conservatives and the catholic church , some legislators in albany have resisted changes in a divorce law often said to be one of the strictest in the nation some women s groups have also resisted any changes , fearing that the vulnerable spouse , usually the woman , will fare poorly once nofault comes into being others have argued in favor of incremental change , like an adjustment a few years ago that allowed couples to get a divorce by mutual consent if they lived apart for a year and then filed for divorce an overly long and complicated process however , one important study for the national bureau of economic research has shown that in states with nofault divorce laws , where women can get out of a bad marriage more quickly , there were fewer suicides among women , less domestic violence and fewer women murdered by spouses the women s bar association , which earlier had opposed this shift , now endorses the nofault option for new york couples the legislature has yet to get very far on judge kaye s divorce proposal , but if this is going to bring relief to so many families , there is every reason for profamily politicians to help move things along this proposal will not eliminate the fullcourt divorce the kind that provides endless fodder for the tabloids and makes celebrity lawyers so much richer and any new law also should , of course , make it possible for spouses without financial means to have access to lawyers but right now , as judge kaye puts it , divorce takes too long and costs too much too much money , too much agony modernizing new york s divorce law will not be easy , but it is the right and humane thing for lawmakers to do
works of religious art are generally found in churches or in the permanentcollection rooms of major museums it is rare to see them in a contemporary art museum but for the next nine months , at the hudson valley center for contemporary art in peekskill , reverence invites viewers to lift their eyes to spiritual heights , and depths as an agnostic who has spent a great deal of time at churches and temples looking at religious art , i approached this exhibition with a measure of skepticism how , i wondered , could contemporary artists compete with the great masters of religious art \? the present exhibition wisely does n't try , opting instead for a display of artworks that trade less in conventional ideas of religious faith than in a wider feeling of profound awe , respect and devotion the curators call it reverence , but essentially this is an exhibition about belief the majority of the 33 artists showing here seem fixated on a few related themes transcendence , forms of ritual and an interest in the elegiac transcendence a quality we attribute to what can be appreciated only in concept , not reality , like the existence of a god , the size of the universe , or death is symbolized in various ways , none so spectacularly as in damien hirst s exalted , 10foot high , oblongshaped collage of hundreds of colorful butterfly wings arranged in a radiating crucifixlike pattern hung high on the wall , forcing your gaze upward , it is like a brilliant stained glass window that looks out at the unknowable opposite mr hirst s collage is hermann nitsch s schuttbild \( 1962 \) , the oldest work in the exhibition and the first you see it is not for sissies this bold red abstract painting is made of animal blood splattered on a piece of primed burlap mr nitsch , 68 , a performance artist , was a founder of the now legendary orgy mystery theater , a group of viennese artists who explored themes of erotic violence in ritualistic performances staged around the world from the early 1960 s to the late 1990 s these performance actions often included group sex and live animal slaughter schuttbild is the product of one of the artist s first ritualistic performance actions the idea of the modern artist as a performer , translating ritualistic or shamanistic activity into artwork , has been around since the 1950 s it comes out of a creative cocktail of zen buddhism , dada and beat elements used by artists trying to reconnect art to its ancient origins in pagan ritual and religion think of yves klein , fluxus and , later , the work of joseph beuys these days , it is a popular mode of working for artists from multicultural backgrounds , who have found in performancebased activity a vehicle for combating stereotypes the iranianborn photographer shirin neshat is among them she is depicted in a photograph here at a mosque pouring water over her head as part of a purification ceremony religious affiliation is rarely overt in the artwork in this exhibition , with the exception of ms neshat s photograph , and a wall installation by trenton doyle hancock , an africanamerican painter from houston whose stepfather was a baptist minister his installation , an entire wall filled with text , is all about being raised a baptist in the south then there are a handful of theologically oriented works , including anselm kiefer s painting about lilith , the mythological first wife of adam according to hebrew lore tossed into the potpourri are theological concepts from the kabbalah , along with references to the bible , the holocaust and recent german history the search for a kind of religious equivalence in contemporary art also led the curators , marc and livia straus , toward artists who are interested in exploring the darker side of the human psyche , what jung famously called owning your own shadow among the works by these artists , jannis kounellis s sculptural meditation on time , death and decay is most memorable , and dieter appelt s selfportrait , a photograph of the artist s naked body , corpselike and covered in sores after living alone in a forest for six to eight weeks , is most distressing by interpreting reverence in art so broadly , and esoterically , the strauses have ended up with a show that can take you clear out of yourself but it can also dissolve into nothing the moment you step out the door reverence , the hudson valley center for contemporary art , 1701 main street , peekskill , through feb 26 , 2007 information \( 914 \) 7887166 or hvccacom photos works from reverence include , at left , damien hirst s butterflywing collage above , photograph of shirin neshat in a purification ceremony and , below , trenton doyle hancock s wall installation
as the mets charged into this year s postseason , their cityskyline logo suddenly appeared on magazine covers , on pencils displayed near grocery checkouts and on bumper stickers sold at gasoline stations but just a few months ago and for many years before that , through thick and mostly thin there was hardly a trace of mets gear to be found my son james and i would trudge from store to store in search of a mets backpack or even just a lunch box , deliberately ignoring the racks and rows of yankee tank tops , change purses and dog sweaters last year , the manager of a large , local sports warehouse truly trying to help asked , have you considered rooting for the yankees \? james , who was 6 at the time , and i had a long , silent , thoughtful ride home even then , of course , metsemblazoned tchotchkes and memorabilia proliferated online and a few clicks did bring us the coveted backpack but seeing that favorite team s logo out in the world , as yankee fans always do , validates that loyalty , makes it seem meaningful and widespread , which is important for a child this year , of course , meaningfulness does n't need a logo but it does need a perspective as both james and i know , this thrilling season would never be so truly , so characteristically amazing without the struggles that preceded it and i do n't mean the team s struggles before he started first grade , james had already learned that it s tough to be a mets fan , especially in yankeeland here in south orange , nj , trickortreaters often resemble the yankees' starting lineup yankeesthemed parties , with the birthday boy in the derek jeter role , are not unusual our daughter s american girl doll wears a yankee uniform \( a promotional giveaway from a game she attended \) even our local history looks toward the bronx babe ruth and lou gehrig played an exhibition game here in 1929 now the town team wears shirts that say , south orange where legends played in big letters across the back ambitious batters , from tball firsttimers to college varsity veterans , aim at an apartment building on a town thoroughfare , hoping to break a window as legend says gehrig did still , we never wavered even as children , the fans i know accepted the mets as their destiny like being lefthanded , it s occasionally inconvenient , but it s a way of life for me , it s a familial trait i was raised national league by a mets father and a phillies mother when the family landed in northern new jersey , my brother and i gravitated toward shea stadium , where i learned to count change at the concession stand and to score a game correctly , filling in the spaces with satisfying k s when the opposing team s batter struck out my father took us to several seasons' worth of mets games , enough to establish a lifetime loyalty to the team even as their fortunes waxed and waned , and i lived in many places , i answered questions about team preference with , mets , of course if i had carried a backpack , i would have wanted a mets logo on it , which is why i 've been willing to travel hopefully from store to store each year , much as the mets approach those first road games each season the peculiar pull of this team is the repeated disappointment that punctuates its bigleague credentials i 've always seen myself in the players the way they blow opportunities , make spectacular errors and sometimes , just barely , catch a break they either do n't deserve or deserve more than any other team in the world that s baseball s equivalent of missed deadlines , bills paid late , children s homework hastily done and the occasional glorious day when either none of that matters or all of it does on the best of good days , i'm willie randolph , my children are a welltrained team , and my suburb is a soldout night game at shea more often , my met life is a rainout followed by a grueling doubleheader on the road and bad news about the pitcher s throwing arm my high school buddy , a queens transplant , and i used to listen to mets games on a transistor radio in his yard when his mother sent us outside to weed the vegetable garden i remember lying in spring s damp grass , which dried to nothing in the heat of late summer and revived for the playoffs even then , back in the 1980 s , it was an apt metaphor for the mets' seasons this year , for the first time in recent memory , i look forward to reading the sports pages after the mets swept the division title , their logo swept the stores with equal bravado , often replacing large yankee displays entire windows of sportinggoods stores in new york city are now filled with mets gear mets tshirts are being advertised in south orange advertised ! at several stores , along with enough backpacks for every child in the tristate area i see myself less clearly in this success story , but that s ok if my mets have a golden season , there s reason to think that i 'll have the same so i'm feeling an unfamiliar exuberance in gleeful anticipation of dare i say it \? a world series title , i decide to buy some party clothes , a new tshirt for myself and a hat for james as a veteran fan , though , my exuberance is tempered , just slightly , by experience browsing through the array of mets gear , i choose a backpack that i hide from james it s for next year just in case we 're all disappointed and it s back to the same old and the mets logo vanishes from sight like a foul ball into a fan s mitt because being a mets fan means celebrating victories a stolen base , a favorable call at third or a division title when we can , and pragmatically planning for errors it s the lesson of the legacy it s the hardwon wisdom that distinguishes us from fans of that other new york team it sets us apart well , that and the backpacks drawing \( drawing by alex nabaum \)
britains highestranking law enforcement official said sunday that the threat of a terrorist attack here remained very substantial , and he disclosed that about two dozen major terrorist conspiracies were under investigation there are still people out there who would carry out such attacks , the official , home secretary john reid , said , the threat of a terrorist attack in the uk is still very substantial four days after the british authorities announced that they had disrupted a plot to use liquid explosives to bomb up to 10 americanbound passenger jets , britain was still on its highest level of alert , its airports in pandemonium because of heightened security measures in early morning raids last thursday , the police rounded up 24 suspects and later freed one of them , leaving 23 in custody under counterterrorism laws permitting 28day detention without charge of those , 22 were being questioned on sunday while the status of the 23rd awaited a court ruling on monday in a bbc interview , mr reid did not give details of any of the other conspiracies , but echoed earlier police assessments that british authorities had foiled four other plots since the london bombings on july 7 , 2005 the bombings brought britons up short against the bloody reality of islamic terrorism , made all the more chilling by the fact that the attacks then like the suspects now were mainly britishborn muslims but the figure of 24 continuing investigations into other plots far higher than had previously been made known seemed bound to alarm many people whose lives have already been reshaped by new security regimes and what prime minister tony blair has called an elemental battle with radical islam at heathrow airport , europes busiest , airlines canceled almost one third of their flights on sunday after a chaotic day on saturday when many flights were canceled and some left halfempty because passengers were stuck in security lines awaiting body searches around 500 people spent the night camped out at the airport and , as torrential downpours drenched marquees erected as makeshift waiting areas on sunday , attendants handed out pink , blue and transparent plastic hooded raincovers to keep passengers dry its good they found the people , said verena trommen , a 26yearold german traveler , referring to the arrested suspects but this is just so hard sobbing as she spoke to a reporter , she said she had arrived from vancouver , canada , and was trying to get home to munich but her flight had been canceled and she would spend the night at heathrow its a very bad end to a holiday , she said it feels just like the war its like a really bad movie one airline boss , michael oleary , the chief executive of the lowcost carrier ryanair , said the government by insisting on these heavyhanded security measures is allowing the extremists to achieve many of their objectives apparently seeking to bolster official denials of a link between terrorism and britains alliance with the united states in afghanistan and iraq , mr reid said it was now known that al qaeda first tried to attack a british target in 2000 so this has been a longgoing threat but it is a chronic one and it is a severe one , he said we now think in retrospect that the first al qaeda plot , for instance , against this country preceded by quite awhile our intervention in iraq and afghanistan and actually preceded 9 11 , he said the remark seemed to be an indirect confirmation , for the first time , that the government saw the hand of al qaeda in the latest conspiracy , echoing stronger assertions by pakistani officials mr reid did not give details about the purported conspiracy in 2000 beyond saying it was uncovered in birmingham , britains second city which figured in the latest wave of arrests one man seized there , tayib rauf , was said to be the brother of rashid rauf , a man captured by police in pakistan whose arrest reportedly set off last weeks roundup of suspects asked about a report in the british sunday newspaper the observer that police were hunting two dozen terror cells in britain , mr reid said im not going to confirm an exact number but i wouldnt deny that that would indicate the number of major conspiracies that we are trying to look at there would be more which are not at the center of our considerations and there may be more that we dont know about at all he also appeared to suggest that some conspirators associated with the plot disclosed last week may still be at large we believe it was a major , major plot , he said , describing the police investigation as ongoing we believe we have the main targets , he said , but did not rule out the idea that other people at large might still be planning an attack or prepared to use this opportunity to carry out a terrorist attack while the government insists that last thursdays plot was real , some of its critics on sunday started to question publicly the veracity of the governments depiction of it , citing previous occasions including an intelligence dossier used to justify the invasion of iraq 2003 when official assertions of a threat proved wrong

control of the senate depends on one narrow race that has kept the political spotlight and the nation s attention on the region alabama as much of the nation turned toward the democrats , alabama continued a longterm trend of southern states becoming more solidly republican gov bob riley was unpopular through much of his term , and democrats had hopes of unseating him but he won a second term and made it look easy , soundly beating lt gov lucy baxley in a race that had seemed competitive six months ago jim folsom , a democratic former governor and lieutenant governor , and the son of a governor , made a comeback by winning a tight race for lieutenant governor but over all , republicans made gains in races for state offices when he began his term , mr riley alienated democrats by quashing plans for casino gambling then he angered conservatives by proposing a tax increase , a measure voters overwhelmingly rejected but since then , he has won praise for his management , in contrast to his democratic predecessor , don siegelman , who faces corruption charges governor 993 reporting riley 717 , 287 58 baxley 518 , 750 42 arkansas in the race for governor , state attorney general mike beebe , a democrat , defeated former representative asa hutchinson , a republican and a former under secretary in the homeland security department gov mike huckabee , a republican , was barred by term limits from running after a 10year tenure this was mr beebe s first time facing an opponent after nearly a quartercentury in politics he served 20 years in the state senate and ran unopposed for attorney general mr beebe led a democratic sweep of seven statewide offices , including lieutenant governor and auditor in his victory speech , he paid tribute to winthrop paul rockefeller , the republican former lieutenant governor who died in july from a rare blood ailment in house races , none of the four incumbents , three democrats and a republican , faced a close challenge voters also approved a measure to allow bingo and raffles by charitable groups arkansas was one of only four states where that type of gambling was illegal governor 98 reporting beebe 414 , 382 555 hutchinson 304 , 408 407 florida floridians had two bush brothers to bear in mind , one who was still popular and one who was not in the senate race , which pitted bill nelson , the democratic incumbent , against katherine harris , the former secretary of state who presided over the 2000 presidential recount , voters seemed to be thinking of president bush in exit polls , some 54 percent of voters said they disapproved of mr bush s job performance , and many appeared to have seen voting for mr nelson as a way to send a message to washington mr nelson defeated ms harris with more than 60 percent of the vote in the race for governor , in which charlie crist , the republican attorney general , easily defeated representative jim davis , the democrat , voters seemed to have had gov jeb bush in mind mr crist has been a close associate of the governor , and in exit polls , 66 percent of voters said they approved of how jeb bush , who is facing term limits , had handled his governorship mr crist went out of his way to cast himself as a centrist republican and to emphasize his independence from president bush , declining to appear at a campaign rally in pensacola on monday with the president instead , mr crist campaigned in jacksonville , tampa and other cities where he hoped to appeal to independent voters crist knew he was attracting independent and even many democratic voters , and if he had campaigned with president bush , he might have lost them , said susan mcmanus , a political scientist at the university of south florida in tampa thirteen percent of voters who cast ballots for mr crist identified themselves as democrats in two florida congressional races , democrats capitalized on voter discontent with the war and with the house page scandal that

call it a rookie mistake , or an epiphany the bagger has a revelation yesterday at 3 pm when the editor at the house of many doors called to finalize his picks for the newspaper the clouds parted at the last minute and he found himself saying the word crash when his best picture choice came up you re sure you want to change it from brokeback \? the editor asked he was sure for about 38 seconds and then picker s remorse set in he had wanted to throw a wild card in , something that would fly in the face of conventional wisdom , but you d think picking enron the smartest guys in the room would have done it nope it reminded him of the time he went shoe shopping the day before high school with his father the bagger picked out a pair of rather extraordinary tricolor shoes in a sort of felt suede motif they look like clown shoes , the bagger s dad said the bagger explained to his dad that he had no idea what kids were wearing today and that he was completely confident in his choice they look like clown shoes a lot , the dad repeated the bagger strode the next day into an allboys school a place he would quickly come to hate with the force of 10 , 000 suns with an inner confidence , a certain snap in his stride he had the snot pounded out of him within three hours , and yes , the shoes were mentioned a lot so now he s done it unlike the shoes , which he dumped in the garbage at the end of that first day , the crash choice will become a tin can , a loud , clanky reminder that after three months of covering every oscillation of the race , he has learned bupkes perhaps it was a form of blogicide , a way to insure that next year when it is time for a daily oscar boswell , his betters will say , well , do we want to go with crash carpetbagger , or a some other blind farm animal \?

know anyone who has the final four intact in the office pool \? no way after all , not one topseeded team made it the last time that happened was 1980 who could have picked the patriots not tom brady company , but the ones from george mason \? was there a secret to making sense of possibly the most unpredictable ncaa tournament \? for russell pleasant , a 46yearold software engineer from omaha , it took a lucky mistake when he filled out his bracket earlier this month , he thought george washington would reach this weekend s final four instead , he ended up picking george mason , round after round after round , all the way to indianapolis now , he finds himself a rare survivor among millions of broken hearts with busted brackets across the nation in espncom s 2006 men s college basketball tournament challenge , pleasant had one of the four entries among three million with ucla , louisiana state , florida and george mason in the final four last season , 4 , 172 people picked all four teams in espncom s pool but last year s final four featured a more predictable lineup two topseeded teams , north carolina and illinois a fourthseeded team , louisville and a fifthseeded team , michigan state at cbssportslinecom , none of the two million brackets submitted this year had all four teams in the yahoo sports pool , just one of more than a million entered had all four that entry was submitted by a contestant named tim mckenna one night i was watching some of the games , and i saw george washington , pleasant said last night in a telephone interview i said that team is good i like them same first name , different last name oh , well man , all those georges he said i knew they were all from dc i like georgetown , too in november , pleasant watched george mason take on creighton on television even though creighton won , 7252 , pleasant said he remembered thinking that george mason was pretty good i thought i had george mason in the sweet 16 , he said but it was the other way around he had eighthseeded george washington in the round of 16 and 11thseeded george mason in the final four george washington lost to duke in the second round by the way , pleasant picked florida to defeat ucla in the championship game he remains in contention to win the top prize , 10 , 000 mike breen , a mathematician at the american mathematical society in providence , ri , said the chances of correctly picking the final four in espncom s contest this year were about 1 in 750 , 000 last year , he said , roughly 1 in 700 brackets included the correct four teams pleasant said he had never entered a pool until last year , when his wife , valerie , persuaded him to join one at work after picking the eventual national champion , north carolina , and nearly winning it all , pleasant could not wait for this year he said he began to pay closer attention to the games , and he kept some favorites in mind i knew i needed a cinderella , a good cinderella , he said and i needed a good mixture photo \( photograph by dave weaver for the new york times \) \( pg d3 \)
jojo the high road \( blackground universal \) two years ago , at 13 , the singer known as jojo released her selftitled debut that album , which eventually sold over 13 million copies , included leave \( get out \) , a resentful breakup song , and baby it s you , a lighterthanair rb ode none of it sounded like children s music there was even a pretty good version of weak , the 1992 slow jam sung by swv to jojo , that must be a golden oldie more recently , having survived a tour of duty with robin williams \( acting alongside him in the film rv \) , jojo returned with a song called too little too late it s a power ballad , more or less , building from a quiet verse to a loud , sweeping chorus but instead of crashing guitars , there are airy synthesizers and syntheticsounding strings the whole thing was clearly cooked up in a lab , not a garage nothing else on the high road , jojo s second cd , is as great as that song , which reached no 3 on the pop chart jojo is a teenpop star with an rb singer s voice that means she can outsing much of the competition , but it also means more ballads \( the album s second half is infested with them \) and more notquitecredible lovesick lyrics still , she knows exactly what to do with a good beat in the way you do me , she sounds as hypedup as swizz beatz s track and in anything , she sings a lovely little song over a sample of the 1982 toto hit africa that s classic rock , if you 're a singer of a certain age kelefa sanneh photo \( pg e4 \)
in 2004 , the new york state legislature finally enacted changes to the draconian rockefeller drug laws that imposed long mandatory sentences on major and minor drug dealers the goal of these changes \( later supplemented by further minor reform last year \) was to prevent firsttime nonviolent offenders especially lowlevel dealers and addicts selling to support their drug habits from serving unreasonably lengthy jail sentences the new law , the drug law reform act , reduced penalties , eliminated life sentences and afforded more pleabargaining options , among other things while the changes themselves were less extensive than what many of us had hoped for , it was a good beginning , especially since it gave judges discretion to lower sentences that were unduly harsh for lowlevel , nonviolent offenders no one envisioned that the sentences of drug kingpins would be reduced now the first report that details at least some of the cases resentenced under the new law must force us to reexamine these changes unfortunately , according to the comprehensive report by bridget brennan , new york city s special prosecutor for narcotics , of the 84 drug offenders who applied for resentencing under the new law , only one was a firsttime , lowlevel , nonviolent offender instead , drug kingpins , or major dealers and leaders of drug organizations , received some of the biggest sentence reductions , as did some defendants with felony records , drug suppliers and dealers with large amounts of narcotics and weapons and , sadly , almost no women benefited from the new law why has this happened \? because the new legislation allowed all convicted highlevel drug offenders to apply for resentencing and the majority of those offenders were significant drug dealers or had violated the public trust i presided as a judge in the new york state supreme court on a number of those cases according to the law , all applicants for resentencing were to be returned to their sentencing judge , which makes sense since that judge would know the most about each case but a number of judges , like me , retired , and the cases were sent to other judges as a result , their resentencings were inconsistent and gave rise to some shocking results the new statute itself creates a strong legislative preference , if not a presumption , in favor of resentencing , and this is a problem take alejandro lopez mr lopez was the leader of a large and violent crack cocaine organization that infested the lower east side of new york city for many years he threatened the two lead detectives in his case and their families mr lopez fled to puerto rico but was ultimately returned to my court , where a jury convicted him of the highestlevel felony for possession of drugs and conspiracy i sentenced him to the maximum 331 3 years to life and a 3 million fine \( none of it ever paid \) at a resentencing hearing before another judge , mr lopez was resentenced to only 17 years miguelina gilbert , who had been selling cocaine for at least two years while on duty as a new york state parole officer , was convicted of the highestlevel felony for selling drugs i sentenced her to 15 years to life another judge resentenced her to eight years , and she was released from jail last year a jury convicted luis torres , a leader of a large lower east side cocaine and heroin organization employing 30 managers , of the highestlevel felony for possession of drugs , his fifth felony conviction i sentenced him to 50 years to life and a 1 million fine \( which he has never paid \) he is awaiting resentencing before another judge , and his sentence may well be reduced but the most disturbing news from the report is that fewer defendants are seeking drug treatment as a sentencing option because they now have less incentive to trade shorter prison sentences for long , rigorous treatment programs if that result continues to prove accurate , one of the primary goals of the drug law reform will have failed the report proposes what many of us have long advocated a drug kingpin statute we must separate those minor , nonviolent offenders who do n't deserve unfair sentences from violent drug dealers who deserve every minute of the sentences they received but we also need to establish a procedure that ensures some consistency and rationality in sentencing reform judicial discretion is critical but resentencing should be permitted only in cases that involve insignificant amounts of drugs , no violence , no drug organization , no weapons and no employment of children under 16 the important point is that drug law reform must continue , but in a rational and intelligent manner it must promote fairness for those who deserve it , treat drug kingpins appropriately and encourage drug treatment sadly , the new law that i had so much hope in has succeeded in reducing sentences , but , it appears , primarily for those who should remain incarcerated
if nine consecutive winless games and 15 of 18 are n't bad enough , the national league should be concerned about allstar games in the near future if francisco liriano , jered weaver , zach miner , jon lester and justin verlander replicate their rookie seasons those five pitchers have reached the allstar game break with a combined record of 366 , and the american league initially had not called on any of them to be here for tonight s game yesterday , the league added liriano \( 101 \) to its staff in place of jos \? ontreras , who pitched sunday and , like tom glavine of the nl , would have been unavailable tonight those five rookies , who are between the ages of 22 to 24 , have been terrific liriano has been so good , he has the minnesota twins thinking they can still contend for the al central title verlander \( 104 \) and miner \( 61 \) have been so good , they have helped lead the detroit tigers to the top of that division weaver \( 60 \) has been so good , the los angeles angels traded his older brother lester \( 40 \) , the least experienced of the five , has been so good , he has the red sox thinking 'yes we can' oust the yankees as the al east champions , that is they get a break , kenny rogers \( 113 \) , the al s starting pitcher tonight , said of the nl hitters they get to face me now that s nothing compared to what the guys behind me have they have tremendous stuff rogers , a 41yearold lefthander , was talking about those rookies , not the al pitchers besides liriano , whom manager ozzie guill \? could use tonight they 're impressive , rogers said of verlander and miner i watch what they do and how they attack hitters verlander s got as good stuff as i 've seen in a long time liriano has been unbelievable you hear about young guys and how good they were in the minors , and they get here and find out it s a lot different and a lot harder to be successful but these young guys have an idea of what they 're doing more so than the ones earlier on when these guys get it down consistently , it s going to be unbelievably hard on hitters which is why it behooves the nl to win tonight when it can pick on rogers and most of the pitchers who will follow him in the game at pnc park the al winning streak has been interrupted only by an embarrassing 11inning 77 tie in 2002 , a game played in commissioner bud selig s hometown , milwaukee , in the brandspankingnew park selig worked so feverishly to get when he owned the brewers the outcome was so embarrassing to selig , who took the fall for the managers \( joe torre and bob brenly \) , who misappropriated their pitching staffs , that he worked to spice up future games by creating a link between the allstar game and homefield advantage in the world series in case you 've been asleep the past three julys the team from the league that wins the allstar game gets four home games in the world series , if it goes the maximum seven games the link did n't come from embarrassment alone the fox people wanted to attract viewers to watch the allstar game by promoting its importance if there s one viewer out there who has watched any of the past three games or plans to watch tonight because the winning league gets the world series homefield advantage , please send me an email message at mchass nytimescom include your telephone number so i can call and ask if you 're gullible about other things as well watching liriano and the others would be a better basis for tuning in to the games in the next few years liriano , a 22yearold lefthander , started the season in the twins' bullpen , relieving 12 times , then joined the rotation may 19 and won 9 of 10 starts in those starts , he has compiled a 136 earned run average , given up 36 hits and struck out 70 in 66 innings verlander is second to rogers in victories on the tigers' staff , miner has won six of his seven starts , weaver has won all six of his , and lester has won four while losing none of his six starts liriano is the star of the group , which is why he was summoned from his home in the dominican republic yesterday to join the al team i'm happy for francisco that he s here , said catcher a j pierzynski , one of the horde of chicago white sox players on the al team he deserves to be here with the numbers he s put up and what he s done i told johan santana i never thought i 'd face a guy nastier than you until i faced liriano , he added , referring to the twins' other star pitcher facing liriano and his fellow rookies , pierzynski said , would make it more difficult for the national league to win these games bill giles , the former managing partner of the phillies and the nl s honorary president the past six years , does n't want to hear that kind of talk in an earlier era , his father was a proud president of the league how would warren giles react to an eightgame allstar losing streak \? he would be in the locker room before the game giving a knute rockne speech , which he always used to do , bill giles said he won 19 out of 23 allstar games when he was league president , and i'm a complete failure i'm 05 it seemed obvious what giles should do tonight i'm not going to give a speech , he quickly said i just do n't feel comfortable with it

most comparisons between david wright and jos \? eyes and a wellknown pair of yankees infielders are based on geography and position wright and reyes cannot yet boast the accomplishments of the yankees' derek jeter and alex rodriguez , but yesterday all four shared the honor of being selected as starters for the allstar game on july 11 at pnc park in pittsburgh wright and reyes , both firsttime allstars , headlined a mets contingent that will turn the allstar game into shea stadium west they will be joined in the national league s starting lineup by catcher paul lo duca and center fielder carlos beltr \?

readers respond to bob herbert s nov 6 column ,  vern matheuszik , montreal , quebec , canada when i go to vote , i put an x beside the name of the candidate of my choosing there is only one item on the ballot i put the ballot into a ballot box it is counted by hand my american relatives tell me of several page ballots with a host of questions and candidates our enumeration is done by the government being elected , and all the organization and procedures is done by a commission of the relevant level of government all so simple and voter friendly , and the terror of errant politicians though it also has serious flaws that skew elections , it remains rather simple and more or less effective yours is so complicated at every level that voter apathy and confusion does not surprise me at all start by making the whole system simpler love your articles , and your country ernie kent boyds , md my suggestions 1 make none of the above a required choice in all races 2 if none of the above wins , there must be a new election with different candidates it shouldn t take more than one election for the parties to start understanding the need to field decent candidates jl , pa i don t think the politicians , even with all the recent coverage , realize the level of dissatisfaction and outright anger that has gripped much of the population iraq may be the flash point , but the dissatisfaction runs much deeper than that people feel that the us has sailed off in the wrong direction , and that as voters , they haven t the clout to set things right rebecca adams , owensboro , ky mr herbert , the fact also remains many americans who are eligible to vote simply will not because they feel their vote does not count the leaders of our country should be elected by the people , and all ballots should be , as you said , properly counted lu motley , richmond , va thanks for clarity in a time of murky waters as far as we , the public can see if the republicans stand for anything it is how they obscure reality gene bocknek , andersonville , tenn what the pols never seem to get is how they sow the seeds of destruction , including their own , by their arrogant abuse of power they don t and choose not to see the serious risks to your democracy that they are provoking too bad they don t know history therese , chicago great column as usual so important to get rid of the electoral college ! we should also have a nonpartisan system of drawing districts the current system is riddled with problems dr paul karlsberg , malibu , calif elections in the us are now determined by the golden rule he who has the gold makes the rules when cigarette companies , for example , put up millions of dollars to defeat a proposition that is against their interests , how can we even begin to believe that this is a democracy of the people , by the people , and for the people \? when a us senator has to come up with 50 , 000 a week for every week of his sixyear term to finance a reelection campaign , how can he she not be beholden to his biggest contributors \? and the same for his opponent what ever happened to campaign reform \? the average voter in the us has become disenfranchised i no longer believe that my vote counts larry quinlivan , ormond beach , fla i believe doing away with gerrymandering as it is practiced today is key if the districts had to be rectangles where the width is no more than twice the height or vice versa with allowances for geography state borders , rivers , etc , there would be many more competitive districts if the districts were competitive , the lawmakers would need to reflect the wishes of the citizens of the district mitch wertlieb , burlington , vt thanks so much for your recent column on the desperate need for a change in the voting process in the us too many people who question the tabulating methods and results of the national election in 2000 or the ohio results in 2004 are dismissed as extremists or paranoids , yet there are still a lot of people in florida especially among the elderly jewish community who are flabbergasted that they could ever have voted for pat buchanan , as the results show they did the ridiculous provisions tacked on to qualifications for voting on election day should be obvious to most for what they are transparent efforts by the ruling party to keep power at the expense of democracy the changeover to touchscreen voting in many districts that will leave no paper trail should sound alarms in any democratic society that has already experienced so many contentious elections , yet here they are met with a collective shrug i really don t know what the solutions are , but i am grateful that a respected columnist such as you , writing for the paper of record , had the guts to point out the problem thanks and keep fighting the good fight william warren , puryear , tenn when i voted for the first time this year using the new electronic voting machines in our precinct , i asked the workers if there was a paper backup for my vote no one knew the answer , which i would assume was no when i buy gas at the pump , i pay with my credit card and receive a receipt showing the time , date and location of the purchase , the price per gallon of the fuel , the number of gallons , and the total cost to me , which i can compare with the display on the pump why can voting machines not produce a comparable paper receipt , which the voter can compare with the display on the machine and then deposit in a regular ballot box \? this would mean that the machine would serve as a means of generating a paper ballot , and not as a substitute for one virtually every gas pump in the country has this capability , placed there at no expense to the consumer by the oil company why cannot the maker of electronic voting machines furnish the same simple technology \?
i m going to make an assumption that you would probably like to ask me three questions what does war have to do with art \? what is a combat artist \? and why would the united states marine corps , of all organizations , send fine artists into harm s way \? i ll try to answer these as best i can over the next couple weeks at the same time i hope to provide a glimpse of who i am , both as artist and marine although what i do falls within an established tradition and has an objective journalistic bent , it also has poetic leanings i ve been out in the trenches of the war on terrorism , which means not only witnessing them as an artist with a sketchbook in hand and an eye at the aperture of a camera , but also as a marine putting a rifle to shoulder , making a good sight picture , squeezing off rounds and trying to kill the enemy there s a joke that s a starting point i use to give people a sense of who i am and what i do this particular joke is offensive and racist , so as a good politically correct unitarian \( yes , that s the religion on my dog tags \) i only give the setup and not the punch line there s a zebra that goes to heaven and standing before the pearly gates asks saint peter , i ve got to know , was i a white zebra with black stripes , or a black zebra with white stripes \? i share with many of you a sense of living in gray areas , with legs astride both sides of everything this is rarely a comfortable place to be , but i take solace in carl jung s reassurance that living in the tension of opposites is the healthiest place to be for our unfolding psyches i was recently asked by a journalist , are you an artist who happens to be in the marines , or a marine who just happens to be an artist \? that s a question i try to answer each day , but one i fear will remain perpetually open what i can state with black and white certainty is that i am passionate about what i do and , despite all life s detours , my muse has never deserted me i m selfconscious enough to want to describe what i do as a combat artist for the marine corps in such a way as to appear fashionably humble that would be patently false and more than a few close friends would take me to task about that kind of posturing i have some wonderful qualities , but selfdeprecating humility is not one of them \( james stewart , were he alive , would be horribly miscast playing me a cross between james cagney and jim carrey would probably get the job done \) simply , i know that what i do is unique and that i m very good at it my work has been favorably compared to the images of winslow homer and the reporting of ernie pyle i also know that i m the beneficiary of being the right person at the right place at the right time , and this tempers my flights of egotistical fancy without the war on terrorism my fifteen minutes of fame just wouldn t be before 9 11 i was high up in the running for the fraternal order of the jacks of all trades and masters of none poster child contest i have been blessed by being allowed to do art of a subject marines in combat of such inherent depth and vibrancy that even if i were talentless dolt i d enjoy an astronomically high statistical likelihood of creating something of artistic merit as an artist i am a realist , or to be more precise , a devotee of a school of fine art called naturalism a term coined by emile zola i call it dragnet art just the facts , ma am i m also a romantic of sorts my stock in trade is images and events drenched in the pathos of war , and i am as much participant as observer what is a combat artist \? the answer is deceptively simple an artist who goes to combat this is not unlike a landscape artist going out into the hills of vermont or a figure painter posing a model in the soft north light of a soho loft but the working conditions are markedly different in addition to art supplies , i carry a 9millimeter pistol with a combat load of 60 rounds due to the nature of combat in iraq i also tote an m16 a4 rifle to the field , with 180 rounds i generally do not carry grenades how close do i get to actual combat \? very close i have one minor shrapnel wound and was injured when a humvee i was riding in nosedived into a large ied crater in the dark i have fired my rifle at the enemy in pitched battle all these elements the crushing weight of gear in the heat , the pain of injuries , the adrenaline rush of firefights , the boredom of downtime march alongside a constant vigilance for cultivating ideas and images i am both with and of the marines with them as observer and of them as fellow combatant to do my artwork in the field i carry a small bag it s actually a medical corpsman s combat trauma kit with small sketchbooks , a selection of pens and pencils , a compact watercolor set , film and lots of extra aa batteries i also have two digital and one regular 35mm camera when it s hot and heavy i take pictures when things are quiet i sketch and do small watercolors i give everything a coat of fixative working conditions are not only dangerous , but filthy as well , so i favor spiral sketchbooks with heavy fronts and backs they get shoved in and out of a backpack on a regular basis i take a digital photo of each piece in case there s some unfortunate event where my gear gets lost or destroyed what has war got to do with art \? images of war and warriors have been part of art history since time immemorial for me , particular pieces reverberate with the presence of the first combat artists when i look at the statue from greek antiquity , the dying gaul , i know viscerally that the sculptor witnessed this the dying warrior s posture , wound , thick locks of hair and celtic jewelry shout this fact i think of the warriors i ve sketched the wounded trying to rise , the exhausted collapsing in corners and against walls , st christopher medals displayed against the fabric of flak jackets , awkward battlefield haircuts echoing the gaul s mop of hair , probably shorn by a buddy s knife blade egon schiele , the troubled fin de siecle artist , while in the austrian army during world war i , drew poignant and sensitive portraits of sickly russian pow s \( he himself died from the same spanish influenza pandemic that was ravaging the world towards the end of that war \) goya s series of etchings , the disasters of war , recorded the horrors inflicted on spain by the french in the napoleonic wars rembrandt s night watch captures what would today be a gathering of national guardsmen manet raced to cherbourg in hopes of witnessing the civil war duel between the uss kearsarge and the css alabama , with the resulting painting redefining marine art the francoprussian war still echoes down the halls of western art by virtue of the indelible effect it had on monet , renoir , courbet and pissarro , to just name a few in my next post i ll talk about the marine corps combat art program , and where my combat art can be seen
help is on the way for families and young people on long island who cannot afford to buy a house but make too much to qualify for traditional lowincome housing programs a new grant program for firsttime home buyers is aimed at college graduates , municipal and union employees , hospital workers , professionals and families who would otherwise be priced out of the long island housing market , according to peter elkowitz , the president of the long island housing partnership the partnership , a nonprofit group , will manage the program the program , financed by a 25 million state grant secured by long island s nine state senators , including funds from employers matched by the state , will begin on jan 1 until now , lowincome housing programs have been designed for families and people whose income is less than 80 percent of the long island median , mr elkowitz said but this program has been developed to provide assistance to the working class by raising the eligibility threshold to up to 130 percent of long island s median income , he said using that income level , applicants in nassau and suffolk counties can qualify if they earn up to 82 , 800 for a single person , 94 , 650 for a couple and 118 , 300 for a family of four the program arose from concerns in the business community over the difficulty in recruiting talented young workers to the island , said tom dunham , a spokesman for senator dean g skelos mr dunham said that the state would provide matching funds for a down payment in a threetoone ratio to any company that contributed up to 10 , 000 per employee buying a first home the program will also provide up to 20 , 000 for repairs and renovation none of the money home buyers get through the grants would have to be repaid as long as they comply with the program s rules at a sept 20 news conference , more than a dozen long island companies , including the business software maker ca , northrop grumman and the edo corporation , endorsed the program , and hofstra university pledged 100 , 000 toward homes being bought by its faculty members under the program the second part of the program focuses on smart growth development in which municipalities and developers work together to provide downtown housing firsttime buyers can get up to 25 , 000 toward the down payment for homes there if , for example , a village decides it wants to opt in and rezone part of its downtown for mixed use , it might hire a developer to build six condos above three stores , mr dunham said this state program is an incentive for local governments to pursue smart growth and affordable housing
\( james alder is the football guide for aboutcom \) the indianapolis colts have taken over the top spot in the rankings thanks to an unexpected upset of the chicago bears by the miami dolphins but how long can they keep it \?

it is risky to be a baby in america figures released by the centers for disease control and prevention last year show that children under the age of 4 account for 78 percent of the deaths that stem from child abuse and infants under the age of 1 sustain nearly half of those deaths why \? most of us could never understand the thoughts of someone who would harm a child , but statistics show us that it happens for a range of reasons the mother may be single , or not married to the father there could be a history of substance abuse possibly there may be too many children in the household already or a history of violence the mother may have discovered the pregnancy too late to take action , or either parent may be afflicted with a mental disorder postpartum depression is now recognized as a spectrum of mental illnesses that range from mothers who have a very bad case of the blues and who will recover on their own to those who develop fullblown psychosis and are a danger to their families mary jo codey , the wife of former gov richard j codey , has blazed a trail for sufferers of postpartum depression and led the way for the spotlight to shine on other similarly troubled mothers the actress brooke shields for one if ms shields , with a household full of help and a fabulous life , can feel uninterested in her newborn and worry about her dangerous inability to care for the infant , then what about mothers everywhere whose doctors and insurance companies have never taken their concerns seriously \? every year in new jersey , on average , three babies are illegally abandoned , according to figures from new jersey human services in the past we 've watched network newscasters react with horror as these stories emerge newborns are left in dumpsters , in empty lots or on beaches and delivered alone in bathrooms and dorm rooms we wonder about what the women could have been thinking as they walked away , what their family background is , or why no one ever reached out to help they could be evil people who deserve to be punished , but maybe we do n't know the whole story maybe they belong to the estimated 20 percent of new mothers who are gripped by postpartum depression who simply ca n't think straight and are desperately confused the state department of human services is trying to help , and while its hands are not exactly tied , it has not been given the support needed to do a great job a program called safe haven is a result of the state safe infant protection act passed in 2000 safe haven s slogan is no shame , no blame , no names mothers are allowed to take babies under 30 days old to any hospital or police station and leave them there without fear of prosecution the rules of the program are straightforward , allowing for a small window of time for the mother to reconsider her decision , to get supervised help if that is what it will take for her to overcome her problems , or to go forward with her decision and allow the baby to be placed in foster care or up for adoption although safe haven has had many successful saves in six years , many adults in positions of authority are ambivalent about throwing their support behind it , fearing that they will be seen as encouraging promiscuity a high school nurse called to ask for posters , and told me that she puts them up in the girls' bathroom after i got past being annoyed that this is seen as only a female problem , i realized that school administrators , parents and teachers rarely enter the student restrooms this was probably the only way she could share the information without fear of criticism for just one month last year , the new jersey transit buses in my area bergen county were painted with the program s logo and phone number , \( 877 \) 8392339 while we do n't know her motive , probably one month , one time was far too long in the past to have been of any value to the 15yearold bergenfield girl who left her baby in a trash can in an alley earlier this month information about safe haven needs to be widely shared with the young adult community that could benefit from it certainly none of us want to encourage teenage motherhood , but let s not be the state that allows babies to die while we debate how to prevent it more information about safe haven is available by calling \( 609 \) 2926448 drawing \( drawing by tom bloom \)
on sept 11 , 2001 , i was a lieutenant in the port authority police department after the attack , i became the night commander of the rescue and recovery operation at ground zero , charged with recovering the remains of my fellow officers and the thousands of other victims of the world trade center collapse i and the 30 to 50 officers under my command worked at ground zero six or seven days a week for more than eight months among the twomillionton mountain of shattered concrete , twisted steel and human remains pulling 19 , 000 body parts out of the rubble , we became accustomed to matching arms and legs like pairs of socks when we got home , we still smelled like ground zero , with bittertasting dust and an odor of decay in our hair and on our skin i could n't hug my wife and children until after i had taken several showers after two months on the job , i began to have sinus infections , headaches and eye irritations i was physically and mentally exhausted almost a year later , i developed a nerve weakness in my neck , back and shoulder that left my right arm nearly powerless besides my physical ailments , i felt isolated and disconnected from my family and alienated from my friends now , five years later , i have had to come to grips with the fact that my health and my future are at best uncertain and i am one of the lucky ones every day i speak with men who worked with me at the site i listen to them talk about suicide and i watch them go through the motions of life as shadows of the men they once were just last month , we buried one of those guys , a decorated port authority police officer , a husband and a father , who jumped off the george washington bridge because he could no longer cope with the loss of friends and colleagues , survivor s guilt , alienation and the frustration of being unable to help other workers who were also suffering since the rescue and recovery mission at ground zero ended in may 2002 , i know of at least half a dozen suicides while government officials have recently begun to take notice of the physical ailments suffered by the 9 11 responders and recovery workers , stress disorders and emotional disturbances are still being denied and yet , most doctors will tell you that physical pain is worsened by a public denial of its existence , increasing the isolation , which is the root cause of suicide port authority officers with 25 years of experience tell me that they ca n't recall a time when they have seen so many of their comrades committing or attempting to commit suicide psychiatric disorders often require years of treatment the 52 million that the federal government has budgeted for treatment of physical ailments and the 3 million that it has set aside for mental health treatment is simply not enough , especially when you 're talking about the unknown thousands of people who may have been affected in some way as a result of their work in rescue and recovery at ground zero starting the recovery mission changed us ending it changed us again none of that was ever properly addressed when we left the site many of us were taken to a hotel in new york s rockland county for a debriefing the intention was admirable but the result was woefully inadequate i had completed more than 220 tours of duty , or roughly 3 , 000 hours , at ground zero , and i was interviewed by a volunteer for a private organization who had less than 16 hours of training and who had never even been to the site it does n't matter who is to blame for the past what matters is who is accountable for the present the american medical establishment must acknowledge that responders and recovery workers are suffering physically and mentally and federal , state and local officials must provide free medical and mentalhealth screening for everyone who worked at ground zero , as well as individual and family counseling , if needed furthermore , the federal emergency management agency should create a medical databank for all workers involved in largescale disasters , like 9 11 or hurricane katrina this databank would contain blood and tissue samples taken regularly to establish the physical health of the workers before , during and after their duties it would also provide individual and group baseline statistical data for research purposes and finally , a coalition of federal and state officials must establish an independent commission for responders and recovery workers similar to the 9 11 victim compensation fund , a nofault alternative to tort litigation that provided compensation to individuals who were injured or killed and eliminated almost all lawsuits against public and private entities the site commanders at ground zero fought the first part of the battle the cleanup without a single fatality or lifethreatening injury to a worker the fact remains that we have lost more workers since the ground zero cleanup than during , and that is simply unacceptable we ca n't afford to lose any more
because he is a dedicated awards ninny , the bagger passed up a chance to see my morning jacket , one of his favorite bands ever , to watch apocalypto , mel gibson s take on the end of the world , mayanstyle the film has made none of the usual press rounds neither has the director instead choosing a soft launch on indian reservations and college campuses but disney held screenings in new york and los angeles last night , so look for a big spike in apocalypto chatter today before mr gibson ever ended up on the wrong side of the news cycle , and even after , there was endless interest in the project partly , that was due to do with apocalypto s idiosyncrasies an epic history of a culture that actually preceded history , with all of the dialogue in a mostly dead language mr gibson s last movie , also rendered in a departed language , was one of the most amazing workarounds in hollywood history , taking a movie directly to the people to profound financial and , some would say , spiritual effect in this case , disney is hoping that the potential audience ignores mr gibson s boozeaddled rants and responds to what he puts on the screen in this retelling of mayan civilization as regular readers know , the bagger is not one to fix the reviewer s gimlet eye on a film , but he can safely say that this movie will be tough to ignore , both in terms of commercial and hardware potential regardless of what one thinks of mr gibson s religious values and the apocalypse is a very catholic meme as anyone who has seen the trailer can tell you , apocalypto is a remarkable thing to stare at yes , it wears its bloody heart several of them , in fact on its sleeve , but in terms of creating an alternative universe and populating it with characters the viewer cares about , mr gibson clearly knows what he is doing the rivers of blood that movie travels on will offend some fox s roger friedman hated it but others are going to be huge fans the bagger , who always seems to be in the tank for the last movie he saw , has to admit he found that the twohourandfifteen minute movie went by with heart there s that word again pounding velocity and like a lot of good movies this year , language proves no barrier to telling stories that is not to say that older film folks , a huge part of the academy , may not find the violence stomachchurning , but there s plenty there for people who like a little story with their blood it s a classic narrative sort of like a humanpowered french connection , with a chase scene that just keeps climbing then again , perhaps the bagger was impressed because he is only capable of running the length of his body the awards upshot \? even though mr gibson has done much to offend academy members , apocalypto is one pyramid scheme that will have legs it is a lavish spectacle with great costumes and eternal human themes kind of like dreamgirls , come to think of it , except that conflicts are settled with poison spears instead of show tunes not to leave anybody in unbearable suspense , after the screening , the bagger did dash out to catch the last hour of my morning jacket s set at roseland it rocked nicely , thank you , and the bagger responded with a trifecta of unfortunate rock mannerisms the white boy overbite , the dude nod and the pitchfork salute he managed to avoid an air guitar solo , a testament to his sobriety and personal restraint

and therefore that the stuff we think we know now must also be wrong you gave an aesthetic answer , but i think theres also a practical answer the value of a scientific theory is its usefulness in making predictions thus while einstein proved that newtons laws of motion are wrong , they still provide excellent predictions of what moving objects will do in almost all the circumstances most of us are likely to experience if youre driving in a car at 30 miles an hour and your daughter pokes herself out of the sun roof and throws a ball ahead of you at 10 miles an hour relative to you and her , the ball will really appear to be moving at 40 miles an hour to a fixed observer until slowed down by wind resistance you wouldnt really see a problem until you were driving at 130 , 000 miles per second and your daughter threw the ball at a speed of 70 , 000 miles per second then special relativity kicks in and the speed of the ball is less than the speed of light in our ordinary earthbound dogwalking lives were always even unconsciously testing our knowledge of science by making predictions of what will happen next the problems come when we push our imaginations out of our experiential lives into situations where we cant make our own observations , dont make our own predictions , and cant test them tom bodett , dummerston , vt on another night we could have bumped into each other in that pasture where you walk your dogs i suffer a similar disorder what i called compulsive cosmology in a piece i did last week for bob edwards show on xm radio \( read or listen at bodettcom \) it must be that kind of summer thank you for putting background to my meager intellectual flareups there are nights out there in the field ive believed the dog understands as much of it as i do
a pair of ducks sat on the muddy shore of the neck river in madison last tuesday , oblivious to the environmental destruction taking place just under their feet vegetation in the salty marshes near long island sound is dying off , putting plants and animals at risk and causing the shore to erode scientists call it sudden wetland dieback , but they are not sure how it started and what they can do to end it to be sure , the problem is still relatively small , and it takes an expert to notice it the marshes at the neck river looked perfectly serene last week a family of ospreys had built a nest on a wooden post in the middle of the grass seagulls rested on a dock birds called to each other there were at least a half dozen different songs in the air none sounded like complaints but there it was , on the far side of the river from an old boat dock the dieback stretching from the water s edge a few feet onto land , it looked like male pattern baldness in reverse the land near the shore was bare , but higher up it was filled with grass and other plants these are very important areas where we 're seeing vegetation lost , said ron rozsa , a coastal ecologist for the connecticut department of environmental protection the problem is that various marine organisms depend on the cordgrass near the shore for shelter and sustenance small shrimp and fish and certain kinds of insects live there bigger fish , in turn , eat them without the cordgrass , those animals go away or die meanwhile , where grasses have ceased to grow , the soil begins to collapse , putting even more of the marsh in danger mr rozsa said there are about 13 , 000 acres of salty and partly salty marshes in connecticut he has recorded dieback from old lyme to as far west as milford he said he thought the phenomenon began in 1999 and it is not just occurring in connecticut scientists have noticed bare wetlands throughout new england , and even near orient point , on long island a similar effect was recorded in a handful of southern states , including louisiana , georgia and texas scientists in louisiana have linked it to a fungus , but connecticut is still testing to determine what causes the grass by the shore to die , mr rozsa said so far , scientists have just been floating theories , including blaming flying dust from sudan susan c adamowicz , an estuary scientist with the united states fish and wildlife service in maine , has worked to pool information about dieback in different states , but she said it was still disparate and incomplete there is no money to fully document it by taking lowaltitude aerial photographs , for instance and there is no organized plan to track it , just a few scientists with increasing concerns they held a conference on the problem this past may and keep in touch through an email group but some worry that they are facing too big a danger for halfmeasures it s not thousands of acres yet , dr adamowicz said , but it s scary because we do n't know what it is or how to stop it photo danger alert bare shore at the neck river signals a phenomenon scientists consider a peril to salt marsh life \( photo by thomas mcdonald for the new york times \)

on april 1 , dr john tuckman , of new york , wrote to the public editor to question the wisdom of that day s article on a neck artery treatment the reader s message was sent to the reporter , barnaby feder , whose response provides an interesting insight into the reporting process behind a medicaldevice article  april 1 to the public editor i refer to the article by mr feder in the april 1 edition , page a11 study finds mental gains in neck artery treatment as an academic scientist i find this article a disgrace and one not expected in the nytimes if it were not in the nyt one would suppose that it had been planted by a public relations firm in the employ of the stent maker mr feder gives hope to future patients based on the results from an investigation which were not yet published and were to be presented by an investigator to a conference on a future date \( april 2 \) reports to conferences are not peered reviewed and what mr feder reports from dr raabe is that the latter indicates that his results from 30 patients \( presumably without control subjects \) are statistically significant the implication is that dr raabe s intervention is simple , without danger and will cost less than present procedures none of these are true and clearly one and or two conclusions are possible this was a superficial piece of reporting on an extremely important subject and or it was a public relations effort for the stent maker the latter coming from a reporter of the nytimes seems unlikely thus , i assume the first supposition is the reason for what is almost an unethical article i think it appropriate that mr feder follow up the article with an amplification of its weakness or further evidence to support its conclusions sincerely , john tuckman , md bronx va hosptial spinal cord injury research unit mt sinai medical school  april 3 dr tuckman , your letter to the public editor regarding saturday s article on the results of research into the cognitive impact of carotid stenting has been forward to me for a response first , thanks for taking the trouble to get in touch while it is unclear from your tone whether you simply wanted a chance to express your anger or you were genuinely curious about why the article ran the way it did , i will assume the latter and respond accordingly the subject came on my radar not through a device company but from representatives of the scientific society hosting the meeting in toronto , who singled this out as one of the most important research reports on the agenda for the meeting such press contacts from scientific societies are a routine source of news leads for us , and not just from medical societies the american chemical society , for example , goes to great effort each year to draw reporters attention to the papers at its meeting it believes will be of broad public interest in this case , as in others , i then phoned doctors i know to be involved in this type of procedure to ask them whether this presentation would be one they would view as an important highlight of the meeting i also asked what the findings , which i had been sent on an embargoed basis and described generally to them , might mean i knew from talking to the editor handling the story that the space would be limited so i would not have room to describe many of the side issues with this technology \( which i had previously reported at length in other stories \) as it was , some of the more specific results of the study were cut from the story i filed however , we did make sure to get high up that the was preliminary work that needed to be confirmed by other studies i was also careful to point out the small number of patients involved and the hazards of the procedure i never indicated it was safer than surgery , only less invasive a point that no one disputes nor did i suggest that it was cheaper , although in fact it usually is when hospitalization costs and lost days of work are considered as to your concern about the commercial angles , no company was mentioned because dr raabe asssured me that the study was done without financial support from any of the carotid stent vendors \( there are more than one , contrary to the implication of your note \) fyi , these were guidant devices the larger issue here is whether the coverage is superficial as a doctor , you know that full treatment of any new procedure like this requires reports far longer than any standard news story some of my stories on carotid stenting in the business section have been twice as long and even then they have run only after editors cut substantial amounts of what i submitted much of the research we present is peerreviewed but there are often reports of interest that have not yet gone through that somewhat lengthy process and yet are still newsworthy , both within the professional world and to the general reader wall street constantly makes big bets based on analysts reports about such work we would be failing many of our readers if we never wrote about subjects until they had been peer reviewed what we can do and did in this case is make sure that we tell readers when a reported study is small and needs further confirmation and we can as we did in this case run a relatively short item deep inside the paper rather than a longer one on a front page so that we don t overemphasize its importance in closing , i d like to contrast this story with the one we ran in today s paper by larry altman on bladder reconstruction , based on a published and presumably peerreviewed journal article \( which was covered elsewhere today as well , including a far larger spread in the wall street journal \) this approach makes perfect sense to me in fields on the frontiers of research where actual products or procedures are many years , at best , from entering practice but carotid stenting is already in the market , growing rapidly and a subject of intense interest to consumers and healthcare providers in this atmosphere , work like that of dr raabe s team deserves to be appropriately summarized sooner rather than later best wishes , barnaby feder ps if i wanted to promote the procedure , i would have mentioned that many of the insurers , including medicare , who do not routinely cover it for asymptomatic patients , will do so for such patients who are part of clinical studies one such patient , who was delighted with her results , emailed me to criticize me for not making this opportunity clear to readers
to the editor in his essay on uncle tom s cabin \( cabin fever , oct 22 \) , henry louis gates jr is right to stress the sexual charge of the novel , but wrong when he writes that for that reason the book s illustrators had always been careful to depict tom as sweet , gray haired and bespectacled when eva is in his lap in fact the old man came late on the scene the book s original illustrator was hammatt billings , and his conception of the delicate white girl s embrace of the slave in the first editions of the book shows the large , broadchested , powerfully made man \( as stowe described tom \) as young , handsomely dressed , with black hair , without glasses and clearly virile it is only in later editions , in the era of jim crow , that other illustrators separated the pair in such scenes , and tom grew into the balding , woollyheaded , shuffling grandpa we remember illustrations are often overlooked by critics in discussions of fiction , but some of the violent reaction of the south to the newly published novel must have stemmed from billings s truetotheauthor image of biracial intimacy depicted in a story reeking of miscegenation james f o'gorman windham , me the writer is mcneil professor emeritus of the history of american art , wellesley college to the editor gates s essay gives the impression that stowe s novel has been languishing , vilified and unread , since the 1960 s nothing could be farther from the truth since 1980 , uncle tom s cabin has reentered the literary canon , and it is now a staple of american literature courses everywhere multiple new editions all treat it with respect and admiration even sparknotes , which exists only because the book is widely read , takes the novel seriously this turnaround is the work of many scholars , none of whom gates mentions from jane tompkins s 1981 essay to joan hedrick s pulitzer prizewinning biography to new essay collections edited by elizabeth ammons , eric sundquist , mason lowance , ellen westbrook and r c de prospo , to the explosion of scholarship by gregg camfield , philip fisher , gregg crane , ann douglas , myra jehlen , gillian brown , marianne noble , jean fagan yellin and many others , scholars have recognized the novel s complexity , artistry and historical impact as well as its still controversial representations of race gates s new edition is welcome , not for its pathbreaking recognition of stowe s achievement but as the latest addition to the scholarship on this wellrecognized , firmly established american classic laura h korobkin boston the writer is associate professor of english at boston university
