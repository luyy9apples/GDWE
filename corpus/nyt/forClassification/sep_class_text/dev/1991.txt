washington , nov 20 closing a wrenching twoyear battle that has destroyed his political career , senator alan cranston rose before his colleagues on the senate floor today and with deep remorse in my heart , accepted a rebuke from the senate select committee on ethics but insisted that his conduct was no different from that of most lawmakers in a twohour proceeding that seemed to put the senate itself on trial , mr cranston , a california democrat , sat in silence as senator howell heflin recited the panel s conclusion that mr cranston s behavior was improper and repugnant in raising nearly 1 million from charles h keating jr , the savings and loan executive , at the same time that the senator was intervening with federal regulators to save mr keating s californiabased lincoln federal savings and loan association from collapse mr heflin , an alabama democrat , was chairman of the ethics committee s inquiry a riveting halfhour speech speaking from his desk in a halfhour speech that riveted his colleagues , senator cranston portrayed himself as being unduly singled out and warned them you are in jeopardy if you ever do anything at any time to help a contributor no matter how worthy the cause , no matter how proper the need for help and no matter how proper the help you render i stand before you as an illustration of that jeopardy mr cranston s address provoked an outburst from senator warren b rudman , the vice chairman of the ethics committee , who leaped to his feet and said , i must say regretfully that after accepting this committee s recommendation , what i have heard is a statement that i can only describe as arrogant , unrepentant and a smear on this institution seeming barely to contain his rage , mr rudman , a new hampshire republican , said he had favored a senate vote on mr cranston and asserted , everybody does n't do it the action today stemmed from a political deal by the committee of three democrats and three republicans that allowed the full senate membership to avoid a floor vote on fundraising tactics that are widely practiced by the members , albeit not in the extreme form used by mr cranston the absence of a floor vote also spared mr cranston from the weight of repudiation by the full senate , and there were indications that the committee went easy because of the 77yearold senator s illness with prostate cancer the committee s decisions broke a partisan deadlock that lasted for months republicans on the committee had pressed members to accept the recommendation of its special counsel , robert s bennett , to urge the full senate to vote to punish mr cranston the democrats gave in to the republicans in allowing the matter to come to the senate floor for debate , even though there was no vote under the constitution , the senate could have taken the harsher step of expelling or censuring a member for disorderly behavior each chamber can choose any words it likes in rebuking a member durenberger case recalled under the senate s procedures , there is no distinction between a reprimand or a denunciation , the word that was applied by the full senate last year to senator dave durenberger , a minnesota republican , for improper financial dealings specifically , the committee said that it does hereby strongly and severely reprimand senator alan cranston it also said that the senator s poor health and decision to retire were extenuating circumstances that were taken into account in a case that has come to symbolize the public s distrust of elected officials , the committee s resolution asserted that senator cranston s improper conduct deserves the fullest , strongest and most severe sanction which the committee has the authority to impose although he said he accepted the findings , mr cranston , a 23year senate veteran who was once a leading force in liberal politics and who unsuccessfully sought the democratic presidential nomination in 1980 , was no less combative in defending himself then when the inquiry opened two years ago it was a sad denouement to the political career of mr cranston , the former secondranking senator and a senior member of the banking committee who is battling cancer and plans to retire when his fourth term ends next year four other senators involved among the senators who looked on at mr cranston today were the four who were also investigated by the ethics panel for their actions on behalf of mr keating dennis deconcini and john mccain of arizona , john glenn of ohio and donald w riegle jr of michigan all but mr mccain are democrats although the panel delivered a written scolding of the four senators last february , it described their actions as less severe than mr cranston s and not improper enough to warrant a hearing before the full senate in its resolution the committee concluded that senator cranston violated no law or specific senate rule , acted without corrupt intent and did not gain personal financial benefit from his ties to mr keating but it found that mr cranston , for years regarded as one of the senate s most prodigious fundraisers , engaged in an impermissible pattern of conduct in which fund raising and official activities were substantially linked and that violated established norms of behavior in the senate a 26 billion collapse
los angeles , june 1 the ethnic politics of the future are germinating here in a race for a state assembly seat from a crowded immigrant neighborhood that some politicians call the new ellis island fifteen candidates , some representing tiny immigrant constituencies , are maneuvering for votes in the 46th district in central los angeles , but as in the state at large , the heavily registered white voters are expected to determine the outcome political analysts say this immigrant point of entry , where nearly 50 languages can be heard among the schoolchildren , offers a lesson in the gap between population numbers and political power i contend that , like it or not , my district is what all of california is going to look like by the year 2025 , if not before , said michael roos , the incumbent , whose resignation touched off this special election , scheduled for tuesday diversity of candidates it seems like every faction in the community has fielded a candidate , said mr roos , a democrat the gays have a candidate , the jews have a candidate , the filipinos have a candidate , the latinos have a candidate , the koreans have a candidate , the japanese have a candidate but while the district has a population of more than 360 , 000 people , mostly immigrants and their children , it has only 63 , 000 registered voters , and fewer than 15 , 000 of them are expected to vote whites , though they account for only 15 percent of the residents , make up at least 60 percent of the electorate in this district thus , political analysts predict that even though california s exploding hispanic and asian populations are expected to put minority groups in the majority by the turn of the century , their political power will continue to lag behind their numbers for some time every time i read an article about how something dramatic is going to change , i want to laugh , said james hayes , a political consultant who said he was advising 12 of the candidates here he pointed out that even though the state s minority population is growing rapidly , the electorate remains overwhelmingly white although minorities already make up 43 percent of the state s population , 80 percent of the voters in last november s election were white but as in the state at large , the white population of the 46th district is aging , while the mostly hispanic immigrant population , many of whom are not yet citizens , is young and growing one democratic candidate , john emerson , the chief deputy city attorney , said , this is a district with one of the highest percentages of children living in it , whereas when the votes are tallied , more than 45 percent of those voting are over 65 years of age another candidate , michael cacciotti , a democrat who is a former aide to mr roos , said this demographic picture was vivid as he campaigned from door to door i can see the dying population of anglos and europeans , by themselves or with their spouse , in their 80 s and 90 s , he said in another room , 20 kids are running down the hallway where latino families have moved in with three white candidates and one homosexual candidate expected by most political experts to divide the white votes , some minority candidates are taking heart from predictions that the seat could be won with no more than 2 , 000 votes victory seems possible if there were bloc voting by the 1 , 800 registered ethnic japanese , the 1 , 200 chinese , the 2 , 500 koreans , the 300 vietnamese , the 9 , 000 mexican and central americans , the 4 , 000 filipinos , the 1 , 000 armenians or the 1 , 500 blacks political consultant s advice but mr hayes said he had counseled his clients that the route to victory in california s emerging multicultural politics was an appeal to a broad base beyond an ethnic constituency he noted that several black and japanese politicians have had success without strong racial or ethnic power bases city councilman michael woo won his seat in a district that is only 5 percent asian , and mayor tom bradley , who is black , has served for 17 years in a city where the black population now stands at 13 percent although none of the 46th district s minority candidates may win , they are preparing the politics of the future in a community that includes what a demographic expert , leo estrada , termed staging areas for immigrant arrivals similar to new york s lower east side early in the century like that neighborhood , he said , this is a district that offers lowcost housing and lowpaying jobs , from which the various immigrant groups will eventually move on the 46th district runs from the affluent silver lake community in the north to a highcrime area along pico boulevard in the south , and includes most of koreatown and slivers of chinatown and the armenian community of east hollywood , as well as a little salvador and a miniature manila most strikingly , said mr estrada , the ethnic groups here commingle more intensely than in almost any other place in the country , with nationalities shifting from building to building along a street i know a place along rampart street that turned from white to mexican to filipino all within about a year and a half , said mr estrada , who is a professor at the university of california at los angeles you 'll find some villages reemerging in the form of an apartment building in which a half to twothirds of all apartments are being rented by people from the same village back home crowded along a few blocks of santa monica boulevard are the panderia salvadorena , taslikian s armenian pastry , lutong bahay filipino food , spicy bbq thai and chinese food and the tavlian middle eastern , greek and italian grocery sri lankan tamils and mixtec indians from mexico s oaxaca province share shady neighborhoods with sufi and vietnamese buddhist temples at the hoover street elementary school , students speak thai , spanish , portuguese , filipino , laotian , korean , khmer , italian , hindi , hawaiian , vietnamese , amharic , cantonese and other chinese dialects only 30 percent speak english well at the hobart boulevard elementary school , said mr cacciotti , pta meetings are like a threering circus the principal gets up there and talks and most of the people ca n't understand him , he said then one vice principal gets up and talks spanish then the other gets up and talks korean as with the state and the city at large , demographers say , new immigrants are lured here by the climate , the economy , the geographical location and the presence of others from their countries who came before them in the 70 s and 80 s , everyone in the world that was going to get killed got out and came to la , said a demographer who asked that his name not be used because he is a consultant to several of the candidates they had these little tiny communities that were already here , he said then climate , location , size , infrastructure and rents as a percentage of income if you were to create all that somewhere on the globe it would show up here in the 46th assembly district photo the 46th state assembly district in los angeles has been called the new ellis island

washington , feb 27 following are excerpts from the statement today of the senate select committee on ethics concluding its hearings involving senators alan cranston , dennis deconcini , john glenn , john mccain and donald w riegle jr introduction the united states senate select committee on ethics initiated preliminary inquiries into allegations of misconduct by senator alan cranston , senator dennis deconcini , senator john glenn , senator john mccain , and senator donald riegle , in connection with their actions on behalf of charles h keating jr and lincoln savings and loan association in the course of its preliminary inquiries , the committee held hearings over a twomonth period which began nov 15 , 1990 while the committee has concluded that none of the senators' actions when considered without regard to any contribution or other benefit , violated any law or senate rule , each act must also be examined against more general ethical standards to determine if there was any impropriety because of any relation between those actions and campaign contributions or other benefits provided by mr keating and his associates based on all the available evidence , the committee has concluded that in the case of each of the five senators , all campaign contributions from mr keating and his associates under the federal election campaign act were within the established legal limits , and were properly reported similarly , from the available evidence , the committee concludes that the senator s solicitation or acceptance of all contributions made in these cases to state party organizations , political action committees , and voter registration organizations were , standing alone , not illegal or improper nor did any such contribution constitute a personal gift to any senator with respect to each senator , there remains the question of whether any actions taken by the senator , standing alone or in combination with contributions or other benefits , constitutes improper conduct or an appearance of impropriety the committee has examined the specific conduct of each senator and has determined that under the totality of the circumstances the conduct of each of the five senators reflected poor judgment the conduct of some of the senators constituted at least an appearance of improper conduct and the conduct of one senator may have been improper recommendations constituent service as noted in the course of the committee s hearings , the senate has no specific written standards embodied in the senate rules respecting contact or intervention with federal executive or independent regulatory agency officials the committee believes that the senate should adopt written standards in this area a specific proposal should be developed either by the senate rules committee or by a bipartisan senate task force created for this purpose campaign reform the inquiries in these five cases have shown the obvious ethical dilemmas inherent in the current system by which political activities are financed the committee notes that over 80 percent of the funds at issue were not disclosed funds raised by candidates for senate or house campaigns under the federal election campaign act rather , such funds were undisclosed , unregulated funds raised for independent expenditures , political party soft money , and a nonfederal political action committee any campaign finance reform measure will have to address these mechanisms for political activities , as well as campaign fund raising and expenditures directly by candidates , in order to deal meaningfully and effectively with the issues presented in these cases the committee urges the leadership and members of both the senate and the house to work together in a bipartisan manner to address the urgent need for comprehensive campaign finance reform the reputation and honor of our institutions demand it panel findings senator cranston the committee finds that there is substantial credible evidence that provides substantial cause for the committee to conclude that , in connection with his conduct relating to charles h keating jr , and lincoln savings and loan association , senator cranston may have engaged in improper conduct that may reflect upon the senate , as contemplated in section 2 \( a \) \( 1 \) of s res 338 , 88th congress , as amended to wit , there is substantial credible evidence that provides substantial cause for the committee to conclude , based upon the totality of the circumstances , including but not limited to the following conduct or activities , that senator cranston engaged in an impermissible pattern of conduct in which fund raising and official activities were substantially linked \( 1 \) from april 1987 through april 1989 , senator cranston personally , or through senate staff , contacted the federal home loan bank board on behalf of lincoln , during a period when senator cranston was soliciting and accepting substantial contributions from mr keating on at least four occasions , these contacts were made in close connection with the solicitation or receipt of contributions these four occasions are as follows
albany , april 14 because progress must be measured from a starting point , state leaders asserted today that they had made headway in budget talks their evidence was that they were talking at all but gov mario m cuomo suggested that such incremental progress might be far too slow to provide any relief to new york city , which is facing a budget gap that has grown to about 300 million with less than three months remaining in its fiscal year the state s budget is two weeks overdue , and the three state leaders mr cuomo , assembly speaker mel miller and the senate majority leader , ralph j marino remain far apart on how to combine tax increases and spending cuts to fill a projected budget gap of more than 6 billion because the state cannot make aid payments to local governments until it passes its budget , the delay has contributed to the worsening of the city s finances and the likelihood that it will have to borrow heavily this month we now , because of our failure , are damaging new york city , mr cuomo said after meeting with mr miller and mr marino for nearly 90 minutes negotiations between the three drew to a virtual standstill on friday , when mr marino threatened to have the senate pass a budget that did not have the others' approval mr cuomo dismissed that as a political gesture and summoned the legislative leaders back to albany today , a day earlier than they usually arrive although none of the leaders reported specific progress , mr miller called today s session fruitful , and mr marino said it was good they were at an impasse friday , said mr cuomo that s what ralph did when he sent up that political flag we had to get the flag down and the talks resumed , and we 've managed to do that
the biggest question left by the clean air act of 1990 president bush s grandest legislative achievement so far was whether its promise would be thwarted by bureaucratic infighting , regulatory paralysis and endless litigation that s been the sad fate of other ambitious laws , including the original clean air act of 1970 although the jury is still out on the new act , legislators already complain that the president s council on competitiveness , headed by vice president quayle , is becoming a haven for businesses seeking to avoid costly investment in antipollution equipment in one case , the council pressured the environmental protection agency to ease regulations on old coalfired power plants but there s promising news as well in the last two weeks the epa has announced two major agreements aimed at cleaning the air in america s dirtiest cities and above the grand canyon in both cases , agreement was reached only after the agency gathered traditionally hostile interests in one room and invited a consensus using a process called regulatory negotiation or , in washingtonspeak , regneg by whatever name , it s an immensely valuable procedure that ought to be used far more often than it is for one thing , the parties to a consensus are less likely to challenge government regulations at some later date , not least because they helped write them that means fewer lawsuits and fewer attempts to subvert the purposes of the act through backdoor intervention with the office of management and budget or mr quayle one agreement involved a crucial provision of the 1990 act requiring oil refiners to produce a cleanerburning gasoline to reduce smog in the nation s nine dirtiest cities , including los angeles and new york the act was far from clear on how that goal was to be reached , so the epa summoned representatives from 30 different interest groups , including environmentalists and oil company executives , for two months of negotiations the result was a compromise under which gasoline sold in 1995 will be 15 percent cleaner than it is now industry will be allowed to average the 15 percent reduction in ozoneforming hydrocarbons so that some gallons come in higher , some lower that gives the companies flexibility to accommodate differences among refineries but it s wholly consistent with the intent of the act the second set of negotiations involved the haze that fouls the grand canyon the haze comes from sulfur dioxide emissions from the navajo generating station , a giant coalburning plant 15 miles northeast of the canyon environmentalists and the epa wanted a 90 percent reduction the plant s owners , though clearly in violation of the law , wanted none mr quayle s council recommended a 70 percent cut the owners eventually agreed to the original 90 percent target but only after the environmentalists proved to the company that , by using a complex averaging scheme , the company could meet the target at lower cost than it thought possible nobody said that carrying out the act would be easy and regulations have yet to be written for controversial sections of the law covering toxic chemicals and acid rain yet the odds of success went up when the epa established a simple principle negotiation now beats litigation later
back in the summer of 1974 , when he was 32 years old and the long railroad tunnel underneath riverside park was uninhabited , john joseph kovacs and another man moved into a couple of cinderblock bunkers in the southern end yesterday afternoon mr kovacs packed his belongings in three cardboard boxes and moved out he had been urged to leave by amtrak , which bought the abandoned tunnel and put a new track through it this winter the railroad warned mr kovacs and his neighbors , a scattered assortment of squatters who sometimes call themselves the mole people , or the tenants of the tunnel , that on april 7 passenger trains would begin rumbling past their living rooms at 60 miles an hour so mr kovacs went searching above ground and happened on another pioneering opportunity he was the first person chosen for a new program intended to transform the homeless into homesteaders after making his home for more than 16 years , a third of his life , in a manhattan railroad tunnel , mr kovacs left yesterday to become an organic farmer in upstate new york the air will be better up there none of those diesel fumes , mr kovacs said yesterday as he waited for his ride to a farm near syracuse he was born in brooklyn and lived most of his 48 years in new york , but he said he was not going to miss the city it s gotten worse over the years , he explained a lot of the restaurants i knew are closed rents have gone up plus there s too many people walking the streets you turn around and there s always someone in your face with a cup asking for money i tell them to get a job panhandling s a little too low for me i would never do something that degrading mr kovacs said he had been on the streets for most of his life he told of a father who died when he was 5 , a mother who drank and attacked him with a butcher knife , a youth spent in fostercare institutions until he ran way at age 16 and started sleeping by the hudson river at 72d street he said he started smoking at age 9 and had a drinking problem by his teens in his 20 s , he said , he spent six years in jail for car theft and other crimes that he did not want to elaborate he recalled times when he had his own apartment and job , but he kept ending up back on the steets or back along the hudson 'i became a bum' i just made a few mistakes , he said i became a bum you lose your job , you lose your friends , nobody really wants to be bothered with you i was sleeping on park benches , subways , movie houses then joe and i found the tunnel joe , now 44 , still lives in a cinderblock bunker next door to mr kovacs and asked that his name not be used because his children think he lives in a madison avenue apartment that he occasionally borrows and uses as a mailing address he was not there to see mr kovacs off yesterday we 're not close , let s put it that way , mr kovacs said although the two men had lived side by side for 16 years , mr kovacs said the sentence i 'll miss you did not cross either man s lips when he told joe that he would be moving the only thing joe said was that he was going to move into my house , mr kovacs said the only thing i said was that i 'd leave him the key mr kovacs had the largest house in his neighborhood , a bunker 30 feet long and 14 feet wide that is one of various buildings in the twoandahalfmile tunnel once used by railroad workers he scoured the west side s refuse to outfit it with rugs , a bed , sofa , chairs , coffee table , kitchen cabinets , bookcases and stuffed animals debts are paid he strung christmas decorations across the ceiling and covered one wall with pictures from cat fancy magazine he kept 15 cats and one dog named mama in his home , and much of his welfare check and his energy went for their upkeep he collected food for them and himself every day from the garbage at a school on the west side mr kovacs said he had paid off all his debts and still had 151 to his name yesterday his three cardboard boxes contained clothes , flashlights , kerosene lanterns , a radio , a hatchet , a firstaid kit , a bible and a boy scout handbook his last day in the tunnel began in typical fashion at 5 am a cigarette , a walk in riverside park with his dog and two shots of vodka he went to visit a friend in the neighborhood whose apartment he used for his mail and his weekly shower , and then he went down to city hall to meet officials from the earthwise education center , a nonprofit group based at an organic farm 40 miles northeast of syracuse 'i ai n't gonna miss anything' mr kovacs heard of their new privately financed program to train homeless people to become organic farmers , and he was the first person they selected on an earlier recruiting trip they were planning to give him three weeks' training , then place him on an organic farm where he would get room and board plus 521 a hour they drove mr kovacs back to his tunnel , where he put his cardboard boxes in a shopping cart and wheeled them along the tracks to the nearest gate he refused to be sentimental when he went out into the sunlight i ai n't gonna miss anything , he said i got no feelings for this place or the people in it i want to get away from these people the only reason i came in here was to find a place that was safer than a park bench where i could go to sleep without worrying about somebody stealing my shoes he said he had occasionally worked on farms in his younger years and had no doubt he would like the work upstate nor did he think that alcohol would be a problem cigarettes i ca n't quit , he said , but i can do without the bottle when i want to the only reason i drank down here was that i was lonely and bored i do n't drink when i'm working , and i'm ready to work i'm ready to get my hands dirty he wheeled his boxes up to riverside drive and 83d street , loaded them into the organic farmer s van , and turned around with an enormous smile on his face i feel good i ai n't coming back , he said he talked about how good the country air would be for his dog , and he wondered if there would be some other advantages , too it s been five years since anybody gave me a good kiss , he said maybe i 'll meet some nice young country lady and settle down and have kids i'm going to be 49 the 23d of this month it s time i got back on my feet photo john joseph kovacs , who moved into the railroad tunnel underneath riverside park in 1974 as one of the original mole people , moving out yesterday to become an organic farmer in upstate new york \( marilynn k yee the new york times \) \( pg b2 \)

with an emotional depth and a comic flair worthy of the cinema s best short subjects , the bird and the mouse tells of a friendly rodent who teaches a baby robin to fly , later to be saved by the young avian from a ravenous hawk although done in simple black and white , the animated cartoon evidences creativity and pathos in fact , it was the product of john ramirez , chris chavez and stewart pera students in david master s animation course at john a rowland high school , a public school in rowland heights , calif in a twist on dr timothy leary s famous dictum , many american schools like rowland are inviting students to turn on , tune in and drop by the subject is the communications media , and after decades of ambivalence about their opportunities and perils , educators now appear to see such study as an avenue to teaching the basic skills like reading and writing in some high schools , students are learning to create animated cartoons as a way of promoting writing skills and analytical abilities elsewhere , children as young as 7 are making videotaped public service announcements , as a way of learning the differences between types of messages and how they are communicated whatever techniques they employ , these courses and others throughout the nation are designed to teach young people media literacy the capability of understanding the codes and conventions of television and other communications media numbers growing no government organization keeps tabs on how many media literacy programs exist in the united states , and none of the organizations that have struggled for two decades to bring these programs to the schools can say how many there are but education experts believe the number is growing , largely because communications equipment has been flooding schools and teachers are being forced to figure out not only how to use it , but how to make students aware of its power a june 1990 survey by quality education data , an educationresearch company in denver , found that 43 percent of the1 , 262 school districts surveyed \( of the 14 , 698 school districts in the united states \) used interactive videodisk equipment , more than double the percentage using such technology the previous year fortyfive percent of the districts had cable television in at least seven schools half the districts screened cable news network

university of michigan and heads the commission on media for the national council of teachers of english enough council members are teaching about the media that the group asked her to prepare a guidebook to help teachers use media analysis as a classroom aid most elementary and secondary level media courses tend to be ad hoc , developed to address a specific local need or opportunity

ethan allen inc the 60yearold connecticut company that is one of the nation s bestknown furniture producers is being propelled into new product diversity and marketing clout by an unusual chief executive who arrived in the united states in 1965 as a political refugee the executive , farooq kathwari , a native of kashmir , is showing american business leaders how to take a tired company and give it a completely new spin in 1989 mr kathwari , now 46 years old , led a group of company managers , dealers and other investors in a 385 million leveraged buyout of ethan allen from interco inc , a st louis conglomerate since then , by applying new disciplines , motivating efforts and marketing skills , he has imbued the company , based in danbury , with new life sixty percent of our individual items were created in the last two years , said the softspoken executive with evident pride we started that process six years ago , when our research showed us that consumers no longer were buying earlyamerican furniture as their predominant style our sales were not growing , and we decided to diversify into other furniture styles and accessory products attention to quality in addition to its traditional line , the company s diversified offerings now include modern american and country french furniture and a new kitchen collection the effort to expand the ethan allen line required massive internal changes and new attitudes among dealers two plants were closed , and others were retooled for the new styles factories were added to produce bedspreads , pillows , mirrors and clocks quality control , which mr kathwari said was long a culture at ethan allen , was further improved , he said , and the old 300truck delivery fleet was replaced by larger more fuelefficient vehicles company executives who believed that big changes were vital stayed , including clint walker , the former president , who has remained as the head of quality control for wood furniture the biggest transformation was among the several hundred ethan allen dealers , who had been prone to add products not made by the company mr kathwari put his foot down on that practice , and while there was some noise from the dealers , he said , none left the fold the company also set up a school at its headquarters for all the sales personnel , who are now called designers , in the 300some dealerships as many as 1 , 000 troop in annually for four and a half days of seminars and briefings at ethan allen college they also compete for trophies in a design and sales contest in this way , the people closer to the consumer are motivated by what we are doing and can go back and further motivate the consumer , mr kathwari said the groups gather in the danbury headquarters and in the adjacent flagship store and stay at the nearby ethan allen inn , which is also owned by the company although ethan allen s chief may have rattled his dealers with his allornothing dictum , he nevertheless endeared himself to them by removing their need to stock backup inventory and to deliver goods to their customers ethan allen sells only through its dealers , who need only have samples on the floor the company takes the furniture directly to the customers , delivering wood furniture in 3 weeks and upholstered goods in 8 to 10 weeks running for his life mr kathwari s connection to ethan allen began in 1973 , when he and nathan ancell , then the company s chairman , agreed to start a joint venture , kea international , to develop nonfurniture products , like floor coverings , lighting and decorative accessories but only eight years earlier mr kathwari was running for his life as a 20yearold political science graduate of kashmir university , he was arrested when his political activities offended the kashmiri government he escaped from his captors , finding his way to the united states he lived in brooklyn , ny , and one of his first jobs was with a printing company i printed envelopes , he recalled six months later i was running the place soon after , mr kathwari was surprised , when his grandfather in kashmir sent him a collection of candlesticks and other household accessories worth 15 , 000 scrambling for space to put the items , mr kathwari offered them to any dealers on consignment he had to do his own auditing of inventory , he recalled , because not all dealers liked to tell him what was sold by that time , he had a job at bear stearns , the stock brokerage , and he was working toward a master s degree in business at new york university as well as starting his own upholstery fabric importing company in 1968 he moved to new court securities corporation , now known as rothschild incorporated , where he became a vice president involved in administration and in the company s bond portfolio when he left new court in 1973 , mr kathwari made his deal with mr ancell , a founder of ethan allen their venture , kea international , was merged into ethan allen in 1980 , and mr kathwari moved up in quick steps vice president that year , senior vice president in 1981 , executive vice president in 1983 , president in 1985 and chairman and chief executive in 1988 mr kathwari s rapid advancement was probably due to my national background , he said in kashmir there s a saying that nature is your teacher with only a four million population , rugged natural environment and political turmoil , there is a tight family structure in the country , and you have to be responsible for your family i think that upbringing has given me my motivation and my endurance and ethan allen will probably never be the same again sales are expected to reach about 650 million this year , mr kathwari said , and profits are up , too , despite the recession an appropriate homily is posted prominently in ethan allen s headquarters it reads , what man altereth not for the better , time altereth for the worse photo farooq kathwari , the new chief executive of ethan allen inc , at its danbury store the company began creating new items after research showed consumers were no longer buying colonial furniture as their major style , he said \( dave labianca for the new york times

economists once thought that by using computers and largescale econometric models , they could develop tools for more accurate forecasting but such hopes have given way to the more humble belief that the best they can do is to state what they think are the odds on various possible developments \( scenarios in the current economic jargon \) the problem of macroeconomic forecasting has been made even more difficult by the complex interactions between national economies and the world economy prof rudiger dornbusch of the massachusetts institute of technology says the world economy is now in the midst of a significant slowdown , with outright recession in the anglosaxon countries and minimal growth in europe , except germany only asia is keeping up the momentum of world growth , but even there japan s growth rate is slipping below 4 percent the most important questions about the world economy , he says , focus on the united states and germany will the united states come out of the recession in the next few months , and can germany resolve its inflation problem before a sharp slowdown sets in and topples the rest of continental europe \? he lays out three plausible scenarios optimistic the american recession touched bottom in the apriljune quarter and the recovery is starting germany cuts its interest rates this summer and europe enters an upswing by late fall \( 30 percent probability \) pessimistic the united states recession is far more durable than the consensus of economists expects , because taxes are too high , debt keeps consumers and businesses from buying durable goods and the federal reserve is too slow and provides inadequate stimulus to turn the economy around germany s inflation proves a hard nut to crack there s a serious chance of world recession by fall and no turnaround before the middle of next year \( 20 percent probability \) central scenario the united states recovery is about ready to start germany , preoccupied with inflation , lets europe slip to the edge of recession the disparity between a recovering united states economy and a declining europe puts upward pressure on the dollar , complicating europe s inflation problem and slowing american growth down the road \( 50 percent probability \) these three add up to 100 percent , implying that no other outcome is possible for different combinations of united states recession and recovery , professor dornbusch sets up a grid of four probabilities deep recessionweak recovery , 5 percent shallow recessionweak recovery , 50 percent deep recessionstrong recovery , 15 percent shallow recessionstrong recovery , 30 percent most other economists' forecasts fall within the shallow recessionweak recovery scenario thus , blue chip economic indicators' june 1991 survey of 52 economists finds more than 8 out of 10 predicting an end to the recession by august \( with nearly 4 out of 10 saying it ended in april or may \) and the blue chip consensus forecasts a 1992 growth rate of real gnp of just 27 percent , a recovery so weak as to mean virtually no change in unemployment the top 10 of the blue chip forecasters average real economic growth of 35 percent next year , and the bottom 10 average 19 percent growth none of the 52 surveyed see either a boom or a crash in '92 the world economy appears weak but not hopeless in the eyes of its beholders the conference board , drawing on indexes compiled by columbia university s center for international business cycle research , finds that the global business cycle continues to show widespread but moderate recessionary trends the board s composite leading index for 11 major industrial countries is declining at an annual rate of 3 percent but that rate of decline represents a one percentage point improvement from three months ago you have to look carefully , but there are a few signs of optimism scattered among the data , says edgar r fiedler , vice president and economic counselor of the board the indications of a turnaround are not strong enough to suggest that a recovery in the global business cycle is around the corner , but they do relieve the gloom somewhat for the developing countries , the world bank offers three scenarios a baseline scenario that is moderately better than the lost decade of the 1980 s a lowcase scenario , with turbulence in international trading and financial systems and a much higher level of real interest rates , and a highcase scenario , in which challenges are successfully met , reducing uncertainty and spurring further integration of the global economy the plausible range of growth estimates for the developing countries in the 1990 s is therefore wide from less than 3 percent a year to well over 6 percent , says the world bank report on global economic prospects this range translates into a 40 percent difference in the level of real income by the year 2000 that s a big spread , like those in other probabilistic forecasting scenarios given the economic , financial and political interests of most forecasters , their collective bias is toward minimizing anxiety and maximizing hope but there are the constraints of the facts the real payoff in forecasting is to be right drawing
the bank of america , the nation s secondlargest bank after citibank , said yesterday that it was cutting its prime lending rate to 8 3 4 percent from 9 percent the cut by the huge san franciscobased bank , which takes effect today , comes less than three weeks after many banks lowered their rates from 9 1 2 percent , and less than two months after all of the nation s largest banks , almost in unison , cut their prime rates to 9 1 2 percent from 10 percent the prime rate , which once applied only to business loans , now has a wider impact home equity lines of credit , creditcard interest rates , mortgage rates and even some traditional installment loans like auto loans have increasingly been tied to the prime a reduction therefore could be felt by a broad spectrum of borrowers frank mccormick , senior economist at the bank of america , said the bank s rate decision was in large part a reaction to a general decline recently in the bank s cost of funds money it borrows and relends to customers at higher interest rates but the timing , mr mccormick said , was dictated by comments made yesterday by the federal reserve board chairman , alan greenspan , in testimony to congress chairman greenspan left the door open to a further decline in shortterm interest rates , he said in fact , mr greenspan told the senate banking committee that the federal reserve will need to remain alert to possible contingencies and will have to continue to respond flexibly to information about evolving trends many market analysts interpreted those words to mean that the fed would like to see lower interest rates , which might push the rates for treasury bills and certificates of deposit down further still , those factors would affect all banks , and as of close of business yesterday , none of the other large banks had taken a similar step bank of america announced its cut after the banks on the east coast had closed p kenneth ackbarali , the senior economist for first interstate bancorp in los angeles , expects , however , that by early next week most major banks , including his own , will have followed suit he noted that certificates of deposit , a good indicator of the cost of money to banks , have been trading at around 655 percent , and that the federal funds rate , which banks charge each other on overnight loans , has been dropping we 're surprised at the timing of bank of america s move , but there is definitely overwhelming pressure on the banks to lower the rate , mr ackbarali said and if we all do and if consumers think the gulf war will be short , as they seem to lately then it will have a stimulating impact on the economy other views but robert giordano , the director of economic research at goldman , sachs company in new york , thinks the opposite what bank of america is doing is aggressively going after other banks' market share , because most of the other major banks are under too much earnings pressure and too many capital constraints to follow suit , he said robert brusca , chief economist at nikkko securities international inc in new york , told the associated press that he expected banks would be slow to follow suit in fact , he said , this time i would expect that until the fed really signals another move , we could have a split prime rate
the warm feeling that shawn abner used to experience when he thought about playing baseball at shea stadium has worn off it was never very warm anyway when abner went hitless in three times at bat during a 63 loss to the mets last night , it was just another game and just another ballpark not long ago , they were ready to carve abner s initials in the outfield grass at shea the mets had made him the first player selected in the 1984 amateur draft after he batted 572 as a high school senior with a mighty arm , a lethal bat and good speed , he was apparently destined for greatness the public is still waiting for abner to bloom into an average major leaguer greatness \? it may not occur he never played a game for the mets and was traded to the san diego padres in december 1986 as part of an eightplayer deal that brought kevin mcreynolds to new york what happened in new york is none of my business , said abner , when asked about the trade they got mcreynolds in left field that s what happened in new york finally gets a chance last night s psuedoreturn was forgettable and foggy for abner as he extended his slump to 0 for 10 in a game that was twice delayed by fog and eventually called after six and a half innings abner has 2 hits in his last 22 times at bat , and his average has fallen from 314 to 228 at least i know when i go 0 for 4 , i 'll be back , said abner , a career 220 hitter it s the first time they 're putting me out there and giving me a chance abner has an explanation for why , as a former no 1 pick , he is hardly a feared player maybe , abner intimates , he should not have been drafted first after all the draft is a joke , abner said being drafted no 1 is overrated it does n't matter where you 're drafted if you can play in the major leagues , they 're going to find you though he still carries around the tag of no 1 draft pick like an unwanted suitcase , abner is confident about finding a niche with the padres manager greg riddoch placed abner in center this spring and hopes the move is permanent he has to completely fail not to be there , riddoch said this year , we 're telling our young players 'it s open go play' youth works in abner s favor it seems as if he has been around longer than exploding scoreboards , but abner is only 24 and has seven years of pro baseball behind him that s a lot of learning check his age , riddoch said this kid has n't had a chance to find success of failure and he s 24 we have guys in single a and double a who are 21 and 22 , said joe mcilvaine , the padres' general manager seven years after he was drafted , he s 24 the padres are satisfied with abner s defense and believe he can play 130 games in the outfield they want him to shorten his stroke and be cautious on offense because his aggressiveness wastes atbats batting coach merv rettenmund said abner could alleviate trouble with inside pitches by simply taking more abner longs to be a 300 hitter , but it may be out of his reach he s never had a tremendous amount of success at this level , said rettenmund until he does , he s going to try more for result than approach an irony of abner s career is the arrival of mcilvaine , who was the mets' assistant vice president and the man who drafted abner no 1 mcilvaine watched abner toss and turn in the minors for three years and then traded him to san diego now mcilvaine and abner are reunited the draft is a crapshoot , mcilvaine said he s gotten to the major leagues he s still got the potential , if he hits , to be a complete player photo fogshrouded shea stadium during 1hour38minute delay that began in the sixth with mets ahead , 42 \( vic delucia the new york times \)
washington , nov 9 the results of last week s elections exposed weaknesses in president bush s still emerging campaign and highlighted divisions among his advisers over how to handle mr bush s unofficial candidacy on the broadest level , white house strategists say they still envision a plan that blames congress for the country s ills and portrays president bush as concerned about domestic issues but the specifics are another matter after the republicans' embarrassing defeat in the pennsylvania senate race , administration officials and party leaders said privately that the immediate reaction was little more than a frenzy of fingerpointing we have no quarterback , said one administration official we 're a football team trying to keep our heads down in a political operation that has not taken formal shape and has lost key leaders since mr bush s victory in 1988 , two main factions have emerged one group , which includes john h sununu , the white house chief of staff , and key members of the cabinet , advise mr bush to remain above the fray until he officially announces his candidacy early next year the other , more activist group , which includes vice president dan quayle and jack f kemp , the secretary of housing and urban development , argue that mr bush should take the offensive now contrast to 1988 mr bush s advisers acknowledge that the campaign at this point lacks a coordinated top management team like the aggressive duo of lee atwater and james a baker 3d that carried mr bush to victory in 1988 the white house , for its part , is abiding by its original campaign timetable , which calls for mr bush to delay formal announcement of his candidacy until after he has delivered the state of the union address in january his biggest strength is being president , the governmental things he s done , said charles black , one of mr bush s top political strategists he will still spend the majority of his time being president even though the speculation over who will run his campaign is common in political circles , the president is resisting assembling anything that looks like a formal organization so far , the campaign planners include the longtime bush advisers mr black , commerce secretary robert mosbacher , the polltaker robert teeter and clayton k yeutter , chairman of the republican national committee none of the top advisers has titles yet , though several have begun meeting weekly to start assembling what one described as the shortterm strategy that will be the groundwork for the campaign but most are so conscious of mr bush s desire to play down talk of a real campaign that they will either not speak for the record or not talk at all others expected to play major roles in the campaign are craig fuller , an aide to mr bush when he was vice president and who is expected to plan the convention frederic v malek , the businessman who briefly ran the 1988 convention roger ailes , a media consultant james h lake , a veteran reaganbush strategist rich bond , the political director for bush in 1988 mary matalin , the republican national committee s chief of staff richard g darman , the budget director nicholas f brady , the secretary of the treasury ron kaufman , a political director , and mr sununu , as well as other members of the white house inner circle awkward and abrupt mr bush has been testing campaign themes that emphasize domestic issues for several weeks now , but his statements have often been awkward , as they were in rome on friday when he came out against higher tax cuts the abrupt , panicky appearance of the decision on election day to cancel mr bush s planned trip to asia pointed up the organizational work that remains to be done so far , the two main factions within the white house have not agreed on a coherent and quickwitted response to the issues that are taking center stage especially healthcare policy and the economy the bush administration is either focused inside washington or outside the united states , one administration official said the problem is we need to focus on the united states missing two strategists both sides admit that this year s campaign lacks the sort of top management team that ran the campaign in 1988 , when lee atwater and mr baker had mr bush s ear and had aggressive political instincts but mr atwater died this spring , and mr baker is not expected to play a key organizational role because of his duties as secretary of state most analysts agree that , together , they supplied most of the political muscle for the 1988 campaign mr sununu was a valuable asset in the new hampshire primary in 1988 , but some bush insiders doubt his grasp of national politics ask me how many times today i thought of lee , said one republican strategist on a particularly bad day last week mr teeter , a veteran polltaker and longtime friend of mr baker and mr bush , is counted on in some quarters to emerge as a central figure who could help fill the vacuum left by mr atwater and mr baker but he and mr sununu have clashed in the past , and it is unclear if the uneasy peace between them can last through a tough campaign 'a year is a very long time' for the moment , mr teeter is trying to do his part for the president by playing down the longterm impact of the vote in pennsylvania , in which dick thornburgh , the former attorney general , was a surprise loser to harris wofford , the interim senator who is a democrat offyear elections are very bad predictors , he said there is a lot of historical evidence of that they certainly have some implications on issues and the sense of the country , but a year is a very long time away by and large , however , many of the republicans who are spending the most time denouncing congress , keeping an eye on announced and unannounced democratic candidates and thinking of 1992 , say mr bush still has time to smooth out the rough spots let me tell you about these early wakeup calls , said senator phil gramm of texas , who heads the national republican senatorial campaign committee they 're almost always wrong numbers ultimately when an election is lost , people are always trying to find someone to blame , he said if we had won , you would have had six or seven different groups and people claiming credit
washington , july 13 secretary of state james a baker 3d and the soviet foreign minister , aleksandr a bessmertnykh , made progress today toward completing the treaty to reduce longrange nuclear missiles , but by tonight were still unable to announce agreement on the accord we 're making progress on all of the major issues that are outstanding , the national security adviser , brent scowcroft , said in an interview broadcast on the cable news network mr scowcroft , who was in kennebunkport , me , with president bush , added , while we have not come to closure yet , there is still reason for encouragement officials said mr baker and mr bessmertnykh were narrowing their differences , but still trying to reach a compromise on what has emerged now as the main sticking point between them that is the question of how much of the reduction will be accomplished by merely removing some warheads from existing multiwarhead missiles this issue is crucial since in a crisis , if one side were to suddenly break the treaty , it would be able to restore warheads to the missiles quickly major progress reported the american side presented the soviets with a compromise proposal on this issue , which by late today they had come a long way toward meeting the officials said the other two key outstanding issues how to define new types of missiles and how to monitor each other s missile tests appear to be largely resolved , with the soviets getting more of what they wanted on new types and the americans what they wanted on the other issue mr bush will meet with mr gorbachev in london on july 17 , after the annual meeting of leaders from the world s seven major industrialized democracies , and it is still possible that the treaty could be wrapped up then if the last sticking points cannot be worked out in washington a planned two or threeday americansoviet summit meeting in moscow this summer will be held only if the treaty is basically completed and ready for signing mr bessmertnykh , who was accompanied by the soviet chief of staff , gen mikhail moiseyev , met with mr baker again in the afternoon , and the two metthis evening as well the soviet foreign minister postponed his departure from washington from tonight until sunday morning the talks , now in their third day , were supposed to have been completed friday , and since thursday neither mr bush nor mr bessmertnykh has spoken with reporters the accord , to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals by some 30 percent , has been in negotiation since 1982 the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty , known as start , requires both sides to reduce the number of their bomber aircraft and sea and landbased missile delivery systems to 1 , 600 each and to reduce the number of warheads carried by those different delivery systems to 6 , 000 per side but 3 , 000 american nuclear gravity bombs , shortrange missiles carried by bombers and sealaunched cruise missiles are excluded from the treaty limits for a variety of political and military reasons negotiated during the past decade this also applies to roughly 1 , 000 similar soviet warhead systems as a result , the treaty over all would bring the total number of soviet longrange nuclear warheads down from 11 , 000 to 7 , 000 and the united states warheads from 12 , 000 to 9 , 000 unparalleled in history but those numbers do not tell the whole story the treaty is unparalleled in the history of sovietamerican strategic arms control in several ways to begin with , unlike the two strategic arms limitation treaties which only set ceilings on longrange ballistic missiles , heavy bombers and cruise missiles the start treaty requires substantial , equitable and verifiable reductions in the nuclear warhead arsenals of both superpowers second , for the first time the treaty would permit both sides to inspect the very weapons aimed against it by the other side unlike the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty signed in 1987 , which allowed each side to monitor the other s destruction of its missiles , the new treaty would create an ongoing verification system by which each side would be able to monitor through onsite inspections the other side s missiles and missile factories third , the treaty would for the first time force the soviet union to scale back its large advantage in heavy landbased missiles , which are widely considered in the pentagon to be the most threatening nuclear weapons because they can destroy a large number of targets quickly in particular , the treaty requires a 50percent reduction in the soviet arsenal of huge ss18 missiles , which have long concerned american experts us sees an advantage generally speaking , american officials insist that the treaty as a whole is weighted to their advantage precisely because it requires moscow to reduce far more of these longrange ballistic missiles , where they have an advantage , and requires less reduction in areas of american advantage , such as bombers and cruise missiles indeed , much of the difficulty in completing the treaty this week can be attributed to the soviet military s unhappiness at this asymmetry moscow s desire to keep existing multiwarhead missiles but remove some of the warheads from them was an attempt to try to recover some of that lost advantage mr gorbachev initially agreed to these asymmetrical cuts in 1986 and 1987 as part of his campaign to convince the west that the soviet union was no longer a threat on friday , mr baker offered mr bessmertnykh a comprehensive approach for resolving all three major outstanding issues holding up the treaty but mr baker s proposal , which encompassed elemets of both the american and soviet bottomline positions , was predicated on soviet acceptance of all elements of the package otherwise none would be valid on monitoring each other s missile tests the issue known as data denial the soviet side has apparently agreed to an american proposal that the two nations exchange taperecorded data from each of the other s missile tests to insure compliance with the treaty moscow initially wanted to exchange data on only some tests on new types of missiles , the united states was demanding that for a missile to be declared a new type , it would have to have at least a 30 percent change in its payload capacity the soviets wanted only 15 percent , and they appear to have struck a deal for around 20 percent bargaining on new missiles under the treaty , neither side can test a missile with more warheads than it is attributed to have unless it is declared a new type moscow had wanted a very narrow definition of a new type of missile , so that with a minor modification in design , they could more easily add spare capacity to an existing missile and then test it but the issue of leaving spare warhead capacity in existing missiles was still a problem today many missiles now carry 10 warheads both sides would prefer to reduce their number of warheads without having to build new missiles designed , for example , for only three warheads to accomplish this , missiles able to carry 10 warheads will be downloaded to carry fewer , and under the treaty will be counted as though they carry fewer even though they will have spare capacity , which , in the event one side or the other wanted to break out of the treaty , could be uploaded to carry 10 warheads again the soviets want to download close to 1 , 700 missile spaces so they will have more spare capacity while the americans are insisting on no more than 1 , 000 photo viktor komplektov , right , the soviet ambassador , being greeted by a protocol officer before the meeting between secretary of state james a baker 3d and foreign minister aleksandr a bessmertnykh of the soviet union they were unable to complete the treaty reducing longrange nuclear missiles , but did agree on how to define new types of missiles and how to monitor the other s missile tests \( paul hosefros the new york

dayton , tex here on the verdant coastal lowlands of texas , a littleknown company is pursuing one of the most risky , politically sensitive and potentially lucrative goals in american business today a permit from federal and state authorities to build a huge hazardouswaste disposal site beneath the rice fields , 30 miles from houston , hunter environmental services inc wants to bury toxic waste in mammoth caverns carved into a salt dome more than 60 million years old the subterranean salt formation is so large that were it above ground it would dwarf mount everest the length of each proposed wastestorage cavern would be taller than the empire state building regulatory clearance for a large project like hunter s is the holy grail of the 25billionayear waste services industry only a couple of such permits have been granted in the last few years , none for saltdome sites hunter s story is partly that of an extraordinary corporate gamble , of a company that two years ago had a consulting business with 2 , 000 employees and annual revenues of more than 100 million yet sold everything to pursue the saltdome project enormous potential reward the reward for hunter could be enormous analysts place the value of the permit the company is seeking at perhaps 500 million , given the size of the proposed project and its potential profitability by contrast , the total value of hunter s shares today is roughly 50 million if you make it , the payoff on this project is very , very large indeed , said j anthony forstmann , a professional investor and a hunter backer the hunter case also deals with an issue crucial to the national debate over disposing of hazardous waste in a way that does not damage the environment or pose health risks to people living near disposal sites and finally it is a story of the rough and tumble of local politics as seen in a costly campaign to try to influence state politicians and government officials the company has spent nearly 5 million in two years on lawyers and lobbyists alone , and the costs are mounting nowhere is the toxicwaste issue more sharply drawn than in texas because of its big oil and chemical industries , the state is by far the biggest producer of toxic waste , generating more than 20 percent of the annual nationwide total of 270 million tons most states have become more reluctant to allow new toxic waste sites in recent years , and several have tried to curb imports of outofstate waste such attitudes are scarcely surprising given the toxicwaste industry s history of problems , both unforeseen and ignored indeed , the environmental protection agency is concerned that the not in my backyard policies adopted by states raise the prospect of sharp conflicts between states siting new disposal facilities is one of the most difficult challenges politically , said william k reilly , the epa administrator but for the sake of the environment , we must face up to siting decisions each state must be proportionately responsible for assuring safe , highquality disposal capacity the politics a sudden change in the climate the political climate in texas , a state with a reputation for giving business a free hand , shifted abruptly in november when ann richards , a democrat , was elected governor , promising a 'new texas with tougher environmental standards until then , hunter seemed well on its way toward getting its permit it had begun the process more than two years earlier , preparing roomfuls of technical documents , meeting with citizens' groups in high school gymnasiums , and lobbying politicians and officials now , the governor s office is occupied by a person who twice during her campaign stumped in dayton , attacking the hunter plan she has harshly criticized the texas water commission , which would grant the state permits , saying the commission is too lenient , and she has pledged that things will change under her stewardship no more will hazardouswaste facilities be rammed through the permit process over the objections of local communities , she declared hunter s permit application is set to go before the commission this summer in hearings that amount to a public trial testimony and deliberations will probably take months the hunter proposal has also been caught up in a legislative fight in austin , the state capital the governor is pushing legislation that would result in a moratorium on toxicwaste permits for a year or so until strict rules are developed the company s lobbyists have pressed hard to change phrasing in the bill so that hunter s permit hearing could go ahead unless the epa or the water commission decides that new rules tailored for salt domes are required hunter succeeded in getting the wording of the bill changed in the state senate , and the house will make its decision soon hunter has hired a small army of wellconnected lobbyists , lawyers and image polishers they include robert s strauss , former chairman of the democratic national committee , and his austin law firm of akin , gump , strauss , hauer feld lee biggart , the former chairman of the water commission , and hill knowlton inc , one of the nation s largest public relations firms
chapel hill , nc , march 26 the message scratched on a barroom wall , a few 3point shots from franklin street and not far from the university of north carolina campus , had originally been directed toward saddam hussein but now that a trip to the final four has become a more pressing concern for the north carolina tar heels than the leader of iraq , the message somewhat precise directions , actually has been updated near the end of an unprecedented month of march in which both the tar heels and nearby duke have advanced to the semifinals of the national collegiate athletic association basketball tournament , the iraqi leader s name has been crossed out and the blue devils have become an equally contemptible replacement ninemile buffer zone in the highoctane relationship between these atlantic coast conference neighbors , each side will bring a strongerthanusual interest to the other s semifinal game this weekend at the hoosier dome in indianapolis for each group , whose campuses are separated by nine miles and whose uniforms are differentiated by shades of blue , the only thing worse than their team losing would be to see the other school winning after 185 basketball games between the two universities since the 191920 season , familiarity has bred friendship , jealousy , respect , pettiness , creativity in the stands and a higher level of play dean smith , the north carolina coach , laughed when he was asked if the two schools , which have made a combined total of 19 final four appearances , need each other the way spouses sometimes do there are quite a few intermarriages , said smith , whose team will face kansas on saturday i 'll bet they 're having a good time admitted dislike the interest is strong enough that as the duke players were shooting before their midwest regional championship game with st john s at the pontiac silverdome , some of them stopped to watch the end of north carolina s victory over temple in the eastern regional on the color scoreboard above and beyond the basket i do n't particularly like carolina too much , said bobby hurley , duke s sophomore point guard so it was n't like i was happy hurley said he did not have any such feelings when he arrived at duke before last season he had been recruited by north carolina , but when hurley sought assurances from smith s staff that another point guard would not be recruited , he said he was told that the tar heels' continued interest in kenny anderson would make such an assurance impossible would hurley have gone to carolina if the answer to his question had been yes \? they would have been on my list , hurley said it s not like i'm a lottery they just were n't able to give me a commitment hurley s negative feelings began to develop in his first game against the tar heels , in the lightblue surroundings of the dean e smith center , when he committed 10 turnovers in a 19point duke loss senior s sympathy greg koubek , a duke senior who has spent much of his career on the bench , understands hurley s dislike since that frustrating initial meeting with king rice , the north carolina point guard but after experiencing so much personal frustration in his own career , koubek could identify with the tar heel seniors who had to watch the blue devils reach the final four in the three years before this when koubek was asked about north carolina s presence in the final four this weekend , he thought about rice and rick fox you feel good for them , said koubek , whose team will meet nevadalas vegas on saturday they really deserve to be going to the final four but i do n't think i 'd feel as good for them if we were n't in the same position it s kind of selfish when the blue devils were beaten by unlv by 30 points in the championship game last april , pete chilcutt , then a carolina junior , was in front of a television set i really enjoyed that game , chilcutt said as new groups of students arrive on each campus late every summer , every chance meeting here or in durham holds the potential of creating new feelings or aggravating old ones north carolina fans will now be able to open the wound of the tar heels' recent 22point victory over duke in the acc championship game to go along with , for instance , the 1974 overtime tar heel victory in old carmichael auditorium , a game in which carolina trailed by 8 points with 17 seconds to go in regulation time in addition to two victories over the tar heels in the 199091 regular season , duke fans can call upon the 18foot turnaround jump shot by gene banks in the final second of regulation time , which led to a 6665 duke victory over the 198182 north carolina team , which later won the national championship they can mention the tripleovertime victory in 1968 over the tar heel group that reached the ncaa final later that month but lost to ucla and the duke fans can also remember one of their finest hours , the 1984 game with north carolina that took place just after their crudeness in cameron indoor stadium had been criticized in a letter from terry sanford , duke s president at the time , a letter that was signed uncle terry a 'crazy' title matchup when the tar heels came to durham that year , the duke students wore halos made of aluminum foil and held up a banner that read , a hearty welcome to dean smith when a tar heel player stood at the foul line , a lone duke student held a sign that read , please miss and when an official made an unpopular decision , the response in the stands was this we beg to differ we beg to differ but none of these memories would be able to match a national championship meeting that would be crazy if it happens , chilcutt said it s pretty crazy right now

hal willner , the record producer , sits in the den of his new york apartment on avenue b in the east village , watching television and listening to music at the same time his den is set up specifically for these pursuits a couch takes up one wall of the long , narrow room , the tv a goodly portion of the opposite wall two enormous stereo speakers are hung from the ceiling and tilted toward the center of the couch mr willner likes to sit right in that vortex of blaring sound and technicolor image engulfed in music , close enough to the tv to be swallowed by it at the moment , the set is tuned , volume down , to a network broadcast of fatal attraction , while the stereo plays one of mr willner s latest projects , a tribute to the late charles mingus tentatively scheduled for release by sony music in january , the album , weird nightmare , features different musicians' interpretations of works by the earthy and innovative jazz composer at the moment , keith richards and charlie watts of the rolling stones are playing a version of the mingus song oh lord do n't let them drop that atomic bomb on me as mr richards s lovely guitar lead rises and falls , glenn close rants and raves with soundless fury across the tv screen charles mingus , the rolling stones , fatal attraction a carnival of contrasts weird juxtapositions and absurd contexts are the core of mr willner s esthetic the records he produces involve a collision of styles and sensibilities on his latest release , another hand \( elektra musician \) , the new album by david sanborn , mainstream meets the avantgarde as the jazz saxophonist remakes the velvet underground s jesus and a theme from the 60 s scifi tv show one step beyond william burroughs s 1990 album dead city radio had the beat author reading his works backed by the nbc symphony orchestra in 1987 marianne faithfull s strange weather recast the former 60 s icon as a cabaretnoir diva singing classics like boulevard of broken dreams think about an old variety show that s how i hear music , says the 35yearold mr willner , turning up the volume on the television to watch the haagendazs scene i get very bored very quickly i'm waiting for someone to come out and spin plates although none of mr willner s projects has yet to be a commercial hit , his body of work proves him to be one of the most original and conceptually ambitious producers in the music industry today his albums do n't fit into the prescribed formats and formulas of most popular music they instead break the rules mr willner s tributes take the esthetic a step further by bringing revolutionary composers into contact with a new generation of musicians and stylists the mingus record is actually the fifth in a series that began in 1981 with a tribute to nino rota , who scored many of federico fellini s films mr willner followed with tributes to thelonious monk and kurt weill in 1988 he produced stay awake , in which performers like tom waits , the replacements and sinead o'connor did versions of songs from walt disney animated films i admire his pioneer spirit , says the guitarist terry adams , whose band nrbq contributed to stay awake and who also plays on mr sanborn s album his work really shows a love of music i think he loves music first , more than he loves the job for another hand , mr willner has created an entirely new backdrop for mr sanborn a surrealist cafe society amid spacey guitar , grumbling bass and somber rhythms , mr sanborn s sax floats like a lounge lizard caught outside time we tried to make it sound like you 're tuning into some strange radio station playing my music but in a different way , says mr sanborn hal s got this great network in his mind of these odd connections he 'll find that seemingly safe situation and then throw a land mine into it to make it interesting he s a pretty twisted guy mr willner was raised in philadelphia , where his father owned a delicatessen by the time he was 14 or 15 , his interests ranged from the ed sullivan show to radio shows like fireside theater to late60 s rock like the beatles and captain beefheart when i was a kid it was equal parts television , films , music , he says since i did n't want to perform , it all became one big fantasy world everything mixed there was this radio station in philadelphia that would play the byrds in the afternoon , and at 6 o'clock they would get harder with led zeppelin around 10 you 'd start hearing beefheart at midnight they would play old orson welles radio shows at 2 you 'd start hearing ornette coleman and it made total sense to me that formed my taste , those few years mr willner moved to new york at the age of 18 , in 1974 , to attend new york university they had a program called university without walls , he says in one semester i would have , like , business law contracts , piano , a philosophy course on death , and shortstory writing while in school he began working as a gofer for a producer named joel dorn , who introduced him to musicians like leon redbone and rahsaan roland kirk after earning a degree , mr willner worked at odd jobs in the music industry and spent time as a cabdriver while trying to raise money to produce his own projects in 1980 he landed a job as music coordinator on saturday night live a year later his selffinanced first album , the nino rota tribute , was released on hannibal records these days , in addition to producing albums , he continues to work at saturday night live his job entails selecting prerecorded backing music for sketches , like a film score composer who does n't compose he also spent two years as music producer for the nbc series night music with mr sanborn mr willner s current projects include a sixcd compilation based on 1 , 000 hours of lenny bruce s private tapes he will record kurt weill s seven deadly sins in prague with marianne faithfull , and he will soon finish mixing the mingus tribute i think right now music has to become communistic , mr willner says you get these great creative minds together and they 're going to really leap at something out of those marriages you 'll get an incredible child photo hal willner at his east village homefrom david sanborn to mingus \( sara krulwich the new york times \)
tatou the era of smokefogged manhattan supper clubs where uptown blues musicians sang their woes is all but a memory , gone down that same lonesome road as top hats , sazeracs and wooden dashboards such mementos are usually impossible to revive , but four partners alan and mark fleischman , oren stevens and dezso szonntagh set about doing just that , with impressive results tatou is in a building that was designed in the late 1920 s to be a small opera house the depression closed the curtain on that idea , and the building sat idle until the late 30 s , when it opened as versailles , a competitor to the famous stork club the house band was led by desi arnaz , and in the early 50 s edith piaf performed there in her american debut the club later became a restaurant called the round table , then cafe versailles , before closing and remaining vacant for five years the new owners virtually rebuilt the room , leaving its nearly 30foothigh ceiling and ornate balcony a massive chandelier hangs from the center , and faux antique windows run from floor to ceiling upstairs is a private club the appealing menu by scott cohen , the executive chef , formerly of la reserve , and dezso szonntagh , from provence , is lustier than one might expect in this setting the opening act includes a knockout tortilla soup with strands of chicken and tortillas throughout and a haunting earthy and charred aftertaste lobster bisque was another winner , assertive with shellfish flavor and a good kick of hot pepper grilled quail \( supposedly boneless , but we found a few \) was well cooked and garnished with twirls of potato ribbons , red onions and tomato the roasted vegetable tart , a tall wedge , was piled with eggplant , zucchini and tomatoes , and moistened with dabs of goat cheese throughout deviled crab cake was on the gummy side , but an appetizer special of cappellini in a light tomatocream sauce , with smoked salmon , garlic and julienne of vegetables , was subtle and fresh the servers at tatou are polite and prompt , although if you are sitting too close to the stage \( light jazz and blues are featured nightly \) you may have difficulty hearing their menu descriptions the list of mostly american wines is well rounded and fairly priced one main course that should chase away the blues is sweetglazed roasted duck , moist and flavorful , with sundried cranberries and wild rice another is fettuccine in a concentrated veal stock sauce with crumbled veal , tomato and endive slices of roasted lamb come with ripe stewed tomatoes , okra and scalloped potatoes the biggest round of applause for seafood went to the salmon coated with honey mustard and roasted to perfection , served with a basil vinaigrette the mustard was not overly sweet , as is so often the case with this type of dish peppered sea bass was inviting , too , coated in herbs and served over rice with pine nuts and roasted tomatoes halibut was nicely crosshatched on the grill , well seasoned and set over a mound of mashed potatoes supposedly flavored with garlic \( i tasted none \) if you like scallops , the big , buttery sauteed ones here are served with couscous and grapefruit sections a cod dish did not turn out so well a cylindrical mound of unseasoned cod was capped by a lid of tasty crabmeat and mashed potatoes , surrounded by red cabbage and spinach desserts are classic american chunky banana cream pie with toasted almonds came under a pike s peak of whipped cream it looked excessive , but i loved it frozen yogurt and hazelnut pie with a thick lid of meringue floated on a light chocolate sauce on the lighter side , key lime pie with coconut was good and citric , although i found no evidence of coconut mixed berry shortcake was the real thing , and even the socalled health dessert could make you feel guilty earthy indian pudding with raspberry sauce whether tatou faithfully recreates the supper clubs of a previous generation is debatable as for its culinary medley , there is no doubt that it deserves hearty applause mariemichelle the reason restaurant critics have to revisit establishments periodically is that restaurants , unlike films , books and to some extent theater productions , are organic creatures that continually change some gain strength and finesse , others lose steam and stumble in the case of mariemichelle , an attractive contemporary bistro in midtown , the road has been mostly downhill the last time the restaurant was reviewed , in early 1988 , the chef was edward brown , a whiz kid with french training who has since gone on to make tropica one of the most stimulating seafood restaurants in manhattan at the moment , there is no chef at mariemichelle business was so slow last summer that the vivacious frenchborn owner , mariemichelle rey , was forced to return to the kitchen and devise menus with three cooks ms rey can still charm customers in the dining room but the maladroit staff can undermine her best efforts waiters misplace orders , forget who gets what and generally provide sloppy service one evening , at a table near mine , a diner was not charged after being served the wrong meal the clincher happened one day at lunch with the dining room onequarter full , the maitre d'hotel sat down at a table near the front door and had lunch as customers left , he looked up from his soup bowl and waved a class act
stock trading slowed sharply yesterday as investors waited for any kind of news that would change the almost inescapable conclusion that american troops may soon be fighting in the desert with little to go on , traders seized on an 11thhour peace initiative from france as a possible solution but concluded early in the day that it seemed to have faltered the dow jones industrial average tried several times to make headway , rising 11 points by 11 am , only to lose all of its gain by 2 pm it recovered a little , then sank 13 points by 3 pm , but bounced back to close at 2 , 49059 , ahead 668 for the day the broader sp 500 rose a little more , suggesting that while the rise was widespread it was indecisive because of the slow trading , market trends seemed almost irrelevant , although 735 stocks were down and 699 were ahead and 63 stocks slid to new lows , including paine webber , the investment firm keeping an eye on the stock tickers and an ear turned to news broadcasts , traders in oil , gold and other sensitive markets faced the same uncertainty february crude futures slipped 71 cents , to 3007 gold edged down 130 , to 39880 an ounce , and the commodity research bureau index , representing every major commodity , moved ahead only 35 points , to 22160 volume at 110 million shares activity on the new york stock exchange slumped to 110 million shares , the slowest since dec 27 and down from an anemic 1208 million on monday birinyi associates , which tracks program trading , said that an 11minute wave of selling starting at 2 40 pm chopped 65 points off the dow consequently even on a slow trading day , computerized program activity accounted for some of the volume based on prior stock exchange data , professional program selling represented at least 10 percent of the total despite the slow day , police erected barricades all around the exchange as a precaution against terrorists parking was prohibited and vendors including the hot dog stand just outside the broad street entrance were moved away suggesting that the big board was viewed as the main target of police interest , the american stock exchange , behind nearby trinity church on broadway , remained unprotected outside security inside both exchanges has always been strict knowing that investment people will want to stay close to their offices for a while , outside events are being put on hold the public securities association , for example , canceled a board meeting tomorrow and friday so bond traders could stay on the job everybody s standing on the sidelines and are cautious about doing anything , said robert g freedman , chief portfolio manager for john hancock mutual funds he noted that while hancock normally held little more than 5 percent to 10 percent of its 300 million stock portfolio in cash , it had built up its cash position in the last two weeks to 21 percent , or more than 60 million ready to go back into the market once the situation clears shearson , lehman brothers advised clients that trade in the futures market to use utmost caution in taking positions because of the potential volatility , depending on what happens in the gulf it s almost like a hurricane , said peter g grennan , senior vice president at shearson we 're tracking the path of war you do n't know if it 'll hit or not so everybody s getting prepared for the worst either lightening up their holdings , hedging what they want to keep or preparing lists of stocks they want to buy if the market drops , as most expect if war develops dow bluechip changes with the small change in the dow , none of the dow blue chips changed by as much as 1 chevron rose 7 8 , to 72 1 4 kodak fell 7 8 , to 37 3 4 ibm rose 3 4 , to 107 1 2 , and merck rose 5 8 , to 83 1 2 j p morgan , the big new york banking company , slid 2 5 8 , to 42 1 8 , in heavy trading after stephen berman of county natwest and frank desantis of paine webber downgraded their ratings on the stock following a rise in fourthquarter profits of 24 percent analysts had expected the highly regarded company to fare better progressive , the ohio insurer , fell 3 7 8 , to 46 7 8 , after reporting that fourthquarter earnings per share would be comparable to or slightly better than the quarter a year earlier investors have been shedding stocks at the first sign of disappointing profits despite a drop in fourthquarter profits of only 13 percent , wells fargo , the west coast banking company , fell 2 1 2 , to 49 3 4 , after reuters quoted analysts as saying that its performance was relatively strong but bore watching table the favorite stocks shows performance of the 15 issues with the most shareholders
albany , march 17 as happens every 10 years when the legislature turns its attention to reapportionment , the members of new york s congressional delegation are returning to albany with the predictability of the swallows to capistrano they can be seen on the floor of the assembly and the senate , backslapping and handshaking and sharing a good laugh they are flooding the mailboxes of lowly state legislators with newspaper clippings about their accomplishments on capitol hill in the offices and anterooms of legislative leaders , they are delivering hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions sometime late this year or early next year , the legislature must draw new district lines to eliminate 3 of new york s 34 congressional seats the seats will be lost where population has declined or where growth has been sluggish , probably one in western new york and two in the new york metropolitan region not here for the albany winter because no member of congress wants to be sketched into political oblivion , those who feel endangered are lobbying for their survival when you see them wandering around the floor , one surmises that they are n't here to check out the albany winter , said assemblyman john j faso , republican of kinderhook thirteen states will lose congressional seats because of population shifts detected by the 1990 census but none will lose as many as new york , making redistricting here particularly intense redistricting is the purest of political blood sports , largely stripped of lofty pretensions about good government and public policy while the boundaries are set by the census bureau and the voting rights act , the outcome is driven by power , partisanship , friendship and money in new york , where the state senate is controlled by republicans and the assembly by democrats , reapportionment must be a matter of bipartisan compromise gov mario m cuomo , a democrat , must sign the legislation , but it is unclear whether he will help draw the new lines most legislators and members of congress assume that the legislature will eliminate one republican seat and one democratic seat the third seat is likely to be decided through what is called a fair fight drawing a district that would pit an incumbent democrat against an incumbent republican how much time do members of congress spend worrying about what the legislature might do \? certainly no more than every waking hour , said representative gary l ackerman , a queens democrat many in new york s congressional delegation have shown little subtlety in trying to curry favor with the legislators who control their fates we see the members of congress once every 10 years , said carl carlucci , a leading reapportionment adviser , and if it was n't for redistricting , we 'd never see them at all representative james h scheuer , a democrat whose district includes parts of bronx , queens and nassau counties , contributed 50 , 500 from his campaign committee last year to the democratic assembly campaign committee and the democratic senate campaign committee , which are run by the party s leaders that accounted for almost onefifth of the campaign money spent by mr scheuer in 1990 , a year in which he ran for reelection in a highly unusual move , mr scheuer has also hired a lobbyist , brian r meara , to be his eyes and ears in the capitol and to press his case several state legislators from both parties , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said mr scheuer s tactics suggested desperation by a congressman who is not highly regarded in albany or washington , who barely survived the last two reapportionments and who has never fostered close ties with the legislature i never really got around to taking off the time to mosey up to albany and pay my respects , mr scheuer said maybe someday i should a promise of 10 , 000 a year mr scheuer s style contrasts starkly with that of representative l william paxon , an aggressive 36yearold republican who is at risk of losing his seat in western new york mr paxon , a former assemblyman , hopes to meet personally with each of new york s 35 republican senators and has already proposed a redistricting plan to the senate majority leader , ralph j marino he has also contributed 30 , 000 from his campaign treasury to the state senate republican campaign committee and has raised an additional 23 , 000 for the committee he said he promised mr marino that he would contribute 10 , 000 a year to the senate republicans if he keeps his seat legislators from both parties maintained that money would not have a major impact on reapportionment but that has not kept them from encouraging members of congress to raise money for legislative candidates financial disclosure reports show that the state s congressmen and women transferred 210 , 500 last year from their campaign accounts to legislative campaign committees the members of congress raised tens of thousands more from outside sources like political action committees it gets their attention , said representative norman f lent , a long island republican who said he raised 33 , 000 for senate republicans last year mr lent sent carbon copies of the check to mr marino and senator dean g skelos , republican of rockville centre , li , the cochairman of the reapportionment task force
washington , aug 14 american banks have not put up any money to finance soviet purchases of american grain , despite the bush administration s efforts to facilitate such loans no american banks participated last month in a 600 million loan to the soviet union for grain purchases , even though the united states guaranteed repayment of almost all of the principal and half of the interest , banking and grain industry executives said despite the government loan guarantees , american bankers said that they were worried about the declining ability of the soviet union to pay its bills and that their own financial problems had limited their ability to make loans to anyone eventually four european banks stepped forward to make the loans , reportedly under pressure from their governments the loans have an adjustable interest rate that is initially set slightly below 7 percent believed to be a first agriculture department and banking officials said they could not recall a previous instance in which a major guaranteed agriculturalexport loan had been claimed entirely by foreign banks the absence of american banks is likely to embarrass the administration , which certified the soviet union as creditworthy when it arranged the guarantee it also spells further trouble for the crippled and shrinking soviet economy , which desperately needs foreign loans and investment to try to make itself competitive in world markets in essence , the european banks are charging the soviets the equivalent of an interest rate exceeding 20 percent on the very small portion of the loan that is not guaranteed by the united states the situation could be a vicious circle for the soviet union if a disappearance of loans deprives it of the foreign currency needed for imports , which are needed to keep the economy running and creditworthy declining industrial imports feed back into declining output , said joseph s berliner , a professor emeritus of economics at brandeis university who has been studying the soviet economy since 1950 some american banks did discuss the loans with soviet officials , but the americans wanted even higher interest rates than what the europeans got , bank executives said now , if the soviet union defaults on these loans , american taxpayers will end up reimbursing the european banks a sharp increase banking officials said that for a 1 billion guaranteed loan last year the soviets paid threeeighths of a percentage point above the shortterm rate at which banks borrow from each other for the 600 million this summer , the margin increased to almost one percentage point , so that the profit margin for banks between their rough cost of borrowing money and the interest rate they charge has nearly doubled the sixmonth international interbank lending rate is currently at 594 percent , and the soviet loans carry an interest rate adjusted every six months to account for changes in this rate the higher rates reflect a calculation by the banks that the soviets might not repay the loans if the return on the guaranteed portion of the loan is calculated at the current rate for comparable borrowing by the united states government and if the considerable extra processing costs of agricultural loans are excluded , then the soviet union is paying an interest rate of more than 20 percent on the 2 percent of principal and several percentage points of interest that it is obtaining on the strength of its own creditworthiness governmentguaranteed loans for countries buying american agricultural products are not new nor is allowing the soviet union to use this financing mechanism when it buys american corn and wheat but after the united states found itself stuck in recent years with 2 billion in guaranteed agricultural loans to iraq , congress imposed tighter rules last year on who was eligible for such guarantees the new rules require that the president certify the creditworthiness of any nation before it can qualify for the borrowing program , but the rules set no guidelines for determining creditworthiness therein lies a problem although the soviet union has paid back other such grain loans , its fastdeteriorating economy has led many in congress and outside to see it as a problem credit but the bush administration wants dearly to promote continued soviet purchases of american agricultural products in the weeks leading up to last month s economic summit meeting , the administration was also seeking ways to help the soviet union even while opposing any program of direct government aid from the leading industrial nations giving guarantees over some opposition , president bush granted a soviet request for 15 billion in loan guarantees on june 11 , certifying at the time that the soviet union was creditworthy the first 600 million worth of guarantees was given to moscow immediately , with another 500 million scheduled for october and a final installment of 400 million planned for february the guarantees state that if the soviet union defaults on a loan covered by the program , the united states will repay 98 percent of the principal plus the first 45 percentage points of interest on that 98 percent of the principal but american banking and agriculture department officials say the soviets quickly ran into difficulties in finding banks willing to lend
in the stillmale world of television news , a maternal image is a dangerous thing before meredith vieira was fired from 60 minutes , few viewers knew she was working part time , to be with her young son now , because ms vieira is pregnant again and cbs refused to extend the parttime arrangement , she has become a news item herself viewers who saw her simply as a reporter now know she has had several miscarriages they have read that some men at 60 minutes were not happy when she brought her infant to the office but awareness of ms vieira s medical history and offtheair problems has not equaled viewers' curiosity about if and when connie chung will get pregnant last july , she announced that her weekly cbs series face to face with connie chung was being cut back to occasional specials because , as the 44yearold ms chung put it , i now need to take a very aggressive approach to having a baby that statement is haunting her like a cruel joke that she may never live down ms vieira and ms chung are the latest additions to the growing list of network newswomen whose images are linked to motherhood , and their cases raise especially troubling questions no one can doubt that ms chung sincerely wants to have a child , but everyone can wonder how much do we need to know about it \? no one is blaming ms vieira for trying to work out the best jobandlife balancing act she can , but a huge question now shadows her career will cbs or any other network ever take her seriously again \? in television news , calculating one s public image is as important as reporting motherhood is now part of that harsh calculation , and the impact of maternity on a career gets more confusing by the day until the chung and vieira examples , networknews mothers were blithely creating their own visible , lucrative version of the socalled mommy track in the worlds of business and law , women on the mommy track work fewer hours than those who aspire to be partners and accept the fact that they will never reach that status but in television news , several stars have apparently traded away some ambition while shrewdly turning motherhood into an asset when maria shriver wanted to spend more time with her daughter , she left the lowprofile sunday today show for cutting edge with maria shriver , occasional primetime specials featuring the glitzy hollywood interviews that suit her best after jane pauley was bumped off the today last year , she responded to rumors that she was in line to be tom brokaw s coanchor on the nbc nightly news by telling a network affiliates' convention that she had not been offered the anchor job and was n't interested in it anyway as a fulltime anchor , she would n't be able to tuck her three children into bed at night she now stars in a weekly primetime series , real life with jane pauley a warm , maternal image is perfect for real life , in which a typical report followed a soldier leaving her husband and children behind when she was shipped to the perisan gulf the today news anchor , faith daniels , is also the host for a new latemorning show , a closer look , with features geared toward a female audience in a recent new york magazine article she described her free time , sitting on the floor playing candyland or nintendo with her two children but motherhood is not such a convenient imagebooster and career strategy outside the world of morning shows and softnews interviews in hard news , it is one dangerous , backsliding step from jane does n't want tom s job she s a mother to connie ca n't do dan s job she s a woman ms chung s extremely personal revelation has already taken on the damaging aura of a continuing drama , shaping reactions to her work tom shales , the washington post television critic , wrote that ms chung seemed confused while she was the coanchor of a report on the war between the first and second editions of the newspaper , he learned indirectly from a cbs source that her poor onair performance was related to a medical treatment he softened his criticism for the second edition would he have done the same if he had learned , for instance , that dan rather had been taking painkillers for extracted wisdom teeth \? probably not , mr shales said in a recent telephone conversation his reaction to ms chung , he said , must be partly that she s a woman and that her problem was related to motherhood or wouldbe motherhood the damagecontrolling leak from cbs to the post was condescending , protecting poor little connie and it is easy to imagine how a critic s humane reaction and the public s awareness of it might turn into a dangerous double standard that is why meredith vieira was much better off when no one knew about her maternal problems after she was dropped from the show , don hewitt , the producer of 60 minutes , gave interviews comparing ms vieira s work unfavorably with that of her colleagues , all of whom are men it s not clear what role mr hewitt s comments a rare and nasty public breach of network loyalty might have on ms vieira s future she is discussing her next move at cbs , where she is still under contract if she lands on a softnews mommy track , that will send a clear message one signal has already been sent a frontrunner for ms vieira s 60 minutes job is lesley stahl , the margaret thatcher of television news a white house correspondent and the moderator of face the nation , ms stahl happens to be a mother but does not trail that image on the air and has not asked to work part time known as a tough reporter , she has an ironlady image that virtually makes her an honorary man that option is the traditional and unfortunately still the safest one for women who want to be taken as seriously as men , but it does n't begin to address a problem that will only become more common quick , think of a tv reporter who is an expectant father as long as none come to mind , television newswomen who are already juggling motherhood and careers will have another tricky balancing act how to be mothers and still be considered firstrate reporters in that , connie chung and meredith vieira are valuable examples of what not to do photos drawings on the network mommy track maria shriver nbc first person with maria shriver jane pauley nbc real life with jane pauley first substitute on nightly news deborah norville nbc cohost of today , currently on maternity leave katherine couric nbc national correspondent for today filling in as cohost for deborah norville paula zahn cbs cohost of cbs this morning faith daniels nbc a closer look news anchor for today mary alice williams nbc cohost of sunday today substitute weekend anchor joan lunden abc cohost of good morning america meredith vieira cbs news correspondent , formerly of 60 minutes
boston , dec 6 the knicks' sixgame winning streak ended tonight , but their frustration in boston continued using a decisive 101 run midway through the fourth quarter , the celtics defeated new york , 10392 , at boston garden , giving boston \( 126 \) sole possession of first place in the atlantic division , something the knicks \( 106 \) were also looking for it was new york s 21st consecutive regularseason loss in this arena and kevin mchale \( sore ankle \) and dee brown \( knee surgery \) were not even in uniform for boston unlike so many other defeats here , the knicks led most of the way they were ahead by 10 points in the second quarter , and they led by 5 points after three quarters but when it mattered most , larry bird was most magnificent , leading the celtics to victory with 31 points , 12 rebounds and 7 assists 'they do n't respect us' they do n't respect us the way they should , and they wo n't give us respect until we beat them here , said gerald wilkins , the knicks' guard they still do n't believe we beat them three games in a row in the playoffs \( in 1990 \) they think that was a fluke we 've lost 21 regularseason games in a row here why should they respect us \? the loss wasted a 28point , 10rebound performance by patrick ewing but like the rest of the knicks , ewing lost effectiveness down the stretch he scored just 8 points in the second half , and only 4 in the final period , when the knicks managed just 19 points boston manhandled new york on the boards , outrebounding the knicks , 5034 ed pinckney , a reserve forward playing rejuvenated basketall this season , had a season high in points \( 15 \) and rebounds \( 12 \) the celtics shot just 446 percent , but when rebounding the way they did , it s not necessary to shoot well i thought the knicks were trying to come in here and establish themselves , said boston coach chris ford we had to step up and accept the challenge with oakley and ewing , if you do n't match their intensity , you 're dead a run that stops knicks in winning , boston also broke the 100point barrier against the knicks , the first team to do that in eight games boston s 101 run did away with the knicks and gave the celtics a 9081 lead with 5 minutes , 47 seconds left bird started the run with two free throws , then brian shaw made an 18foot jumper robert parish made a hook shot in the lane and with scored on a followup slam dunk bird capped the run with two more free throws all the knicks managed during that 2 1 2minute span was one free throw by john starks once the celtics concentrated on denying ewing the ball , the knicks' offense was reduced to longrange jumps shots and they could not find anyone capable of making them you ca n't run in this league like you used to , said knicks coach pat riley if all you have is postup offense , the teams will take that away from you , too sooner or later , you have to make a jump shot tonight , we did n't bird lived at the freethrow line in the second half , making 14 of 14 foul shots for the game but new york could not blame this loss on the officiating ewing got things started with a strong 16point firstquarter , and the knicks eventually built a 4434 lead midway through the second quarter but by halftime , boston had tied the score at 51 'they call it confidence' when someone suggested to riley that the celtics played with arrogance at home , the coach feigned surprise and said oh , really \? they call it confidence it s a culture that s second to none in this league it s part of what they are they come in here , they know they 're going to win they 're going to take it to you in the fourth quarter , and you 've got to play 48 minutes thirtysix minutes is n't enough if you 're plus5 points after 36 minutes , and you 're committed , you win we got discouraged when a couple of shots did n't fall that s the sign of an immature team but they will mature , because they 'll get tired of it they 'll have to photo the celtics' john bagley and the knicks' mark jackson competing for a loose ball during the first quarter last night \( reuters \)
the united states is completing a deal to buy an advanced type of nuclear reactor built by the soviet union to generate power in space , federal officials say the transaction would be the first major sale between the former antagonists of a sensitive space technology with military potential such a development , which would have been unthinkable a year or two ago , points up the extraordinary changes that have accompanied the end of the cold war the purchase is to be announced today at a scientific meeting in new mexico the reactor is an advanced version of devices that have powered soviet spy satellites for decades the united states has no working nuclear reactors in orbit , although it has programs to develop them a federal official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said the aim of the purchase was to learn about soviet technology rather than to use the device in space he said that , on its own , the united states had studied this type of advanced reactor but had never built one this purchase is a way to leapfrog the process , to start from operational hardware and make a variation , he said in an interview mission to mars \? space reactors are compact energy sources that can generate more electricity than the large arrays of solar cells usually found on satellites in theory , they can energize electrical systems on any type of spacecraft , but they are seen as vital for missions requiring great amounts of electrical power , including certain kinds of spy satellites , space weapons and civilian spacecraft they can also power engines most recently , reactor engines have been envisioned as a means of speeding a manned expedition to mars the existence of the advanced device sought by the united states government came to light in january 1989 , when soviet scientists said they had developed a new class of reactor that was very efficient , longlived and powerful and disclosed that they had launched two experimental devices into space in a surprising move , they offered at the same time to sell the reactor to the west , although its mere existence had previously been a state secret although there have been reports that american scientists wanted to acquire the reactor from the russians , the negotiations had remained a secret until now the device is about 6 feet wide and 12 feet long , weighing a little more than a ton and generating 6 , 000 to 10 , 000 watts of electricity , depending on the makeup of its fuel core the purchase price , including plans , manuals , a stand for ground testing and a soviet team to start operations , is said to be around 10 million strong in metallurgy although the soviet union has lagged in some aspects of high technology , its scientists are seen more and more by their american counterparts as metallurgical wizards who have mastered highstrength , hightemperature alloys that are virtually unknown in the west these metals can be important in the design of advanced reactors , which generate great amounts of heat steven aftergood , a space analyst who has monitored the purchase for the federation of american scientists , a private group based in washington , said the deal would make sense for both sides the soviets desperately need the cash , and we have something to learn from the technology , which in several respects is more advanced than our own , he said the federation opposes nuclear reactors in earth orbit but sees them as potentially useful for space exploration reactors in space have been the subject of considerable debate since radioactive debris from a soviet reactor fell in canada more than a decade ago moreover , soviet space controllers lost contact in 1988 with a crippled reactorpowered satellite the mishap caused concern around much of the world before an automatic safety system aboard the craft sent it into a high orbit at the last minute the advanced reactor has been used in two experimental flights , which began in 1987 and were conducted in unusually high orbits those reactors , still in space , are now shut down soviet sales blitz the soviet effort to sell the advanced reactor is part of sales blitz that got under way a few years ago when the soviets , strapped for cash , started to offer a diverse line of spacerelated goods and services to anyone who had the money the initiative met much resistance in the west , mostly for political reasons sales have generally been lackluster and until now have involved no major technologies that are militarily sensitive the united states government s purchase of the advanced reactor could conceivably be blocked by political opponents in the west , or by the wrenching shifts of policy that have recently kept the soviet union in turmoil the announcement of the purchase is to be made today at a scientific symposium on space nuclear power that is held each year in albuquerque the advanced reactor is known as topaz 2 one such advanced reactor , which arrived in new mexico over the weekend , is to be displayed at the meeting this week in what will be the reactor s western debut some two dozen soviet scientists are to attend the meeting , which is sponsored by the university of new mexico senator to make announcement
companies judging from the rally in banking stocks last week , it would appear that defaults and delinquencies are a receding worry but not necessarily several banks , including chase manhattan and some regionals like first fidelity , posted sharp gains in their firstquarter profits a product of costcutting , the slowing growth of bad loans and falling interest rates falling rates enable banks to make money on the spread between what they pay depositors and what they charge borrowers , whose rates are not adjusted as quickly these spreads are now their widest in years , bankers say , because they need to earn more on their good customers to make up for all the bad ones but these benefits did n't buttress all banks chemical bank , ncnb and manfacturers hanover all saw earnings slip and citicorp suffered the most its profits plunged 70 percent in the first quarter , to a bare 70 million while bad real estate loans were the bane of bankers early in the downturn , souring consumer loans are a worry as the recession matures they were to blame for the disappointing quarter at citicorp , the nation s largest issuer of credit cards and home mortgages so why the stock rally \?

could alan greenspan and the fed be preparing for a rebound \? despite reports earlier this month indicating that inflation is in check , the fed drained reserves from the banking system on monday that may be a sign that tightening credit and fighting inflation are higher priorities than lowering shortterm interest rates to help speed a recovery life after 3 , 000 wall street certainly warmed to the theory that the fed is in its recovery mode the dow jones industrial average broke the 3 , 000 barrier for the first time , a psychological milestone it had come close to three times since july spurred by lower interest rates here and abroad , stocks worldwide have rallied since the gulfwar chill last fall that spells relief for wall street firms , whose firstquarter earnings were positively buoyant compared with last year , the worst year for securities firms in decades but evidence that the economy has hit bottom is still shadowy , and institutional investors grabbed the chance to take profits while others rushed into the market on the coattails of the 3 , 000mark euphoria the market ended the week at 2 , 96559 reading the trade figures the falling price of imported oil and the need for less of it in a recession helped narrow the trade deficit in february to its lowest level in more than seven years the deficit , the amount by which purchases of foreign goods exceed sales abroad , dropped 26 percent , to 53 billion but the trade figures do n't necessarily bespeak an imminent recovery though imports dropped dramatically , exports , which had been a cushion in this recession , continued to slide from their december peak the rising dollar and continued weakness of the country s trading partners are likely to reinforce the trend gloomy economic statistics
elizabeth , dec 11 a statewide grand jury today found no basis for criminal charges against police officers who fatally shot two young newark residents and wounded four others after a highspeed chase last june the union county prosecutor , andrew k ruotolo , said the jury found that the failure of the police officers simply to arrest the young people , who were in a stolen van , was tragic , avoidable and unprofessional the grand jury found , however , it was not criminal , he said the jury handed up one indictment for misconduct against a newark police officer , marvin carpenter he was one of four officers from newark and hillside who fired as many as 37 rounds into the van within a 10second period after it crashed into a hillside patrol car officer carpenter was not indicted for firing his weapon , but for trying to hide the fact that he was one of the shooters following release of the indictment , the newark police director , william r celester , suspended officer carpenter without pay pending the outcome of the charges if convicted , the officer faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of up to 100 , 000 mr ruotolo said the grand jury determined that at no time were any shots fired at the police from the van , whose seven passengers included five teenagers charman harvey , the lawyer for martika fleming , a 14yearold girl wounded in the shootings , said she was disappointed but not surprised by the grand jury action i knew it , she said the grand jury was more interested in what happened earlier in the day when the van was stolen than in what happened after the chase how can they simply call it unprofessional in the case of a shooting \? she asked that s at least negligence too many bullets were fired into that van without anybody firing back ms harvey has filed negligence suits against both newark and hillside on behalf of her client jack n frost , the lawyer for the family of tasha maysey , who was 16 years old and five months pregnant when she was fatally wounded in the shootout , and for de angelo cody , 17 , who was wounded , would not comment on the grand jury action , beyond saying that he will read the 60page report of the incident released by mr ruotolo and confer with his clients before deciding what to do in addition to miss mayse , lamont jones , 20 , was killed the oldsmobile van had been stolen at gunpoint in newark by two young men several hours earlier , and when it was spotted by a newark officer about 1 30 am the two had picked up five friends the grand jury gave the five survivors of the shooting immunity , and mr ruotolo said their testimony showed that all of the occupants of the van knew that it was stolen and that they were riding around essex county towns looking for robbery targets at least two of the van s occupants committed a strongarm robbery by taking a bicycle from a small boy in east orange before they returned to newark and became involved in the sevenmile chase that reached speeds of 90 miles an hour before it ended in the shootings mr ruotolo said it was the panic of one of the newark officers that touched off the shooting four newark police cars that were chasing the stolen van about 2 am on june 9 pulled up behind it after it crashed into a hillside patrol car on the north broad street overpass over route 22 several officers left their cars and advanced on the van in violation of guidelines that say they should stay behind the cover of their vehicles , mr ruotolo said on the other side of the van were the hillside officers , john shust and john baum jr , who were in the patrol car rammed by the van when one of the newark officers fired at the van , again in violation of police guidelines , officer shust said he heard the shot and the sound of breaking glass followed by a quick whistling sound passing his position he assumed the shot came from the van and fired seven shots into the vehicle s rightfront passenger door , according to the investigative report released by mr ruotolo at the direction of the grand jury this was the start of the firing that mr ruotolo said was appropriate to a military operation but inappropriate to a police response the grand jury report said that a starter s pistol was found on the floor of the van but that it had not been fired and none of the blank ammunition it was designed to use was found
boston , sept 30 battered by years of demonstrations , picketing and lawsuits by animal rights advocates , several of the nation s leading aquariums have vowed to fight back in the first move , the new england aquarium here has filed a 5 million defamation suit against three animal rights groups , accusing them of making false statements about the aquarium s handling of dolphins in fundraising efforts the suit also accuses the groups of filing frivolous lawsuits to harass the aquarium and undermine its program of rescuing stranded whales and dolphins we are fed up , and we 're not going to take their lies anymore , said dr paul boyle , the director of programs and exhibits at the aquarium calling the groups' members animal extremists , dr boyle said , it is clear their real objective is to close all aquariums 'not a vendetta' but steven wise , a boston lawyer who is president of both citizens to end animal suffering and exploitation and the animal legal defense fund , said , this is not a vendetta against them instead , he said , the suits were intended to force national policy changes several other aquariums and zoos are expected to support the new england aquarium s suit , filed sept 17 in federal district court here , by entering friendofthecourt briefs , dr boyle and aquarium officials around the country said the action is believed to be the first by an aquarium or zoo to seek damages against animal rights advocates bob jenkins , the senior adviser for research and animal affairs at the national aquarium in baltimore , said this is the culmination of the kind of harassment we have all been dealing with the last three to five years we feel we have been defamed by some of these groups , and it is time to set the record straight people ca n't just run around saying whatever they want about an institution to raise money 'a misinformation campaign' brad andrews , the zoological director for sea world , a chain of four aquariums from orlando , fla , to san diego , said we support the new england aquarium 100 percent we have to put the skids to a misinformation campaign by a vocal minority to mislead the public and raise money the new england aquarium acted after two suits were filed against it in the last year , including one in june , claiming that the aquarium did not have the proper permit to transfer a dolphin named kama to a navy training program four years ago the most recent suit was brought by citizens to end animal suffering and exploitation , the animal legal defense fund and the progressive animal welfare society group acknowledges error in its countersuit , the aquarium charged that the groups distributed fundraising letters with false information about kama for example , the letters claimed kama was born in the ocean near bermuda and was violently removed from his family group and put into captivity at the new england aquarium dr boyle said kama was born at sea world in san diego and never lived in the ocean the question of kama s origin is important because under the marine mammal protection act of 1972 aquariums are required to get a permit from the national marine fisheries service to take , or capture , a dolphin from the wild moving a dolphin born in an aquarium requires only a letter of agreement from the agency , a much simpler procedure the animal rights groups' fundraising letter also charged that kama would be turned into a lethal dolphin torpedo by the navy , that dolphins at the new england aquarium were kept in containers barely larger than their bodies and that they were trained by having food withheld from them dr boyle said that by agreement with the navy kama was limited to doing scientific research on sonar , and that the aquarium has large tanks for its dolphins and does not deprive them of food mr wise acknowledged that his groups made an error about kama s origin it was just a minor mistake , he said , but for their own reasons they are blowing it up but beyond the arguments about who is telling the truth , the real quarrel seems to be about a broader issue whether intelligent sea mammals like dolphins and whales should be held in captivity at all approves of rescue program mr wise said the animal legal defense fund , which is based in san rafael , calif , had never taken a position on whether aquariums should be allowed to exist but he said , there are many people in our organization who believe you should not keep such exquisitely beautiful and intelligent animals in captivity similarly , mr wise said he wholeheartedly approved of the rescue programs by the new england and other aquariums to help stranded and beached whales and dolphins but he said his groups strongly objected to the aquariums' keeping any of the animals they saved without first obtaining a permit dr boyle said that it often took six months to get a permit and that none was required for rescuing marine mammals by aquariums that have letters of authorization from the government the extremists would prefer these animals to die on the beach and suffer a long painful death rather than have us help them , he said they are advocating animal suffering tom otten , the director of the point defiance zoo and aquarium in tacoma , wash , said the animal rights groups have also opposed his institution s rescue of marine mammals their agenda is for dolphins not to be on public display , he said they only want them to be out in the ocean mr otten said this showed a profound misunderstanding both of the educational role of aquariums and of what is happening to the oceans he said aquariums help children who otherwise would never see a marine animal learn to appreciate the need to protect dolphins and whales last year more than 100 million people visited aquariums in the united states moreover , with civilization continuing to encroach on the oceans , making them dirtier and more dangerous through overfishing , mr otten said , there is no longer a really free environment out there this makes the scientific and educational roles of aquariums even more cricital , he added be wild , be free , is just not a valid premise any longer , he said
ciudad del este , paraguay in this bustling town on the border of brazil and argentina , often called the hong kong of south america , smugglers fear that their long and lonely advocacy of free trade is about to become respectable on tuesday , the presidents of argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are to meet in asuncion , paraguay s capital , to sign a treaty forming the southern cone common market known as mercosur , a contraction of its name in spanish , the market will allow goods and services to circulate tariff free between the 200 million consumers of the region by january 1996 brazil and argentina , the two largest economic players of the region , are to eliminate all tariffs on trade with each other by january 1995 in addition , both countries plan to lower duties on imports from outside the region to an average of 20 percent in some cases , those tariffs are as high as 100 percent brazil is already the largest importer of goods from the other three nations last year , 2 billion worth of goods was traded between argentina and brazil chile , which lowered its tariffs in the 1980 s , declined to join the common market instead , chile starts talks in may with the united states in the hope of establishing a freetrade agreement it s a world trend toward economies of scale , celso amorim , brazil s commonmarket negotiator , said in an interview in brasilia it s happening in europe , the far east , north america on the other side of south america , venezuela , colombia , peru and bolivia have decided to abolish virtually all regional tariffs by yearend both south american common markets dovetail with a proposal for a western hemisphere freetrade zone that was promoted by president bush during his fivenation tour of south america in december this city s practitioners of free trade may be among the first to lose if free trade breaks out in the region in a back office of the seedy lai lai shopping center here , a brazilian computer smuggler whose business card identified him only as marcio said with a mix of apprehension and bravado mercosur would finish off this town if it ever happens but it wo n't brazil s big thing has always been bureaucracy and import duties the city protectionism built indeed , to walk though this town is to see a mirrored reflection of the protectionist economies of brazil and argentina , which start on the other side of the alto parana river roller skates with pink wheels , scotch , fishing rods , american potato chips , electronic organs , taiwanese pocket calculators , space laser gun toys , ersatz ming vases , cordless telephones , designerlabel sneakers , french perfumes , ibm personal computers all are on sale here on the other side of the river , all are considered contrabanda while many countries outlaw imports of illicit drugs , pornography and firearms , brazil and argentina banned imports of these and thousands of other consumer goods to foster domestic industry items that were not banned outright were kept out with stiff duties , sometimes more than 100 percent indeed , brazilian and argentine protectionism built ciudad del este , now paraguay s secondlargest city when i

clewiston , fla the annual harvest of sugar cane from south florida s mucky flatlands is in full swing the horizon is flecked with smoke from fields being torched to clear leaves , and by steam from the mills that grind endlessly the grunts and sullen chatter of cane cutters who sever the singed stalks inches from the ground vie with the whining of mechanical harvesters there is one surprising difference this year the cane growers , long envied for their government subsidies and vilified for their labor and environmental practices , aim to shed their image as an industry that fears publicity that image , the industry has concluded , has undermined its clout in washington and florida and made it hard to attract public sympathy on issues like water management that threaten the growers' future the idea is to get everything on the table , said j nelson fairbanks , president of the united states sugar company , which began the public effort to win friends we have n't been confronting allegations and misperceptions yesterday , u s sugar announced that it would plead guilty to eight counts of violating federal hazardous waste disposal laws at one of its mills and pay a 375 million fine the violations , which took place between 1986 and 1989 , caused no measurable harm to the environment , the company said , adding that the mill passed two subsequent state investigations with no further violations the industry s most infamous sore point over the years has been its reliance on some 10 , 000 seasonal workers , mostly jamaican , who are imported each year for the fivemonth harvest persistent charges of worker mistreatment are costly to fight so costly , the growers say , that the companies are being herded toward the use of expensive harvesting machinery that sometimes cuts cane inefficiently and damages the fragile soil the growers , like other farmers , are also worried about the future of government subsidies sugar price supports cost the government nothing in most years because they are linked to import quotas set at levels calculated to push domestic prices higher than the guaranteed support level but the price supports are increasingly unpopular in washington because they drive up the cost of consumer products by 3 billion annually according to critics and undermine the bush administration s credibility when it pushes other governments to support freer trade an environmental showdown the problem that drove home the need for the growers to improve their image , though , is a threeyearold confrontation with federal and state environmental regulators over how to improve the quality of the water flowing into the everglades the regulators agreed last summer on a proposed settlement that could saddle the growers with a large chunk of an estimated 440 million cost to create a new marshland for filtering water reaching the everglades the proposal would also force growers to make sure that water leaving their property is cleaner than the rain that falls on it the growers say the settlement , now before a federal judge in miami , could wipe out cane production and most other forms of agriculture in southern florida , which provides a large portion of winter vegetables and citrus for the eastern united states the growers hope their arguments will appeal to residents in the booming cities on florida s atlantic coast if the settlement is subjected to a public review process they say , for instance , that a threat to the cane industry is a threat to urban water supplies because water flowing from their irrigation systems acts as a reservoir for the cities' wells state officials say the cane growers are exaggerating their potential liability , particularly if the industry can demonstrate that it contributes as little to pollution as it claims and they say the growers remain more confrontational than open they have launched the most concerted attack ever by anyone against the state agencies , said daniel thompson , general counsel to the florida department of environmental resources they have 17 different proceedings of various sorts going against the settlement disproportionate clout until the water battle arose , the publicityshy florida cane growers often seemed to pack clout far out of proportion to their economic importance the 430 , 000 acres of cane land in this region account for over half the nation s sugar cane production , which besides in florida can be found in louisiana , texas and hawaii but the acreage adds up to only 20 percent of the nation s total sugar output , once beet sugar production and imports are included the growers , though , are big landowners a plantation of several hundred acres would be scarcely large enough to support the equipment needed and most also grow fruit , vegetables or rice more important , they have powerful allies on pricesupport and quota issues the corn farmers across the nation who peg the price of their highfructose syrup at a level just under sugar the cane growers tell visitors that sugar is a bargain , one of the few products that does not cost more in 1991 than it did a decade earlier
earthshattering news does not always arrive beneath banner headlines it may turn up in small print and almost as an afterthought , like the editor s note that followed the current cinema column in last week s new yorker we regret that pauline kael feels that it s time , after 24 years at the magazine , to retire from regular reviewing , the note began within the world of film criticism , where ms kael has been such a formidable and influential presence for decades , that announcement was enough to set off seismic waves she has long been the most impassioned , defiantly controversial figure in american film criticism and she will doubtless remain so , even if she writes about film less often reached by telephone at her home in the berkshires , fielding say it ai n't so messages from friends and admirers , ms kael explained why she was ready for this change health is a factor at 71 she can no longer easily make weekly or even biweekly treks to new york city to remain current with new films and when she arrives here , she is often forced to wait in long lines in bad weather , since her noholdsbarred opinions have made her unwelcome at press screenings in certain quarters all those people you see on television appearances talking about how they never read their reviews are very good at keeping me out of their screenings , she said with a little laugh as for the long lines , ms kael blames theater owners they just want you outside so that you 'll be a shill to attract bigger crowds when movies are bad the films themselves are another and more important reason for her decision the last time i was there i saw an awful lot of movies that were n't worth writing about , she said you can take a lot of bad movies when you 're younger , but when you 're older you wonder why you 're doing it to yourself i used to react with more bounce than i do now if i had to write about something as bad as 'the hard way , ' she said of the new movie with michael j fox and james woods , with good people involved in something that turned out to be so hopeless , it just drags you down in spirit ms kael described 70 as a turning point and said she now occasionally becomes uncertain as to the exact sequence of scenes in a film but she still works entirely from memory in writing the capsule descriptions that appear in the front of the new yorker , never needs to revisit films when they appear on videocassette , feels sorry for most people who rent videocassettes \( they have no background they 're like children shopping you watch them and think , 'oh , what a disappointing night they 're going to have' \) , and has lost absolutely none of her characteristic bite writing about dances with wolves , she said kevin costner , the film s star and director , had feathers in his hair and feathers in his head when that film wins its oscars , she said i 'll just laugh i expected that when i reviewed it i do n't think i 've ever seen a worse bunch of candidates than this year it must embarrass people when they have to vote speaking of robert de niro s performance in awakenings , she now says he does the tics and jiggles well it s in the quiet moments that he s particularly bad people get the idea that somebody is a great actor and it takes them decades to shake it off when she speaks admiringly , it is in citing a whole new generation of favorite actors tim robbins , jeff goldblum , annette bening , uma thurman , john cusack , laurie metcalf and wesley snipes are among those she mentions by name and there are directors , like robert altman and brian de palma , whose work she credits for saving me from being a hack by making the films that most consistently inspired her the late 1960 s and then the 1970 s , which brought forth these directors and so much other precocious talent , remain ms kael s favorite time to have written about film , and a time she considers very different from today what we do n't have now is the conviction that there s something up there on the screen that needs to reach people , she said there s attention to specific movies now , but they do n't really matter in the same way plans for the future since specific movies do still matter greatly to her enemies a love story and casualties of war are recent favorites , whereas she sat screaming silently while reading rave reviews of the silence of the lambs ms kael is not likely to spend much time on the sidelines but she does plan to read long novels she might have avoided because it was frustrating to stop reading and start producing her copy and she expects to spend more time with her grandson she will continue to write essays for the new yorker and intends to do some reflections and other pieces of writing about movies the magazine s regular reviewing will now be done by terrence rafferty , who has replaced ms kael during her longer and longer absences robert a gottlieb , the editor of the new yorker , compared ms kael to james agee for her mixture of very formidable critical apparatus and love of movies a whole generation of film critics has had to respond to her either by imitating her or resisting her , he said and readers throughout these 20odd years have had to read her , whether they agreed with her or not , for the passion of her ideas and the excitement of her prose if ms kael chooses to look backward , it will no doubt be with great and justifiable satisfaction i 've had a very good time reviewing pictures , she said surely that is the understatement of a lifetime photo pauline kael , who is retiring as film critic for new yorker magazine \( anne hall \)
washington , sept 9 judge clarence thomas enjoys about equal support , and opposition , from whites and blacks , but twothirds of the american people have no opinion on whether he should be confirmed as a justice of the supreme court , the latest new york times cbs news poll shows among those with a view , twice as many say he should be confirmed as say he should be rejected judge thomas , who is black and has been opposed by most civil rights organizations , was supported by 23 percent of blacks and opposed by 15 percent among whites , 26 percent favored confirmation and 10 percent did not in the public generally , 24 percent favored confirmation 11 percent did not but the reasons given varied sharply by race many respondents gave only vague reasons , or none at all , but whites who supported him often cited president bush s backing , judge thomas s conservatism and his perceived opposition to abortion and affirmative action whites who opposed him cited his conservatism and stand on abortion blacks' reasons for and against blacks who want him confirmed cited his race and his boyhood poverty , while blacks against him often focused on his opposition to affirmative action the 65 percent of respondents who had no opinion was almost as many as the 73 percent who had no view on whether judge robert h bork should be confirmed four years ago on the eve of senate hearings on his nomination , which was ultimately rejected a times cbs news poll then found 14 percent in favor of confirmation and 13 percent opposed but the hearings , which begin tuesday at 10 am , could change public opinion as they did four years ago , although they are likely to be less rancorous page a17 a times cbs news poll just after the 1987 hearings found that supporters increased to 21 percent while opponents grew to 27 percent for many in the telephone poll conducted last tuesday through thursday , the lack of an opinion was a reflection of the relative low level of controversy and information about the nomination over the summer but for some , it amounted to a thoughtful ambivalence for example , paul patricks , a 34yearold black auditor from denver , called himself undecided thomas has rendered some very conservative views on most issues , he said that i like but mr patricks , one of the 1 , 519 adults in the poll , complained in a followup interview of mr thomas s opposition to affirmative action programs i hate to label it 'turncoat , ' but pretty close to it , especially having benefited from the same programs he is trying to hurt that complaint touched on one potential weakness for mr thomas , as an overwhelming majority of the respondents said they thought someone who had benefited from affirmative action , as mr thomas did in his admission to the yale law school , should support it for others tide of bush s popularity three reasons behind the support for the nominee stand out one is president bush , who has continually identified himself with the nomination and enjoys very high public support he is more popular than president reagan was at the time of the bork nomination , with a 70 percent approval rating in this poll to 50 percent for mr reagan then this poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all respondents , and plus or minus five points for blacks , who were interviewed at a higher rate than usual to allow detailed analysis of their views there were also very high levels of support for mr thomas among strong foes of abortion , even though he has not stated a position on the issue , while strong supporters of abortion rights backed him more narrowly one abortion foe in the survey , peter wrobel , a 19yearold white college student from plainville , conn , said it s just a gut feeling he is against abortion , and i am a catholic and he is a catholic it s about that simple he seems like a dedicated man in his belief it s most likely that when he is on the court that roe versus wade will be overturned judge thomas , who went to roman catholic schools and once thought of becoming a priest , now attends services at an episcopal church in fairfax , va a similar pattern was found on affirmative action , where strong supporters divided evenly , while strong foes backed him heavily audrey juffer , 37 , a nurse in mitchell , sd , said she wanted him confirmed because of how she thought he stood on abortion but also because of his opposition to affirmative action i respect him all the more because he worries for the whole country , not just his segment , she said but that stand drew some of the sharpest criticism in followup interviews robert gardner , 25 , a black plumber in philadelphia , said his whole attitude is a problem like he made that 'picking yourself up by the bootstraps' statement , ok \? man , some of us do n't have no boots it s unfeeling and arrogant mr gardner and mr patricks touched on the potential source of opposition to judge thomas , who sits on the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in the poll , 70 percent of whites and 83 percent of blacks agreed that someone who had benefited from affirmative action programs had an obligation to support those programs so others can benefit
howard spira , the 32yearold bronx man who george steinbrenner says ruined my life , had his own life jolted yesterday a federal jury in manhattan convicted spira of attempting to extort money from steinbrenner in all , spira was convicted on five of six charges involving steinbrenner and on three of the other four charges against him the outcome of the fourweek trial will almost certainly lead to a renewed effort by steinbrenner to challenge the investigation of him last year by baseball commissioner fay vincent no bearing on status the verdict , however , will have no bearing on steinbrenner s position in baseball because the government had made clear that its case was separate from vincent s by agreement with the commissioner last summer , steinbrenner was removed as managing partner of the yankees because of his threeyear association with spira and his 40 , 000 payment to him in january 1990 although steinbrenner has contended the payment was extorted , the government case neither made that claim nor dealt with that episode in the steinbrennerspira relationship the government accused spira of trying to extort an additional 110 , 000 from the owner after the 40 , 000 payment in a statement issued after the verdict , richard levin , a spokesman for vincent , said , the federal case against mr spira , as the commissioner has said many times , has no relationship at all to any baseball matter , including mr steinbrenner s status as it pertains to his agreement with the commissioner a statement issued for steinbrenner by his spokesman , steve mangione , did not address the baseball matter naturally i am pleased with the verdict and i thank all of those people who believed in me and my family , the yankee owner said the jury of 10 men and 2 women returned its verdict after deliberating for one full day and parts of two others judge louis stanton set sentencing for sept 19 under federal sentencing guidelines , two of the counts provide for terms of 10 to 16 months each and the other six counts call for 4 to 10 months each that would mean a minimum total of 3 years and 8 months and a maximum of 7 years and 8 months , but the guidelines allow sentences on different counts to be served concurrently relying on tapes and letters the jurors appeared to have acted with one approach in mind where a count was tied to a tape of a telephone conversation they could listen to or a letter they could read , the jurors found spira guilty where there was no tape or letter or other indisputable testimony available , they voted not guilty for example , in its first message to judge stanton on tuesday , the jury asked to listen to a tape related to count no 3 , which accused spira of trying in a telephone call in the fall of 1989 to extort money from earle lilly , a houston lawyer , by threatening to harm his reputation the jury was told no such tape existed that count was one of two on which the jurors voted not guilty the other count on which spira was acquitted dealt with his allegedly intercepting , or taping , for criminal purposes a telephone conversation between him and steinbrenner the other two counts on which spira was convicted stemmed from telephone threats he made to ronald juris , a united airlines employee it started in 1986 spira , who as a young man covered the yankees as a stringer for radio stations , began a relationship with steinbrenner in december 1986 , after dave winfield rebuffed his efforts to resume their relationship spira had become associated with winfield and his agent , al frohman , in the early 80 s desperate for money and a job , spira went to steinbrenner with information on winfield , with whom the owner was feuding over the player s foundation for children unlike winfield , steinbrenner did not terminate his relationship with spira , instead assigning philip mcniff , his chief troubleshooter , to handle him spira and mcniff had numerous telephone conversations over the next 38 months spira , an admitted former gambler , was arrested in march 1990 after being indicted by a federal grand jury in tampa , fla a federal grand jury in manhattan handed up a superseding indictment last november the jurors appeared to disregard testimony that david greenfield , spira s lawyer , said should have tempered their view of at least some of the charges my biggest disappointment , greenfield said in an interview , was the apparent literal interpretation of the judge s instructions rather than taking relationships into consideration 'very incriminating' the tapes were very incriminating , said a juror , leon sterling , a sheetmetal worker from monsey , ny when the tapes were n't incriminating , the letters he wrote were very incriminating as for considering the testimony , sterling said , most of the testimony we heard was a duplicate of what was on the tapes sterling said the jury did n't really consider events in the steinbrenner phase of the case that occurred before the 40 , 000 payment when we went into the jury room , we were handed papers that defined all 10 counts , the juror said none of this was in there this stuff happened so many years ago we did n't take that into consideration we were working with what happened after steinbrenner paid the 40 , 000 voting among the jurors on each count , sterling said , was not always unanimous from the outset the voting was always 102 or 93 , but it was never close we went around the table three , four times discussing the issues when you have two saying not guilty , you have to try to convince them that he s guilty as we talked , the people who said not guilty heard points they had n't remembered greenfield said he planned to appeal the verdict but could not begin the appeal process until after sentencing spira engaged in a pattern of extorting people , gregory kehoe , the assistant united states attorney who prosecuted the case , said later there were serious threats to their reputations and their livelihood he threatened the life of an innocent person who had no relationship to him , not like mr steinbrenner as the verdict was read at 3 35 pm , spira s somber face reddened as he started into space , his chin resting lightly on his right hand at one point , he briefly bowed his head and put his hand to his eyes , but he quickly resumed his more stoic position minutes later , kehoe asked that spira s 50 , 000 bail be revoked and that he be put in jail until the sentencing spira , who did not testify during the trial , spoke impassionedly in an effort to reain free on bail i have no intention of running away , he told stanton i'm scared , i'm confused , but i have every intention of doing what i 've done every day the past five weeks going home i have no intention of doing anything but facing this like a man the judge rejected kehoe s request and allowed spira to leave before he did , spira walked over to kehoe , shook his hand and said , you presented a good case kehoe nodded and spira walked out of the courtroom photo howard spira leaving federal court in manhattan yesterday after being convicted for attempting to extort money from

san diego the day starts out simply enough for the 30 crewmen of japan s america s cup challenge team there is an hour of exercise running , swimming or working out on weight machines at the team s compound , a sprawling apartment complex close to where the boats are docked at mission bay then there is breakfast bowls of miso soup and seaweed , panfried fish , rice and green tea set a hearty oriental table but how to explain the miniature boxes of breakfast cereals , the toast , yogurt , fried eggs , hot dogs and coffee \? hikaru shiraishi eats frankfurters by skewering them with the tips of his chopsticks and yoshiya sasaki is adept at folding a fried egg in half and eating it with one gulp but the western dishes have other palates to please , those of the five new zealand yachtsmen who form the sailing backbone of japan s first effort in history to win the america s cup few question the nippon s potential successes in the computerdriven aspects of boat design but finding experienced crewmen in japan s fledgling yachting community was like spotting a buoy in fogshrouded sagami bay near tokyo kaoru ogimi , vice commodore of japan s cup sponsor , the nippon ocean racing club , said recently in san diego that his team was forced to look outside japan for a crew the big question mark is , of course , the people , the software side , said ogimi the syndicate s answer was to hire chris dickson of new zealand , the topranked matchracing skipper in the world what we 've been doing around the clock with him in our own camp is trying to reach out and go beyond chris , said ogimi to make the best use of dickson s expertise , the nippon group in 1987 bought two former america s cup yachts to use as training vessels the boats happened to be the same 12meters , kz 3 and kz 5 , that dickson and his teammates sailed to a near victory four years ago in cup trial races in australia the purchase was designed to help japanese sailors prepare for even bigger boats the new 76 to 78foot international america s cup class yachts that will be sailed in the 1992 cup races here none of us have ever sailed in boats in any size approximating these , said ogimi of the 2 million racing craft the america s cup class boats are 10 feet longer than most 12meters , and onethird lighter they carry far more sail area , and are faster downwind by 6 or 7 knots even dickson , who has sailed on everything from a sevenfoot dinghy to an 80foot maxiboat , is impressed with the new class these boats portray power , he said , while standing on the deck of jpn 6 , the second of the syndicate s two identical new america s cup class yachts when you look up , you see a cloud of sail suddenly it feels like a tiny little boat with a huge amount of sail area a budget of six billion yen , about 40 million , has fueled the syndicate s extensive costs of research and development from a country rich in naval architecture through its commercial shipbuilding , japanese experts have turned their attention to sailboats at nippon s 45 , 000squarefoot compound on mission bay , a new sail loft is taking shape four trailers and 12 shipping containers a combination of 20 and 40footers serve as space for offices , a machine shop , computer center and storage space the promise of competition looms large syndicates from italy , new zealand and france are also in san diego by year s end , 12 challenge teams and two defenders are expected be sailing dickson had his first crack at sailing one of japan s freshly built cup boats last april he and his crew launched the new breed of yachts in gamagori city , nippon s training camp 200 miles southwest of tokyo the boats were shipped to san diego in midjanuary for starters , the 29yearold dickson and the 40yearold makoto namba , his japanese team captain , had to teach many on the crew how to sail the first recruits answered newspaper advertisements placed by the syndicate the ads called for individuals at least 175 centimeters tall \( 6 feet \) and weighing at least 82 kilograms \( 170 pounds \) nearly 300 people , most with weak sailing skills but strong athletic backgrounds , responded one man thought he was trying out for a golf tournament ten were chosen after a battery of physical and psychological testing known within the syndicate as the green crew , the novice sailors have put in more than 8 , 000 hours on the water since then takashi kawahara , a nippon sail trimmer , was working in japan as a pig farmer when he read the ad jin matsubara was a young businessman in tokyo who sailed for a hobby he was inspired to answer the crew ad by a video he had once seen of the 1983 cup races shiraishi , a professional diver , remembers being overwhelmed the first time he joined the nippon sailing team i did n't know the winch name , he said last week i did n't know anything someone told me to ease something , but i did n't know what ease meant others confess to falling overboard now and again , and embarrassment unbecoming to a seasoned yachtsman language was a barrier at first , and to some degree , still is there were reports that friction had developed on the boat during the early days because of communication problems dickson and namba insist that those days are gone bigboat sailing is very systematic , said namba at the docks last week once we have established the system , there are not many opportunities to express yourself any other way namba , who commented through an interpreter , speaks limited english but at crew meetings , he speaks in english the team returned two weeks ago from a threeweek vacation the prospect of a world championship may 411 here for the new cup boats a kind of dress rehearsal for the america s cup trials next winter has thrown training into

stockton springs , me , nov 1 ted reed , the police chief in this rundown town of weatherbeaten houses by penobscot bay , now exists on a salary made up of donations his old cruiser runs on gasoline provided by a garage owner chief reed s plight has been brought about by growing anger among the town s 1 , 383 residents over the recession and rising property taxes in september they voted to do away with their oneman police force , and the drive stalled temporarily only after some townspeople took up a doortodoor collection to keep chief reed on the job on tuesday the question will be settled by a referendum if the vote goes against keeping the chief , the town will have to fall back on the county sheriff s office and the state police tempers are running high familial insults at a selectmen s meeting on thursday night , with beige quilts covering the windows to keep the cold out of the unheated room , members of the audience insulted each other s families and one burly man poked his finger in another s face afterwards , parker gray , the head selectman , summed up the sentiments if you took these same parties and put them in a bar , with a couple of 38 s , i think you can imagine what kind of problem you 'd have although the amount of money at stake here is small it would cost 4 , 000 to keep chief reed and his patrol car operating till the end of the year the issue touches a raw nerve in maine , where the economy has been declining and frustration over taxes has been building for two or three years , especially in poor rural areas similar concerns led two other towns in maine to eliminate their police forces last summer in one , lebanon , a town of 4 , 300 people in the southwest near the new hampshire border , an 18yearold security guard at a campground was stabbed to death while trying to stop a breakin shortly after residents voted to abolish the town s sevenmember police force in july some local and state authorities worry that more communities will follow suit next spring at their annual town meetings , new england s traditional form of town government in which financial and other major decisions are made by a vote of those attending our small towns see their police departments as discretionary spending it s not like it is in big cities where crime is a big threat , said jim damicis of the maine municipal association these towns are counting on their county sheriffs and the state police to take over the duties of their police forces , mr damicis said but the sheriffs and the state police have been hit by budget cuts of their own and are concerned that they may not be able to provide adequate assistance col andrew e demers , head of the maine state police , said , if there are any more cuts , i am afraid there will be a point where we 'll have to decide what we can do and what we ca n't town business and feuds in stockton springs , the battle over whether to keep the chief s job is typical of the fights elsewhere in maine , and , as is true of smalltown tussles , it is spiced with local feuds the conflict began at the town meeting last march when mr gray , newly elected as head selectman , proposed a police department budget of 22 , 000 , including mr reed s salary , gasoline and maintenance for his cruiser that was 9 , 000 less than was spent the previous year mr gray said he believed that the department was simply too expensive people were in a cutting mood , he recalled they had just watched as their property taxes were reevaluated , with the valuation on some waterfront land jumping to more than 100 , 000 an acre from 3 , 000 mr gray offered the chief an option take a cut in his 440aweek pay , or face elimination of his job when money ran out in september chief reed , a bluntspoken 56yearold man who some people here say would arrest his own mother , took his chances , reckoning that come september the citizens would vote to draw enough money from the town s general fund to cover his expenses but at a special town meeting on sept 26 , after two disputed ballots , the decision was no , by four votes ed marshall , a retired 69yearold traveling salesman who voted to extend chief reed s pay , said we all felt sick when we left the meeting i tossed and turned all night mr marshall said he remembered what it was like when stockton springs , a workingclass town of clam diggers and mill hands , did not have a policeman he lives across the street from the local school , and he recalled young people gathering there , drinking and swearing and breaking into the buses the drive for donations so mr marshall and some friends came up with a plan the next week , at the selectmen s meeting , after chief reed s job was terminated , mr marshall s group asked if the chief could be kept on with contributions the answer was a grudging yes , and so the chief was rehired a few minutes later in the next two days mr marshall s group raised 2 , 000 for their police officer mr marshall s team also circulated a petition , getting 242 signatures , seeking a referendum on election day that would have the town pay the rest of chief reed s expenses until the end of the year that way , under maine s form of government , the chief would automatically be kept on three more months , until the next annual meeting perhaps then , mr marshall thought , the town would come to its senses but manly shute , a barrelchested carpenter and lobsterman , was angered by the donations scheme and the referendum he saw the donations as a trick , because it forced the town to continue paying the chief s insurance 'they do n't give a darn' i'm not against the officer personally , mr shute said in an interview it s just that it s the poor people who keep paying and they do n't give a darn about the poor people so mr shute began gathering signatures for another petition , which he presented at the selectmen s meeting on thursday , calling on the town to stop the donations plan at the meeting , one supporter of chief reed shouted at mr shute , your problem is , your name is shute in a derogatory reference to mr shute s large clan of relatives in town mr marshall tried to quiet the dispute let s not get into this , he said this is a good town mr shute replied , well , it was it was halloween , and as the angry participants , including mr reed , left town hall , they noticed his cruiser it had been splattered with eggs photo the recession and rising property taxes in stockton springs , me , prompted voters to do away with their oneman police force in september some residents have since taken up a collection to keep chief ted reed on the job , until the matter is settled by referendum on tuesday \( gary guisinger for the new york times \) map of

boston , may 3 when a player assists on all of his team s four goals in regulation , it is perhaps fitting that he is rewarded with the winner in suddendeath overtime that is precisely what happened tonight to boston s vladimir ruzicka , the 27yearold native of czechoslovakia , who was acquired from edmonton two weeks into the season he scored his second goal in the playoffs 8 minutes 14 seconds into the first overtime to give the bruins a 54 victory over the penguins ruzicka s winner from directly in front , on a rebound of a shot by dave christian , gave the bruins a twogamestonone lead over the penguins in their stanley cup semifinal series the biggest goal for me , ruzicka said in his limited english the biggest night for me , he said , referring to his goal and four assists ruzicka s biggest assist was his pass to craig janney for boston s fourth goal with 3 11 left that set the stage for the overtime his other assists came on goals by cam neely , glen wesley and ray bourque janney s tying goal came after a disputed call by referee dan maroueli with 4 11 left in regulation that gave the bruins a twoman advantage for 1 42 it s tough to be in a situation with two men down so late in the game , said pittsburgh coach bob johnson but that s no excuse we had a lot of opportunities , but their goalie is playing well andy moog faced 34 shots in each of the games against the penguins and has come up the winner each time the only times he was beaten tonight was twice by mario lemieux and once each by kevin stevens and mark recchi while moog was just as sensational as he was in the 63 triumph in the opening game of the series monday night , tom barrasso s goaltending for the penguins has been nothing to rave about in the two games barrasso had some difficulty with a number of boston s 22 shots in regulation and he could have possibly prevented the goals by wesley and bourque that gave the bruins leads of 21 and 32 wesley s goal , which regained the lead for the bruins after stevens had tied the score was partly deflected by peter taglianetti s stick , but barrasso had plenty of time to react on bourque s goal , 38 seconds into the second period , barrasso was screened by a crowd in front , but the goal still appeared to be of the soft variety as it went in by his left post the penguins were creative enough in the offensive zone , but they felt the absence of paul coffey s speed in bringing the puck out of their zone and his quarterbacking on the power play while the bruins had three powerplay goals on seven attempts , the penguins had only recchi s goal for the same number of power plays they missed coffey , who has a broken jaw , more tonight than in the first game slap shots cam neely , the powerful right wing for the bruins , who scored twice in the opening game of the series , threatens to set a record for most goals in the playoffs in one season neely now has a boston record of 15 goals and it puts him ahead of the pace to break the league record of 19 goals , set by reggie leach of the flyers in 1976 and jari kurri of the oilers in 1985 mario lemieux had eight shots in the game , but none in the overtime
to the editor it was heartening to note in your sept 21 article about new york city residents who ply the east river and other of our waters for seafood that the severely polluted waters around the city are recovering to the extent that blue crabs and other marine life are reappearing in places where they would not have been found a decade ago but it was disheartening to read that anglers and crabbers are eating or selling their catches in quantity in the bronx , people can be seen daily fishing off the pelham bay landfill on eastchester bay , exposing themselves needlessly to toxic waste , heavy metals and any number of carcinogenic agents , despite bilingual warning signs and miles of fencing the same can be said for those using the east river from greenpoint , brooklyn , which sits atop a subterranean lake of gasoline that undoubtedly mixes with river water none of this makes for safe eating both eastchester bay and the east river , sealife to the contrary , are environmentally compromised any notion that because the fish are back means they can be eaten should be disabused the battles over the pelham bay landfill in pelham bay park , the largest park in the city , go back three decades , long before it was declared a hazardous waste site in 1989 , bronx borough president fernando ferrer formed the pelham bay landfill task force , which i head , a citizen group drawn from the surrounding communities of city island , coop city , pelham bay and throgs neck this followed the death from childhood leukemia of a 10yearold girl who lived near the landfill , as did five other children with the same disease , another of whom has since died the inquiries of the task force into fishing off the landfill have turned up anecdotal evidence of clams reduced to a gelatinous ooze , desiccated crabs and fish too rank to eat yet hundreds of people continue to take their catch from these waters each week at the same time , the task force has been pushing the city for adequate scientific testing to determine whether this combination toxic dump and fishing ground is the root cause of seemingly abnormal numbers of cases of autism , miscarriage and childhood leukemia among those who live and work near it so , please do n't eat the fish john c dearie member of assembly , 75th dist albany , oct 1 , 1991
roy langenberg says that people burst out laughing when he tells them he produces hats how do you make a living \? they ask but mr langenberg , the fourth generation in his family to head the langenberg hat company of washington , mo , says that the headwear business is actually enjoying a comeback no one in the industry expects formal felt hats to recapture the universal popularity they enjoyed before world war ii but most americans own many more caps and leisure hats than they realize and seem eager to accumulate more the headwear institute of america , a new yorkbased group , estimates that sales have been growing at 5 percent to 10 percent for the past few years more precise statistics are hard to come by because all the companies are small , most of them secretive and none publicly traded many manufacturers say that despite the recession , sales are still growing , driven by everything from changing fashions to the awareness that sunburn can contribute to skin cancer hat and cap makers hope that they will scarcely feel the recession because , for every customer who suddenly feels too poor to buy , others decide that they can economize by purchasing a hat instead of a complete outfit everyone was quite pleased with sales over the holidays , said susan tildesley , the headwear institute s executive director she estimated that retail hat sales will top 2 billion this year , up from 750 million in the early 1980 s , not including women s hats and odds and ends like construction hardhats the more fashionoriented 450 million women s hat business is growing 15 percent to 20 percent annually , according to casey bush , director of the millinery information bureau in new york like other apparel sectors , hat and cap makers have long been under pressure from imports the huge cap market is dominated by the chinese , who pay workers as little as 25 cents an hour with no fringe benefits or safety regulations , according to industry consultants taiwan and south korea are also major exporters an antidumping suit against china in 1988 resulted in a finding that imports were being sold below cost but failed to prove that domestic manufacturers had been harmed imported caps typically cost 20 percent to 50 percent less wholesale than domestic products , according to paramount cap manufacturing company , a bourbon , mo , concern that , according to industry executives , is probably the largest producer the industry star a cap , a logo , voila ! a promo if the era when most men went to work in fedoras , homburgs or other formal hats is long gone , the day when every man , woman , and child wears a cap for recreation may well be approaching headwear makers estimate that cloth goods , primarily baseballstyle caps , now account for as much as 80 percent of sales the biggest sellers boast logos of colleges and professional sports teams movies like batman have touched off their own cap fads long a favorite advertising medium for farm equipment companies and seed producers the beloved gimme caps billed headwear is now widely used in corporate promotions and fastfood restaurant uniforms an order for as many as 500 , 000 caps with a corporate logo is not uncommon , according to cap manufacturers but imports account for about twothirds of the business domestic manufacturers rely mostly on design abilities , nimble marketing and quick response to customers to counter the lower costs of imports none are big enough to fight back with extensive automation even the biggest just do n't have enough employees cutting cloth to justify spending 500 , 000 on something like computerized cutting equipment , said c leon sherman , president of cls associates inc , an aurora , col , company that is the headwear industry s bestknown consultant because the industry is too small to attract machine makers , it gets its new equipment by customizing devices made for other apparel makers mr sherman said that the most successful domestic cap makers have lucrative businesses , routinely building up 10 to 12week backlogs during the busy spring and summer seasons there are serious capacity shortfalls at times , he said this industry is far better off than the rest of the apparel business fads and niches boombust cycles with a vengeance hats that attract the fashion spotlight can generate big sales , but manufacturers have learned that popularity can disappear with equal speed in the most notorious modern case , the movie urban cowboy touched off a craze for cowboy hats overall hat sales nearly doubled from 1979 to 1981 , mr langenberg said but instead of the gradual retreat the industry anticipated , demand fell abruptly some people went out of business and a lot of others changed owners , mr langenberg said now , western hats are once again selling briskly , but primarily in their native regions and in other nations many of the biggest names are owned by companies that market a wide variety of hats stetson is owned by ajd corporation , an enterprise formed by irving joel , a richmond , vabased entrepeneur who has acquired several hat companies some companies try to smooth the business cycles by staying in niches kova quality hatters of brooklyn concentrates on supplying traditional black brimmed hats to orthodox and hasidic jews the market is made up of about 100 , 000 people , who buy 50 , 000 hats a year , said yaakov ehrman , the owner of kova quality it goes up with the population
washington , sept 3 a harvard study today called for presidential candidates and the television networks to agree to schedule substantial televised appearances by the candidates each sunday in the fall 1992 campaign the study , issued by the joan shorenstein barone center on the press , politics and public policy , called for two 90minute debates between presidential candidates , and one such debate between vice presidential candidates it also urged five sets of 30to40minute interviews with presidential candidates discussing the same issues with moderators and experts , and finally paired 15to30minute addresses to the nation by the presidential candidates on the sunday before election day the study s authors proposed that none of the televised appearances be interrupted by commercials marvin kalb , director of the barone center , wrote that the 1988 presidential campaign would have depressed anyone , even republicans who won he complained that the candidates , television and the press , through the use of sound bites , photo opportunities , polls and distorted advertising , had joined in the trivialization of american democracy insuring serious textured tone' he said that the proposal , if adopted by networks and candidates , would insure a serious textured tone to overall news coverage of a presidential campaign he said it would also give voters regular , predictable access to the candidates , over a sustained period of time and would set a framework for constructive televised exposure to the issues john ellis , a former fellow at the barone center and a former nbc news producer and election analyst , described the details of the nine sundays proposal , named for the number of sundays that usually fall between the traditional labor day beginning of a campaign and election day he argued that candidates rarely speak to issues and that reporters do not have the time to examine the substance of the proposals they do make moreover , he said , at the time in the fall when the public begins to pay attention , the speeches have become routine , predictable and boring to reporters , so they concentrate on the marketing and not the substance of the camapaign the news media , given its norms \( what s new \) and imperatives \( make it snappy \) , feel they have already covered what many voters , belatedly awakened , now want to know about , he wrote mr ellis said it was true , as journalists contend , that voters may say they are interested in substance but will not necessarily read or watch reports on them he said the center s proposal would focus on what television and candidates do best he said that what television does best is live coverage of the candidates and what candidates do best is campaign , debate and answer questions under the proposal , the networks would rotate responsibility for broadcasting the interview programs , which might be shown earlier on sunday evenings than the coveted 9 pm time , when the harvard institution wanted the debates and the preelection speeches to be shown it argued that abc and nbc , which have had smaller sunday night audiences than cbs , might want to carry more of the interview programs echoing many other criticisms of debates between candidates , the report called for the use of one moderator to move the arguments along and prod the candidates to debate each other , rather than the traditional use of reporters to ask them questions it also suggested that the debates be held in a studio without an audience , as was the case in 1960 but not since the barone center will hold a news conference on the report here on wednesday
east rutherford , nj , nov 10 looking at the statistics from today s game between the jets and the colts , it would appear that ken o'brien had a slightly better day than jeff george the statistics did n't exactly lie , but the scoreboard told a more important truth indianapolis 28 , new york 27 o'brien completed 23 of 36 passes for 329 yards george completed 16 of 26 for 239 yards but o'brien threw only one touchdown pass and was sacked once for an 11yard loss , while george threw three touchdown passes , breaking wide open a fivegame indianapolis touchdown drought and going sackfree for the first time in his twoyear career it s great , said george , the no 1 draft choice in the national football league last year he had been taking a lot of heat in his hometown of indianapolis as fans booed the leader of what was , until today , the national football league s only team without a victory frustrations disappear it feels like we 've won a super bowl , george said the locker room s great a lot of frustrations are gone hopefully , this was the spark we needed the colts have had enough frustrations this season to fill a lifetime besides the ninegame losing streak and the touchdown drought that dated to the fourth quarter of the sept 22 game against detroit , coach ron meyer was dismissed after an 05 start and replaced by the defensive coordinator rich venturi , now 14 and eric dickerson , the star running back , was suspended last week for the second time in two seasons today , the colts got their first glimmer that there might be light at the end of the tunnel when george , operating from the shotgun , connected with jessie hester for a 49yard touchdown pass with 1 minute 7 seconds left in the half the extra point cut the jets' lead to 147 when clarence verdin returned the secondhalf kickoff 88 yards for the touchdown that tied the score at 1414 , the colts reached double figures for only the second time this year it took the monkey off our backs , george said about breaking the drought of touchdowns and victories on the same day everybody was wondering all week just how we were going to score with eric and anthony johnson both out , or if we were ever going to score emotionally , it was super , said george , who was asked why the colts did n't risk a fine by doing more celebrating in the end zone i have my own little dance that i was planning to do , but i was so caught up in the play that i forgot to do it i asked clarence why he did n't do his dance since he had been asked to do a video with hammer and all , and he just said that everybody jumped on him and he could n't do it acquainted with hard times venturi knows what it s like to suffer through losing streaks he lost 11 consecutive games and then 20 straight games while the head coach at northwestern , his alma mater , from 197880 i just could n't be more proud of this coaching staff and the players , he said it s been a long tough week and a long tough season it has n't been an easy tenure for venturi for two of his colts losses , he did n't have the services of dickerson , the nfl s fourthleading career rusher , who had a hamstring injury dickerson returned to action for last sunday s 106 loss to miami but venturi suspended him without pay for four weeks on wednesday and fined him an extra week s pay for refusing to participate in drills on top of that , running back anthony johnson , the colts' leading receiver this year , was poked in the eye in the miami game and is out for the season but george persevered without his biggest weapons when he missed three games with a pulled muscle in his abdomen last year , some people questioned his courage , but none of those questions surfaced today even though he was n't sacked he was hit darrell davis knocked the wind out of him with a hit in the second quarter but every time he came off the turf he came up throwing we hit him clean a couple of times but he just made the plays , said pete carroll , the jets' defensive coordinator he made the plays that saved the game
futz la mama 74 east fourth street through nov 3 by rochelle owens direction , music and set design , tom o'horgan lighting design , howard thies costume design , ellen stewart set construction , jun maeda and david adams stage manager , marybeth ward presented by la mama e t c with penny arcade , john bakos , paul beauvais , peter craig , sheila dabney , kimberly flynn , tom keith , john moran , doug von nessen , jonathan slaff and marilyn roberts as much as any experimental play of the 1960 s , rochelle owens s futz symbolizes that era s gleeful embrace of rude dionysian revelry to tweak establishment sensibilities a primal yawp of barnyard poetry and song , ms owens s comic satire tells the story of cyrus futz , an eccentric farmer who is jailed and killed by the local villagers after he is seen having sex with his adored sow amanda the characters include the town tramp majorie , whom cyrus rejects in favor of amanda , and a motherfixated murderer who claims he was driven to rape and to kill after observing futz s porcine union futz created a sensation when it was performed in 1967 at la mama in a production directed by tom o'horgan , who also composed its crude , folkish score and as part of la mama s 30thanniversary celebration , that production has been revived , with mr o'horgan once again directing and several members of the original ensemble stepping back into their roles seen nearly 25 years later , ms owens s parable of sexual repression still has a compressed , blasting comic energy , although given the reactionary , aidsanxious sexual climate of the 90 s , its message is n't as direct the play s fanciful rural dialect , which suggests a bawdy expressionist answer to li'l abner cartoons , has lost none of its salt and the 11 members of the cast , including john bakos , who played futz in the original production , portray the villagers with a grunting , snorting , snoutwiggling exuberance for the revival , mr o'horgan has n't modified his ritualistic totaltheater style of direction in which the dialogue , song and choreography blend to create an orgiastic communal energy the play begins as a demented rustic chorale in which the villagers sing and play instruments that include a washboard and homemade singlestring bass and culminates in a familiar o'horganstyle tableau of the martyred futz and villagers reaching up to him as the meek , pigsmitten farmer , mr bakos projects a sly humor along with an understated poignancy but the strongest performance is penny arcade s slatternly majorie the stage has rarely held a lustier town tramp
bush administration officials say that the deteriorating situation in the former soviet union is filled with the most dangerous consequences and yet , the help they offer to arrest those trends is most modest bluntly , there is a galactic gap between the problems they say we face and what they are prepared to do about them is this a lack of vision and political courage that will come back to haunt us \? or is it good sense \? begin with one almost incomprehensible fact the russian empire , the soviet union , the center or whatever has vanished from the chessboard in its place is a commonwealth of independent republics its members , former soviet republics , asserted control of military forces on their soil but nobody knows if they have actual control they say they have united command of some 27 , 000 nuclear weapons but there is no central authority and therefore no common political control they promise to build economic relations and use the ruble to settle accounts but they have no mechanisms for doing so , and their economies are in a free fall robert gates , the director of central intelligence , called this situation the most significant civil disorder since the 1917 boslshevik revolution he told congress that the situation is dangerously unstable secretary of state james baker warned of resurgent stalinism , fascism , extremist nationalism and militarism and how did mr baker and president bush propose to respond to such dire threats \? first , they would spend the 400 million just voted by congress with absolutely no help from the white house to begin dismantling nuclear weapons good second , they would spend 100 million just approved by congress again with the white house standing by cravenly in silence to transport emergency humanitarian food and medical supplies good , again third , they would throw another 100 million into the pot to catalyze private sector involvement , whatever that means and fourth , they would convene an international conference next month to coordinate emergency relief aid this winter overdue , but in the right direction is this a plausible recipe for heading off dictatorship and militarism in the former soviet empire \? not likely , as bush administration officials privately admit but they say , and they are right , that the more relevant question is , would it work to do a lot more \? hardly anyone still advocates a massive marshall planstyle aid effort neither the commonwealth nor the republics have the organization and stability to handle that the money would simply disappear into bureaucratic pockets and foreign bank accounts there is no there there to manage megabilliondollar programs what about a smaller , multibilliondollar effort to cushion against inflation and help pay for needed imports \? ambassador robert strauss publicly asked the white house to take that gamble last week for fear of a few billion dollars going up in smoke , he said , we risk saying 10 years from now 2 billion to 3 billion in this effort could have prevented fascism that s powerful rhetoric but it is hard to see how a few billion , or even a few billion from many nations , would make a material difference in a sprawling trilliondollar economy whose financial transactions currently rest on corruption and barter i once believed in a major aid effort based on soviet performance to head off just the kind of chaos that impends i could be persuaded to go somewhat in that direction again but that depends on whether the commonwealth and republics can get their acts together first in any event , the topic should be on the agenda for the emergency conference next month none of these choices are happy ones but for the time being and belatedly , mr bush and company have zeroed in on the least wasteful , least impractical objectives rounding up the nukes , staving off starvation in big cities and helping increase energy production those goals are much smaller and less noble than preventing fascism and militarism but they are also within our means and roughly attainable to attempt more would be to stagemanage an earthquake it would be a grand gesture that would sap support for bold plans when the time might be right
calcutta , india it is received wisdom in much of the world , or at least within that part between the hudson and east rivers , that the pilots of new york city s yellow taxis face the planet s most formidable challenges to their breed the people who believe this have never visited this city there are , it is said , streets here but these tracks of undulating asphalt , mud , brick and rock more often resemble dried riverbeds than urban thoroughfares and along them lurch improbable vehicles delivery vans the shape of snapping turtles , woodframed buses of indeterminate age and health , garishly painted trucks with brass horns sounded by squashing a rubber bulb , handpulled rickshaws and pushcarts crafted of bamboo latticework and discarded tires calcutta s traffic is marked by few working stoplights , the occasional traffic officer in white uniform and leather braces , and an accepted disregard for the rules of the road potholes consume vehicles at noon , what may be the globe s largest traffic jam occurs in much of the downtown of this city of 11 million 'fast , ' as in 4 mph with india s passion for gathering statistics , it is not surprising that a researcher here contends that in 1987 the city had registered 397 , 542 fast , that is motorized , vehicles , although the average daytime velocity of those vehicles that manage to keep moving here , research has also found , is 4 miles per hour there are another 454 , 072 licensed slow vehicles , or handpropelled carts and conveyances no one even pretends to know how many unregistered vehicles stumble through the city through this maelstrom of torn fenders , automotive paralysis and wails of injustice and impatience maneuver the black and yellow ambassador taxis , lumbering hippos that seem to teeter uncertainly on narrow tires , cars modeled on the 1950 s british morris and not updated since somehow , by virtue of strength , stubbornness , a crafty sense of timing , a total obliviousness to oncoming motorists and foolhardy pedestrians , and an ability to reshape the space around them , calcutta s hacks command the streets with the arrogance of a boardroom baron these cabbies who wrestle with oversized , oddly skewed steering wheels are sinewy , loud , tobaccochewing , impulsive and rude there may be 20 , 000 of them and one , jasbir kaur , is a woman everywhere you find women working , said mrs kaur , typing , in hotels , in banks , everywhere why ca n't women have a job as a driver \?

los angeles , nov 8 for 30 years now , californians have had an implied promise from their state government a highquality and lowcost public college education for every resident who wanted it it was a promise the prosperous fastgrowing state seldom had much trouble fulfilling but suddenly the state that operates the largest system of higher education in the nation may no longer be able to honor that promise under intense pressure from a stagnant economy , all 236 campuses in the state s three public college systems face mounting troubles the vaunted 1960 master plan for higher education in california that built it all a generation ago is in jeopardy at san diego state university , where 550 parttime instructors have been let go and 662 classes canceled , more than 1 , 300 students got none of their requested courses when the semester began some have perfected the process known as crashing , by which they attend classes to which they have not been assigned and beg overloaded professors to admit them and many are freeway flying , madly dashing by car between the campus and various junior colleges trying to gain the credits they need to graduate janitorial services have been cut back so sharply at california state university , northridge , in los angeles , that students and professors in the department of communicative disorders regularly pick up brooms and mops to clean the clinic and therapy rooms many professors are typing exams in small type to save paper and using tests that can be electronically graded instead of essays to save time budgets for phone calls , copier paper and clerical help have been reduced sharply the center for studies in higher education at the university of california at berkeley can no longer afford a receptionist it keeps its doors locked and a machine takes phone calls across the bay at san francisco state university , students sit on the floor in many classes we have reached the point where the there is a fundamental mismatch between the master plan assignment and our resource base , said barry munitz , chancellor of the 20campus california state university system we are the gatekeepers for socioeconomic mobility in this state many of our students work for them to be out of a campus is to be put out of the system suddenly we are eroding the very reason we created the master plan in the first place for example , michelle l mcclure , a 21yearold junior majoring in english at san diego state , works 30 hours a week delivering packages for airborne express , and has only mornings to attend classes she requested six classes and got only one of them this semester seniors told me to go to professors' offices and beg , she said i took a day off from work , and they were not there she crashed 15 or 20 classes and ultimately got three courses , one in geology , one in history and one in women s studies none counting toward her major you end up with bizarre classes because that s all that s left , she said a notion of prosperity budget ills afflict state colleges nationally , but nowhere have they taken more urgent form than in california , where the colleges have long been the route to fulfilling the california dream of egalitarian prosperity and where the american dream has reached its broadest realization though never a guarantee , it was based on the notion that even the poorest family could send its children to college if they had the brains it s going to be awfully tough for the legislature because so many people have been telling their children if you stay through high school you can go to college , said clark kerr , the former president of the university of california , who was an architect of the 1960 master plan that is a promise people keep in mind it is almost a right now but now the california colleges find themselves under the conflicting pressures of drastic stateimposed budget cuts and a fastgrowing population , demanding more , not less , access this has posed some tough questions for california s educators and politicians shall quality be sacrificed to maintain universal access \? should faculty teach more and do less research \? should student fees vary according to ability to pay \? and can the colleges continue to serve as the economic entryway for the ethnic minorities and immigrants who have gravitated to the largest state \? on oct 17 in los angeles , the current president of the university of california , david p gardner , told the regents the system might have to raise admission standards to cut enrollments and that such cuts could stir ethnic tensions because many whites and asians might have to be refused admission if access for black and hispanic students was to be maintained climbing enrollment the california postsecondary education commission , a state agency that coordinates the activities of the disparate systems , estimates that the state s three systems will add 700 , 000 students to the 2 million they now enroll and that 37 new campuses will be needed by the year 2005 but the university of california has delayed building its longpromised 10th campus , and plans for other new campuses are now in doubt the master plan , most of which was passed by the legislature in 1960 , created three interlocking systems and established admission standards

appearing here a homey , companionable book grounded in a thoroughly domestic plot , the road to lichfield nevertheless has some unusually large themes like a number of ms lively s novels \( treasures of time , for example , or the more recent passing on \) it features grownup siblings , houses and unruly sexuality but like moon tiger and , again , like quite a few of the author s later works it is also concerned with time and memory , the workings of perception on the past and of the past on perception its protagonist is anne linton , a 40yearold suburban mother of two and parttime history instructor anne lives in a village in berkshire with her relentlessly stolid husband , don , a successful solicitor , and their two rather unmemorable children as the novel opens , anne has just learned that her elderly father , james stanway , has become ill he has checked himself into a nursing home in lichfield , a hundred miles to the north when we meet her , she is driving up to see him , a journey she repeats many times over the course of his gradual descent toward death before and after visiting hours , anne stays in her father s house in a village outside lichfield she sorts through his papers and putters around in his garden she also falls in love with one of his neighbors the affair reawakens in her a capacity for intense emotion forgotten since her early days with don , who for many years has been utterly absorbed in his career interwoven with these plot threads are others anne s slow rapprochement with her televisionproducer brother , graham a community campaign to save an ancient , tumbledown cottage from demolition and , in bits and pieces , the story of james stanway s life as in her subsequent novels , ms lively skips easily from character to character , recording the thoughts of each from his or her point of view some of the best passages detail the dreamy recollections that alternately torment and comfort stanway as he drifts in a solitary , feverish fog ms lively s style is clear and unpretentious , and all of her characters are plausible enough but , unlike those in her later novels , none manage that curious jump from the page to our imagination that makes them seem threedimensional it does n't help that anne is given to a great deal of abstract reflection on the nature of memory , experience , history and time , very little of which provokes answering thought or reflection in the reader the present does alter the past , she thinks , musing on the current juxtaposition of the endangered cottage and a new housing development i begin to see how slippery the past is , she observes further on and , still later , the trouble with the past is that it is also time transformed it gets so the reader cringes whenever the word past looms in the text in her later works , ms lively built these ideas into her stories instead of forcing her characters to articulate them of the small workings of time and perception , however , she was , in this early book , already a shrewd observer here , for example , is the first physical contact between anne and the man she will fall in love with he laid his hand for an instant on her arm , removing it almost at once so that it was only later , at another time , that she felt his touch , in the way in which recollection can sometimes be more real than experience itself and here is anne , miserably separated from her lover by a summer vacation , being driven by don through scotland sometimes , in a procession of slowmoving holiday traffic a slice of loch or mountainside would hang cinematically beyond the interiors of cars shirtsleeved drivers , clambering children , thermoses , coats and cushions as though devised simply as a backdrop for the more compelling affairs of travellers waiting in the queue for a ferry , anne stared apathetically through the window of the car to where , a few yards away , sheep slumped on the edge of the tarmac shut off by the glass , they had the clinical interest of a nature film despite the death at its center , the road to lichfield is a pleasant book too pleasant , perhaps we never feel any sense of dismay \( or wonder \) in anne at her own newly discovered capacity for duplicity and betrayal , nor does she seem particularly concerned over the fact that the affair could destroy the rest of her life moreover , despite her continual ruminations on her father s history , his decline and death hardly seem to upset her in the end , the road to lichfield is itself subject to the altering effects of the present had it appeared here in 1977 , it would doubtless have seemed a richly promising debut in the glare of ms lively s later accomplishments , however , it looks a bit pale and slight spying on death her father was out of bed again , sitting up in the armchair , wedged in with pillows , a rug across his knees beyond the closed door , in the passages , the comings and goings of the place , footsteps and voices , seemed also to abandon the neat room and the hunched figure in the chair anne wondered how far her father was conscious of all this they sat together in silence , anne read the newspaper and made out a shopping list from time to time she looked across at the old man , staring at him intently and with a kind of guilt it seemed wrong to watch him in this way , when he barely knew one was there , his head nodding , moisture creeping from his eyes , as though one were spying on his senility once , she got up and adjusted the rug that was slipping from his knees , and held his hand for a moment the fingers clutched hers from the road to lichfield drawing
minneapolis for minnesota s tom kelly , atlanta s bobby cox , pittsburgh s jimmy leyland , what is about to unfold in baseball s league playoffs will be an exhilarating ride for toronto s cito gaston , it will be another week of both agony and ecstasy to reach the world series , to win it all , are dreams he shares with the other three managers of baseball s divisionwinning teams to be able to sit and enjoy is a hope he gave up on long ago gaston , plagued by a bad back that has caused difficulty with his legs and weakened considerably by a bout of food poisoning , is in a bad way , to say the least now , for him , wanting to survive the sevengame playoff series is right up there with wanting to win it stoic and reserved when he s at his best , gaston tries to play down his current status but more and more , the circumstances under which he is operating are obviously taking a toll i'm soso , not bad , gaston said , as he invariably has since his return on sept 27 from a 33day medical leave more and more , though , he s adding painful addendums today , he said after declaring he was ok , it was all relative , anyway , because i have n't felt good in a long , long time in a 10minute news conference today , he could not stand but had to sit when he left his seat , he winced and a considerable groan could be heard by those three rows away gaston had to be helped down from a stage that was approximately two feet high when you 're back s bothering you , it makes you a different person , gaston said he talks of short fuses , of impatience , of mood swings his zombielike presence at times haunted the team and more it kind of humbled us , said tommy craig , the toronto trainer after seeing what he s gone through , this all does n't seem that difficult on the eve of the playoffs , gaston said he was not nearly as off as he once was his back has improved over what it was i get three or four hours a night , now , five if i'm lucky , he said that s a lot for a man who was once grateful for the five hours' sleep he managed during a fourday trip earlier this year still , there are rigors to be endured and the jays stand ready to evacuate him to toronto if another hospital stay and more traction are needed gaston is cognizant of the hurdles , whether it be the plane rides or something usually as harmless as walking the steps and does the metrodome have steps as taxing a physical plant as there is in the game , teams must walk 44 steps down to the field from the clubhouses the twins , sympathetic to gaston s plight , have offered him fieldlevel access through the outfield stands but gaston is trying his darnedest not to make concessions even though the justcompleted weekend series against the twins was nothing more than the obligatory mopup that comes with every season s end , gaston would not could not give up the reins not even when he stumbled into yet another illness this weekend suffering foodpoisoning saturday night and winding up in severe pain in a minneapolis hospital sunday morning six hours after he was discharged , gaston , looking more greenish by the moment , was nonetheless back in the dugout managing his team s final regularseason game it s that kind of quiet tenacity that borders on stubbornness that was perhaps lost in the glaring fact of gaston s 33game , 37day absence in the heat of a pennant race he left the team on aug 20 , four months after his back went out because of a herniated disk and accompanying sciatic nerve problems i stayed as long as i could , gaston said but , in the end , it was too much it was pain , all day and all night , he said , pain i would n't wish on anybody though he most likely needs surgery , he cannot bring himself to consider it until baseball is all done with for the year during his forced absence , gaston surprised himself only in that he was n't more of a gadfly he made no phone calls into the dugout from his hospital bed , a la billy martin , the yankees manager who phoned in advice to interim manager lou piniella during a fivegame absence in 1985 martin s calls , eventually publicized by radio stations in cleveland , prompted what seemed like half that city s population into phoning piniella during games , driving him into a frenzy no , gaston was much , much kinder to his interim replacement , gene tenace i left him alone , gaston said i figured if he was going to have to face the press alone he had the right to make his own decisions during the games the jays , under tenace , held their own , going 1914 but they started out a seasonending stretch against west division teams by losing 8 of 14 gaston returned at that point , in time for an important series against the twins the jays proceeded to win six of their final nine games as well as their second division title in three seasons under his tutelage nothing against geno , but i knew we 'd win for sure , as soon as he came back , devon white said of gaston white was one of the many jays who bristled a bit under the dick williamslike tendencies of tenace after having become comfortable with gaston s handson , persontoperson nurturing as for gaston , he was exhilarated by the return , if only for reasons of sanity the toughest part was the watching , the not being there , gaston said that was a helpless time in my life he s here , now , for better or worse , the man in the back brace , squirming in the blue jays' dugout , hoping that the winning he hopes for will offer the ultimate cure
in the 1990 s , as in the 1980 s , the most conspicuous art book is the monumental catalogue that comes with an exhibition devoted to a single indisputably great artist such a catalogue has everything in its favor it is a compendium of all that is newest and brightest \( and sometimes most tendentious \) in art scholarship thanks in particular to the entente cordiale that now links the museums of france with the museums of britain and the united states , it may well be backed by two , three and sometimes four major institutions it has in those museums an audience that may total 500 , 000 people , not to mention those who cannot get to the show but who will treasure the catalogue for a lifetime that is the context in which people have lately cherished the catalogues of exhibitions of seurat \( at the metropolitan museum in new york \) , rembrandt \( lately in berlin , and due to open in amsterdam this week \) , gericault \( now at the grand palais in paris \) , constable \( at the tate gallery in london not long ago \) and toulouselautrec \( now at the hayward gallery in london , and later at the grand palais in paris \) for the individual scholar , working on his own between four walls and with no governmental or other official backup , these catalogues are big competition but they have their drawbacks there never was an exhibition , no matter how great , that did not lack one or two key pieces what is said in the catalogue may well be superseded when the works of art actually get on the wall , all together above all , there is a large and intelligent public that prefers a consecutive , smoothrunning text from a single hand to the stops , the starts and the mingling of learned voices that are fundamental to the catalogue readers like to be in clever company , but they also like to be wooed without interruption scheherazade herself would never have made it through her 1 , 001 nights if her husband had started saying now wait a minute ! what s your authority for that \? happily , this season s books on art show that virginia woolf s common reader has not been forgotten seurat by robert l herbert with francoise cachin , anne distel , susan alyson stein and gary tinterow 459 pp \( metropolitan museum of art abrams , 70 \) seurat by alain madeleineperdrillat 215 pp \( skira rizzoli , 75 \) in recent years seurat has been much written about john rewald s pioneering study of 1943 was given a sumptuous new edition last year books , articles and dissertations have proliferated but robert l herbert , a scholar at mount holyoke college in massachusetts , has been on the track of seurat since 1958 , and it is to him that the bulk of the catalogue for the metropolitan museum show of seurat was confided mr herbert did a glorious job , as did his colleagues order and reason prevail speculations of a sociopolitical sort are kept within the limits of good sense , and so are those that have to do with gender the 230 works in the catalogue include some of the most beautiful paintings and some of the most original drawings ever produced the 14 appendices include much weighty material , and the format allows almost every painting to be shown complete on a single page ideal , one might say but there is still a place for the discursive , wellresearched and wellwritten text that sees seurat as a poet in paint , rather than a partisan of this or that political , sociological or scientific point of view that is alain madeleineperdrillat s position to some it may seem oldfashioned , and it is true that much of what he has to say in his volume on the painter could have been said by a thoughtful and widely read esthete in seurat s lifetime but that is not to say that it is out of date it may , in fact , be closer to seurat s own ambitions than many of the speculations of our own day in any case , this is a book that has both coherence and integrity and carries us with it from start to finish toulouselautrec by richard thomson , claire frechesthory , daniele devynck and anne roquebert 557 pp \( yale university , 65 \) toulouselautrec by bernard denvir 216 pp \( thames and hudson , paper , 1295 \) henri de toulouselautrec bears one of the most famous names in french 19thcentury painting , and some of his prints have become so hackneyed , and been so often travestied in reproduction , that we almost shudder to think of them by contrast , his paintings are so widely dispersed that for many visitors to the current exhibition in london , this may be the first and only time they will have access to the full range of his achievement the catalogue does a monumental job of resuscitation the smoldering indecency of many of his most famous works is shown to be incidental to the wide gamut of human sympathy lautrec had at his command letters , photographs , documents and the accounts of contemporary witnesses are all brought into play , and the result has a stately quality that may come as a surprise to many readers but as with seurat , and at a much lower price , there is a new book that marshals much of the same material in a much smaller space bernard denvir s account of lautrec and his career is a model of condensation , and it has flashes of wit that lautrec himself would have applauded
to the editor i would have hoped that an article discussing how to observe the 50th anniversary of the japanese attack on pearl harbor and not intensify antijapanese sentiments in this country and antiamerica feelings in japan \( front page , sept 1 \) would have mentioned that united states airmen had been firing for months before dec 7 , 1941 , on sight and without warning , on japanese ships and planes in the pacific you might also have referred to the body of evidence that the united states had broken the japanese code , knew of the attack in advance and permitted it to happen without alerting its commanding officers at pearl harbor or sending ships and planes to head off , or at least challenge , the japanese ships and planes all this occurred on top of a united states oil embargo on japan calculated to provoke reprisals that would overcome widespread popular opposition to the entry of the united states into the war as winston churchill testified later in the british parliament , franklin d roosevelt had secretly promised him in august 1941 , four months before pearl harbor , that the united states would go to war against japan before the year was out none of this justifies the expansionist military policies of the japanese fascists , but a true history shows that there was treachery on both sides of the attack both japan and the united states were more interested then as now in becoming superpowers than in working for justice and democracy in the world , or at home it was bad enough that the united states government \( like the japanese government \) failed to inform its citizens of much of what it was doing , and bad enough that most newspapers of the time went along in keeping the public unaware of the larger truth but must the error be repeated 50 years later \? david dellinger peacham , vt , sept 1 , 1991

in considering a plan for a high school for black and hispanic boys , the board of education appears to be embarking on a farreaching experiment to promote racial and cultural pride and transform what some see as the european slant of traditional instruction a 21page proposal circulating privately among board officials shows that the school , the ujamaa institute , is intended to be africacentered and would cultivate seven principles distilled from traditional african values , including unity , collective responsibility , economic cooperation , creativity and faith to believe with all our heart in our parents , our teachers , our leaders , our people and the righteousness and victory of our struggle , is the way the proposal defines the principle of faith the school s american history course , the proposal says , would be taught from an africanamerican frame of reference , and foreignlanguage study would include swahili and yoruba in addition to spanish a majority of teachers would be black men , a feature that has been frowned upon by the united federation of teachers a separatist outlook while some teachers have long woven black and african history and culture into the standard curriculum , there are few if any publicly financed schools that have have made such instruction the heart of their identity the proposed school could open as early as next fall , with 300 to 400 students , on the campus of medgar evers college in the crown heights section of brooklyn critics say the ujamaa school would provide indoctrination , not education they warn that it would foster a separatist outlook among young black males and hostility toward whites they 're trying to use our public schools to build and maintain racial unity , to foster socalled black selfdetermination and to expand the racial ghetto to develop cadres of politically correct thinking , ethnocentric , breastbeating racial braggarts , said michael meyers , a new jersey state education official mr meyers is director of the new york civil rights coalition , which includes the new york civil liberties union and 21 other groups he says the proposal is full of myths and halftruths and calls it fashionable , rhetorical and racist 'all people will be welcome' basir mchawi , whom schools chancellor joseph a fernandez hired specifically to plan the experimental school , rejects such charges he contends that the ujamaa institute would be a high school in which all people will be welcome and will look at many cultures but do so from the perspective of africanamerican people he said that when he used the term our struggle to explain the principle of faith , he intended it to apply to all humanity the very idea for ujamaa seems to have turned the 1950 s and 1960 s quarrels over segregation on their heads dr kenneth b clark , whose research undergirded the 1954 united states supreme court s decision in brown v board of education rejecting separate but equal schools , says that even when segregation is sought by blacks it stigmatizes children and creates feelings of inferiority but jawanza kunjufu , a chicago pioneer of the concept of schools for black boys , says urban schools are already segregated as a result of housing patterns , tracking practices and other factors so long as the class is already segregated , why not turn it into a class for winners \? he said the ujamaa institute would not exclude whites , asians or females but its raison d'etre is its concentration on young black and hispanic males , though hispanic boys seem to be mentioned only as an afterthought noting that black males are over represented in statistics on crime , drug abuse and dropout rates , the proposal says the school s strategy is to instill cultural pride in young men , create bonds among them , and inspire them with successful black adults by emphasizing the special needs of the africanamerican male , the proposal says , ujamaa institute acknowledges the fact that young africanamerican males have simultaneously become societal victims and victimizers the arguments over the school also offer a capsule version of the national debate over curriculum many critics attack socialstudies instruction for concentrating on western civilization they can be broadly divided into two camps multiculturalists , who think studies should be laced with contributions from many cultures , and afrocentrists , who think that , for black students , the curriculum should stress the african and black american heritage the mchawi proposal claims to be both afrocentric and multicultural dr gwendolyn c baker , president of the board of education , who read the proposal , was flattering at a board meeting where mr mchawi and assemblyman roger l green of brooklyn presented the plan , but she insists on a school that is multicultural seemed to disown proposal complicating the debate is the role of mr fernandez he has often seemed to disown the proposal when reporters have inquired , yet he hired mr mchawi to develop it before he came to work at the board of education , mr mchawi , 41 years old , was a teacher and administrator at two independent schools in brooklyn , uhuru sasa and shule ya mapinduzi , both closed , that he says can serve as models for ujamaa mr fernandez , evidently hoping to minimize controversy , has never publicly released the ujamaa proposal , but has issued his own memorandum that mentioned none of its afrocentric features yesterday , his press secretary , james s vlasto , said mr mchawi was being asked to draft a new plan that he suggested might not contain some of the present elements also at issue in the board s consideration of the proposal is mr mchawi s long association with robert \( sonny \) carson , a convicted kidnapper who helped organize the boycott of two korean groceries and has said he is antiwhite mr carson has also been a controversial figure in the brooklyn public schools mr mchawi says they have never had a working relationship pythagorean theorem \? in his proposal , dated dec 14 , mr mchawi defines africacentered as meaning that it is the african experience which forms the center of analysis one of the problems with much existing curriculum is the perspective bias that is often imposed in texts that view european history and culture as the paradigm by which all human experience should be measured , it reads as an illustration , mr mchawi said schools teach that the pythagorean theorem was developed by the greek mathematician pythagoras mr mchawi asserted that knowledge of the theorem existed 1 , 000 years before pythagoras , but that alexander the great sacked libraries in egypt that might have attributed it to africans the proposal has very little to say about conventional academic subjects on biology , it says only that attention will be given to great biological scientists from the african world such as imhotep , charles drew and daniel hale williams and that students would focus on the effects of certain behaviors on their bodies such as smoking crack and surviving during pregnancy on potato chips and pepsi 'the quality of life' what you have before you is a concept , mr mchawi said when asked why the plan was so skimpy on curricular details he said the school would meet all state and city requirements for a diploma the seven principles , or nguzo saba , which also include selfdetermination and purpose , mr mchawi said , were synthesized from traditional african values by a california professor , dr maulana karenga , in the 1960 s the proposal says they address things that young people need to do to improve their personal lives and the quality of life in their community mr mchawi denied that the principles might make white , hispanic or asian pupils feel excluded we talk about the universality of the ten commandments , he said it does n't mean that it would n't be applicable to other people photo basir mchawi , who was hired to plan a proposed experimental high school for black males \( the new york times \)
tokyo , oct 9 a week after apple computer put the finishing touches on a broad strategic alliance with ibm , it is quietly negotiating another major linkup , one that could blend american and japanese technological strengths this time the partner would be the isony corporation senior executives of both companies have confirmed in recent days that they have discussions under way about a new venture , but the details are closely guarded i ca n't talk about it , john sculley , apple s chairman and chief executive , said today in tokyo , other than that i am talking to ohga this week he was referring to norio ohga , sony s president and the architect of its purchase of columbia pictures in 1989 and , before that , of cbs records the discussions are taking place just two weeks before the public introduction of longawaited notebook versions of apple s macintosh computer , the first product on which the two companies have collaborated there will be several models in the line , including one made by sony the companies' goal in the current talks is to merge sony s next generation of consumer electronics hardware with apple s easytouse computer software if the alliance proceeds , it will combine the talents of two of the most innovative companies in computing and video entertainment , while providing the strongest evidence yet that the move to digital audio and video is leading to a range of new products that are nearly indistinguishable from lowend computers michael p schulhof , the vice chairman of sony usa and recently its principal strategist for the japanese company s entertainment operations , also declined to discuss the talks in detail suffice it to say that i'm hoping that we will see something by the end of the year , mr shulhof said earlier this week as he was visiting sony s headquarters here when you think about it , apple and sony are two cultures that fit each other very well apple officials said that the notebook computer was not an outgrowth of any alliance with sony , but a separate deal negotitated more than a year ago nonetheless , mr sculley said today that work on the notebook project had helped solidify the relationship between the companies people will be impressed , mr sculley said of the notebook machine he said we developed it in a short time frame we used a lot of their experience and neither of us could have done it alone indeed , apple has struggled for years to design a six or sevenpound macintosh but it failed every time , and mr sculley conceded today that the company has not been a player in the fastest growing segment of the market not as broad as ibm pact as described by several people close to the two companies , the technological alliance under discussion would not be as extensive as apple s accord with the international business machines corporation , which mr sculley today called seminal for apple that arrangement , announced in detail last week , is intended to create a range of new computer hardware and software , using a new generation of microprocessors that will be common to ibm s and apple s machines the two companies are also creating software joint ventures intended to make computers easier to use and to greatly reduce the time it takes to program them nonetheless , for both apple and sony a partnership could provide a much needed missing link toward the multimedia future apple has talked extensively about the future of multimedia technology , in which movies , video and graphics stored on cdrom s a version of compact disks as well as electronic books and other information and entertainment software would be accessible from what is termed a nomadic computer but integrating the necessary video and communications technologies will require skills in manufacturing and miniaturization that apple does not possess , and a far keener sense of how to sell a range of consumerelectronics products to people who may not view themselves as computer users we ca n't compete on the hardware , michael spindler , apple s president , said today in tokyo , discussing the company s future in consumer electronics we have to look at the core competencies of different companies and what we are good at is creating much simplified user interfaces there are a huge number of vcr s around the world , and still a lot of people who ca n't use them apple displays new software tokyo s annual trade and technology show for multimedia products opened today , and apple showed prototypes of a program it calls quicktime , which merges numerous types of video and graphics into a single computer system apple is also expected to begin publicly describing soon but not yet market a lowcost macintosh with an internal cdrom both sony and apple also have new interest in digital communications technologies engineers at both companies , for example , have talked about developing portable computers that can receive , via radio signals , huge bursts of information the morning newspaper , for example , or television news clips or electronic mail when the user flipped on the machine , the information would be there sony is also facing problems that conceivably a linkup with apple could help solve like all japanese consumer electronics companies , it is discovering that competition from elsewhere in asia is eroding the profitability of its core business the absence of new , hit products has also driven the company to seek its profits elsewhere in the movie and record business , for instance how sony might benefit by merging some of apple s computer software into a new generation of hardware , sony may be hoping to create and improve categories of consumer products one of its most innovative arrived in the american market just last month a pocketsized cdrom player , called the data discman , that stores enclyclopedias and other reference books on a tiny compact disk the discman has been a modest success in japan , even though little software is yet available and the process for searching and retrieving data is still clunky and the device has little computing or communications power sony s computer division , which five years ago seemed like one of its brightest prospects , is also in considerable disarray ever since the purchase of cbs records and columbia pictures sent sony down a new , entertainmentoriented path , its executives have tried to figure out how the computer business fits into the rest of the company sony s workstation system , called news , has enjoyed some success in japan , but none outside similarly , the company has marketed a computer that recognizes handwritten japanese characters , one of the first of the new genre of pen computers even though japanese defies keyboards , the pen technology has not taken the market by storm again , it seems , for lack of elegant software there is a major rethinking under way about how to redefine the mission of the computer division , a sony executive said recently it will take a while to sort out

although cole porter used his beloved paris as the setting for five of his 23 broadway musicals , in none of those shows was his affection for the city more palpable than in fifty million frenchmen , from 1929 a frivolous romp , subtitled a musical comedy tour of paris , the show follows a bunch of welltodo americans abroad in search of excitement , and it pokes fun at the sight of puritanical americans pining after a discreet taste of continental depravity porter s effervescent , jazzy score for the show is one of his most dazzling although it contains fewer standards than some of his other musicals , it also includes risque cult favorites like find me a primitive man , i'm unlucky at gambling and you 've got that thing its wittiest number , tale of the oyster , which some found offensive in 1929 , follows the fortunes of a bivalve social climber that is ingested by a socialite and then , in a bout of seasickness , returned safely to its home in oyster bay to celebrate porter s centennial , the french institute alliance francaise and the producer and conductor evans haile have mounted a superb concert revival of the show at gould hall \( 55 east 59th street \) fifty million frenchmen , which opened on thursday evening , will have its final performances today at 3 and 7 pm conducted by mr haile , the concert uses the original broadway orchestrations and a judiciously edited version of herbert fields s book its cast of singers , most of whom are expert intepreters of vintage broadway shows , features howard mcgillin , kim criswell , jason graae and peggy cass , among others at thursday s show , ms criswell was especially impressive singing the role of may devere with her rich , hefty voice and charismatic personality , she is as close to the young ethel merman as anyone is nowadays and her lusty renditions of find me a primitive man and i'm unlucky at gambling found a perfect balance between lubricious fun and musical sense mr mcgillin s renditions of you do something to me and you do n't know paris were characteristically strong and vibrant the evening offered a small revelation in the score s insistent jazziness many of the songs have revvedup charleston rhythms that are accented by banjo and other jazz age touches mr haile , conducting the orchestra of new england , kept the pulse light , the mood heady and musical textures finely blended
cambridge , mass , april 8 for years , an exclusive corner of this city known as the brattle street neighborhood has been a haven of safety and civility for harvard professors and boston s elite unlike boston , across the charles river , cambridge is relatively crimefree , say the police , who record an average of four murders each year violent crime , especially in this neighborhood where rockefeller family members and gov william f weld live , is virtually unheard of but last week that sense of security was broken when an unknown assailant fatally stabbed to death mary joe frug , a professor at the new england school of law , as she walked alone to the grocery store shortly after dark ms frug , 49 years old , a noted feminist legal scholar , was killed less than 300 yards from her home in the brattle street neighborhood where she lived with her husband , gerald , a harvard law school professor , and their two children that neighborhood is a very unlikely place for any kind of crime , especially one as heinous as this , said paul johnson , chief of the harvard university police , as he stood outside memorial church in harvard yard , where more than 1 , 000 people gathered today for a memorial service for ms frug this has really heightened the apprehension of the community cambridge police said there had not been a murder in the 14block neighborhood since 1973 , when a man was killed in a nearby park burglaries are more common , they said , since the stately homes often contain rare art and other precious items 'the safest area in the city' richard sevieri , a senior crime analyst for the cambridge police , described the neighborhood as the safest area in the city hours after the attack , the police found a 7inch military knife , believed to have been used in the murder , on a front lawn nearby they have also made plaster casts of a footprint found near the knife but the police have yet to find a suspect or a motive for the attack they said a white man in his 20 s was reported seen hiding in the bushes near the scene of the stabbing shortly before it occurred ms frug s purse was found near her body and did not appear to have been rifled , which has given rise to speculation that the killing was simply an act of random violence it is the perceived randomness , neighbors said , that has been the most troubling i 've been more frightened than i thought i would be , and i'm not a particularly frightened person , said rosamund zander , who lives near the corner of brewster street and sparks street , where the attack occurred the randomness of this is what is so frightening i'm the same age and the same type that she is , so it makes me think , why not two or three or four if one \? another neighbor , who spoke on condition that she not be identified , agreed i have a daughter and i have n't let her walk out at night , she said but i certainly wo n't now other neighbors spoke of two attacks last week that have further troubled them last monday a 25yearold woman , a resident of nearby linnean street , was raped in her home on thursday another woman was raped as she walked out from a nearby subway station the police said none of the three attacks are thought to be related no suspects have been arrested both cambridge and harvard police have sent extra patrols into the neighborhood to help allay fears in the meantime , residents here are mourning the death of a woman who spent her professional life fighting for the rights of battered women this is an enormous , terrible loss , said laurence h tribe , a harvard law professor who lives just blocks away my wife and i are just overwhelmed with grief this was as safe a place as one could go except in broad daylight ms frug was on a oneyear fellowship to study at the bunting institute of radcliffe college , located near the harvard campus
washington , aug 25 the cascade of political changes in the soviet union is forcing the west to consider greater financial aid , but bush administration officials and economists are uncertain which measures are most practical before tanks rolled into downtown moscow last monday , the debate over how to help the soviet economy was mired in the question of what policy changes were needed first to keep aid from being wasted by the kremlin now the declarations of independence by several soviet republics and the political ruin of so many top soviet economic managers has left it unclear how much aid is needed , who should oversee its distribution and who should get it eventually there may be a way we can help with money , president bush told reporters on saturday while playing golf in kennebunkport , maine but before that , we 've got to see reforms in the soviet union , we 've got to know who we 're dealing with in these ministries outright grants unlikely any outright grants from the united states would have to come at the expense of other programs , new taxes or a larger budget deficit , said dimitri k simes , a soviet expert at the carnegie endowment for international peace he added that as republics secede from the soviet union , unless there is someone to receive this money and distribute this money in the soviet union , the whole argument is moot shortterm difficulties aside , some experts contend that an extraordinary opportunity has emerged to help the soviet union develop a thriving economy along western lines the time frame here has now telescoped very dramatically and there s not a moment to lose , said robert d blackwill , who was the special assistant to the president for european and soviet affairs for the first year and a half of the bush administration mr blackwill is now a publicpolicy lecturer at harvard university and one of the authors of the proposed grand bargain that would provide largescale western financial assistance linked to the introduction of marketbased policies in the soviet union such proposals may be more likely now with the naming on saturday of grigory a yavlinsky , the main soviet author of the plan , to a fourmember committee charged with salvaging the economy policy changes first the united states has been more insistent than some of its european allies that soviet policy changes precede largescale assistance even before the coup , italy contended that the soviet union should be given full membership in the international monetary fund and the world bank germany has been arguing that other western countries follow its lead of promising 33 billion in the last two years , much of which has been disbursed the administraion and japan have opposed such efforts prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan and his top ministers have decided not to extend immediate largescale assistance , reuters reported today , citing the kyodo news agency fundamental economic reform should precede significant financial assistance , said an administration official who outlined the united states position on condition on anonymity two administration officials also expressed concern that squabbles between republics over their shares of the soviet debt , gold and foreign exchange reserves could imperil the country s fragile creditworthiness , which has forced it to reduce imports and impaired its ability to compete in world markets skeptics of direct aid worry more about the soviet union s financial and monetary troubles than its production problems all of the republics asserting their independence want to issue their own currencies , said steven h hanke , an economics professor at johns hopkins university who has been advising russian , lithuanian and eastern european officials on monetary issues everybody s going to start issuing rubles , none of them are going to be worth anything , and you 're going to go back to a system of primitive barter , he said administration officials and many economists inclined to provide direct aid under some circumstances agree that the soviet union needs to follow the advice of an international lending agency that has been prescribing economic policies to developing countries for a generation
trenton , jan 10 gov jim florio s administration acknowledged more bad news today the state needs to find about 800 million in cuts to balance its budget for the fiscal year beginning in july administration officials are asking labor unions to bear half the burden of finding the money the administration has told unions representing 64 , 000 of the state s 87 , 000 workers that unless they are willing to accept major concessions in salaries and benefits , 400 million in budget cuts involving workers could translate into 10 , 000 lyoffs , union and administration officials said today an administration official said that the state expected to lay off several thousand workers but that with union cooperation it could be far less than 10 , 000 a spokesman for the state s largest union reacted with anger the latest news underscored the contrast between the economic and financial outlook for new jersey in 1991 and mr florio s generally upbeat state of the state address on tuesday under the slogan new jersey works , mr florio proposed state programs to create tens of thousands of construction jobs , make mortgages available to 3 , 000 firsttime homebuyers , help middleincome parents send their children to college and reduce automobile vehicle inspections that have long irritated the public up to 20 cut vincent trivelli , legislative coordinator for the communications workers of america , the largest of several unions that met with representatives of the administration this week , said the governor s aides had said that the state had to find 800 million in budget cuts for the fiscal year beginning july 1 , and that layoffs and givebacks on the part of state workers would account for 400 million an administration official , who spoke on the condition that he not be identified , said estimates for the shortfall in the 12 billionplus budget for the fiscal year ending in june were holding steady at about 600 million he said the 800 million for the next fiscal year would require severe cutbacks , including the elimination and merging of some government departments mr trivelli said the administration had asked his union , which represents 38 , 000 employees , to give up 20 percent of their salaries , including a series of salary increases and health benefits granted under a contract signed in january 1990 we are not accepting these cutbacks , he said they would be a devastating attack not only on the living standards of our members , but for all working people in new jersey it will set a pattern that will move into the private sector mr florio s hope this week was to create programs with funds from authorities and from the federal government to aid , among others , an ailing construction industry and middleincome homeowners and parents construction jobs the governor referred in his state of the state speech to programs that his aides hope will create more than 30 , 000 construction jobs on transportation and other public works projects more than 865 million of the money is already drawn rom state and federal transportation money , officials say , and an additional 200 million would be taken from the state s transportation trust fund , which derives its revenues from a gasoline tax in addition , administration officials expect that the new jersey turnpike authority and port authority of new york and new jersey will create tens of thousands more jobs with their construction plans over the next three years but none of the money from independent authorities and the transportation trust fund could be used to close the gap in the state s budget , which pays the salaries of state employees economists say that such projects could significantly aid the construction industry , which has seen a drop in employment to 152 , 000 from 181 , 000 between july 1988 and last fall , according to employment statistics that have not been seasonally adjusted vehicle inspections a source of irritation for many new jerseyans has long been the safety and emissions tests conducted by the department of motor vehicles , which adjusted its hours this year in an economy move to make lines that were often long even longer the administration has announced that it plans to eliminate much or all of the safety inspections and turn emmissions testing over to a private contractor in hopes of making the test more efficient and saving the state 22 million it plans to eliminate testing at 3 , 900 privately run stations the plan would require cars under six years old to be inspected for emissions every other year and would centralize inspections at 30 to 40 franchised locations motorists would have to pay between 6 and 15 for inspections , which have been free at state inspection centers the administration says it plans to have the new system under way by the end of this year college savings another program mentioned in mr florio s speech was a 50 million plan to provide loans of up to 5 , 000 for college tuition , a mearsure aimed at parents with annual household incomes of 60 , 000 to 90 , 000 who are not eligible for other loans also aimed at middleincome parents was a 50 million savings bond program for people saving for their children s college educations the taxfree zerocoupon bonds could be cashed in at maturity or they could be used to pay tuition at new jersey state colleges and universities , where they would be worth 5 percent to 10 percent more than their cash value the bonds , similar to programs in about 20 other states , would be floated by a variety of independent state authorities
costello s skepticism in the other side of summer , the opening cut and first single from elvis costello s new album , mighty like a rose \( warner brothers \) , the english singer and songwriter has written what may be the ultimate antidote to traditionally euphoric funinthesun seasonal anthems from the foaming breakers of the poisonous surf to the burning forest in the hills of astroturf the other side of summer , he announces in a song that goes on to describe a world that is physically and spiritually disintegrating , mr costello even takes a swipe at john lennon was it a millionaire who said , 'imagine no possessions \? ' he asks the tone becomes even nastier with the second cut , hurry down , doomsday \( the bugs are taking over \) , a slice of sciencefiction horror whose narrator gleefully predicts that a giant insect mutation will swoop down and devour the white man s burden has the 35yearold postpunk songwriter given up on humanity , or is he just having fun playing devil s advocate \? i think that everyone has the experience on certain days of waking up , reading the paper and thinking , 'would n't it be better if man was gone \? ' mr costello said the other day in a telephone interview from his home on the outskirts of dublin the song is not saying we should kill everybody i'm hoping that by taking the blackest comedic position , there will be some kind of release from all those feelings 'the other side of summer' is not a slap at john lennon , he went on john lennon wrote some wonderful songs , but 'imagine , ' which has been so sanctified , was one of his worst he did n't think it all the way through if none of the songs on mighty like a rose could be described as happy or optimistic , none of the rest are quite so misanthropic as the first two that was intentional , mr costello said the album begins from an outwardlooking comedic perspective and moves toward a more intimate one , he explained some critics have called the record cynical , which i wholly reject i think it s a very skeptical record a cynic does not admit the possibility of hope , while a skeptic invites faith the singer pointed to the last two lines of the album s final song , could n't call it unexpected no 4 , as expressing what he means by skeptical please do n't let me fear anything i cannot explain , he sings i ca n't believe i 'll never believe in anything again the feelies at town hall we 've always had a pure idea of what type of band we wanted to be and how much we wanted to put into it , bill million of the rock quintet the feelies said the other day it does n't have to do with backing off from success , but with recognizing our limitations that may be why we 've been able to stick together for 14 to 15 years , while so many other bands have come and gone the feelies , who are appearing this evening at town hall \( 123 west 43d street , manhattan \) made their debut in their hometown of haledon , nj , in 1977 they still live in the northern new jersey town that is a 45minute drive from new york city it s where we grew up , and we 've never had an urge to move , he said although we 're occasionally recognized at the supermarket , we 're definitely not hometown heroes in 14 years , the feelies have released only four albums their latest , time for a witness \( am \) , is a musically austere record in which the guitars of mr million and glenn mercer , the band s lead singer and lyricist , interlock eloquently we 're not the type of band that gets together five days a week , eight hours a day , to practice , mr million said threefifths of the band has families , and we 've never been willing to put the band ahead of the family when we go out on tour , four or five weeks on the road is our limit we also tend to take long breaks from playing and from each other we only get back together when everyone gets the urge to play as a band again although the feelies opened for lou reed at the st james theater and for rem at the felt forum , until this evening they had never been the headline act in a large new york hall showtime is 8 pm tickets are 1850 andersen s lost album eighteen years ago the folk singer and songwriter eric andersen suffered one of the worst nightmares that could befall a recording artist the master tapes for his new record were lost shortly before it could be manufactured it could n't have happened at a worse time mr andersen s previous album , blue river \( columbia \) , had won more acclaim than any of his earlier work the tapes disappeared while supposedly en route to new york city from nashville , where they had been produced by norbert putnam , the architect of the delicate countrypop sound of blue river the loss devastated mr andersen and stalled his career he eventually left columbia records and signed with arista , which rerecorded six of the songs from the vanished tapes in 1975 but by then it was too late and the overwhelming pop production on the arista album , b true to you , often undermined the intimacy of mr andersen s quiet but intense singing in october 1989 , the longlost tapes and artwork 40 boxes of material were discovered misfiled and unmarked in columbia s new york vaults it is still unclear how they disappeared mr putnam remixed and remastered them along with three new cuts recorded in 1990 that were produced by steve addabbo , they have been released as stages the lost album \( columbia archive \) it is an impressive record , whose high point is mr andersen s philosphical meditation titled time run like a freight train mr andersen will appear tomorrow evening at the lone star roadhouse \( 240 west 52d street , manhattan \) showtime is 9 30 pm , and tickets are 12 special guests will include shawn colvin , rick danko , eric bazilian of the hooters , and jonas fjeld photo elvis costello \( arnella stein warner brothers records \)
over the last few years , as lincoln hospital expanded its clinic for the sick people who can still walk in off the streets of the south bronx , the hospital managed a small revolution the hospital s emergency room suffocated by asthma cases and heart attacks , aids and urban violence began to breathe easier the thousands of patients who needed less urgent care each month were seen separately , and did not have to wait so long but now doctors say they fear that the emergency room is about to be swamped again next month , along with 5 of the city s 10 other acutecare hospitals , lincoln is scheduled to shut down its walkin clinic because of budget cuts ordered by city hall it s so overwhelming that people do n't even talk about it anymore , one doctor , minkailu m sankoh , said as he rushed around the emergency room the other day now , instead of taking care of emergencies , you 're going to have to deal with the sore throats , the gonorrhea it s just going to be uncontrollable lincoln s walkin clinic is not a venue of high medical drama i is , however , emblematic of the hospital s struggle to dispense a modicum of primary care to one of the most medically desperate communities in the country and its potential loss is typical of the impact that doctors , nurses and administrators in the city hospital system foresee as they prepare to shut down some services when the current fiscal year ends on june 30 from a long look at how the budgetcutting has begun to affect one of the city s busiest hospitals , there is little that recalls the stereotype of chaotic wards strewn with moaning , forgotten patients as with new york s bridges and subways , the urgency of its hospitals is a matter of rust and tiny cracks and what they portend at lincoln , the signs of collapse are the dirt left by the layoff of a single custodian , the 10 , 000 skintreatment machine that sits idle because the hospital has not been replacing its bulbs still more frightening to many at the hospital are the most subtle signs the frustration rising in doctors and nurses whose paychecks have always been only partial compensation , the sense of powerlessness that among some has already begun to overwhelm their commitment to serving the poor 'the absolute bottom line' few people expect the proposed cutbacks to save much money , except in the shortest term instead , doctors say , men who might have walked in complaining of chest pains will come later , in ambulances women who give up waiting for routine mammograms will return with cancerous lumps on their breasts many patients will be unable to pay for their care , and it will end up costing the city far more than if they had been seen earlier the absolute bottom line , said lin coln s executive director , dr carlos w molina , is that more people in this community will die although the city s hospitals are well along in deciding how to reduce their services , the cutbacks are based on financing estimates contained in mayor david n dinkins s executive budget the pressures may yet be eased somewhat in final budget negotiations but from the plans that the city s health and hospitals corporation have put forth , it seems clear that the fiscal crisis will force the hospitals to ignore some basic tenets of public health it s much cheaper to treat a cold than to treat pneumonia , and i believe very firmly that we need to put our monies into prevention and primary care , the hospital corporation s president , dr j emilio carrillo , said in an interview but he added the most vulnerable pieces in this budget situation are those that generate relatively less revenue , and that s things like outpatient pharmacies and ambulatory care at a certain distance , the hospital agency s sacrifice appears relatively small under its proposed budget , the 287 billion that it is spending this fiscal year would drop to 275 billion next year the corporation s budget officials said the city s direct contribution would fall from 377 million to 116 million but the 160 million that officials say they face in hard cuts looms much larger when one puts aside the hundreds of millions of dollars over which they have no control the wages paid under union contracts , the money for basic maintenance , the cost of treating thousands of patients who have no insurance and nowhere else to turn less immediate impact as a general rule , the programs scheduled to disappear at the city s 11 acutecare hospitals are not luxuries but are those with less immediate impact on patient care at metropolitan hospital in manhattan and woodhull hospital in brooklyn , the cuts would mean an end to drug treatment programs and dental care harlem hospital center and the vast kings county hospital center would close their burncare units having laid off 20 administrative employees and having stopped using outside nurses to cover some empty slots , the city hospital center at elmhurst in queens expects to shut its diagnostic clinic , a primarycare clinic for adults and another for children
the reader s companion to american history edited by eric foner and john a garraty illustrated 1 , 226 pages houghton mifflin 35 the reader s companion to american history arrives at a moment when historical literacy about the united states is sadly neglected , and there is continuing debate about the enshrinement of a europeancentered version of the past , while excluding other cultures this companionable reference work is cause for celebration because it s readable , opinionated and even controversial some traditional historians may challenge the notion that sexual harassment in the workplace , abortion rights and homosexuality should have such prominent places in a book that must cover the entire american cavalcade there are two long essays on the feminist movement one is rooted in the first women s rights meeting , held in 1848 at seneca falls , ny , which capitalized on the experience of women in antislavery organizations the other begins with the revival of feminism in the 1960 s , including the emergence of the national organization for women and its drive for the equal rights amendment related essays on feminism cover abortion \( with a summary of the 1973 roe v wade decision \) women and the work force the triangle shirtwaist fire \( in which 146 sweatshop workers , mostly women , died in 1911 \) , and portraits of elizabeth cady stanton , susan b anthony , betty friedan and gloria steinem unlike the standard dryasdust histories , the book addresses venturesome subjects the entry on homosexuality , by john d'emilio , reads one result of the changes wrought by the gay movement was the gradual recognition that gay men and lesbians had made important contributions to american society , culture and politics in previous eras the work of such literary figures as walt whitman , willa cather and langston hughes was reinterpreted in the light of their homosexuality and the civil rights leader bayard rustin , the songwriter cole porter , the depression era journalist lorena hickok and many other notable americans of the past were gay men and lesbians whose homosexuality , though hidden , deeply influenced their sensibility , their values and their career the profiles and theme articles in the book cover today s concerns and yesterday s milestones many are about people and events the general reader may want to look up or simply know more about ralph nader and ralph ellison jackson pollock and stonewall jackson the berlin blockade and irving berlin dorothea dix and the dixiecrat party billy graham and martha graham plus the presidency , supreme court decisions and many of the basic documents of american history the nature of historical writing itself a matter of dispute among historians is included in one of the most revealing essays in history as in other fields , there s often a radical and a conventional way of interpreting the past a signed essay on history and historians by abraham s eisenstadt , a brooklyn college professor , makes a distinction between the patrician historians and the new historians historical writing took a new turn in the 1960 s to the younger historians , the united states was a land of conflict rather than consensus they emphasized pluralism the vietnam war and the civil rights movement made historians aware of the conditions and statuses of different classes of people the essay notes , american historians now wrote about prisons , churches , hospitals , mental institutions , mobility , kinship systems , social structure , public places , private places , sexuality , food , the bedroom and the nursery indeed every aspect of family life some of the new historians use computers to quantify past and present statistics , but the essay fails to add that other historians challenge the conclusions drawn from inhuman raw data one school of computerminded historians , for instance , has compared certain plantation records on cotton production and concluded that slaves must have been happy with their lot in the antebellum south but no historian using the most powerful computer can punch up and quantify the hidden power of the lash what are this generation s historians saying about the major themes running through american historical writing \? they have retreated from celebrating america s providential role among the nations , its mission as a city on a hill and the singularity and exceptionalism of its society , the essay says after watching the recent confirmation freeforall for a new associate justice of the supreme court , the book seems prescient about washington s lost exceptionalism one reason this new encyclopedia is so readable is that many of its essays are signed and not hidden behind a wall of editorial anonymity there are some 400 wellknown contributors , among them arthur m schlesinger jr on franklin d roosevelt , paul a freund on the constitution , robert l griswold on divorce , alvin m josephy jr and dee brown on indians , kenneth t jackson on public transportation , eric foner on thomas paine , john a garraty on british colonialism , james m mcpherson on the emancipation proclamation inevitably , there are surprising omissions , even considering a onevolume reference book s precious space jack kerouac and henry a kissinger are given their own entries , but there is none for e b white or adlai e stevenson by comparison , whose writings and political meaning have greater permanence \? the reader s companion to american history , edited by mr foner and mr garraty , columbia university professors and authors , is sponsored by the society of american historians , an organization that encourages literary distinction in the writing of history and biography in an introduction , the editors emphasize that the encyclopedia is designed to be read for enjoyment as well as enlightenment remarkably , it achieves both aims
almost out of money , without a job and more than 3 , 000 miles from home , bob steele was not exactly on top of the world on sept 30 , 1936 after five months in hartford , during the peak of the depression , he had decided to accept a friend s offer of a ride back to california the following day with little else to do , mr steele had a halfhour to kill before a sherlock holmes movie matinee was to start at the old princess theater on state street spotting the travelers insurance company building nearby , mr steele decided to go inside and see if he could get an audition for an announcer s job with radio station wtic i 'd already done auditions at wtht and wdrc and had n't heard anything , mr steele recalled recently if they were n't going to hire me , i certainly did n't think wtic was , since it was , and still is , hartford s main radio station state s strongest station but mr steele was in luck the station was indeed looking for an announcer and had already auditioned 13 candidates without hiring anyone after listening to mr steele s style , the station s management offered him 35 a day as a staff announcer on a sixmonth trial i make more than double that now , he said tomorrow , exactly 55 years from the day when he was hired , mr steele will do his final broadcast for wtic , whose 50 , 000watt signal makes it the state s most powerful radio station he said he is ending the longestrunning affiliation between a station and an announcer in broadcasting history fiftyfive s the limit in connecticut , mr steele said , referring to the maximum highway speed and i decided that should be my limit , too there are bound to be skeptics out there , since mr steele , who turned 80 years old on july 13 , has threatened to retire several times the first time was just before his 50th anniversary at wtic in 1986 he talked about stepping aside the following year as well whenever mr steele mentioned retirement in the past , the station s top executives , aware of his huge ratings as wtic s longtime morning man , induced him to stay on but about a year ago he told the management that he had definitely decided to sign off on sept 30 i think that turning 80 had a lot to do with it , although i feel fine , he said in his office on the 19th floor of the gold building in downtown hartford surrounded by photographs of him with scores of celebrities , especially sports figures like babe ruth and muhammed ali i got to the point where i felt i was imposing by staying around so long , and that it was time for me to move on no one at wtic pushed mr steele , who has been doing his morning show for 48 consecutive years bob made his own decision and is sticking with it , said bill white , the program director , who was born 25 years after mr steele s first wtic broadcast we would love to have him stay as a child in pittsburgh , mr white said , he was often able to pick up wtic before sunrise in those dark hours , mr white said , his interest in a radio career was sparked by the voice of bob steele mr steele has cut back on his work schedule in the past two years but when he was on the air six days a week from 5 30 until 10 am , he had the largest audience share of any morning show in the nation s 50 largest markets and he retained his popularity without changing his style while many drivetime personalities lean to insulting humor and boorish behavior , mr steele has remained a model of decorum , an old family friend with a slightly gruff deep baritone voice that both informs and entertains more than 400 , 000 listeners in 1989 , the last year he did the entire show six days a week , his share of the audience was 251 , meaning that onequarter of those listening to radio in the market were tuned to mr steele by contrast , the second largest share in the hartford area during those hours was a 126 for wticfm before fm became a factor in ratings , mr steele s share was even higher a remarkable 589 in 1973 over the years mr steele s daily audience has been estimated to include more than 400 , 000 listeners throughout southern new england , said wtic s research director , jim macpherson ross miller , vice president for special projects for the ten eighty corporation , which owns the radio station and wtictv in hartford , said bob spans generations grandchildren of people who were big fans of his back in the 40 s now listen to him with their children he s a broadcasting phenomenon whose hallmark has been consistency next to mr steele , mr miller has been with the station the longest , 45 years for two years mr steele has been tapering off or fading out , as he likes to describe it in june 1989 he began to share the morning show with tom mccarthy , who will be his replacement then in january 1990 mr mccarthy and arnold dean , the station s veteran host of sports talk shows , took over the time from 5 30 to 9 am , leaving mr steele to broadcast from 9 to 10 on weekday mornings and 5 30 to 10 am on saturdays mr dean , meanwhile , has returned to his early evening sports show
wimbledon , england , june 30 there was talk of tennis courts that swallow seeded players like graveyards there was the sort of noise that usually emanates from highschool pep rallies , rattling the dark green rafters of centre court there was a giddy mood undercutting the overcast sky the only show of normalcy at wimbledon on this historic sunday was provided by the heavens , which served up rain , and the players , who put in a routine day of work on what has traditionally been their midtournament holiday for the price of a 10pound note and a reservoir of patience in the queue , the hoi polloi was allowed to enter these hallowed grounds and make history on a firstcome , firstserved basis today as wimbledon tried to catch up on a backlogged and waterlogged schedule for the first time in the tournament s 114year history , perilous weather forced officials into a decision to play on the twoweek event s first sunday gates were opened to the public , and until a lateafternoon shower interrupted things , a tennis heyday ensued for more than 24 , 000 robust fans they do n't sit on their hands , they actually use them to clap , said thirdseeded martina navratilova who , along with the rest of the seeded women who played today , advanced to the next round amid cheers from fans who were n't shy about providing standing ovations to every player regardless of ranking it was the perfect setting for 38yearold jimmy connors who , despite his two wimbledon titles , has always seemed more comfortable entertaining a lunchpail crowd than attempting to charm royalty connors was treated like a gladiator on centre court where , after receiving but a brief stay of execution from the cloudburst , he bowed out in straight sets because of some thunderous serving and volleying by derrick rostagno the lanky and irreverent rostagno , who eliminated united states open champion pete sampras in the second round saturday and treated threetime champion john mcenroe rudely in the first round last year , used today s 76 , 61 , 64 victory to advance to the fourth round , a careerbest after five visits connors , who admitted to burning the professional candle at both ends lately in his shuttle between the tennis court and the broadcast booth , failed to handle rostagno s serve with his usual alacrity and tired badly after the firstset tie breaker the oldest contender in the men s draw , connors went away from his 101st wimbledon singles match , another recordsetter , unperturbed by the loss and intent on a return engagement next year lendl battles back thirdseeded ivan lendl , wearing his usual grasscourt grimace , created his own stay of execution today by extricating himself from a twosetstonone deficit against malivai washington , an american player who defeated him in straight sets last summer in new haven in their only previous meeting lendl , who outgritted washington in the final set after letting himself be dictated to in the first two , avoided a secondround exit that would have been his worst grand slam loss in a decade his 46 , 26 , 64 , 64 , 75 comeback improved his fiveset record to 3118 over all and 102 at wimbledon , where he is in his 12th year of chasing the only grand slam title to elude him unlike gabriela sabatini , navratilova and connors , all of whom expressed delight at the way stodgy wimbledon loosened up for a day , lendl said he was n't much interested in being a part of this departure from wimbledon tradition , which has avoided play on the first sunday since 1877 he also said he did n't consider court 2 , where former champion pat cash met an unkind fate saturday and where lendl has tumbled before , any more of a graveyard than the rest of the 18 lawns to which he is , literally , allergic i think it is just a myth , lendl , who does n't subscribe to any theory that is n't grounded in logic , said of court 2 s reputation as for making history on this sunday , lendl said he 'd find it much more meaningful to have to go to work next sunday i like playing on sundays that means you are usually in the finals , but i had a different sunday in mind , said lendl , who has twice been the runnerup here keeping under control lendl managed to survive until monday because he refused to panic in the third set , which unfolded on serve until the final game there , washington was pushed to break point by a blistering backhand service return that streaked down the line and out of reach then , he doublefaulted it s not that lendl did n't consider the possibility of losing i thought it was a remote possibility , said lendl , who next faces david wheaton , another serveandvolley specialist who has a better rapport with grass than lendl does but you can say a lot of things about me , but do n't say i quit that s the bottom line to that with the exception of one game in the fourth set , i did n't have any trouble on my serve then i started hitting some good shots when it really mattered washington agreed with lendl s assessment of the tide that turned this match , bringing the winner his 200th victory in grand slam matches i knew he was going to put up a fight , so i was trying to do everything i could do to counteract what he was doing , washington said in the last set , he just came through when he needed it he s definitely no 3 in the world for a reason mcenroe and defending champion stefan edberg , both victorious today in straight sets , will meet in the next round edberg has not lost a set here in 1991 , is riding a 15match grasscourt winning streak and is intent on winning a third wimbledon title mcenroe is merely intent on putting up a good fight last year , when i came here i could n't even say i was competitive this year , i can say that and mean it , mcenroe said
twentytwo civil war and lincoln scholars and historians released a statement yesterday saying the charges of plagiarism against prof stephen b oates are totally unfounded the charges were brought at a symposium of the illinois state historical society last fall by prof robert bray of illinois wesleyan university professor bray said parts of professor oates s 1977 biography of lincoln , with malice toward none , were plagiarized from abraham lincoln by benjamin thomas , which was published in 1952 professor oates , of the university of massachussetts , at amherst , denied the charges in a statement released yesterday , the 22 scholars and historians said , we find no evidence of the appropriation of either the ideas or the language of other scholars without attribution the only legitimate test of plagiarism signers of yesterday s statement included c vann woodward of yale university , david donald of harvard university , james m mcpherson of princeton university , john hope franklin of duke university , eric foner of columbia university and william s mcfeely of the university of georgia the plagiarism accusation is also being investigated by the american historical association professor oates has refused to cooperate with that investigation on grounds that he is not a member of the association and therefore it has no jurisdiction over him he also said the association s hearings are stacked in favor of accusers instead , in interviews and in a news conference , he had appealed to his peers to read professor bray s paper , his own response , and to make up their own minds
in 1991 , no situation comedy , ensemble drama , miniseries , movie or documentary dominated american television nor was the biggest thing on television this year a forsale sign , despite incessant rumors that one or two of the networks specifically nbc and cbs would be put up for sale instead , this was a year when the biggest thing on television was the stuff of real life , world and national events that appeared on television only because television showed up to cover them the persian gulf war , the attempted soviet coup , the supreme court confirmation hearings of clarence thomas , the william kennedy smith trial , the resignation of mikhail s gorbachev and the dissolution of the soviet union not from hollywood none of these events was a television program at all they were not anything that anyone at a network or a hollywood studio planned , wrote or produced the dominance of nonentertainment on television , several industry executives said , was at least as indicative of the changes taking place in the industry as a turnover in network ownership would have been when you walked up the hall this year , the things people were talking about , the things people were watching , were the war , the hearings , the trial , said marshall cohen , executive vice president of research for mtv networks nothing was made in entertainment that got people talking like that , he said nothing was watched in high enough numbers to get people talking part of the reason for that result , mr cohen conceded , is that people now watch television in so many different ways , because of the many options they have , that it is much harder for any piece of entertainment to cross over all the divided tastes watching separate channels but , he added , it s mainly a function of nothing being good enough what is happening to television can best be defined by broadening the category of what had impact on television this year , said david f poltrack , senior vice president of research for cbs what people watched in 1991 , he said , was information he said all forms of television connected to information enjoyed growing success , from the oprah winfrey show to reality shows like nbc s unsolved mysteries and cbs s rescue 911 , to the cable news network and cspan the trend toward informational programming was predictable , mr poltrack said , and reflected the changing makeup of the television audience as the american population ages , informational programming is what they want to see , he continued when people get to their late 30 s or early 40 s , they become more interested in news and information what has been happening in recent years to the television audience , he added , is that more members of the babyboom generation , by far the largest segment of the american population , have reached this chronological turning point the networks have found a way to take advantage of this shift by packaging news in entertainment formats news magazine programs , like 60 minutes and 20 20 , had higher ratings this year than the year before the problem for the networks is that they continue to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on entertainment programs that inevitably suffer a falloff in popularity at the same time , the networks must continue to cover the kind of news that the mass audience they seek finds compelling even though these events are often prohibitively expensive to cover nbc for example , has estimated that its losses on the gulf war alone totaled about 45 million as a result of canceled advertising and the costs of news coverage still , robert c wright , president of nbc , sees a reason for the networks to embrace the 1991 trends toward informational television network television still has the advantage of having 100 percent coverage of the country , mr wright said cnn does n't have that that still makes the difference between ourselves and cable really meaningful we just have n't yet figured out how to arrange the economics mr wright added it used to be that at the beginning of the year you would budget five , six , ten million dollars for crisis coverage everybody in the company would hope the year would go by and nothing would happen so we would n't have to spend that money now all of a sudden , we look for those moments to happen mr wright acknowledged there was some incongruity between this high interest in covering news and the painful cutbacks at the network news divisions we 've underestimated the excitement that can surround these events , he said , and we 've held back our efforts to enhance that excitement that s something we have to change financing news coverage the other thing that has to change , he and mr poltrack said , is the method of financing news coverage we have to educate the advertisers , mr poltrack said almost none of the network coverage of the gulf war included advertising , because of skittishness about potentially graphic war scenes i think some of the advertisers now realize they were foolish , he added mr wright and mr poltrack agree that the main way such a change is likely to take place is through shifting more and more regular news programs to prime time instead of interrupting entertainment programs to cover news , the networks are likely to try to steer their coverage into some established news program i expect we 'll see at least one network news program in prime time every night of the week , mr poltrack said 'we 're almost there now as the population continues to age , i'm sure we 're going to see more photo television this year was dominated by news events , from mikhail s gorbachev s downfall to anita f hill s dramatic testimony against clarence thomas before his supreme court confirmation
amid deepening concern over a shadowy new health menace , an ambitious program of mandatory tuberculosis testing in the new york state prison system began yesterday in an effort to control a drugresistant strain of the disease that has killed 13 inmates and a guard the testing program , announced by correction and health officials last week as they disclosed the deaths caused by the new strain this year , is expected to reach all 60 , 000 inmates and 28 , 000 employees in the 68 prisons by the end of december it will then become a permanent feature of life in the system , with annual tests for all and semiannual tests for those put at at high risk by other diseases but the sweeping program had a modest beginning , with tests administered only at the two prisons that had housed known victims the queensboro correctional facility in long island city , queens , and the auburn correctional facility near syracuse moreover , only 360 guards and other prison employees were tested no inmates were tested , and none were expected to be tested until next week correction officials said priority was being given to the prisons where the new strain is known to have spread , and to prison employees rather than inmates because of the danger the employees pose in spreading it to their families and communities all inmates have already been tested for tb at least once , upon entering the system we decided it was more important to focus our limited resources this week on the immediate testing of all staff members , said james flateau , a spokesman for the state department of correctional services they are the ones who go out into the community mr flateau said it would take a week to prepare the medical personnel , test kits and other equipment needed to administer an average of 2 , 000 tests daily meantime , he said , to minimize the spread of the disease , inmates with tb will not be transfered between prisons tuberculosis , an airborne disease that usually strikes the lungs and is spread by coughing and other close contacts , was brought virtually under control between 1950 and 1980 in the past decade , however , it has soared again in cities along with poverty , homelessness and aids and mutant strains unresponsive to standard therapies have arisen , including the strain blamed for the prison deaths dr george diferdinando jr , director of the state health department s tuberculosis control program , said the test to be administered the best available , though it is more than a century old is known as the mantoux test , after its french discoverer , and is far from foolproof this 'is killing people' because the test detects an immunesystem reaction to the bacteria and not tuberculosis directly , an infected person with a depressed immune system might show a false negative result , dr diferdinando said nobody knows what percentage that will be in the general population , experts say , only 5 to 10 percent test positive , but 25 percent of the state s new inmates test positive for tuberculosis the danger posed by the new strain raised expressions of concern yesterday from union leaders representing guards , counselors , medical technicians , parole officers and others in state prisons and new york city jails all pledged cooperation with the testing , but some expressed skepticism over the state s resolve i have to tell you that in my 11 years as a correction officer , i have never seen my people more scared , said thomas p kennedy 3d , president of council 82 of the american federation of state , county and municipal employees , which represents 21 , 000 correction officers , sergeants and lieutenants in the state system they 're asking , 'are my kids in danger \? is my family threatened \? ' he said this disease is killing people and i'm not confident that the state is going to act quickly and appropriately to protect our people photo an ambitious program of mandatory tuberculosis testing in the new york state prison system began yesterday mary martha mcsweeney helped employees of the queensboro correctional facility in long island city , queens , site of one outbreak , fill out forms for testing \( dith pran the new york times \)
huntington , li , may 17 a fire that killed two people and destroyed a mccrory s store in a rush of black smoke and 10foot flames at the walt whitman mall here on thursday night was the fourth suspicious fire at the store in six months , officials said today the officials said it was too early to establish the cause of the fire , which had apparently begun in the artificialflower section of mccrory s and then raced through the store as it was fueled by flammable merchandise but they said they were looking for evidence of arson and for any connection with the previous fires we 've determined this fire to be suspicious in nature due to the fact that it was a largevolume fire , said detective sgt kevin cronin of the suffolk county homicide squad the roof caves in the fire in the store began about 8 25 pm , with just over an hour left before closing , and raged until after midnight it gutted the 62 , 000squarefoot building , caused much of the roof to cave in , killed at least two people and injured 36 about 250 firefighters put out the fire an hour later , the authorities said both of those killed were store employees one victim , who apparently died of smoke inhalation and whose body was found in the basement , was identified as wayne mortak , 20 years old , of west babylon the badly burned body of the second victim , identified as eileen aylward , 27 , of east northport , was found near an escalator on the first floor officials said that until they could walk through and examine the cavedin building , still smoldering today , they would be unable to rule out the possibility that more bodies were buried in the rubble the fire broke out suddenly and seemed to engulf the store in a matter of minutes , people working in the 110store mall said witnesses in several nearby boutiques , connected to mccrory s but separate from macy s and most of the other stores in the spreadout mall , said they had heard alarms and then looked out to see a cloud of black smoke billowing toward them i thought there was a blackout in the mall , because all you could see was black , said christa casciglia , a 16yearold clerk at the children s place , a clothing store across the hall from mccrory s , recalling how she peered out into the hall after she heard customers screaming you could n't see one inch in front of your face as she struggled to shuttle children and their parents out through the back of her store , miss casciglia said , a manager from mccrory s ran in and picked up the telephone he notified his boss that he had lost his store , that it had just gone up in flames , she said just then , she heard several loud explosions , later identified as coming from the helium tanks used to inflate balloons inside mccrory s , and then ran out the back as a security guard shouted for everyone to leave there was total panic , she said those people who got out last night , i do n't know how they did it she was just panicking' miss casciglia s best friend , she said , was working in mccrory s tshirt department , which is next to the artificial flowers , when the fire broke out the friend , christina fitzpatrick , also 16 , ran through the exit , only to look behind her and see that half her department was in flames she was just panicking , miss casciglia said sergeant cronin said the fire had apparently started in the flower area , which was filled with flammable items like artificial plants sprayed with chemicals , wicker baskets and the like just below , the basement was filled with housewares and they , too , might have helped the fire spread faster , he said some store employees told fire department officials that the fire started after someone threw a cigarette into a display of plastic and silk flowers and wicker furniture huntington town officials said mccrory s had a sprinkler system in the basement , as required under the building code but because of its size and because it had ready access to the outdoors , it was not required to have sprinklers on the main floor , said patricia reiss , a town spokeswoman ms reiss said the basement sprinkler system had gone off in one of the earlier fires , extinguishing it but sergeant cronin said he did not know whether the sprinkler system had worked this time building is unstable he said the full sequence of events would not be known until the investigation was completed because the building was still unstable , he said , it might be some time before investigators could go in and examine it thoroughly meanwhile , the mall remained closed today , its power shut off by the long island lighting company so as not to endanger firefighters or investigators some stores near mccrory s had apparently suffered some smoke and water damage , although none appeared to have been burned john werthessen , the district manager for mccrory s , a chain based in york , pa that has 1 , 000 stores across the united states , said the company would try to offer jobs in other mccrory s branches to the store s 30 fulltime and 30 parttime workers he would not comment on the three earlier fires , which caused no injuries and which the police said occurred in november 1990 and in february and march of this year walt whitman mall , spread out over several acres to one side of the busy route 110 corridor , has been open since 1962 in 1984 a fire in a nearby store destroyed

new york city s fiscal problems have become so severe that mayor david n dinkins is forcing his commissioners to contemplate severe cuts that many considered almost unthinkable only a few weeks ago from eliminating the city s flagship garbage recycling program to closing scores of branch libraries while none of these cuts are final some could yet be averted by the mayor , the city council or the city s unions through concessions they emphasize anew that the city is facing its worst budget crisis since the 1970 s commissioners have been asked to consider reducing street sweeping and alernativeside parking restrictions from three times a week to two , as well sharply reduce the maintenance of the city s roads and bridges spending on social services and hospitals would be cut by 400 million officials at the city university , already beset by campus protests over proposed tuition increases , say that newly ordered cuts could lead them to shrink enrollment at twoyear colleges this would lead to further losses of tuition and state aid and deeper slashes in programs the new cuts are part of 12 billion in savings ordered by mayor dinkins including 500 million in reductions disclosed for the first time on wednesday to balance a 29 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning july 1 weekend decision due mr dinkins is to make a final decision on most of the cuts over the weekend and present his plan to the council on may 10 the cuts would be a central element of a plan to close a gap in the mayor s budget caused by falling tax revenue and spending increases yesterday , city budget officials raised their official estimate of the city s budget gap to 35 billion , a 400 million increase much of the deficit is to be closed with tax and revenue increases and service cuts announced earlier asked if mayor dinkins had ordered nightmarish service cuts , budget director philip r michael said simply , yes and the mayor acknowledged at a news conference that despite his best efforts , services could be slashed to the point where the health and welfare of the city s children is harmed one distressed commissioner said that the cuts , drafted at the mayor s request by the city s office of management and budget , had demoralized the mayor s commissioners and that many of the cuts simply could not be carried out commissioners are throwing up their hands and saying if the budget analysts at omb think we can run our agencies this way , let them run our agencies , said the commissioner , who requested anonymity if all the cuts drafted by city budget officials are carried out , there would be huge slashes in the city s work force through a combination of layoffs and attrition according to one estimate , well over 30 , 000 jobs could be at risk the parks and recreation department , facing a possible cut of 45 percent of its budget , could lose almost half of its 4 , 500 employees , one official said while city officials said they hoped the worst of the cuts could be averted , they added that most were likely to go through 20 library branches may close in practical terms , we will withdraw branch library service from 600 , 000 to 700 , 000 people , an area the size of washington or boston , take your pick , said the rev timothy s healy , president of the new york public library , which is drawing up plans to close 20 of its 82 branches mayor dinkins likened the latest round of cuts to a man standing with a 100 bill at a supermarket checkout counter , only to discover that he had 110 worth of groceries and must put 10 of the groceries back while he is doing that , his wife comes running down saying you forgot the sugar , you left out the flour , he said she is coming to add things , and he is taking things out because they already have too much that is the situation in our city what is necessary is to decide whether we really need the sugar , can we do without the butter but robert preston tisch , president and cochairman of the loews corporation and chairman of a business group , the new york city partnership , said yesterday that city officials had not done enough to date to cope with the problems businesses 'disappointed' major cuts have to be made , and major saving have to be made , he said the business community is disappointed that nothing has been accomplished to this stage he urged the city to press unions to agree to sevenday furloughs in the remaining days of this fiscal year as a way of reducing pressure on next year s budget continued disarray , he said , could lead to sharply higher taxes , which could push more and more business leaders to leave the city city budget officials carried thick notebooks listing hundreds of service cuts yesterday as they pressed their budgetcutting plans on wednesday , in a series of meetings in the basement of city hall , they ordered the heads of large city agencies to increase their budgetcutting targets by 70 percent and gave many detailed plans on how to do it yesterday the commissioners came back with their own plans mayor dinkins , his top aides and budget officials are to meet through the weekend , making final decisions about the cuts some commissioners showed up at city hall dazed over the prospect of the deep cuts ahead other commissioners , like barbara j sabol , the city s human resources administrator , were planning to appeal cuts proposed by city officials directly to the mayor her agency , which is facing 260 million in cuts , successfully averted some deep cuts planned last january through an appeal to the mayor of the 35 billion gap in next year s budget , city officials say they have already completed plans to close 22 billion of it through proposed taxes , service cuts and revenue increases the administration , facing considerable opposition from the city council on tax increases already proposed , decided to draw up plans to close most of the rest deficit through service cuts at the same time the city is working on a plan to close a 465 million gap in the remaining 10 weeks of the current fiscal year by using reserve funds , seeking concessions from labor , delaying some payments by the city and

meeting with the mayor , barry feinstein , president of local 237 of the international brotherhood of teamsters , and stanley hill , executive director of the american federation of state , county and

beijing , nov 5 throughout the 1980 s , chineseamerican relations flourished across the cultural bridges built by scholars , artists and business executives who established exchange programs and advisory councils to help bring the two nations closer now , these bridges are slowly deteriorating , not so much because china is closing its doors , but rather because american bitterness over human rights abuses in china has dried up interest many of these programs are fighting for survival , and their struggle underscores the difficulties that the chineseamerican relationship is likely to face in the future it s all part of the tremendous mood swings people suffered , going from the exaggerated rosy picture of china that americans have from time to time to the exaggerated , depressed picture that they have from time to time , and now we 're in the bottom of the swing , said jerome a cohen , a specialist in chinese law at new york university the whole picture is a very serious and sad picture students and tourists still come to be sure , many american students still come to china on exchange programs and american tourists still flood the forbidden city and the trip later this month by secretary of state james a baker , the first by such a highlevel official since the tiananmen square crackdown in 1989 , is expected to have some impact on relations with china but several prominent links between the two countries are now in trouble because of disgruntlement at the political repression in china even though those associated with the programs insist that they help foster a more democratic culture there these people worry that if the trend develops , it could create a gap in understanding that may make bilateral problems more difficult to resolve the great impetus for americans to give is a missionary impetus wanting china to change and there s a frustration that china has n't changed the way we wanted it to , said anthony j kane , codirector of the center for chinese and american studies , a program sponsored by johns hopkins university and nanjing university it s going to end up hurting sinoamerican relations in a number of ways obviously , it closes a window the sixyearold center , in the eastern city of nanjing , is one of those that is struggling it has enough money to make it through this year , but may not be able to operate next academic year the program , which has 31 american students and 46 chinese students this year , exposes the chinese to american teaching methods and materials students turned away a second major exchange , a business school program for chinese students at the dalian university of technology in the northeastern city of dalian , did not take students this academic year because it did not have enough money the united states department of commerce , which had sponsored the program by contributing 400 , 000 , used the money elsewhere organizers are trying to arrange private financing to keep the program alive the united stateschina business council , which represents the interests of american businesses in china , has lost about onefourth of its membership in the last two years the council s president , donald m anderson , says that raising money has been difficult for a variety of reasons , including the poor economy in the united states most of the money from foundations is going elsewhere often to the soviet union and eastern europe only a few of the large foundations , like the ford foundation , which has an office in beijing , continue to finance projects in china on a steady basis to raise money , programs sometimes need to be packaged as part of an asiawide effort so that china is not singled out some centers are scaling down their programs , while others are rethinking their strategies arts exchange is silent for example , the center for uschina arts exchange , which brought arthur miller s play death of a salesman to china in the early 1980 s , currently has no programs for the last two years , it has been revising its focus and approach now , it hopes to translate and distribute works about prominent western composers chou wenchung , the center s director , also said that it plans to focus exchanges but on smaller cities and counties organizers say that for the near future , they do not foresee changes in the american perception of china , which many believe is unduly negative they are confident a change in attitude will come about , but none could say when they expected that to happen it is important for americans to actually go over and see what is happening , jan c berris , vice president of the national committee on united stateschina relations , one of the organizations not in difficulty until the number of americans who have the opportunity to go increases , i am concerned that these impressions that are now prevalent in the country are going to remain
a lineup to respect q how many major league teams have had in their lineups more than two players with 35 or more home runs in the same season \? a only three , and one of them , the 1973 atlanta braves , had a lineup with three players who cracked the 40 mark dave johnson , later the new york mets' manager , cleared the fences 43 times for atlanta that season , and was joined by darrell evans \( 41 \) and henry aaron \( 40 \) that threesome accounted for 124 of the braves' 206 home runs the other two teams with three 35homer bats in the rack were also in the national league and they share the league mark of 221 homers in a season one was the 1947 new york giants , whose lineup included johnny mize \( 51 homers \) , willard marshall \( 36 \) and walker cooper \( 35 \) the other team was the 1956 cincinnati reds , with frank robinson \( 38 \) , wally post \( 36 \) and ted kluszewski \( 35 \) for all their threepronged power , none of those teams won a pennant or division title cincinnati finished third , the giants were fourth and the braves fifth rematches in finals q when duke and nevadalas vegas met in this year s ncaa semifinals , it was a rematch of the two colleges that met in last year s final has there ever been a rematch in an ncaa final \? a only once , and that rematch serves as one of only two reacquaintances among teams in ncaa championship games in other words , only twice in the 53year history of the tournament have the same colleges met for the title , and only once have the same ones done so in successive years the first duplicate pairing came in 1940 and 1953 , with indiana beating kansas both times , by scores of 6042 and 6968 the second repeat pairing involved cincinnati and ohio state , and it was a pure rematch in 1961 , cincinnati upset the defending champion buckeyes , 7065 , in overtime a year later , the same teams produced the same outcome , as the bearcats were 7159 winners records in nhl q are there any significant playoff records in the national hockey league that surpass the regularseason records \? a not really , but there is at least one regularseason best worth noting that has been matched in postseason play the record is for most goals scored by a player in one period , 4 in the regular season , there are nine players who share the mark , beginning with busher jackson of toronto in 1934 , and ranging through such players as max bentley of chicago in 1943 , red berenson of st louis in 1968 , wayne gretzky of edmonton in 1981 and bryan trottier of the new york islanders in 1982 the last player to score four goals in a period in the regular season was joe nieuwendyk of the calgary flames during an 83 victory over winnipeg on jan 11 , 1989 in the playoffs , a personal fourgoal period has been achieved twice first to do it was tim kerr of philadelphia against the new york rangers at madison square garden in a 65 flyer victory on april 13 , 1985 almost four years later , kerr s team was victimized by mario lemieux of the pittsburgh penguins , whose four firstperiod goals led a 107 victory over the flyers skating s roots q in figure skating , competitors perform jumps like the axel , the salchow and the lutz where do the terms come from \? a each is derived from the name of the performer who invented it or popularized it , with two based on a last name and the other on a first name taking first names first , the axel stems from axel paulsen , a competitor from norway early in the century whose contribution is still referred to by most national figure skating organizations as an axel paulsen the salchow jump is named for ulrich salchow of sweden , who not only created it , but also was the first man to win an olympic gold medal in figure skating \( 1908 \) as a world champion 10 times from 190111 , he consistently skated circles around his rivals the namesake for the lutz was alois lutz of switzerland , whose jumps and turns at the turn of the century also turned heads regularly
los angeles death , as hollywood cynics are prone to snipe , can be a wise career move just look at the smarties over at thirty something it s not for nothing that the show s producers have decorated the reception area of their offices with a mad magazine spoof titled thirtysuffering as in an ingmar bergman film , it s almost as if a blackhooded figure has become another character on the abc series , lurking in the background and waiting for just the right moment to strike as fate , or maybe the ratings sweeps would have it , that moment could be near on tuesday night , in an episode called second look surgery , nancy weston s doctors will determine whether her treatment for ovarian cancer has been effective though her body has been ravaged by chemotherapy her long blond hair has fallen out in huge chunks and she has taken to wearing babushkas she s still hanging in there after a year and a half the agenda for the series has always been to depict death as part of the fabric of everyday life and yet , like it or not , the hifalutin intentions of the bearded brains behind the show , the executive producers marshall herskovitz and edward zwick , pale beside the question on the minds of thirtysomething devotees does nancy live or die \? it s a question that has seeped into the popular culture not only have viewers mounted a letterwriting campaign on her behalf , but supermarket tabloids and even one men s magazine have taken to writing about the show s characters as if they were real let her live , mr producer , begged the editors of esquire last summer when they selected patricia wettig , the actress who plays nancy , as one of the women we love let her live ! but no one at thirtysomething is talking about nancy s future especially ms wettig i'm not allowed to say what happens , she said , smiling , as she sat in the dining room of her brentwood home i understand you have to ask but it will be answered in the next episode that s all i can say so hushhush is the enterprise that mr zwick said he has been running decoys people were stealing our scripts , he said publications were paying to have people sneak on our set our plot developments were appearing in print before they aired on television so we changed some pages on something and let it sort of fall into the wrong hands mr zwick said his strategy of floating dummy scripts was intended to prevent his audience from being robbed of the emotional impact at hand that the pivotal show is being served up during the ratings sweeps period is purely coincidental , he said over on soundstage 12 at the mtm lot in the san fernando valley , ken olin the actor who plays michael steadman , the director of the key episode and ms wettig s reallife husband was only slightly more forthcoming obviously , he said between takes , there is a degree of crass manipulation involved here there s no question about that there will be a refocusing of the show and that s a cool thing to know i mean , is the significant question whether nancy lives or dies , or is it to examine death as a part of life and its randomness \? the point is that gary michael steadman s best friend , played by peter horton says , sometimes there are happy endings , and sometimes there are n't' in effect , thirtysomething has served as a collective vehicle for mourning the cancer story line is not the first instance in which loss has been portrayed on the show in the first year , michael s father died in the second year , there was hope s miscarriage and the loss of michael and elliot s business by the third year , the show s creators were ready to tackle something larger the question was what this caused more dissension in our staff than anything on our show , mr herskovitz said we had huge arguments worried that cancer had only been depicted on television in a melodramatic , hokey way , said mr herskovitz , the writers first considered giving a character lupus erythematosus or inflicting harm via a car accident it sounds ghoulish and coldblooded , mr herskovitz said , but he added that it was important to analyze all the dramatic possibilities finally , they picked cancer the only reason we were resisting cancer is because we were so afraid of it , he said it carries such a huge wallop just the word itself the show s writers used susan sontag s book illness as metaphor as a guidepost they said they were less interested in exploring the medical realities of cancer than in using the illness as a catalyst to some revelation of character perhaps that is why the six episodes about nancy s cancer have been so affecting they have had as much to do with other issues as cancer itself sexuality in a marriage , sibling rivalry , a son s aggression and all of that simultaneous with chemotherapy , hysterectomy , the litany of procedures and horror of something that is potentially deadly why was it so important for the show s creators to deal with death \? our collaboration , mr zwick said simply , has been informed by loss he was referring to the death of his mother in a car accident and the death of mr herskovitz s father by cancer in addition , friends have died of aids and cancer
william b quandt political analyst brookings institution i think the palestinianisraeli talks will almost certainly begin and there will be some substance in those quickly the palestinians have the most to gain , and the best chance to score a public relations coup by looking reasonable and moderate during these talks they might even surprise everyone with specific proposals early on they want this process to succeed more than anyone else the syrianisraeli talks , obviously , are a bigger question i imagine there will be a meeting , but i do n't know where or how optimistic the parties will be to continue the real process of the israelisyrian accommodation will not be seen in official negotiation committees those responsible will probably be their intelligence services meeting in czechoslovakia or somewhere and seeing what they can agree on i would n't be at all surprised to see the conference established elsewhere than in the formal negotiating forum it s also possible to see lebanonisrael negotiations turn serious , but with a strong syrian hand reflected in the discussion i can almost imagine israel and the lebanese talking about syrian issues and the syrians plugging into that the united states has to recognize its ongoing role as a mediator the united states has to have substantial ideas to inject into the negotiating process president bush cannot go to the conference and then say , ok , now we 've done our job , we can go home and leave you to it we should present certain ideas on specific issues with the objective of trying to define what the big tradeoff will be we need to go to the parties and say , if you could get so and so , would you consider such and such \? judith kipper political analyst brookings institution the fact that the parties to the conflict are meeting in one room changes the agenda in the middle east it means de facto recognition of one another and acknowledging that they must find some form of coexistance i think bilateral talks will take place because none of the parties can refuse to go that party would be blamed for the talks' failure none of them can afford this , with the end of the cold war and each of them looking towards the united states for assistance but there will be ups and downs , walkouts , consultations , assurances , clarifications , arab summits , elections in israel every middle east postponement tactic they can use the parties to the conflict enjoy the role of victim too much and are too fearful of taking the risks necessary without mediation from the united states and the soviet union it will require powers of persuasion , new ideas , incentive , threats , the whole basket of instruments available not a specific plan , but for the united states to suggest ideas when the parties reach a deadlock everyone will take familiar positions and we will hear some vitriolic speeches and accusations of all kinds of things but the bilateral talks will start for a couple of days , then stop , and everyone will go back for consultations with their governments and leaders so clearly , the united states and the soviet union will have to have teams for handholding these negotiations mirror what has happened in the world , the transformation from the cold war to a new world order joseph sisco assistant secretary of state , 196974 i do n't accept the gloom and doom scenarios that this will break up there will be stops and starts , surprises and crises it is significant that the israelis and arabs are in the room together it is not a guarantee the conference is not going to fall apart but something happens when people get into the room together the arabs and israelis will begin bilateral relations the most hopeful dimension is in baker s framework within which israel , jordan and the palestinian residents in the west bank will focus on bilateral dialogue over some form of autonomy as reflected in camp david the general understanding is that they 'll leave the tough issues of sovereignty , borders , jerusalem and the like for the later stages my concern is really the syrian position i think syria is pivotal historically , they have been the spoiler syria made it very clear they want to play a role in three dimensions the question of the golan heights , the question of lebanon , where syria as well as israel is present , and the position that they do n't believe in separate agreements that means they are seeking to exercise a veto over israelipalestinian negotiations relative to the west bank and the gaza strip each of the parties will play to its own home audience during the talks at the outset each side will adopt totally impossible positions but even so , that will not prevent bilateral dialogue the reason is the pressures that brought them to the conference table are the same pressures that will keep them there neither side wants to affront the united states , which is at the zenith of its power in the area and everyone knows that the route to jerusalem is through washington zbigniew brzezinski national security adviser , 197781
the babyboom generation has a clean little secret it grew up watching animated films and remembers them with great , if covert , affection that secret has been the basis for two of the rare , unmitigatedly upbeat film events in recent years little mermaid , which in 1989 marked the walt disney company s first open attempt to court parents along with their children , and now beauty and the beast , in which this strategy has been taken even further in combining liveaction directorial techniques with animation , devising a story that reflects adult attitudes and recalling baby boomers' fond memories of the traditional broadway score , disney has made its target audience clear and in catering overtly to that audience while still working hard to attract children , the studio has engineered a spectacular twotiered marketing coup , one that is every bit as ingenious as the film itself beauty and the beast virtually ignores the original fairy tale and instead invents a smart , independent heroine named belle who makes a conspicuously better role model than the marriageminded disney heroines of the past belle rails against the perils of provincialism and bravely fights off wolves in the forest she is not once seen frolicking with field mice , doing housework or swooning over a new dress the film makers also concoct gaston , a handsome heman who becomes the story s villain , and who illustrates the meaninglessness of physical appearance even more aptly than the kind but scarylooking beast does like ursula the sea witch in the little mermaid , gaston is theatrical and satiric in a way that adults will best understand avoiding the usual saccharine manner in which a children s story might unfold , beauty and the beast lets these characters express themselves \( thanks to the rousing and witty score by alan menken and howard ashman \) with the gusto of seasoned broadway stars inexorably , this progressive thinking also manifests itself in the form of bigger and better salesmanship beauty and the beast has been seen in all the right places \( a topflight manhattan movie theater , a prestigious film festival \) and it has spawned an uncommonly wellplanned set of spinoff products , from knickknacks for grownups to a book any librarian would love posters , toys and even hitminded records take into account the film s anomalous nature and doubleedged appeal it helps that beauty and the beast is of such high caliber that it has already been mentioned , and not only by disney personnel , as a contender for an oscar nomination in the best picture category \( of course , disney plans some serious campaigning in that department and may have a real chance , since the rest of the oscar field looks weak so far \) it s also fortunate that an incomplete version of the film , combining line drawings with fully formed scenes , was of such great interest it became a high point of this fall s new york film festival revealing the bare bones of the film s utterly fluid animation only made the finished work that much more impressive as early as last march , a troupe that included mr menken , the singer paige o'hara \( who supplies the voice of belle \) , the directors gary trousdale and kirk wise , disney s chairman jeffrey katzenberg , and a real disney \( roy , walt s nephew , now the company s vice chairman \) met the press in new york and los angeles , showing off fragments of the film to come this tactic would have backfired if the finished product had not lived up to its promise not even the occasional bit of overkill , like ads touting this as the most beautiful love story ever told , can obscure the film s obvious merits however , now that marketing has become an art form , not even a good film can be trusted to speak for itself in this case , unusual handling was called for , and the atypical selling of beauty and the beast was apparent last week to anyone who expected to find the film at neighborhood theaters opening initially only at the sophisticated cinema i on new york s east side \( it subsequently opened at more than 1 , 000 theaters around the country on friday \) , the film could be seen in shows starting as late as 10 o'clock on weeknights this strategy worked so well that at cinema i s first evening shows , adults outnumbered children 10 to 1 on its opening day beauty and the beast grossed more at one new york theater \( 9 , 200 \) than the little mermaid had at six \( 8 , 400 \) if this kind of planning is not enough to prove that the film aims beyond the saturday matinee crowd , consider the poster art and the fact that there are two different versions one , with cheery , vibrantly colorful kiddie art , features the expected array of animated characters but there is also a darker , more muted image of beauty and the beast dancing before a silhouette of the beast s castle it is the latter , more romantic artwork that has appeared in newspaper ads , since disney knows very well who buys the tickets since the studio also knows who buys toys , tiein merchandising has also been rethought while it will some day undoubtedly be possible to buy beauty and the beast stuffed everything for children , the initial focus has been on adultoriented playthings so before cuddly likenesses of lumiere the candelabrum , cogsworth the clock and the film s other characters hit the stores , one can already find a ceramic cookie jar and teapot modeled on the motherly mrs potts \( whose voice in the film is supplied by angela lansbury \) , along with replicas of her little child , chip the cup knowing that its customers may be sentimental but are n't stupid , the manufacturer has made sure that chip is no longer missing a piece of his rim

if you 're one of the millions of americans trying to launch or advance a literary career with the mix of elation , envy , selfloathing , paranoia and arrogance that seems to be the writer s normal frame of mind you should read a few pages of george gissing s diary it is a record of 15 years , 18871902 , in the life of a victorian novelist begun when gissing was 30 years old , and ending a year before his death in 1903 , and its 500 pages of entries go by with a devastating sameness their accumulated effect seems to say this is what it amounts to thursd nov 20 dull , rainy , warm morning did nothing went to museum to get particulars of pneumonia , for reardon s death wrote from 2 30 to 9 , doing 4 pp a steamroller at work all day down in the street maddening frid nov 21 dull , rainy did 4 pp sat nov 22 my wretched birthday sunshine in morning , changing to rain am 33 yrs old letters from mother , madge and edith did 4 pp as in gissing s novels , the weather is always foul , the mood always depressed it starts to sound a little comical , woody allenish until you come across an entry that would strike any writer a blow of recognition again blank discouragement have no heart to write details and yet somehow the four pages get done , and in those 15 years gissing published 19 long books that no one reads anymore a visit to the gissing shelf in the library stacks can be almost as upsetting as a look at his diary near the bottom of a wall of english literature i found all those uniform tripledecker novels standing in a dignified row , and not one of them checked out in the last five years except new grub street , gissing s masterpiece about london literary life in the 1880 s , which he wrote in two rainy months and which has its 100th wretched birthday this year even new grub street \( the title refers to london s grub street , which , gissing noted , became known in the 18th century as the abode , not merely of poor , but of insignificant , writers \) is hardly famous , though it deserves to be , as do the odd women , born in exile , in the year of jubilee and the whirlpool gissing is thirdrate in the secondrate qualities and firstrate in the firstrate ones he has little stylistic grace \( joyce compared his style to a triestine noodle and bean soup \) , only a rare grim wit and none of the inventive energy of his idol dickens the form of the threevolume novel that set dickens free was an intolerable burden for gissing q d leavis wrote that gissing is an example of how disastrous it may be for a writer whose talent is not of the first order to be born into a bad tradition the absence of what now enables anyone in bloomsbury to write a readable novel made gissing s efforts mostly futile fill in new york or iowa for bloomsbury and that statement is even truer today the careful secondrate qualities we write and read for perfectpitch dialogue , the choice word for the choice detail for the choice nuance , luminous lyricism gissing could n't do he gets no nice effects he s worth reading for other hardwon qualities a strong empathy with almost all his characters , especially the women , broadened and deepened by a grasp of the way ideas shape experience and social forces overwhelm the individual gissing was willing to risk suffering , to face private pain and social pain , poverty and its quiet humiliations while correcting the page proofs of new grub street , he wrote to his brother i am astonished to find how well it reads there are savage truths in it even at its most graceless , his writing has a quality of deeply felt , honestly earned truth that ca n't be guaranteed by any mfa degree to write it well , he had to endure it first the wilderness of diary entries turns out to be a stamp of authenticity , the key to whatever greatness gissing has almost all his novels are about a single subject the cost of poverty and social isolation to people of intelligence and sensitivity they 're full of thinskinned novelists in garrets bright , passionate , unmarriageable young women lowermiddleclass intellectuals torn with hatred and sympathy for the poor and hatred and envy for the rich victims of a perverse , moneysoaked social order that they can neither enter nor reject orwell said , gissing s novels are a protest against the form of selftorture that goes by the name of respectability , but the protest is muted by the fact that gissing himself partly craved respectability he might have been a socialist if he 'd had more money instead , the vision is of endurance and defeat new grub street carries it to almost unbearable intensity if such concerns and lives seem dated , that helps explain gissing s obscurity he was no genius , but he was the next best thing a writer fully awake to the conflicts and illusions of his own age he understood what it meant to be alive in a time when the pursuit of money had begun to rot the moral base of daily life , even of literature yet one reason for marking the centennial of new grub street is that , on its lower frequencies , i think the novel has something to do with us because gissing s nose for corruption and personal deterioration is so strong , new grub street acts as a mirror that distorts and simultaneously reveals , at a time when there may be no one able or willing to do it , the features of a writer of anyone struggling to maintain integrity in our own age
kuwait city , june 10 the kuwaiti government has begun expelling civilian prisoners to iraq , and some of those deported apparently have been sent against their will any such forcible expulsions would be a violation of an agreement signed by all parties at the end of the persian gulf war at least 600 prisoners , including many iraqis , are being held in a jail opened about 10 days ago in the shuwaik section of town , and of these about 30 prisoners were escorted across the border sunday night more were seen arriving in the prison in shackles today kuwaiti officials said the 30 prisoners were iraqis a western official described the shuwaik center as the end of the funnel for people who are being deported , and kuwait s apparent intention is to hold prisoners in shuwaik only briefly before sending them to iraq it could not be determined , however , whether others had preceded the 30 who were expelled on sunday a protest is planned a western official said he is preparing a protest to the kuwaiti government because he believes that the deportations are forced , and therefore a violation of the accord kuwait , iraq , the united states and the other major coalition partners signed a memorandum of understanding in riyadh , saudi arabia , on march 7 that prohibited the forcible expulsion of prisoners of war or civilians prison officials' comments and interviews with family members indicate that most of the prisoners in shuwaik are bedoons , members of a group of stateless arabs who have lived in kuwait for many years without passports many bedoons have ancestral ties to areas that are now in iraq , but they do not claim to be iraqis the kuwaiti government , however , now claims that they are hiding their true nationality it is not clear whether sending the bedoons to iraq , where they may have relatives , or to other countries is technically a violation of the accord but kuwaiti officials said again and again that the group expelled on sunday night were iraqis , even after it was pointed out to them that such expulsions would be a violation no ambiguity on iraqis there is no ambiguity about the detainees who have iraqi passports many from this group may be eager to leave kuwaiti jails and go to their homeland , but some of them are known to be political exiles who would face peril in the hands of iraqi government it is not known how many of the detainees do not want to go to iraq , because they have not been allowed to meet privately with lawyers or international relief organizations but one kuwaiti official said he knew that at least some were unwilling somebody must stop this , said the official , adding that he was powerless to stop it himself some of them do not want to go some prisoners have been threatened with expulsion to iraq but may yet be released , and some have been offered the choice between going to iraq or to some other arab country , according to their family members but it appears that international relief and human rights workers may be able to help at least some of those still at the prison , now that their plight has been discovered for those who have already been deported , it is too late relief workers from the international committee of the red cross visited the jail on sunday for the first time the red cross is known to be taking their names and interviewing their families at its headquarters in kuwait , but it has not been allowed to interview the prisoners and is prohibited from discussing their cases except with the kuwaiti government prison authorities refused a reporter s request to interview the prisoners the united states has been prodding kuwait to respect the human rights of its nonkuwaiti residents in a speech on saturday , the american ambassador , edward w gnehm , urged the government not to create new victims among innocent people although some of the prisoners at the shuwaik jail have been accused of crimes such as theft , illegal immigration , or the use of fake license plates , it appears that none of them have been tried in court before being deported today , weeping women and grimfaced men who had just visited relatives inside the jail told of the deportations they claimed that some of the prisoners had been tortured by the state security police before being taken to the jail , which is managed by the interior ministry there are said to be about 50 women in the prison , although most of the women have been sent to another prison there are also some children in the jail in shuwaik
by all the old standards and stereotypes , the two high school seniors from new york city should have been perfect vulnerable targets for a college recruiting blitz maurice brown and robert blackwell do not live with their parents , who have died or left home or had problems with drugs both teenagers have notions about removing themselves , and their energized basketball games , from the gunshots that keep one of them awake at night they are ambitious and cocky , perhaps a bit too certain their skills will overwhelm all obstacles but while recruiters wooed and pursued the two standouts , while brown and blackwell dined on thick steaks and elegant shrimp cocktails during their official visits to campuses this fall , these teenagers were anything but wideeyed victims they were welleducated consumers who viewed the campus parties and fancy foods with a healthy skepticism it s all hogwash , blackwell said the best part is the eating this is november , the time of year when the nation s top high school basketball seniors eat well and commit themselves to majorcollege programs throughout the country a letter of intent , which will wed the student to a specific scholarship , must be dropped into the mailbox some time from nov 13 to 20 in these final weeks , there is a rush to judgment as each recruit experiences up to five official 48hour visits to campuses , paid for by the colleges it is a time when young men are asked to make decisions that are based , necessarily , on practiced illusion on your visit , they 're going to show you a good time , treat you like a king , said brown , 18 years old , a 5foot10inch point guard at grady high school in brooklyn you live those days up , go to the parties but you have to know it s not going to be anything like that when you get there brown will visit st john s and dine with coach lou carnesecca on saturday , then make up his mind blackwell , a 68 forward from bishop ford high school in brooklyn who was introduced by carnesecca to the chef at dante s restaurant in queens during his recent visit to st john s , has already given a verbal commitment to boston college the formal letter will follow the decisions are not being made in an information vacuum both players have had advice from high school coaches , from counselors at the gauchos basketball club , an amateur program to which they belong , and from fellow recruits who network informally at camps and tournaments the kids today are so much more sophisticated than years ago , carnesecca said they come in with a scouting report on the school they know who s competing with them at their position they know how many players graduate , whether they can make money in the area from athletics after they get out of school they 're just more in tune colleges still try to impress recruits national collegiate athletic association regulations and probations have eliminated some of the excesses , but the art of campus seduction remains intact a host college is permitted to roll out the red carpet for a bluechip prospect , for exactly two days party , game , movie blackwell , 17 , went to a party , a football game , a movie , and some fancy restaurants during his official visit to boston college brown , who enjoys partying even more than eating , said he was introduced to attractive young women while visiting duquesne you take what they give you , brown said but you ca n't forget your priorities this sort of mature talk thrills high school coaches like jack ringel of grady and ray nash of bishop ford , who have been nursing along brown and blackwell since the recruiting letters started arriving in the mail for brown , those enticements began when a letter from the university of iowa arrived at his junior high school brown was in the eighth grade a new ncaa rule this year bans colleges from sending recruiting letters to a student until he is at least a junior in high school but back then , brown was making a reputation for himself at regional camps and the mail was pouring in dear studentathlete , the form letters would begin brown would rarely bother to read the rest brown moved into a tough coney island housing project with his grandmother , 52yearold eloise britt , and two foster children when it became clear his troubled parents could not take care of him the neighborhood was bad , but the coaches came to visit anyway , because brown averaged over 21 points a game in his junior year when carnesecca showed up at carey gardens , the news traveled all over coney island in a hurry there are guns shooting every other night around my building , brown said i ca n't go to sleep without hearing gunshots but i do n't worry , because most of the guys shooting , i know when they know there s trouble , they look at me and say , 'go upstairs' they treat me different , because they know i play basketball and i have something going for me brown was recruited by dayton , until the school signed three other guards he was recruited by rutgers , duquesne , and st john s he has whittled his decision to st john s and duquesne brown is a city kid he sounds as if he wants to stay in new york , maybe take over some day for jason buchanan , the redmen s point guard you save on longdistance calls , you have family and your girlfriend at home , brown said but i'm also looking for a place where i can make a living some day a careful approach
to the editor as a composer , i read the article run into any mozarts lately \? nov 17 with interest contrasting possibilities for composers of today with those of the 18th century makes an intriguing study yet all the composers cited as examples in the article are men , and this does not address a fascinating difference between our time and mozart s as the sampling in the article seems to show , women do not immediately spring to mind as composers even to today s knowledgeable male musicians among a particularly wellinformed audience , the names of one or two women might be known fine artists though they are , these token women can hardly represent the mutiplicity of musical styles and temperaments of the thousands of women composing today but in mozart s time there were no women composers at all none with real careers or reputations no opportunities existed then for women to acquire the experience and training needed for development of the craft for male composers , our time may seem one of career frustrations and small recognition for women , building careers while even more arduous than for men has at least become possible , something inconceivable in mozart s day joelle wallach new york drawing
santiago , chile suddenly , a look at the economic map of latin america shows a startling change after a decade of no growth , crippling inflation , rising foreign debt , protectionism and bloated state payrolls , governments at least for now have found a new economic religion balanced budgets are in , as is privatization , the buzzword for selling off government enterprises negotiations to reduce foreign debt have been successful in some countries , especially mexico , and are continuing in others stabilization and discipline have become winning political slogans the free market , open economies and deregulation are now part of the vocabulary of taxi drivers and laborers in latin american cities there are signs of change everywhere in concepcion , 200 miles south of here , three new paper plants costing more than 13 billion are opening in buenos aires , the park plaza hotel is overrun with investment bankers from new york , london , bonn and paris looking for deals in lima , adventurous business executives talk with the peruvian government about its plans to sell off staterun enterprises 'committed to free enterprise' we have a country committed to free enterprise , where there are established rules , a central bank you can deal with and zero bribery , said vincent a russo , general manager of santa fe forestal y industria , a 460 million pulp plant in nacimiento , chile , that is owned by shell oil , scott paper and citicorp there s not a lot more you can ask for driving this newfound optimism and economic activity are profound policy changes that run from the rio grande to tierra del fuego the new consensus says that inflation is bad , particularly for the poor , that governments do not know how to run businesses , that printing money is political suicide and that tax evasion , a timehonored sport here , should be punished severely also , in the face of democracy s growing popularity , marxism has all but disappeared all of latin america , except for cuba and haiti , have democratically elected governments in early 1979 , argentina , bolivia , brazil , chile , ecuador , paraguay , peru and uruguay were all run by military dictatorships military governments except in chile have been unable to run stable economies huge amounts of unpaid debt borrowed over the last decade or so underscore the insolvency of those governments and their inability to meet social needs now , the only alternative seems to be to generate jobs through internal growth there has been a psychological lift for several countries , including mexico and venezuela , from the bush administration s debt reduction plan especially in mexico , the negotiation of a successful debt plan lowered the level and cost of billions of dollars in foreign commercial bank loans and eased the economic burden on a new mexican administration with the added imprimatur of aid from the international monetary fund and world bank , a successful debt reduction agreement has made mexico and some other countries more attractive to foreign investors even though both argentina and brazil have yet to frame a debt reduction agreement , the mere prospect of one has been a spur to foreign investor interest country by country in argentina , president carlos saul menem has announced a vast deregulation of his country s economy , reversing decades of protection for industries in chile , a prospering freemarket economy generated by gen august pinochet , who stepped down from office 18 months ago , has been maintained by a coalition of his successors in bolivia , the poorest country on the continent , a general and his leftist opponent have teamed up to impose tight monetary discipline and promote growth and even in peru , long plagued by poverty , president alberto fujimori has instituted a severe package of economic restrictions that are unpopular but accepted as necessary in the last two months three respected organizations the international monetary fund , the international bank for development and the united nations have all issued cautious reports predicting a new era of vigorous , through sporadic , economic growth but none of these new policies have been able to wipe out poverty in 1980 , 40 percent of the latin american population was considered living in poverty by last year , that had risen to 44 percent in peru , where the minimum wage is 50 a month , 90 percent of the people are considered to be either unemployed or underemployed in chile , five million people , or a third of its population , is considered to live in poverty what astounds economists and analysts is that the tough economic medicine continues to be popularly supported even though it has resulted in large government layoffs , a precipitous drop in the buying power of the average citizen and less spending on public needs like housing , water and electricity in both mexico and argentina the incumbent political parties won large midterm elections because of economic stability brazil plans frustrated brazil is the only country still struggling to produce a plan to stop perennial inflation president fernando collor de mello has been frustrated by an opposition congress and has failed to persuade the public that with the dole and a relaxed life on the beach , brazil will remain in the past
baseball socked it to pete rose again yesterday , and this is all to the good , naturally a special panel was convened by the hall of fame to decide whether rose should be on the ballot next year , when he becomes eligible for the first time but the committee decided to recommend a change of rules to its rubberstamp board of directors , and determined that anyone who is on the permanently ineligible list from baseball , as rose is , cannot be on the ballot this is terrific , because of course you ca n't have bums filling up that little shrine , the revered baseball hall of fame in cooperstown , ny after all , what will the little children of america make of it , that even a person with questionable character can be a good ballplayer \? we all know the fairytale that sports builds character of course it does that s why there are so many characters in the hall of fame the litany of miscreants who are immortalized in the hall has been well documented , and there is no need to go into it again here suffice to say that , while none was banished from baseball or was convicted of a felony , as rose was , they were all great ballplayers , as rose was what happened with the panel s vote yesterday is that representatives of the powers of organized baseball decided to save baseball from the defilement of having pete rose in their hall of fame influenced , in no small degree , by the people who run the hall of fame in cooperstown , as well as by the office of organized baseball though fay vincent , the commissioner of baseball , was not on the panel , he has previously indicated that he would endorse keeping the hall roseless the committee s decision superseded the position of the baseball writers association of america , which , until now , has had full authority to conduct the balloting some 450 members of the association are eligible to vote for the hall of fame and the committee s decision to in effect remove some of the power of the writers' group is a positive step , though for the wrong reasons baseball is a business , and newspapers are a business , and though the two often cross , they should be separate newspaper writers are supposed to report the news they are n't supposed to make it and when they vote for awards , they are helping to make the news more than that , the sportswriters are aiding the business of baseball , which is n't any of their business except , again , to report on and though i had voted for hall of fame members for a number of years and it was fun and relatively harmless it s still properly not my place the sportswriters were asked in the beginning of the hall , in 1936 , to vote for members , and , probably flattered , did so and have continued to the hall , as a startup business venture , needed the publicity , and who better to involve than the guys who can give you all that free ink \? the concept is a forerunner of the selection for players to allstar games get the fans involved in the voting and you 'll stir the fires of interest the more attention to the product , the more the turnstiles churn , the richer the lords of baseball get the baseball hall of fame and museum , meanwhile , is a private organization , not officially connected to organized baseball but it feeds off organized baseball , to be sure and when some hall of fame members said they might not attend the yearly ceremonies in cooperstown if rose was voted in , well , this was taken seriously by that little community , because a lot of people with families visit there regularly and stay in the motels and eat in the restaurants and buy the souvenirs in the stores that line main street if there is some taint , as they say , or some controversy , who knows what effect it could have on the hall s and the town s cash registers \? but the decision by the special panel is an object lesson for the tiny tots of america who are interested in the realities of life as seen through baseball the powers of baseball no longer trust their publicity arm of old , the baseball writers , to do the right thing , and keep rose off the ballot all of the rosehall of fame discussion , which was surely going to continue , was obviously perceived as a detriment to the business of baseball so the powers hoped , now , that this would squelch it the writers had made noises that , in a democracy , a man should at least have the right to be on the ballot the powers of baseball were n't about to test democracy in this area , and did n't want to be embarrassed by possibly having rose elected by the weird writers , who are capable , apparently , of anything , especially with a pen in their hands strange , too , that the three brandnew electees rod carew , gaylord perry and ferguson jenkins each said on wednesday that pete rose unquestionably deserves to be in hall of fame maybe there will be a new special panel to change the baseball writers' vote on those three guys , too photo pete rose \( associated press \)

the seine it is not , this turbid , turbulent waterway separating the industrial reliquiae of queens from the glassandsteel everests of manhattan yet from a window seat at the water club on an east river barge , where everything is starched and fresh and buoyant , it s easy to conjure up a romantic fantasy especially after sunset the water club may not have the aweinspiring view from the river cafe in brooklyn both are owned by michael \( buzzy \) o'keeffe nor its histrionic approach to food , but its charms are substantial nonetheless the frenchtrained chef , richard moonen , turns out eclectic and imaginative fare that is always well rooted in common sense one enters the water club via a woodpaneled bar with a hearth at one end and a long shellfish display along one wall at this time of year the top deck is a delightful spot for a cocktail or light meal the glasswrapped , twotier main dining room has sweeping views up and down the river , and there really is n't a bad seat in the house if you are sensitive to smoke be careful , for one evening we were not asked our preference and were dispatched to the smoking corner at lunch one day , zesty gazpacho enriched with chunks of lobster , avocado and onions was invigorating seafood gumbo , served in a castiron crock , packed a stealthy , smoldering heat that sneaked up in the aftertaste it was n't bad on first impression either , replete with shrimp , rice , sausage , scallops , lobster , crab meat and oysters less spicy but equally appealing were the crispy quesadillas of shrimp , which are made by wrapping shrimp , vegetables and cilantro in wonton skins and deepfrying them also compelling are the grilled shrimp with a warm potato salad flavored with tomato , roasted corn and redwine vinegar crab cakes have always been a specialty of the water club , and the moist , sweet balls of lightly browned crab served here with avocado tartar sauce are faultless for freshness to my taste , though , they could have used a blast of black pepper a good lunch starter is slices of parma ham and shaved parmigianoreggiano over excellent grilled tuscan bread housesmoked salmon is subtle and smooth with its garnish of horseradish cream , osetra caviar and blinis the water club s wine list touches many regional bases , however superficially but there are ample fine selections , primarily from california , france and italy , mostly at fair prices the service staff here runs a tight ship it is rare that you need to look up twice for a waiter , and the staff s knowledge of the food and wine is exemplary fullflavored white wines are called for with most of the seafood preparations , which are boldly seasoned swordfish , for example , is perfectly grilled , faintly pink in the center , and served with crab meat ravioli on a pool of sweet peppers , tomatoes , onions and chives pestoencrusted salmon steak , cut into a cylinder , arrives with a little christmas tree of rosemary sticking out the top it is enhanced with a bright citrus sauce panbraised grouper sounded appealing along with deepfried leeks and a chardonnayandlobsterstock sauce unfortunately , the fish was overcooked snapper under a crispy armor of herbed bread crumbs atop liberally buttered spaghetti squash was a pleasing combination and those who fantasize about escaping the heat along the coast of maine could do well with the impeccable steamed or broiled lobsters here on the meat side of the menu , barbecued pork tenderloin is tender and succulent , although i could have used more punch from the lackluster ancho chili sauce the dish came with a spirited blackbean sauce salsa and sunchoke fries lamb chops are terrific with a supporting cast of nutty toasted barley one time , and quinoa , a south american grain , the next one of the more compelling dishes at lunch is the grilled breast of capon sandwich if you have the mandibles of a crocodile , you can eat it like a sandwich , otherwise a knife and fork are needed to extricate the moist white meat , arugula , red peppers and smoked mozzarella vegetables are a la carte you should n't miss the mount vesuvius of creamy mashed potatoes laced with scallions , onions and black pepper sauteed spinach in olive oil would be fine except for the load of burned garlic heaped on top in order of preference , dessert options include a sublime flourless chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream and \( unnecessary \) mango sauce , sour cherry creme brulee , and apple tart banana bread pudding had an odd chemical taste , and peach shortcake was flossy and dry all

on tuesday , voters in the 29th city council district in brooklyn will choose from among nine candidates who have spent a total of 500 , 000 in a race for an office that will cease to exist before the end of the year most of the candidates are liberal democrats with barely distinguishable positions , but no trace of traditional party affiliations can be found on the ballot instead , the candidates are identified under peculiarly catchall and upbeat labels like people s choice and better government this special election , the second under the new city charter , is to fill the north brooklyn seat of abraham g gerges , who resigned to become a state supreme court judge the district includes all or parts of williamsburg , greenpoint , brooklyn heights , fort greene , boerum hill , bushwick and park slope council elections have generally been among the uncontested or halfnoticed sideshows of new york politics but in the future , thanks to the new city charter , they are expected to be more fiercely fought grassroots campaigning because the charter has mandated expanding the council from 35 to 51 members , the city s 35 current districts are to be replaced this summer by 51 smaller ones in time for september primaries and the november general election that will leave 16 additional seats up for grabs , and is designed to foster more grassroots campaigning the charter will also make special elections more common in the past , council vacancies had been left to each borough s council delegation to fill by appointment the charter stipulates that candidates in many of these special elections run without party identifications some democratic and republican party officials say this provision violates state election law , and the provision may be challenged before the next special election that election will be in april , to fill the queens seat of arthur j katzman , who has announced his retirement the changes were in keeping with the charter s goal of increasing the council s power , attracting members of greater political experience and making the board more representative of the city s minorities biggest issue incinerator but none of the candidates in the 29th district have previously held elective office , and all are white in one of the city s more heterogeneous districts , which is made up of hispanic residents , hasidic jews , polish emigres and blacks , as well as whites the debate over the contest s biggest issue the city s proposal to put an incinerator in williamsburg has been dominated by personal attacks those clashes culminated last week when campaign workers for one of the two selfdescribed frontrunners , joan millman , placed an advertisement in a shopper that was directed to williamsburg s hasidim and that linked her chief opponent , kenneth fisher , with the incinerator in the advertisement , which mr fisher said was printed to look like a flaming tombstone , the incinerator was referred to in yiddish as a crematorium mr fisher , a 38yearold lawyer once affiliated with a law firm that represented the developer for the proposed incinerator , now opposes the project , as do all the other candidates he denounced ms millman , a 50yearold educator and brooklyn heights district leader , for trying to associate him with the holocaust in what he called a desperate effort to diminish his strong support among hasidic voters mr fisher , who is the son of a former metropolitan transportation authority chairman , harold l fisher , and who has been endorsed by the brooklyn borough president , howard golden the bronx borough president , fernado ferrer , and the citizens union , said that the incinerator diverted attention from major issues of crime , housing and the deterioration of quality of life 'lastditch effort' ms millman , who has been endorsed by the city council president , andrew j stein , and the new york times , said that the advertisement used the word incinerator , but was mistranslated by the shopper , the advertiser , from english into yiddish she said that she would not pay for the advertisement , and that mr fisher was using it as a lastditch effort to smear me while their clashes have dominated the seemingly minimal attention paid to the race by the district s 200 , 000 residents , the seven other candidates have feverishly tried to distinguish themselves from each other and to distance themselves from what they call the politicsasusual approaches of mr fisher and ms millman because the turnout is expected to be just 10 to 15 percent , a tight race could be swung by a few thousand votes consequently , the other candidates say their intensive grassroots campaigning will help them emerge as darkhorse victors most of their fire has been directed at mr fisher s and ms millman s refusals to accept public campaign money and the resulting limits on spending candidates who accept the public matching grants are limited to spending 105 , 000 on the race mr fisher has acknowledged that he has spent more than 100 , 000 , and democrat officials say ms millman has spent about 90 , 000 it s horrendous that fisher and millman , who are slashing each other s throats in public , have n't gone for public funding , said angela battaglia , a 38yearold director of a housing center for the elderly in bushwick she has cited her long experience as an advocate on housing issues and for the elderly , and the patrolmen s benevolent association s endorsement of her candidacy for organizing block associations to fight crime most to run again lonni leavittcacchione , a longtime brooklyn heights community advocate , called ms millman a machine politician interested in patronage , and said members of mr fisher s family who have been involved in government have shot down any reforms over the years irene van slyke , a 50yearold nurse and aide to state senator velmanette montgomery , has been endorsed by new york newsday and called herself the only candidate with government experience she has advocated putting more police officers on the streets and creating park land along the brooklyn heights waterfront linda t minucci , a sevenyear district leader in greenpoint , said that she was the first to oppose the incinerator and that she has long focused on ecological damage to williamsburg and greenpoint caused by a huge underground oil spill and a toxicwaste storage center john t glick , a 41yearold tenant organizer in boerum hill who was endorsed by the village voice , called for increasing income taxes for the rich , reducing tax abatements for developers and expanding economic planning to reduce competition among new york , new jersey and connecticut the socialist workers candidate , angela l lariscy , has principally campaigned against the persian gulf war and gary s popkin , running on the anticrime line , wants to increase prison capacity cheaply , so that everyone who is convicted would be imprisoned photos kenneth fisher , another 29th district

fort lauderdale , fla , feb 28 one day earlier , don mattingly walked into the yankees' training camp to begin a new season with the same old bad back today , with rain interrupting the second day of workouts , he took on another major task looking for leadership on a club filled with young players , manager stump merrill officially named mattingly the 10th yankee captain in team history he becomes the first captain since ron guidry in 1989 merrill made the announcement to the team this morning , but he discussed the idea with mattingly in conversations during the off season 'i take it seriously' it had a chance to sink in , said mattingly , who had told none of his teammates of merrill s decision it s one of the biggest thrills and biggest honors for me in baseball i take it seriously so did the players , who offered their congratulations to mattingly before beginning a shortened workday they were n't asked to vote , but it is clear they would have chosen the first baseman , whose seven full seasons make him the senior member of the team who else could you name captain \? asked randy velarde , the infielder when you think of the yankees , who do you think of \? don mattingly it s ideal that stump did it jesse barfield said it s a good move the guys respect him and the organization respects him the announcement was one that mattingly openly welcomed , but it is also something else to shoulder besides his back troubles without him , the yankees are surely doomed to repeat their 95loss season of 1990 with him , they can hope for a firststep recovery it was no surprise wednesday that every move he made from morning stretching and running to afternoon batting practice was watched closely and cheered by fans sitting in the stands at fort lauderdale stadium something to prove this year is more challenging because a lot of things are up in the air , a lot of people are saying what i can and ca n't do , said mattingly , who turns 30 in april i 've got a lot to prove mainly that i can stay healthy and the only way i can do it is out on the field the yankees were encouraged by mattingly s impressive september , which ended a run of 47 games on the disabled list because of a bad back he played in 16 games , hit 333 and drove in 7 runs , then returned home to evansville , ind , and rested even when he resumed his workouts during the winter , he accepted the fact that he could not work as he had in the past people say i work too hard , but when you 've achieved success doing things a certain way , it s hard to tell yourself to quit working , he said i 've talked to guys who have told me you 've got to slow down the older you get i never did , but it s true that the body can only take so much how he sees role mattingly , who finished the season with a careerlow 256 average , said he did not believe his captaincy would create an additional burden more than anything , he said , he intends to act as a liaison between players and management i do n't think i 'll do anything different , he said if players have problems , i can act as a window between them and stump i 've watched guys like willie randolph and ron guidry and graig nettles , and they never did things differently they just tried to keep it loose and fun mattingly also said he would not be the sort to take punitive action if it became necessary stump sets the discipline , he said that s not my job if a guy s not doing his job , not hustling , all the guys should get on him a quiet sort in the past , mattingly has been a quiet sort , never the type to take charge at playersonly meetings and seldom pulling aside younger players for private sessions in fact , given a chance to step forward last season during a long losing streak in late may , he dismissed a suggestion that he take a leadership role today , he said that teammates who wanted to look to him for leadership need only to watch him work i 'll lead by example , he said i'm not a talker what s a leader anyway \?

norfolk , va , feb 4 pipe bombs were discovered today at the base of two storage tanks filled with several million gallons of highly combustible and toxic commercial chemicals , but demolition experts disarmed them before they could explode and possibly endanger nearby navy shipyards the police said they did not know who planted the bombs or whether the incident might be an act of attempted terrorism the norfolk area holds some of the nation s most important military complexes , including the huge norfolk naval base , home of the atlantic fleet the tanks are owned by allied terminals inc , a norfolk company that stores and hauls petroleum and chemical products for other companies one tank contained about a million gallons of methanol , a chemical the authorities said could have created a major fire had it exploded the other contained a similar amount of sodium sulphate , which the authorities said could have loosed a toxic cloud had it exploded a milesquare area around the tanks was evacuated while demolition teams removed and disarmed the bombs , described by the police as clutches of pipes filled with explosives and hooked to detonators and timing devices there was no word on whether the timers were ticking when an allied worker making a routine inspection spotted the bombs at the base of the tanks , shortly before 8 am residents allowed to return in late afternoon , after both bombs had been removed and disarmed , residents near the tank farm were permitted to return home the authorities were unable to say how many people were affected by the evacuation the allied tank farm is on the eastern branch of the elizabeth river , about two miles from the center of downtown norfolk and even closer to a number of commercial dockyards that do major work on navy warships the norfolk naval base , one of the largest in the world , is about five miles northwest of allied shortly after the bombs were discovered the operator of another commercial tank farm nearby received a call warning that bombs also had been planted there none were found some federal investigators familiar with details of the case said that pipe bombs tend to be relatively crude and ineffective devices and are not a preferred tool of experienced terrorists the investigators were careful not to rule out the possibility of iraqi terrorism but they reported that american intelligence agencies had no indications that the norfolk area was a target of iraqi agents at least 35 , 000 military personnel and scores of warships and fighting planes have been sent from here to the middle east war zone the question is who figuring out who planted the bombs is now the milliondollar question , said officer larry hill , a spokesman for the norfolk police department we just do n't know at this point and i ca n't characterize how sophisticated or crude the devices were what we do know is that if the bombs had gone off , we might have had a lot of fire and a lot of toxic smoke kirk j woodruff , executive vice president of allied , said , we 're as puzzled as anyone at being the target of the bombs he said allied had had no labor problems , adding that the company would increase security measures the company does not have military contracts in disarming the bombs , consisting of two pipes in one instance and four in the other , the authorities salvaged as many parts of the devices as they safely could for later investigation , then blew up what remained in nearby open areas in washington , the federal bureau of investigation issued a statement in which it said it was in a response mood and had taken the lead in the investigation of the incident because of the potential for a terrorist nexus no claims of responsibility but bureau officials would provide no further details other than to report that , as of late today , no individual or group had claimed responsibility for planting the explosives it s too early to say anything else , said steve markardt , a bureau spokesman security at all military bases in the norfolk area has been tightened since fighting began in the middle east while the pipe bombs were being removed today , business continued as usual at the bases and in norfolk , excluding the evacuated area around the allied tank farm photo smoke rising from pipe bombs that were removed from tanks and detonated in a norfolk cemetery \( associated press \) map map of virginia showing location in norfolk of site of bombs
bezenik , iraq , april 30 high above bezenik , a littered junkyard of a highland meadow that looks across a deep valley to the turkish border , iraqi refugees trekking homeward resemble a stream of overburdened ants alone and in families , the refugees slowly file along narrow mountain paths some set up camp here to wait for rides along the rutted dirt road that leads toward zakho and the americanbuilt tent city about 25 miles away others pause before trudging onward a 21yearold kurdish mechanic from zakho and his 17yearold wife , who requested anonymity because they still fear the revenge of saddam hussein s troops , said they struggled for eight hours this morning to cross the mountains to bezenik from a refugee encampment in turkey traveling light the couple carried only two small bundles one was a bedroll the other their tiny , puffyfaced daughter , who has spent all but three of her 37 days in this world cradled in her mother s arms as she climbed rocky massifs , sloshed through cold , soupy mud , and endured hunger and thirst we were afraid because the news in zakho was that when the soldiers arrived they would kill the babies , the families , the kurds , the mechanic said everyone was afraid now , thanks to a large allied military presence in northern iraq , the kurds' fears have subsided on foot , on donkey back , and huddled in trucks and tractordrawn wagons and buses , iraqi refugees who have camped for a month on the mountainsides along the turkish border are going home to iraq in droves clearing out guerrillas the movement comes just a day after allied military leaders convinced kurdish guerrillas to begin allowing refugees to pass their mountain checkpoints about 500 , 000 kurds , turkomans , assyrian christians and members of other ethnic and religious groups fled northern iraq to the mountains about a month ago after mr hussein crushed the kurdish uprising i am very , very happy , said feyruz mohammed saleh , a 35yearold english teacher and mother of two children , loading her family s belongings into a dusty white pickup truck we are going to a tent to the americans but she said she had no plans to return soon to her hometown , dohuk , a town about 40 miles south of zakho that was heavily damaged by iraqi troops the soldiers still occupy it they say the soldiers have stolen everything from our house , she said i do n't know when we will be able to return hope springs repeatedly despite repeated statements by the united states and its allies that their military presence in northern iraq will be temporary , mrs saleh and many other kurds cling to hopes that the allies will protect them indefinitely and oversee the creation of an independent kurdistan i am not afraid that the americans will leave , she said they are good a traveler walking in the opposite direction , mohammed ali sumel , said he was going back over the mountain to fetch his wife and children kurdistan , bushistan , america good , he said i would be happy to return to rebuild dohuk , said kemal sadiq , a construction worker i would like to go back if there is a free kurdistan and , oh yes , there will be free kurdistan french and british help just a slow trickle two days ago , the flow of returning refugees has now increased many times over we 've seen 500 come just this morning , said sgt thierry ferragau , from a french army medical unit soldiers manning checkpoints on the main road to zakho reported that about 3 , 000 refugees had passed their position by late this afternoon at the tent city outside zakho , refugee officials said they were surprised that so many of those returning are traveling straight home there are not as many people staying here as we expected , said clive wilkinson , a medical assistant with the british navy we 've seen buses filled with people that just drove by , said a united states army officer , capt deb luebker of green bay , wis , who added that many refugees were dropping by the camp just to pick up food we did n't plan on people going to town and then coming by the problem is that the markets in town are closed or there is nothing in them to buy , she said if they stay in the camps , they 'll keep getting free food late this afternoon , the young mechanic , his wife and infant daughter arrived at their house on the outskirts of zakho we are happy because there are none of saddam s soldiers here , he said we are happy that the american soldiers are here they were among the lucky ones their small apartment , unlike many others on their street that were ransacked and burned during and after the kurdish uprising , had been left untouched we watched this home , the neighbors said only the front door was broken by the soldiers they looked for guns , then they go the iraqi troops left a few spent cartridges in the entrance hall , where the couple waited for an uncle to arrive with the key to their apartment we were very fortunate , the mechanic said about their ordeal in the mountains we saw many babies who died we saw too much i have a shop for working on engines here in zakho , he said but nothing works now when the families return , i will reopen my shop i cannot work now , he said i am very tired perhaps in two or three days in the future photo kurdish refugees getting into a flatbed trailer at a refugee center in isikveren , turkey , before

to the home section selling frankly fake art is not in itself illegal , but it is definitely not the next best thing currents , aug 8 to buying an authentic work this summer , you have publicized shops that offer , in one case , exact reproductions on wood of 18th and 19thcentury sporting and animal paintings , complete with artist s signature and a craquelure and tinted varnish that imitates age and in another , a gallery that sells fakes by artists who have replicated on paper , sometimes astonishingly well , the techniques and signatures of many 20thcentury masters , like picasso , miro , leger and rouault the sporting pictures range from 350 950 and the works on paper sell for under 2 , 000 both galleries are completely forthright and honest about what they are selling so what s wrong here \? first of all , none of the works are marked in any way to indicate that they are either reproductions or fakes in what i suspect was an innocent yet irresponsible move , the shop selling reproductions of sporting paintings identifies each work on a gummed label attached to the back , using the title of the original work and the name of the original artist at some future moment , these works will be given away or sold , and information about their origins will be obscured it is a certainty that some of these pieces will enter the marketplace as original works of art my concern is for the naive and hapless purchaser and what about the price being asked for these works \? granted , the initial investment is modest , and reproductions are sold elsewhere for a great deal more , but it should be pointed out that there is no real secondary market for these works in answer to those who plead that it is impossible to buy an authentic work of art for a reasonable price , i would like to point out that in 1990 at christie s in new york , 35 , 000 lots sold for 2 , 000 or less , and at sotheby s half of the 188 , 000 lots sold worldwide were 5 , 000 or under since i am involved each day with the enormous problems wrought by the proliferation of forgeries , i am alarmed and exasperated by the potential for fraud that exists with the sale of these works the joke eludes me , and a lighthearted approach to the problem helps no one virgilia heimsath pancoast director , authentication service international foundation for art research new york , ny
none of the three national hockey league teams in the new york area will have a chance to select oshawa , ontario , center eric lindros when the league holds its entry draft tomorrow in buffalo the quebec nordiques , with the first pick , say they will draft the 18yearold junior superstar , even though he might be reluctant to play for them but the rangers , the islanders and especially , the devils could improve their teams soon with wise choices in the early rounds already a competitive team , the devils have the best assortment of selections , with two picks in the first round and one in the second they get 3 of the first 33 choices , beginning with the third selection behind quebec and san jose because they traded tom kurvers to toronto early in the 198990 season they will also exercise their own picks the 11th and the 33d selections the islanders , who have n't drafted a star since pat lafontaine in 1983 , choose fourth over all and have the same position in the second round the rangers must wait for the 15th pick in the first round and have the same position in the second here is what the general managers of the three teams in the metropolitan area have to say about their hopes for the draft neil smith , rangers draft position 15th in the first and second rounds major need i think we are looking for another big , solid defenseman like we took last year in michael stewart we 're trying to build up the depth on our defense because of the age of our defense and that s the one position where we do n't have younger players coming up on draft position i think that we 've got as good a chance of getting a good player as the people who draft sixth , seventh or eighth i do n't think it s going to be somebody you see in our uniform for a couple of years , that s for sure it s just going to be somebody we 're going to have to project on and hope will be on the team three or four years down the road on immediate impact players i think there are maybe a couple of guys who can play in the league after lindros pat faloon really played well in the memorial cup and he looks as if he could help a team that would need that type of player scott lachance played pretty well at the world junior , but i would imagine he would go back to college i do n't think there are too many past lindros who are going to show up in the league right away on possible trades for draft position i think there will be the normal amount of trade talk , quite a bit of it somebody usually likes to make a statement at the draft , so i imagine something will happen there that will be real interesting lou lamoriello , devils draft position third in the first round \( toronto s pick obtained in a trade \) 11th in the first round and 11th in second round major need we certainly would like to get defensemen in the draft but that s not saying that when it comes time for us to pick it would definitely have to be a defenseman but we are looking for a couple of defensemen if we can add a physical defenseman , that would be a positive you ca n't overlook talent and a player who can break a game open on immediate impact i do n't think that you ever can forecast exactly how a player will turn out , but we feel we are going to get a quality player with our first pick whether he will be ready to play in the national hockey league , quite frankly , i doubt very much , just on past record we certainly would like to see it happen we wo n't rush anyone we do n't feel we have to do that but , certainly , if a player comes along and can make our team be better , he 'll be here but it s not a case like it was several years ago when every player had to be here and you had to rush them that s not the case at all on possible trades i would be surprised if we did n't have some personnel changes throughout the summer bill torrey , islanders draft position fourth in both rounds on immediate needs eric lindros would fill my needs to a tee a scoring centerman who might attract some people to my building that s not a bad combination our biggest need is to increase our offensive output there s a lot of ways to do that in this day and age , the way the game is played today , a paul coffey player on defense can increase your output as much as a mike bossy or jari kurri can what we would like to do is to find a player who would obviously impact us in that way on depth of the draft there are five or six players in this draft who , at this stage of their development , appear to be pretty good prospects but i think , quite frankly , other than lindros , to put an 'immediate' tag on anybody would be a bit unfair on doing business while the franchise is for sale any time that you are in this situation it is not helpful that s not to say you ca n't go about some business and we are doing that we are trying to do everything we normally would does the situation we are in impact us in some ways \? to say that it does n't obviously would n't be accurate to the best of our ability , we are trying to go about our business as normal
in a dingy basement apartment in harlem , a welldressed man in his late 40 s drew deeply from a pipe fashioned from a miniature whisky bottle and a stubby glass tube holding his breath , he passed the pipe , with the bluegray smoke of crack still swirling in its chamber , to a friend sitting at his side at a crowded old wooden dining table another weekend of partying was starting at chuck s place in another era , chuck s place might have been called a speakeasy now , the term is crack house chuck s place is like dozens of spots in the city where people gather to relax and distract themselves with a powerful drug that has left a trail of human wreckage across america at a time when the use of crack and cocaine is believed to be diminishing , the little group at chuck s place provides a snapshot of the world of illicit drugs that is sharply different from its image over two days at chuck s place , there were one or two moments when tempers flared under the intensity of the drug but there was none of the wild agitation and violence that are so much a part of crack s legend nor were there any of the teenage addicts who seemed so ubiquitous only a year or so ago chuck s people , as the tall bonethin proprietor refers to them , are mostly in their 30 s and 40 s a few are in their 20 s some have lost the contest with crack they survive on soupkitchen meals and the money that comes from selling drugs and sometimes , themselves but there is also a nurse , a maintenance man and a couple of case workers for city agencies none are newcomers to drugs at chuck s , four or five years of using crack and cocaine is on the short side no one knew anyone who had taken up the habit lately what you 're seeing here is the decline of a drug epidemic and the normalization of crack use , said ansley hamid , an anthropology professor at the john jay college of criminal justice who specializes in the drug culture and frequently drops in at chuck s to gauge changing drug fashions you do n't have the intensity you had when crack use was expanding , mr hamid said there are fewer initiates those still using crack are normalizing their use they 're making it a part of their routine heroin use stabilized in the 1970 s now it s happening with crack narcotics police officers estimate there are dozens , if not hundreds , of crack houses in the city , mostly in the northern parts of manhattan and brooklyn and in the south bronx but , the police say , the numbers are falling we do n't have the crack use we had a few years ago , said lt kevin barry of the narcotics division , therefore there are fewer crack houses many of the houses are in abandoned buildings , but there are also many in apartment houses and brownstones and housing projects , the police say since they are not marked , they are hard to find it is difficult for investigators to get inside hb like a living room anywhere mr hamid took a reporter inside chuck s place many there spoke freely , but there was no way to check what they said none of them would give their full names on a weekend afternoon , the mood at chuck s place was as convivial as in a living room of friends anywhere the group had been swapping tales of drugs and the police and lost loves , and smoking crack for hours there were few signs of the drug s awesome clout most of the smokers' eyes were filmy and red rimmed , and some people were edgy and restless , as if they had stayed up all night but nobody wanted to fight nobody was raging there was an undercurrent of excitement and a slightly more pronounced sense of furtiveness ordinary questions seemed prying we know each other by first names and nicknames , chuck said a girl named tracy got arrested two weeks ago for shoplifting , and we could n't call the precinct to ask about her because we did n't know her last name chuck tries to run his place like a business he charges 2 to get past the heavy door with the peephole for privacy , people can rent the big back room with the couch , tv and overstuffed armchairs for 10 an hour or they can have the smaller room , just large enough for the queensize bed with rumpled sheets , for 5 an hour when a woman takes a paying customer into the back , chuck expects a percentage , but he said he is not a tough guy i do n't beat the women if they do n't pay , he said i may slam the wall you see that broken piece over there and i might shout , but i do n't beat them and if anybody is short , i might let the 2 go until the end of the month unlike those who ran the earliest crack houses in new york , chuck expects his clients to bring their own paraphernalia and drugs , though he permits them to use his stove to convert powdered cocaine into crack he also expects a small share of everyone s drugs , he said , a rock , a piece , enough to hold me for a while patrons said to be like family when someone needs a fresh supply , reggie , chuck s righthand man , will run out and buy some down the street he expects a tip of a dollar or two , and perhaps a small share of the drugs reggie and chuck worry that a stream of people popping out to buy drugs might attract attention from the police or neighborhood groups already complaining about the crack house
detroit , march 30 thirty minutes after his red wings beat the rangers by 65 at joe louis arena today , kevin miller stood in the corridor wearing a suit , a trench coat and a big smile one by one , he greeted his former ranger teammates as they filed out to the bus that would take them to their charter flight home miller had scored two goals to help give the rangers their ninth defeat in their last 11 games to go with one tie and one victory perhaps it is just coincidence , but their slump and fall from first place began right after the march 5 trade that sent miller to detroit in a fiveplayer deal that brought joey kocur to new york kocur also was on hand today , watching from a private box , while serving a suspension for stick fouls miller saved especially friendly greetings for mike richter , the new york goalie before they were teammates on the rangers , miller and richter played for the united states olympic team miller now has five goals in 10 games as a red wing and is blending well on a line with sergei fedorov and shawn burr all three are natural centers of the rangers' top centers , bernie nicholls is slumping and kelly kisio is out with an injury darren turcotte , another new york center , scored three goals today in a losing cause asked if he felt any special pride in playing well against the rangers , miller replied definitely , because , he said , he wanted to prove that the rangers had made a mistake in dealing him i could n't be happier , miller said i really wanted to do well i would have been happy just if we won the two goals were icing on the cake among the ranger personnel greeted by miller was neil smith , the general manager , who traded him their exchange was brief detroit swept the season series from the rangers , three games to none further along the corridor stood roger neilson , talking with reporters asked if he was worried , the rangers' coach replied yeah plenty worried although today s final score was close , the rangers trailed by two goals after two periods and by three goals late in the third neilson said his players let the red wings too often have position deep in the new york zone to set up right in front of richter our defensemen could n't handle them in front of the net , neilson said on detroit s five goals scored while the teams were at even strength , mark hardy and david shaw were on the ice for three and james patrick and brian leetch were on the ice for two the rangers' final game of the regular season is sunday night against pittsburgh at madison square garden they open the playoffs wednesday night against the washington capitals the scoresheet once again showed john ogrodnick and bernie nicholls without goals jody hull scored twice for new york paul ysebaert scored twice for detroit steve yzerman , the detroit captain , scored his 50th of the season the rangers' power play had one goal in six tries this included a span of 1 44 in which new york had a twoman advantage rangers never led the score was tied at 11 after one period , but detroit held a 42 lead after two miller opened the scoring at 7 10 of the first period by beating richter from the slot after a perfect setup pass from fedorov in the left corner the rangers tied the score at 15 29 of the second period on a goal by hull , who scored from right in front with three red wings around him detroit took a 21 lead at 6 01 of the first period when yzerman scored after ysebaert s feed touched yzerman s stick , the puck caromed behind richter , who accidentally kicked it over the line with his skate the rangers tied the score , 22 , at 10 29 on hull s second goal of the game he finished off a shift of digging by kris king , who was been one of the rangers' most consistent players during their recent team slump ysebaert made the score 32 with a slap shot on the power play at 18 24 and brent fedyk made it 42 a minute later on a setup from yzerman , who jumped on the ice as the extra man in place of the goalie , tim cheveldae , when another penalty was about to be called on the rangers

final aspects of the deal , and that there was every reason to be optimistic that a formal agreement would be reached by the end of the day there is a lot of language to go over , a lot of wording to

matter of how they want to do it neither gooden s agent nor the mets today were inclined to divulge the specifcs of the deal but neader , whose public position throughout has been that gooden was entitled to a wage on the order of the 53 million annual salary the red sox recently awarded roger clemens , said his client would be satisfied that his asking price had been met ion i believe it 'll be satisfying to both parties , said neader it will be structured in a unique way the implication appeared to be that the deal , through devices like a signing bonus , a revision of gooden s final year of his current contract or provisions for deferred money , had been put together in a way that would make it seem as if the mets had not retreated from their position that the fouryear 215 million extension given clemens was irresponsible and an aberration only two weeks ago , after all , the mets offered gooden a threeyear package worth 138 million in their last formal proposal but whatever the final financial details of the extension , an agreement monday would conclude one of the critical episodes in the franchise s history gooden , the national league rookie of the year in 1984 and the recipient of the cy young award in 1985 when he went 244 , is a pitcher respected without equivocation by his teammates he is a player treasured beyond measure by the organization s loyalists and an unquestionably vital ingredient for the immediate and longterm success of the mets pick the adjective , although probably none of them will be sufficient , david cone , a member of the pitching staff , said recently of gooden what he has meant to this organization you ca n't begin to calculate he s been a cornerstone of the escalating success and profits the club has enjoyed for almost a decade barely a month ago , though , it appeared the mets , through their stated refusal to match the deal signed by clemens , stood to lose gooden at the conclusion of the season gooden , who is to make 225 million this season as the thirdhighest paid member of the staff , deeply resented the club s negotiating stance when his feb 22 deadline for an agreement passed , he said he was determined to pursue free agency a quick reversal less than 48 hours later , gooden , nervous about the public s reaction to his absolute rejection of the club s offer for three years and 13 million and astute enough not to needlessly shut off a bargaining option , reversed himself he said he would not close the door on further negotiations through the season with the mets i do n't want to be accused of not being fair , gooden said at the time thereafter , gooden quietly and without rancor went about the business of preparing himself physically for the season , enjoying one of his most consistent and often compelling springs the 26yearold gooden , who was 197 last season , posted a 238 earned run average in five outings , striking out 15 in 22 2 3 innings but as recently as saturday morning , gooden expressed increasing frustration at the lack of an acceptable and bonafide proposal and conceded that the wait was wearing on him meanwhile , neader and harazin were engaged in regular discussions about the terms of a potential deal telephone call after telephone call addressed methods of payment , language of clauses and , of course , the total value of the deal whitehurst raked wally whitehurst was roughed up for four straight singles and three firstinning runs sunday as the mets lost to the braves , 31 , in a game at west palm beach shortened by rain whitehurst , who had enjoyed an uninterrupted run of success this spring en route to a promotion to the starting rotation , went on to pitch four scoreless innings after the initial damage the game was called after

the new york city opera s production of janacek s cunning little vixen was one of the hits of the company s season when it opened 10 years ago but its life was unnaturally short it remained in repertory for two more seasons and had a national telecast on live from lincoln center in 1983 two years later , its intricate animal costumes , designed by the children s book illustrator maurice sendak , were destroyed in a warehouse fire beverly sills listed vixen among the productions that she hoped to see restored , and christopher keene , a janacek champion since the early days of his conducting career , included a complete janacek cycle on his agenda for the company when he succeeded miss sills as general manager in 1989 the company raised 100 , 000 to restore the costumes , and on tuesday evening the refurbished production returned to the new york state theater vixen janacek s own adaptation of a story by rudolf tesnohlidek has a strange sort of beauty , full of conflicting strains at times , it is an anthropomorphic fairy tale , with conversations between forest animals the animals can understand humans , but humans cannot understand them there is an antagonism between the two worlds that is sometimes playful , but often deadly on both sides , sex \( whether active , nostalgic or merely speculative \) is a regular preoccupation but beneath the work s veneer of cute furry critters and roughhewn rustics is a sober , unsentimental look at the cycle of life , death and renewal when they are not fantasizing about women , the forester bartos and his friends worry about getting old sharpears , the mischievous vixen heroine , is shot in the last act , but no dirges are played that s life , janacek tells us , and sharpears s cubs carry on and when bartos recognizes a frog he thought had jumped on him at the start of the opera , the frog says , no , that was my granddaddy frank corsaro s stage direction sharpens some of these points during a pause in an early orchestral interlude , he has a couple of poachers shoot and skin sharpears s mother the furry creatures and birds gather around her corpse to pray then huge insects come to prey on her none of this is suggested in the libretto , but it plays startlingly after the opening bug ballets and forest frolics , and it makes for an interesting symmetry with sharpears s own death janacek s music for all this is gloriously vivid and elemental the orchestral writing shimmers with naturalistic rhythms , textures and timbres , and with echoes of czechoslovak folk music mr keene drew a splendidly played , comfortably paced performance from the orchestra and the backstage choir as in 1981 , the city opera production is sung in an english translation by robert t jones and yveta synek graff opera sung in english is often seen as an alternative to supertitles , and the two are rarely offered together city opera sensibly ignored that rule here the balance between janacek s rich orchestration and what is being sung on the stage is difficult to maintain , and although mr keene mostly succeeded , there were moments when one was grateful for the projected text janacek was less concerned with vocal display than with dramatic cohesiveness , so vixen is not a singers' opera in the sense that , say , tosca is but the demands of its sometimes folksy , sometimes angular music should not be underestimated kathryn gamberoni gave a lovely account of sharpears s music , and acted the scampish part with the combination of endearingly and infuriatingly foxy qualities that the libretto suggests cynthia rose was slightly shrill as goldenstripe , sharpears s beau , but she acted the role amusingly on the twolegged side of the cast , jan opalach was a fullvoiced bartos , and john lankston and wilbur pauley gave reliable performances as the priest and the schoolmaster among the others who rounded out the large cast were dulce reyes as catcher , lee bellaver as the strutting but unwary rooster , joseph mckee as the badger and bronwyn thomas as mrs bartos neil peter jampolis s sets and steven feldman s costumes , realized from mr sendak s colorful storybook designs , put the work in a lovely setting notable , too , was jessica redel s choreography of the grasshopper dances the cunning little vixen opera in three acts by leos janacek , libretto by the composer based on stories by rudolf tesnohlidek conductor , christopher keene director , frank corsaro scenery and costumes from designs by maurice sendak sets and lighting by neil parker jampolis costumes by steven feldman choreography by jessica redel performed by the new york city opera sharpears kathryn gamberoni goldenstripe cynthia rose catcher owl dulce reyes bartos jan opalach mrs bartos bronwyn thomas schoolmaster john lankston harasta matthew lau badger joseph mckee father alois wilbur pauley
washington , nov 22 with the blessing of the white house , republicans in the house of representatives tried today to embarrass democrats by offering a broad package of popular tax cuts that stand no chance of enactment just days before congress plans to adjourn for the year the initiative by the house republicans underscores their frustration with the lack of forceful policy proposals by the bush administration but even more , it demonstrates an attempt to regain political momentum that has been lost in recent weeks because of the shaky economy , a drumbeat of attacks from democrats and a series of misfires at the white house announcing the package , representative newt gingrich of georgia , the house republican whip , delivered one political sally after another in the hope that at least one would make the television news a typical line about the democrats was this in the next four days they get to show the people of america whether they are truly interested in creating jobs the measures would go far beyond what president bush has proposed but before he had seen the initiatives , richard g darman , the budget director , said the white house would support them so long as they did not cost the treasury a net loss of revenue differences in accounting because under the administration s accounting system some tax cuts actually raise revenue , at least in the short term , the republicans were able to say that their plan would not lose money but it would cost billions of dollars over the next five years according to the way the congressional budget office does the accounting the republicans worked hard to choreograph their strategy for maximum political impact here are the steps 1 the republicans will offer their tax proposals next week as an amendment to legislation providing money for the savings and loan bailout , which must be passed before congress adjourns 2 the house rules committee , an arm of the democratic leadership that establishes the procedures under which legislation is debated and voted on , will declare that the amendment is not germane to the savings and loan legislation and thus , under house rules , cannot be presented 3 the republicans will demand a vote on this ruling and will lose on a nearly partyline vote then they will offer to back down if the democrats will agree to a specific date next year on which their package can be brought up for a vote the democrats , who hold a better than 3to2 majority in the house , will reject this idea , too delay would be costly the final step is not clear whether , without their amendment , enough republicans will refuse to vote for the savings and loan legislation to defeat the bill is not clear the administration has asked for 80 billion more to finish the bailout albert v casey , president of the resolution trust corporation , which is in charge of the bailout , has estimated that a delay in financing the bailout until congress returns in january would cost taxpayers an additional 300 million to 400 million but whatever happens in the end , the days before thanksgiving are sure to be filled with barbs and jibes about growth and jobs and fairness and all the other words that republicans and democrats throw out when they are bickering over the economy representative thomas s foley of washington , the speaker of the house , left no doubt today that he and other democrats would vigorously oppose adding tax cuts or any other amendments to the savings and loan measure there s no chance in my judgment , none , that the rtc can bear burdens other than its own , mr foley told reporters what are the chances of this having some forced leverage for other issues \? zero , absolutely zero significant tax code change among the republican proposals are a lower capital gains tax rate , new tax breaks for small businesses and real estate investments , new and more generous rules for individual retirement accounts , a taxfree savings plan for households with incomes of less than 50 , 000 a year and a repeal of the excise tax on expensive boats , cars and aircraft this would amount to a signficant revision of the income tax code , the kind that normally takes congress a year or two to act on the measures , many of which would enjoy broad popular support because they would save taxpayers money , are sure to arise again next year , when some kind of tax legislation may be considered this year , however , the white house has not even pushed for a capital gains break , the centerpiece of its tax strategy that is because senior officials like mr darman and treasury secretary nicholas f brady feared that if they opened the issue of taxes , the democraticcontrolled congress would produce legislation the administration could not abide senate republicans did not participate in this latest sortie in large part that is because they are a potent force in their own right and can get their way better by striking deals with democrats rather than attacking them in the house , however , the republicans are such a small minority that their only real strength is making noise and causing trouble photo republicans in the house offered a package of tax cuts just days before adjournment from left , representatives mickey edwards , newt gingrich , nancy l johnson and dean a gallo \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
detroit , feb 8 tonight s game , an 84 loss to the detroit red wings , was the islanders' fifth game in a row without victory and was odd statistically the red wings scored 8 goals on only 16 shots even though the islanders' goalie , jeff hackett , did n't play all that poorly , and new york outshot detroit by 4916 had the islanders scored at the same rate as detroit , they would have won by 248 or 258 but there was nothing flukey about the play of sergei fedorov , detroit s rookie center from the soviet union fedorov scored twice once while on the power play , once while killing a penalty he also assisted on 3 goals and now has 25 goals and 33 assists making this more remarkable was the fact that fedorov and his linemates came into the game primarily with a defensive mission to check pat lafontaine , new york s highscoring center i played him against their best line and he put on a clinic , said bryan murray , the coach and general manager of the red wings i put him out with two guys shawn burr and dave barr who were meant to be my checking line learning experience none of the detroit goals were what hockey players call soft hackett was victimized in the following ways a slap shot that changed direction by hitting an islander , two goals on breakaways when detroit was shorthanded , a setup pass to an uncovered red wing in the slot , two rebounds , and several rushes on which the islanders were outmanned he s got to learn from it , coach al arbour said barr had two goals and one assist burr had one goal and one assist patrick flatley scored twice for the islanders early in the third period to cut detroit s lead to 64 fedorov s shorthanded goal in the third period was dazzling he took the puck in his own end , banked a pass off the boards around one islander defenseman , raced down the ice , beat another defenseman to the puck , cut in on goal on the backhand and shot while being tripped from behind both fedorov and the puck crossed the goal line at the same time in one sliding crash that knocked the net loose as 19 , 817 fans cheered at joe louis arena the red wings led by 10 after one period and by 52 after two marc habscheid , keith primeau and bob probert scored detroit s other goals the islanders' other goals were scored by lafontaine \( his 30th \) and david chyzowski \( his 4th \) as was the case against the rangers on wednesday night , the islanders were outmuscled probert bumped into several of them on forechecking forays and eventually faced little opposition when invading the attack zone late in the game , he crashed into hackett , just for the fun of it , knocking him over
leipzig , germany the velvety golden light of a late autumn afternoon slants through the window wall of bernhard heisig s spacious studio dust motes float lazily through sun and shadow among easels , canvases and a coalscuttle helmet on a hat stand , forming occasional shapes and patterns like some torpid , pointillistic kaleidoscope the idyllic setting in which mr heisig , a burly man with the bearded face of an amish farmer , works belies the unsettled state of the visual arts in reunited germany while physical , political and economic divisions are being bridged , a rift over the art and artists produced during four decades of east german totalitarianism is widening a bitter dispute has polarized museum directors , art historians , critics , private collectors and artists in both eastern and western germany over the question of whether east german art is really art even if no answer is found , experts say , the issue could preoccupy germany s art scene for years to come artist or hireling \? some prominent art experts contend that mr heisig a 65yearold leipzig painter who built an international reputation under communism s allencompassing control of art in east germany is not an artist , nor is his life s work art in their view , east german painters , sculptors and graphic artists were nothing more than corrupt , cynical servants of an ideology that deliberately capped the wellspring of all art individual freedom of creative expression i find it absolutely grotesque to suggest that east german art be judged on the same standards as western art , said siegfried gohr , the director of the ludwig museum in cologne , one of the leading modern art museums in western germany the traditional impulse of the avantgarde is freedom of the artist in a free society that never existed in east germany as long as he is director of the ludwig museum , mr gohr added , no east german art will be displayed an even harsher verdict was passed by georg baselitz , a 52yearold painter and sculptor who left east germany at age 19 after expulsion from the art academy in east berlin for being sociopolitically immature mr baselitz shocked the german art world by using a vulgar expression to decribe all east german artists there are no artists in eastern germany , they all went away , mr baselitz said in a telephone interview east germany carried on the example set by the third reich of complete state control of the arts , he said this is anathema for avantgarde art a hardline disavowal asked if former colleagues like mr heisig or wolfgang mattheuer , a leipzigbased painter and sculptor who is widely seen as having broken with the east german establishment in the early 1980 s , were not artists , mr baselitz replied no artists , no painters none of them have ever painted a picture their work is just recreations on reconstructions , that discovered nothing , he said they were interpreters , artists degenerated to propagandists of the ideology , who had fulfilled a program of the system and betrayed fantasy , love and craziness , mr baselitz added he once said of himself , in me , the poisonmixers , the annihilators and the decadent are honored others , including those being denounced , say they think mr baselitz has different reasons for attacking east german art and artists it is sheer nonsense , mr heisig said baselitz may be taking revenge for what happened to him as a student and making a little advertising for himself at the same time i just do n't take the whole debate seriously was there no russian art because of stalin \? my paintings hang in 14 western german museums were they just letting themselves be taken for a ride \? peter ludwig , western germany s most powerful art collector , agrees with mr heisig the debate about east german art first began to draw attention last summer when mr ludwig , a chocolate magnate from aachen in western germany whose collection is the foundation for the cologne museum that bears his name , publicly chastised mr gohr for refusing to hang some of the more than 600 paintings by east german artists that mr ludwig has acquired since the ludwig museum opened in 1986 mr gohr is under no obligation to do so much opinion , no unity once the ludwiggohr split surfaced , art critics and historians throughout germany rapidly weighed in with their thoughts on the subject critics from other european countries soon added their voices to the fray no consensus has emerged even mr gohr and his deputy director , evelyn weiss , are amicably divided on the subject mrs weiss organized a recent exhibition at the josefhaubrich kunsthalle in cologne titled pictures from germany , to showcase mr ludwig s acquisitions it s unfair to say that all east german art was homogeneous , she said nothing in life really is you have to look behind the scene before we give one opinion that all east german art was bad , we should look at it very carefully and we dare not lump the artists who resisted the system , such as mattheuer , in with those who fought for it or to forget that established artists often helped those on the outside
they built the house well , not with their own hands , but they had it built for them , and that is nearly the same thing , after 26 years they even know the anniversary october 20th , said suzie torborg that s the closing date the home in mountainside is not far from westfield , the new jersey town where jeff torborg was born his mother , winifred , has lived in her own home for over 50 years , and she s not leaving jeff and suzie torborg drop over as often as they can , fixing her home , bringing in a meal , staying to chat still , the torborgs were thinking of putting their home on the market this fall it made sense they had the summer job in chicago and the winter home in florida , and maybe it was time to give up the big home where their three children were raised it really did make sense then came the strange phone call the white sox said the mets were interested in jeff torborg s becoming their manager , and not only that , the white sox were not going to stand in torborg s way the mets torborg had tried out for them in 1962 , and they had not signed him , and ever since then they had been the team out in queens however , the family has changed baseball caps before i'm a jeff torborg fan , suzie barber torborg said yesterday she was talking about her allegiances at shea stadium , where her husband had just been given a fouryear contract the length tells just how delighted the mets are that the torborgs are essentially homebodies i love that home as much as i could love any inanimate object , suzie torborg said while her husband was giving sound bites to every microphone from new jersey to the loop , suzie torborg seemed like a telling barometer of the man being asked to give the mets some teamwork and discipline none of this will matter much by april if the arms do not come around and the fingers still cannot cling to a baseball but for the moment , the feeling in the room had more to do with 1969 than 1986 , a reminder of the roots an indiana man named hodges established with a brooklyn woman named lombardi the torborgs met at roosevelt junior high , where suzie barber s mother pointed out a certain seventh grader and said , there s that boy over there i 've been telling you about the daughter s reaction was , is n't he cute they became friends for the next four years , then something more than that asked if they had been voted the cutest couple in their class , suzie torborg said no then she added , i was voted 'most optimistic' and 'best figure' was that sexist \? when she was 18 , she was persuaded to enter a beauty pageant she was a history major , not a trained beauty contestant , but she entered , and won then they told her the next step was the miss new jersey competition she won that , too the next level was still in new jersey in a place called atlantic city torborg came and cheered as barber performed her talent portion , a comedy monologue by a hillbilly watching her first baseball game bert parks did not sing to her , but she graduated on time from douglass college at rutgers we had a brief honeymoon at the jersey shore and we reported to the dodgers' farm team at albuquerque , she recalled yesterday somebody said , 'you 're late , ' which we really were n't , and then they said the team was going on a 10day road trip , and i was left in albuquerque with all the suitcases baseball can seem like one long road trip , but the torborgs' values meant they traveled together when torborg was persuaded by frank robinson to take the managing job in cleveland from which robinson had just been fired , suzie torborg prepared the three boys i said daddy would almost surely lose his job , she said i said there would be ups and downs i did n't want them to be disillusioned , and when it happened , they took it very well the boys are now scattered doug s arm gave out in the minor leagues , so he s running his own sporting goods store in florida greg is in his second year at fordham law and dale is a sophomore at northwestern in illinois , where his parents spent three fulfilling seasons now they are home they ducked the flak during torborg s 10 years as a yankee coach , but suzie torborg knows the criticism level has escalated on the radio and in the papers i know it s going to hurt , she said yesterday i know how hard he works i know that people who are criticizing do n't always have the facts it s always hurtful but we can take it that s in the future right now , the new manager of the mets thinks he may have time to touch up his mother s house this fall photo suzie torborg \( joyce dopkeen the new york times \)
moscow , aug 27 the aftermath of the coup was rich in the theme of betrayal leaders had turned on the nation , communists had turned on their leader , russians had turned on their own but most damning was that the plotters included some of the people closest to president mikhail s gorbachev , and none closer than anatoly i lukyanov , the speaker of the parliament and a comrade from the 1950 s when they both attended the law faculty at moscow state university after the coup , mr lukyanov s attempts at justification and mr gorbachev s bitterness at his betrayal became the stuff of rich gossip , liberally sprinkled with references to brutus and other great betrayers of legend mr lukyanov s physical appearance fed a separate stream of allusions to figures in the godfather saga again today in the parliament , mr gorbachev gave vent to his bitterness i personally counted on lukyanov not to betray our work and myself , he said forty years bound us together , we had known each other since student days but one aspect of mr lukyanov that nobody had suspected from his droning speeches in parliament and dour visage was that he wrote poetry , under the pseudonym anatoly osenev under the heading poet s corner , komsomolskaya pravda unearthed these lines from a poem titled conscience that appeared in 1990 , which it printed without comment safeguard your conscience for your friends a friend seeks neither gain nor flattery a friend and conscience are as one in tempest , cold and thunder safeguard your conscience for your friends ! the record does not show whether mr lukyanov tried to foist these lines on mr gorbachev when he came before his friend and mentor in the crimea after the coup failed and attempted to justify his actions but it does record mr gorbachev s response drawing on his agrarian childhood , mr gorbachev cut mr lukyanov off with an earthy russian saying you 've known me for 40 years do n't hang noodles on my ears not quite et tu , tolya , but it made the point orbit as alibi when coups fail , alibis abound suddenly everybody had been against the putsch , or sick , or just doing his job newspapers published explanatory notes , lawmakers pointed fingers at everyone around , mr lukyanov roamed the corridors of parliament waving some official document signed by boris n yeltsin , president of the russian republic when mr gorbachev read out notes of the council of ministers meeting in which minister after minister either supported or did not oppose the coup , one of the ministers leaped to the microphone and demanded to know who had compiled the slander he had not even been in moscow , he insisted the most ironclad alibi was probably that of two astronauts who continued circling the earth through all the excitement , utterly forgotten by all anatoly artsebarsky and sergei krikalev had been up there for 102 days already , and today tass issued a statement reporting that they had used a kraterb furnace to grow a monocrystal of semiconductor silicon tass did not report how they reacted to all the fuss down below did they ever wonder , for example , whether they might be totally forgotten \? or when all the republics went on a frenzy of declaring independence , did the thought cross their minds to leap on the bandwagon and proclaim a sovereign republic of outer space \? but all that was certain was that they were innocent of the coup lenin s coup primer many reasons have been proffered for the failure of the coup mr gorbachev argued that the plotters had not properly assessed the new mood of the people , mr yeltsin reported that the brutal commandos of the kgb s group alpha refused to attack his headquarters , everybody noted the resolve of the resistance and its lack among the plotters an objective political analysis , as communist scholars used to say , would also suggest that the plotters were simply bad marxistleninists as members of the party , many of them members of its central committee , all should have been closely familiar with the teachings of lenin , the founder of their party and a plotter whose coup succeeded among his voluminous teachings , lenin left behind a letter dated sept 2627 , 1917 , that is readily available as a sevenpage pamphlet titled marxism and rebellion here is what he said to approach a rebellion in a marxist way , that is as one would an art , it is necessary not to lose a minute in moving loyal battalions to the most important objects , to arrest the government , send units against the junkers and the wild division that are ready to die before they let the enemy move to the center of the city , seize the telegraph and telephone one cannot at this critical moment remain true to marxism not treating rebellion as an art luckily at the critical moment the junta did not remain true to marxism they failed not only to move loyal battalions to key objects or to arrest mr yeltsin s government , but they even had difficulty finding battalions that were loyal and the phones continued working throughout , allowing mr yeltsin s forces to pass the word and to keep track of the enemy s movements plotters with credentials
albany , nov 11 assembly speaker mel miller steps into a federal courtroom in brooklyn on tuesday to face fraud charges , with the outcome set to determine not only his guilt or innocence but also his survival as the second most powerful democrat in new york state government the case has consumed the attention of assembly lawmakers here , several of whom are privately jockeying to succeed mr miller should the trial end in a conviction , even as they publicly support him with words and donations to pay his legal bills his prosecution also continues to raise questions about the resolution of the state s latest budget deficit that is a crisis mr miller insists he will personally oversee in the coming weeks despite all the time he will spend battling charges that he and a top aide swindled some clients out of 300 , 000 in a private realestate deal six years ago no gladhanding here but for all the power that this 52yearold son of a brooklyn milk truck driver has so buoyantly wielded in the last five years as speaker , a post that gives him a dominant voice in legislation and budgets affecting virtually every new yorker , mr miller is striking a decidedly humbled pose when asked about the trial and even he concedes that it is not an easy thing for him to do having spent much of his professional life cajoling and joking , gladhanding and armtwisting , all trademarks of his leadership style , mr miller seems almost befuddled by the concept that his political future now rests with a dozen voters with whom he can do none of these things it s very hard to put your fate into the hands of 12 people who you do n't know , and who do n't know you , and a judge who you do n't know and who does n't know you , said mr miller , who has steadfastly maintained his innocence but has declined to discuss the specific charges in the case this is not like running for speaker or for a seat in the assembly , he added in a telephone interview today from his brooklyn home you may be at the center of the stage , but you really have no control over what s going to happen to you on the eve of the trial , this sense of powerlessness was in evident contrast with his more usual demeanor in the halls of the capitol , which borders on cocky and even on brash at one point , mr miller , a fixture in brooklyn democratic circles for just about all of his adult years who was first elected to the assembly in 1970 , seemed to express total confidence about the outcome of the trial the one thing i know is , i'm not guilty of anything and i have no guilty conscience , he said , adding that he and his lawyer arranged a year ago for him to take a lie detector test , which he says he passed such tests are almost always inadmissible as evidence in criminal trials but then , a few minutes later , alluding to the vagaries of the jury system and to his own lack of success in predicting jury verdicts when he was a private attorney , mr miller seemed to be almost speaking about his years here in the past tense these have been 21 really great years , and i 've really enjoyed it , he said it s been a good life , and i do n't have any complaints whether mr miller will take the stand to testify in his own behalf is a decision that he says he and his lawyer , gerald b lefcourt , have yet to make such a move always carries a risk because it introduces the possibility that a prosecutor could rip apart a defendant with searing questions and although mr miller has spent his life in the public eye , he is not exactly noted as a gifted speaker he has a disconcerting habit of staring at the ceiling when he talks and in a line he has has never quite been able to explain , he once responded to a question about legislative corruption with personally speaking , for myself , to the best of my knowledge , i do n't think i know anything , to the best of my knowledge there is much talk in albany these days about political futures but as mario m cuomo ponders his largely in the seclusion of the governor s mansion , mr miller will reckon with his in the public setting of a federal courtroom if he is convicted on felony charges , the speaker s career will come to an end , because state law would require his removal from elected office , not to mention the possibility of up to five years in prison and a 250 , 000 fine on each of 19 counts but if he prevails , there is a wide recognition here that his power in the assembly will likely be undiminished classic politics in many ways , mr miller has thrived by using classic political tactics rewarding friends and punishing enemies shortly after mr miller won the position in late 1986 , he replaced the man who had been his chief opponent for the post , arthur j kremer , the ways and means committee chairman , with saul weprin it was the closest thing to a public mugging i ever experienced , recalled mr kremer , who resigned from the assembly the following year and is now in private law practice in uniondale , li but , mr kremer added , such bluntness had its effect i think you could safely say there is no antimiller faction in the assembly right now , that mel runs a very tight ship none of the aspirants to the speaker s post the three leading contenders are sheldon silver of manhattan , the codes committee chairman james r tallon jr of binghamton , the majority leader and mr weprin of queens has expressed the slightest intention of challenging mr miller if he is exonerated and those who surround mr miller vehemently reject any assertion that the support for him is based on fear he cares about people , said mr tallon i 've watched him go through the illness of a member , the death of a member mel is a genuine friend in those periods of time he leads in the very best sense of the word watching and waiting while this loyalty is a political asset , it may cause problems for mr miller some top legislative officials say dozens of members have contributed to a private fund that friends of mr miller established to help pay his legal bills while such contributions are not illegal , mr miller has so far declined to identify who has given him money or indeed how much is in the fund and , taking advantage of unclear provisions in legislative ethics laws whose drafting he oversaw as speaker , mr miller has indicated that he may not reveal such information even in the financialdisclosure forms he must fill out at the end of the year but for the moment , mr miller , the most kinetic of political figures , will be in the unfamiliar position of watching and waiting to see what fate has in

manila , sept 12 among the philippine senators prepared to vote to shut down the largest american military base in asia , none makes quite the same sacrifice as senator agapito aquino , brotherinlaw of president corazon c aquino and younger brother of her slain husband , benigno s aquino jr since he announced his opposition last month to a new 10year american lease for the subic bay naval station , senator aquino says his relationship with the president a woman he describes affectionately as his surrogate mother has grown decidedly cool i feel she is hurt by what i have done , senator aquino said as he sipped coffee today in the lounge just outside the senate chamber where the debate over the future of the american base began wednesday our relationship now is civil , only civil but at the risk of family harmony , i feel we must make this historic decision , he said , adding the time has come for the philippines to put an end to the spirit of dependence on the united states we need to cut the apron strings with america , even though we are scared to do it petition drive considered mrs aquino , in the middle of what she insists is the final year of her presidency , has staked her political credibility on ratification of the treaty , and the decision by her brotherinlaw to vote against the pact came as an acute embarrassment her chief aide , franklin drilon , said today that if the senate rejected the treaty , the aquino administration would consider staging a petition drive to collect the millions of signatures necessary to hold a national referendum on the issue it remains unclear whether a referendum on the bases could overturn a senate rejection of the treaty under the philippine constitution , the senate has the exclusive right to ratify or reject treaties mr aquino is one of 12 members of the 23member senate who have announced their opposition to the base agreement , which would allow the united states to operate at subic until the year 2001 a vote on the pact is expected sometime before monday , when the current treaty expires although mr aquino is obviously closer to the president than any of his 11 antibase colleagues he lived in the home of his brother and mrs aquino for a time in the 1950 s and describes himself as like her eldest son other senators have longstanding ties to the president indeed , only two members of the philippine senate were elected without mrs aquino s endorsement 'difficult for all of us' it s very hard to go against the president you respect and you love , said the 52yearold lawmaker it has been difficult for us all even though opinion polls show overwhelming public support for the treaty , the senate appears ready to reject the treaty for reasons of national sovereignty and national pride some of the senators say they do not oppose the idea of an american base on philippine soil so much as they object to what is often described on the senate floor as the insultingly small compensation package offered by the bush administration 203 million a year , less than a quarter of the original request by mrs aquino s negotiating team senator aquino s objection is one of strict nationalism , however he says it is time for the philippines , while retaining the friendship of the united states , to issue its declaration of independence from foreign paternalism mr aquino said the nation would somehow deal with the economic consequences of an american withdrawal the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars injected into the philippine economy each year from subic the job dislocation weighs heavily on us , he said , but added we also worried about the more than three million other filipinos who are unemployed across the nation at this time benigno aquino , a leader of opposition to president ferdinand e marcos , was gunned down at manila s international airport as he returned from exile in 1983 , setting in motion a chain of events leading to the election of his widow as the nation s leader and the downfall of mr marcos when he tried to steal the election senator aquino said he beleved that his elder brother would have supported the removal of american troops from the philippines i think my brother shared the belief that the bases should go , he said photo we need to cut the apron strings with america , even though we are scared to do it , said senator agapito aquino , second from right , brotherinlaw of president corazon c aquino he joined other opponents of a new united states lease on bases in the philippines at a rally this week in manila \( reuters \)
andorra la vella , andorra to be fair , many andorrans are quick to blame themselves indeed , they add repentantly , if this tiny principality tucked in the pyrenees is now bemoaning its identity crisis , it is because its citizens have been too anxious to get rich quickly today , they admit soberly , they see the results they are as affluent as germans , but their traditional way of life may have gone forever they still have a flag , anthem , passport , parliament and no fewer that two heads of state , but they no longer recognize the andorra of yore we have to rediscover the modesty and dignity of our past , said antoni morell mora , a lawyer who has written historical novels about andorra the problem is that few people are willing to make the sacrifices necessary to rescue the idea of andorra tourists are still told how charlemagne first gave land rights to local farmers in the ninth century , how the principality was created in 1278 , how france s head of state and spain s bishop of urgel have long been its coprinces , how andorra about a fifth the size rhode island has always been neutral a kind of hong kong but residents only see what has happened since the 1960 s , when andorrans abandoned farming for commerce , finance and real estate speculation and began turning the principality into a kind of hong kong in the pyrenees by offering discount prices and secret bank accounts to their french and spanish neighbors andorrans kept the business to themselves through rules excluding foreign investment but by the time they were drawing 10 million annual visitors in the 1980 s , they needed more and more immigrants to build and run the supermarkets , boutiques and hotels that line the main road now andorrans have become a minority in their own land fewer than one in five of the principality s 50 , 000 inhabitants are an andorran citizens and the number of spanish and portuguese immigrants continues to grow faster than the local population in 1950 we were only 7 , 000 people and almost all andorrans , said oscar ribas reig , the pipesmoking banker who is now chief of government in 1983 we were still only 25 , 000 so you 'll see our growth is alarming and out of all proportion this has led to a very serious loss of identity and sense of nation more recently , western europe has also begun to besiege andorra as the 12nation european community prepares to eliminate all its borders by dec 31 , 1992 , andorra is being pressed to conform its neighbors are even demanding that it modernize and liberalize centuriesold laws and customs a state of instability we 're asking ourselves , what role can europe s microstates play after 1992 \? mr ribas said , referring to monaco , liechtenstein and san marino as well perhaps we should ask , what role will the european community impose on us \? we 're in a state of institutional instability europe s influence , though , is already apparent last year , the coprinces president francois mitterrand and bishop juan marti alanis issued the country s first penal code , which , among other things , eliminated the death penalty now the plan is to draft andorra s first constitution we need it to show we are democratic , mr ribas said further , because andorra has been required by the european community to reduce its import duties , it will soon introduce a sales tax to make up for lost revenue an income tax , though , is still out of the question any government that proposed one would fall , jaime bartumeu cassany , the finance minister , admitted but there is also resistance to change from the country s 28member parliament for example , after almost a year , it has taken no action on a bill lifting the ban on trade unions despite urging from paris and madrid we have a real problem , mr ribas said a single tractor across our one main road could paralyze the country the bishop says no then there is the question of social customs andorrans may marry only in church , and divorce , abortion , sterilizations and vasectomies are all banned pressure is building up to allow at least civil marriages , but bishop marti will have none of it and both coprinces must approve all laws for them to take effect andorra s main quandary , though , remains what to do about immigration if andorrans want fewer foreigners , they will have to limit economic growth , said maria carme grau , editor of the catalanlanguage weekly poble andorra , but they do n't want to do that so they control immigration and illegals come flooding in anyway although catalan is the official language , french and spanish are both widely spoken aware that there is little support for freezing the principality s development , the government has now proposed relaxing its strict nationality rules to increase the ratio of andorrans to foreigners if the new law is approved , some 5 , 800 andorranborn children of immigrants will be given local citizenship yet as the country looks for new ways of wooing spanish and french shoppers and tourists , the need for immigrant labor seems certain to grow , creating new strains between locals and foreigners already , for example , the shortage of housing has forced many immigrants to live in caravans beside the river that runs through this city one tradition , though , has not changed every two years , andorra pays the french president 1 , 100 francs , or 240 , and the bishop of urgel 900 pesetas , or 9 every christmas , the bishop also receives 7 hams , 14 capons and 28 cheeses in exchange , however , the coprinces have yet to signal what sort of country they would like andorra to become photo the tiny country of andorra is reluctuntly facing problems that resulted from its economic growth the main street of andorra la vella is filled with shops that draw customers from spain and france \( alan riding the new york times \) map of spain highlighting andorra

washington , june 8 in the second major weapons deal since president bush pledged last week to curb the middle east arms race , defense secretary dick cheney said today that the united states would sell attack helicopters to the united arab emirates pentagon officials said the united states planned to sell 20 apache gunships to the united arab emirates and 8 to bahrain they would be the first gulf nations to buy the army s most advanced attack helicopters administration officials and military contractors said the white house was also considering selling 337 m1a1 tanks and about 160 bradley fighting vehicles to the united arab emirates in a deal that would total more than 21 billion , including the apaches the helicopter portion is worth about 500 million , a pentagon official said mr cheney s announcement comes less than a week after he said the united states would give israel 10 used f15 fighters and would continue supplying threequarters of the funds for an americanisraeli antiballistic missile , the arrow the united states also said it was stockpiling american military equipment in israel to use in any future regional conflict administration s twin goals the proposed helicopter sale to the two gulf countries , which requires congressional approval , threw into greater relief the seeming contradiction between the administration s twin goals of arms control in the middle east and meeting the security needs of washington s allies in the region mr cheney said , however , they were not divergent goals it is not inconsistent to say , on the one hand , we 're interested in arms control and , on the other hand , we want to make certain our friends can defend themselves , mr cheney told reporters on his plane returning to washington after a 10day trip to europe , israel and egypt mr cheney said that the united states cannot fall into the trap of saying that arms control means we do n't provide any arms to the middle east both the united arab emirates and bahrain are considered likely hosts for a forward headquarters of the united states central command , which headed american forces in the gulf war notified in october pentagon officials emphasized that congress was informally notified last october of the possible sale of apaches to the united arab emirates once the white house formally submits a proposed sale , which has not happened yet in this case , lawmakers have 30 days to reject it supporters of israel in congress , who fear that sales of advanced weapons to arab countries erode israel s military technological edge in the middle east , expressed outrage at the proposed sale it s distressing that this is the administration s version of arms control in the middle east , said representative mel levine , a california democrat any sale at this time is bad policy and should be stopped mr levine said it was too soon to tell if there would be enough support on capitol hill to block the proposed sale the administration last october pushed through a 73 billion emergency arms package to saudi arabia , but only after bowing to congressional opposition and splitting the original 21 billion deal into two parts there has been a virtual freeze on american arms transfers since last fall , largely because of the persian gulf conflict administration officials said today that the helicopter deal was a test case to sound the depths of congressional opposition and determine whether the sale of armored equipment to the united arab emirates could proceed , perhaps later this summer it s more of a test case in that it will give us a gauge if these helicopters are problematic what the next phase might be , said one administration official familiar with the arms sales notification to congress the official said that formal notification to congress of the helicopter sale was imminent , but that any decision on selling tanks and armored vehicles to the united arab emirates was not ripe the proposed transfers are running into a bipartisan buzzsaw of opposition to arms sales to the middle east there are at least four pending bills or amendments in the house and senate to impose moratoriums or other curbs on american arms sales to the region one amendment , for example , sponsored by representative dante b fascell , a florida democrat who is head of the house foreign affairs committee , would provide for an indefinite moratorium on major united states arms sales to the middle east until another major arms supplier broke the moratorium or permanent contraints were put in place none of this makes sense , said representative larry smith , a florida democrat on the foreign affairs committee apache attack helicopters are not defensive weapons they do n't belong in a sale of any kind an administration official said the white house expected criticism from any proposed sales , but it would not discourage any deals we presume we 're going to get grief , but the grief level wo n't determine a decision on sales we think are justified , the official said the united states and its allies do not want to give up the ability to sell conventional military equipment to their friends in the middle east mr bush , however , borrowing from a canadian proposal , has called for a meeting of the united states , the soviet union , china , france , britain to work out guidelines on conventional weapons
to nobody s surprise , the seemingly interminable wrangle over the transportation reauthorization bill , now heading for a congressional conference , is all about money how much of it will uncle sam hand out , how will the states divide it , how much will go to mass transit what may surprise is the pox on all their pork barrels view of peter gordon , an associate dean of urban planning at the university of southern california and author of a new position paper from the libertarian reason foundation he reckons that much of the 100 billion to 150 billion slated for highway and masstransit aid over the next half decade is bound to be wasted unless washington turns over a new economic leaf the alternative to gridlock as usual , mr gordon argues , is a transportation policy that exploits opportunities to privatize , asks most users to pay their own way and subsidizes needy transit patrons rather than empirebuilding transit bureaucracies the white house wants to invest 105 billion in surface transportation over five years , mostly on highways the house would opt for 151 billion over six years , raising the extra green by extending 25 cents of the nickelagallon gasoline surcharge due to expire in 1996 the senate s fiveyear , 123 billion version , the choice of many goodgovernment types , puts more emphasis on repair of roads and bridges and puts a higher priority on mass transit but mr gordon sees fewer distinctions here than differences more cash for mass transit will simply mean more underused monuments to transit engineering , he predicts and federally financed relief of highway traffic jams is , at best , a palliative because government does not have the wisdom or the will to charge road users according to the congestion they create those seeking to learn from mistakes of the past , mr gordon says , need only look at the newest transit systems , which carry far fewer passengers than expected and require enormous subsidies to operate the miami heavyrail system , for example , is moving only 15 percent of the forecast traffic , and at a cost of 1677 a ride even washington s much admired subway scarfs subsidies like an armada of stealth bombers each ride works out to almost 9 light rail called trollies in a less officious age does n't have a much better record the new system in portland , orecarries just half the number of passengers projected , at a cost of 5 each these mistakes are not hard to explain , mr gordon argues most cities do not have sufficient numbers of commuters living along narrow corridors to support fixed rail and in many cases , commuting density is even too light to justify the use of fullsize buses on fixed routes but transit authorities keep investing in steel and concrete because the alternative is a loss of influence and employees highway policy is apparently no better grounded in the public interest while private cars are \( and will inevitably remain \) the backbone of transportion through the urban sprawl , most roads cost nothing but time to use and by no coincidence , most are choked at rush hour with cars on errands of marginal value radical failure , mr gordon believes , requires a radical fix he would phase out masstransit construction subsidies , convert operating subsidies to vouchers for lowincome families and make all transit aid contingent on breaking local transit monopolies the vouchers , modeled after food stamps , would support service for people who could not afford to commute by car as important , they would create demanddriven transit systems ones that mr gordon expects would evolve into flexible van and jitney networks operated by workers paid competitive wages he would also chip away at policies that encourage profligate use of roads it may not be possible to eliminate existing taxbased subsidies for employerprovided parking but one could even the playing field by allowing employees to receive transit vouchers in lieu of free parking without incurring added tax liability by the same token , federal rules prohibiting tolls on currently free swatches of the interstate highway system may not be the only reason local governments balk at imposing congestion fees but elimination of the prohibition would certainly do away with one good excuse john kain , a transportation economist at harvard university , estimates that 90 percent of urban road congestion is caused by the underpricing of a key 5 percent of road capacity none of these reforms are even remotely possible , of course , unless public servants are prepared to risk the wrath of special interests grown accustomed to their perks but then , in more naive times , one assumed that was what public service was all about drawing

los angeles , march 30 the day after the police beating of a black motorist , mayor tom bradley huddled in his office with deputy mayor mark d fabiani and a few top aides to watch the videotape of the incident in the darkened room , they concentrated on the blurry image until it ended then there was a long silence it was just beyond belief to me to see these officers , mr bradley recalled this week , to see them come in like a pack of wolves , hitting , kicking , mauling that man lying on the ground and not resisting i felt a sense of outrage i 've never felt before the aides could only guess at the thoughts of the taciturn 73yearold mayor , who was a los angeles policeman for 21 years as a black officer in the 1940 s and 1950 s , he could not walk a beat or ride on patrol with white officers because the department was segregated now , after 17 years as mayor , he prides himself above all for the racial peace he has helped to maintain here for most of the 26 years since the watts riots his greatest crisis \? the march 3 beating threatened to upset all that , spawning what mr fabiani termed mr bradley s greatest crisis as mayor through it , the mayor , who has seldom been known to enter a political battle he could not win , has steered a delicate course there in the first days was his familiar image on television , calling for calm , for the restoration of credibility and integrity to the police department yet he has remained at least outwardly aloof from the fray over chief daryl f gates he has refused to call directly for the chief s resignation , which his aides say he would accept but which he cannot require under a city charter that makes him about the weakest bigcity mayor in america his admirers say this has been the finest moment in mr bradley s career , which seemed near its end less than two years ago , when he was struggling through a scandal over his personal finances there has been none of the bombast that might have come from other city halls under such circumstances , and there has been no racial upheaval since the black man , rodney g king , was savagely beaten by white officers while a witness across the street videotaped the pummeling 'an evolutionary approach' you are witnessing him at his best , said michael j gage , a former deputy mayor he has maintained in this polyglot city a sensitivity to multiple nationalities he has taken an evolutionary approach , not reacting in a kneejerk way to the demands of any particular community indeed , mr bradley has found his harshest critics among los angeles s blacks , torn between pride in his success and widespread feelings that he has been slow to confront what they say are years of racism and abuse by the police under chief gates i'm for gates s removal , but i'm also for bradley s removal , said booker griffin , who has a talk show on radio station kgsj on the program , which appeals mainly to black audiences , callers have denounced mayor bradley for not publicly demanding chief gates s resignation in response , the mayor said there is a lack of understanding of my approach to problems if i do not have the authority , i do not go through an exercise in futility instead , i try to exhaust every legal means possible to resolve the problem when that appears impossible , i reserve the right to express the view he should resign i am not going to preempt that just to get an emotional response a response to corruption the episode has underscored the extraordinary impotence of los angeles mayors under the city charter , passed in 1937 after the reign of mayor frank shaw , whose administration was riddled with police corruption the mayor of los angeles cannot select department heads they are chosen by commissions he appoints once selected , they have civil service status , meaning they cannot be dimissed except for cause , narrowly interpreted to mean things like moral turpitude , theft or other illegal acts one of the things i hear most often is , 'why are you not able to fire department heads \? ' mr bradley said i cannot conceive of a city like los angeles where the mayor does not have the power to appoint or dismiss department heads it s a terrible system a catalyst for change \? the king episode may have provided the climate for change the mayor has proposed a charter amendment , as he has without success three times in 10 years , to allow the mayor to change top appointments every five years the city council is expected to put it on the november ballot , but it cannot apply to incumbents like chief gates thus , the mayor has been reduced to using indirect pressure on the chief , with whom he has clashed repeatedly in the 12 years since mr gates was installed the mayor has appointed new members to the fivemember police commission , which oversees the department , and has announced that he would appoint a panel of citizens to study problems in the department the mayor s goal is to keep the city together while keeping his options open , mr fabiani said mr bradley conceded that it might not be possible to remove the 64yearold chief , whose sarcastic and scrappy style could hardly contrast more sharply with the mayor s
washington , aug 1 william von raab , the former commissioner of customs , today accused the bush administration of dragging its feet on an investigation of the bank of credit and commerce international and of barring him from sensitive information about the scandalriddled bank when he pushed for stronger action the treasury department , under which mr von rabb served as customs commissioner , immediately replied that the commissioner was , indeed , kept away from sensitive information for fear he would disclose it this exchange marked another chapter in a longrunning feud between mr von rabb and treasury secretary nicholas f brady still , it also underscored the political tensions involved in the hearings on bcci conducted today by the senate foreign relations subcommittee on terrorism , narcotics and international operations big point of contention the question of whether the treasury department , the justice department and the federal reserve board ignored warnings that bcci was engaged in criminal activities and was the secret owner of first american bankshares inc , a company with strong political connections , has emerged in recent days as a big point of contention between the administration and critics in congress and elsewhere senator john f kerry , the massachusetts democrat and subcommittee chairman , has been criticizing the government and pressing for answers as to why the government knew so much about bcci s potentially criminal tendencies , yet appeared to have ignored the evidence mr von rabb was one of several witnesses during a day of accusation and official denial that produced the following accounts officials of the federal reserve said the bank was never informed that the central intelligence agency knew at least five years ago that bcci illegally controlled first american bankshares , washington s largest banking company the state department said it learned in 1986 through the intelligence community that the organization of a leading terrorist , abu nidal , used a bcci branch in europe for commercial transactions in his written testimony , a peter burleigh , the department s coordinator for counterterrorism , said that information was used to disrupt abu nidal s commercial activities in an international effort a number of countries , including east germany and poland under communist governments , were approached as part of the effort with requests that they close down businesses in their countries that were working with abu nidal jack blum , a former investigator for the subcommittee , testified that he had been told by a former bank official that bcci worked with about 3 , 000 highnetworth criminal clients , and that the rest of the bank s apparently legitimate banking activity was set up to shroud its business with those clients according to an affidavit introduced at the hearing , a former bcci official who had been subpoened in 1988 to testify before the subcommittee told an undercover customs agent that he had been advised by clark m clifford , who represented bcci , to get transferred to paris to slow down senator kerry s investigation robert s bennett , a lawyer for mr clifford , the chairman of first american , did not return a call for comment last night reports of weapons deals the hearing also brought out a number of allegations about the bank s involvement in illicit activities and weapons deals these included statements that bcci had been involved in financing a shipment of scud missles to syria and had assisted pakistan in its efforts to obtain triggers for nuclear weapons in his statements , mr von raab said that he had been eased out of responsibility for a 1988 customs investigation of moneylaundering at bcci in florida , and that sensitive documents had been kept from him by order of officials with the treasury department just as the inquiry was reaching its peak i was told i was not to have information from the bcci case , mr von raab said , they felt i was overzealous in my drug enforcement efforts , and they were uncomfortable with the way i worked with congress and the press to push cases he asserted this as part of his contention that the government had been lackadaisical in its prosecution of criminal cases against the bank , which was indicted in 1988 for moneylaundering at a tampa , fla , branch office the bank pleaded guilty in 1990 and forfeited 14 million pleabargain agreement more important , the pleabargain arrangement included an agreement that the justice department could not prosecute bcci for any illegal activities that the government was aware of at the time the deal formally entered in the federal district court in tampa in 1990 at the time , the justice department had possession of tape recordings , made by undercover federal agents , in which bcci officials openly claimed to control first american bank and could rely on the influence of its chairman , mr clifford , a prominent washington lawyer and democratic presidential adviser
to the editor justice department officials hail as a victory for students the agreement by eight ivy league schools to stop sharing student financial aid information \( front page , may 23 \) and you quote attorney general dick thornburgh as having said at a news conference , students and their families are entitled to the full benefits of price competition when they choose a college these are both honorable sentiments , but they reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of how tuition levels are determined and how a college education is financed the assumption by justice department officials that price competition will work to the benefit of students is based on a simpleminded application of economic theory we all know that in a free market with perfect competition among many profitmaximizing businesses , competition serves to keep prices down to the level at which the market clears the problem is that universities have never been profit maximizers at the schools covered by the consent agreement that you report , tuition covers only a relatively small portion of the actual cost of educating a student the rest of the cost comes from other sources , such as alumni donations none of these funds are used to pay dividends to stockholders , because there are no dividends and no stockholders that these universities are not in the business of maximizing profits should be clear from the fact that tuitions are as low as they are the demand for admission to ivy league colleges is always several times higher than the supply if these schools really were the profit maximizers the justice department seems to think they are , why have n't they raised tuitions to the level at which the market clears \? and why do they offer deep discounts , in the form of financial aid , on a product that is in such high demand \? the answer is that these schools really do believe that they are serving a worthwhile social goal by keeping tuitions as low as possible rationing financial aid by avoiding bidding wars for students , including the use of the informationsharing meeting , serves this goal it insures that the best use possible is made of each school s limited financial aid dollars the real irony is that the agreement with the justice department will only speed up the increase in tuition if some students are able to bid up the amount of financial aid they receive , and thus pay less to attend an ivy league school , someone else will have to pay more at that point , either other students will receive less financial aid , or the nominal tuition level will have to increase the result either way will be to increase the net cost to qualified students who lack the bargaining chips that count most at ivy league schools steven greene palo alto , calif , may 23 , 1991
facing a recession and a banking crisis , the federal reserve s top policy makers are cutting interest rates almost every week as they seek to reawaken the economy but they are taking each step reluctantly not convinced that the recession will turn out to be severe or that many banks will fail the federal reserve has reduced interest rates recently only after the publication of data showing fresh weakness in the economy by acting largely after economic weakness appears , and not in anticipation of it , the federal reserve has scaled back its role in fighting the recession , some analysts say the reluctance showed up in interviews with 7 of the central bank s 18 policy makers , some of whom agreed to speak only off the record reducing interest rates helps to reverse a recession by encouraging people to borrow and spend but many of the policy makers are not primarily concerned with reversing the recession these officials worry more about preventing a surge in the inflation rate , the interviews showed their concern is that if the borrowing and spending become too robust and shortages develop , then prices will rise sharply that would force the federal reserve to push up interest rates sharply to control the inflation , and that in turn could cause a more severe recession we are proceeding in a rather cautious manner , said robert p black , president of the federal reserve bank of richmond our staff projects for us what might happen next to the economy , but none of us really knows i know that i do n't the federal reserve exercises most of its power over interest rates by controlling the rate charged for socalled federal funds , a misnomer for the money that banks lend to one another when the federal funds rate drops , the banks can lower their rates on auto loans , mortgages , other consumer loans and business loans , thus encouraging people to borrow and spend the reluctance to reduce interest rates to fight the recession has divided the federal reserve policy makers , according to those interviewed the 18 policy makers are the 6 sitting governors of the federal reserve board , including alan greenspan , the chairman , and the 12 presidents of the federal reserve s regional banks roughly nine of the policy makers think the current recession could be short and relatively mild for them , too much stimulation now through lower interest rates could inflate prices later this year , if the economy bounces back but four or five policy makers would have preferred sharper cuts in interest rates , beginning early in october , as insurance against a severe recession the almost weekly rate reductions currently under way did not begin until early december , when the recession was clearly hurting the economy the dissident faction robert p forrestal , president of the federal reserve bank of atlanta , is perhaps the most outspoken of the dissidents but the interviews showed that , remarkably , mr greenspan also appears to be among them , along with david w mullins jr , a recently appointed governor who is expected to become mr greenspan s vice chairman soon nevertheless , the dissidents do not push their case very forcefully , largely because they too worry about future inflation rarely has a federal reserve chairman not gotten his way , but mr greenspan appears to have accepted the majority view you do n't want to exacerbate inflation , mr forrestal said but faced with the possibility of a serious recession , i would prefer a little more insurance in the form of lower interest rates the operative word , however , is 'little' similar caution showed up in mr greenspan s behavior this week on tuesday , he ordered a quarterpoint reduction in the federal funds rate the other policy makers had given him authority to act on his own , but mr greenspan did so only after receiving fresh data that would convince even the most resolute inflation fighters that the inflation rate is probably waning specifically , mr greenspan learned on tuesday that the nation s money supply had continued to grow sluggishly , partly because banks were not , in effect , creating much new money through fresh loans in a conference call to the other policy makers on wednesday , mr greenspan cited the weak moneysupply figures as a major justification for the action he had taken the day before , according to martha seger , a fed governor the moneysupply figures were not publicly announced until yesterday but cuts in interest rates worry the federal reserve members most concerned about inflation , among them mr black the two most prominent members of this group are robert p parry , president of the san francisco federal reserve , and w lee hoskins , president of the cleveland federal reserve among other things , they argue that the recession might never have developed if not for the persian gulf crisis , which drove up energy costs and , more important , destroyed public confidence , making americans reluctant to spend and invest once the crisis is over , this argument goes , the economy might bounce back too rapidly , driving up the inflation level , which has fallen in recent months to less than 45 percent at an annual rate , as measured by the consumer price index , from nearly 6 percent early last year the worry is that if inflation rises again , the federal reserve will have to increase the federal funds rate sharply to discourage economic activity and bring down prices such an action could produce a recession much worse than the present one lessons from the 1970 s
akron , ohio tom h barrett has had a gruelling twoyear tenure as chairman of the goodyear tire and rubber company since he took over , goodyear , once known by its rivals as the gorilla because of its dominance of the world tire business , has lost the lead to france s groupe michelin and the tire business has taken a turn for the worst none of the top companies not michelin , goodyear or japan s bridgestone corporation is faring well and the uncertainty over oil prices , the unending price cutting and chronic overcapacity among tire producers , plus anemic auto sales , are likely to keep the industry in a tailspin there are simply too many tires chasing too few buyers despite consolidation of the industry into the hands of a few global companies over the last decade and the idling of dozens of plants , producers have been unable to raise prices as industry costs have increased , leaving them little choice but to cut their own costs to make money and here , no company has been any more aggressive than goodyear as the only publicly traded tire company among the top five , which also includes germany s continental and italy s pirelli , goodyear is under greater pressure from investors than its rivals to post quarterly improvements mr barrett and his top managers decided last summer to slash the company s capital spending and flatten the layers of management in its north american operation over the next two years , goodyear expects to lay off about 3 , 000 employees , nearly 3 percent of its work force worldwide the largest layoff in its history we have taken some actions that have been difficult , but they will help this company compete , said mr barrett , a plainspoken man from topeka , kan , who has been with goodyear for 37 years , principally in manufacturing these are difficult times for us and i get a little impatient that we 're not moving as fast as we should in some areas with uptodate plants that are as efficient as any in the industry , goodyear may now be poised for an improvement indeed , since the company announced the restructuring , its stock price has climbed it is trading at around 20 , up from 14 in november still , that s well down from the 50plus range of 1989 and last week , the standard poor s corporation said it was considering downgrading some of the company s ratings a lot of what they 're doing is positive , but it s not payting off yet , said dennis byrne , a professor of economics at the university of akron and a tire industry consultant harry w millis , an independent tire analyst in cleveland , said oil prices will probably be lower than people expected and goodyear has done a lot of cost cutting that will show up in the next year , he expects the company to earn 120 million this year that would be well below its performance in 1989 , when it netted 2068 million on sales of 108 billion , but better than 1990 the company has yet to report results for all of last year , but analysts project a net loss of at least 30 million on sales of more than 11 billion tire makers are being tarred in part because they are captives of the auto market the slump in auto sales has already caused auto makers to slash the price they 're willing to pay for new tires by about 20 percent at the same time , competition in the replacement market , which accounts for about twothirds of the industry s roughly 475 billion in worldwide sales , is forcing companies to cut prices so deeply that profits are thinner than they have been in decades the industry just does n't seem to make any sense , said professor byrne it seems as though the major goal among the tire companies is to get market share and they will do anything to sell more tires than the next guy earnings might have been healthier if companies had been shouldering less debt each of the top five has taken on a mountain of debt in the last five years either to make an acquisition or , in the case of goodyear , to fend one off for instance , michelin , which recently said that it would report a 400 million loss for 1990 , assumed 800 million in debt in its purchase last year of the uniroyal goodyear tire company the acquisition vaulted it into the marketshare lead , but brought its debt to 6 billion goodyear is the only toptier tire maker not to have merged in the last decade still , it has yet to recover from a 1986 takeover attempt by sir james goldsmith , the british investor to fight off the pursuit , goodyear sold its highly profitable aerospace division to the loral corporation for 650 million and took on 38 billion in debt , largely to finance a 2 billion stock repurchase plan the company s ratio of debt to equity soared to more than 70 percent , from 30 percent , and has since fallen back only to the 60 percent range and goodyear has suffered other headaches that rivals have not a big one the unprofitable 1 , 750mile crude oil pipeline between california and texas that it bought in 1985 as a way to diversify although the pipeline is designed to carry more than 400 , 000 barrels of oil a day , it is handling only about 100 , 000 barrels
beyond the junkyards , abandoned buildings and battleweary tenements on the river s edge of east harlem , there is pleasant village tucked amid streets strewn with old sofas and tires , pleasant village is a faint , but still palpable , memory of east harlem s better days immaculate turnofthe century brownstones alternate with decrepit walkups and empty lots on quiet streets , where people still post handwritten signs on store windows \( free summer art classes at the community garden \) , knowing their messages will be there the next day but pleasant village is neither an undiscovered paradise nor a euphemism , one of those old manhattan neighborhoods renamed as a marketing gimmick by realestate brokers , like manhattan valley on the upper west side or clinton in hell s kitchen it was named by members of its block association about 10 years ago , in part for pleasant avenue , the oddity between franklin d roosevelt drive and first avenue , extending from 114th to 120th street but the village itself goes farther west , to first avenue and its sense of itself tightknit , proud reaches back more than 50 years decades ago , it was an uptown little italy as bustling as mulberry street families spilled onto the streets in the summer neighbors divided their loyalties between two busy parishes , holy rosary and our lady of mount carmel politics were a local passion it had its own tammany hall outpost , the kanawha democratic club , and a homegrown congressman , vito marcantonio , who found international fame heading the american labor party in the 1940 s today , a shadow of the old neighborhood survives elders play cards and argue politics in a storefront social club some staples the churches , the bakery , butcher shop and deli hold steady and there is a stoop life but the streets fold when stores close , at dusk the annual july feasts at our lady of mount carmel , which once rivaled san gennaro s , have shrunk to small family affairs pleasant village is a quiet recess of puerto rican , italian and black neighbors , as well as a few germans and irish whose families were there for several generations pledged to a peaceful coexistence by a common concern for their small piece of manhattan , they watch one another s children and look askance at unfamiliar cars and faces many own their own brownstones and have friendly competitions for the best front yard rebecca feuerstein , who is 39 years old and has lived in the neighborhood all her life , calls pleasant village a safe haven her two children play outside she knows all her neighbors and , she said , you can park your car almost anywhere some people actually do neighborhood lore has it that a certain local celebrity , a man known for his powerful and sinisterlooking friends , confidently parks his mercedes on 114th street criminals are said to find the area inhospitable but a tender , nurtured peace is only part of what distinguishes pleasant village , from , say , the senator robert wagner houses , a squat housing project on its 120th street border infested with gangs and drugs there is also the food pleasant villagers like to boast about rao s \( pronounced rayohs \) , where jerry lewis can occasionally be spotted debarking from a limousine and where reservations must be made months in advance locals also cite patsy s , one of the few brick oven pizzerias anywhere in the city they go on about the smoked mozzarella , made fresh , at l t s deli a few residents like to murmur words like resurgence and revival they mention that when apartments are advertised \( 3 1 2 room in pvt brwnstn , pkg available 695 \) , fine upstanding sorts take them and they recall all the artists who come looking for lofts \( none exist \) they point to the refurbished brownstones on 118th street , restored over the last 10 years or so by committed pioneers as a lastditch effort , they describe the turnaround of benjamin franklin high school on 116th street it has become the manhattan center for science and mathematics , housing three of district 4 s muchlauded alternative schools but most here consider such talk a realestate broker s dream roberta guaspari tzavaras , 42 , is a newcomer she bought a brownstone eight years ago , having discovered pleasant village while teaching in a school in its strip when i tell people i live in pleasant village in east harlem , she said , they say , 'yeah , right' but it s a neat neighborhood
minneapolis , june 1 it has been nearly 60 years since 412 poor black sharecroppers suffering from syphilis were rounded up in tuskegee , ala , for what would become the most notorious example of human experimentation in this country for 40 years , the men were never told what had stricken them , while doctors observed the ravages of the disease , from blindness and paralysis to dementia and early death even after penicillin proved to be an effective treatment for syphilis , they were not told about it now , as aids looms as a far deadlier threat than syphilis to impoverished minority groups , and with no cure in sight , scientists are struggling with the ethical questions raised by the tuskegee experiment and the weaknesses of current efforts , like informed consent and peer review , to protect patients from exploitation the debate has taken on greater immediacy as some in the medical establishment propose segregating by race procedures like organ transplants and blood transfusions to improve the chances of matching donor to recipient and as the disparities between the health and life expectancy of black and white americans continue to widen an effect in the long term it was under the cloud of tuskegee and the bleak health statistics for blacks that about 200 researchers , ethicists , doctors and other health care professionals gathered here at a meeting organized by the united states public health service to discuss the notorious experiment and examine its longterm effect on the relationship between blacks and the medical establishment at the core of the debate here was the sense that a predominantly white , middleclass medical establishment has failed lowincome blacks , a group that provides most of the patients in many prestigious urban teaching hospitals there is clear , demonstrable , undeniable evidence of discrimination and racism in our health care system , dr louis w sullivan , secretary of health and human services said each year since 1984 , while the health status of the general population has increased , black health status has actually declined this decline is not in one or two health categories it is across the board the secretary cited a black infant mortality rate twice that fpr whites and a life expectancy for blacks that is six years less than for whites absence of condemnation other speakers said the medical establishment s unquestioning acceptance of the tuskegee study , which was conducted by the united states public health service , and its findings were evidence of the continuing gulf between organized medicine and many black americans the horrors the program have raised troubling questions about the humanity and propriety of such research when and under what conditions , if ever , can human beings be used for purposes of acquisition of knowledge \? asked dr jay katz , professor of law , medicine and psychiatry at yale university in most cases , he said , the despised , the disadvantaged , the disempowered will become the first cannon fodder for research they may be blacks , jews , the mentally handicapped , women or children all those with whom it is difficult to identify many at the conference said such an absence of doctors' common feelings of humanity with minority members , as epitomized by the tuskegee experiment , raises questions about tests and treatments given the many members of such groups who suffer from aids the problem in the tuskegee case , dr katz said , was that patients , for whom treatment was originally intended , became data destined for a federally sponsored research program , in a deliberate decision that was made after it became apparent that there would be no money for treatment privilege is protected since the experiment , which took place from 1932 until 1972 , safeguards have put into place , like requirements for a subject s written consent and review of pending research by a panel of researchers' peers but , ethicists say , impoverished poorly educated patients remain at a disadvantage informed consent is a privileged man s protection , said dr arthur caplan , director of the center for biomedical ethics at the university of minnesota and a chief organizer of the symposium it is not going to work as well for someone who is poor and uneducated and for whom the researcher may have prejudice and contempt it works best for those who are educated enough to know to demand it the tuskegee study has had farreaching effects on how blacks view health care and medical treatment , the speakers contended it has made many of them suspicious of research of any kind and has contributed to the underrepresentation of blacks in clinical trials for new drugs and voluntary organ donations at death among others , said dr vanessa northington gamble , an assistant professor of medicine at the university of wisconsin in madison dr robert f murray jr , a professor of medicine and genetics at howard university , said many blacks were afraid that hospitals would not work as hard to save them if they knew they can get a black patient s organs as a geneticist , he argued against efforts to separate blood and organs by race he said that despite genetic predispositions to certain diseases , like sickle cell anemia among blacks and taysachs disease among jews which are cited by many who argue for such separation , interracial breeding from the time of slavery has made race as socials definition with little biological meaning 'we should n't start' we should n't start the ball rolling , he said in a racist society , once you start , where do you stop \? blacks would always be at a disadvantage in getting tissue because we are a minority in the population symposium speakers tried to convince blacks in the audience that neither the syphilis study nor aids were the result of white conspiracies , but many blacks were not persuaded i think that s how aids got out , said dottie fenrick , who runs a daycare center in minneapolis you do n't know what they 're doing it s a wonder our entire race is n't wiped out other blacks were infuriated by descriptions of the annual roundup of the men in the tuskegee for medical tests , including spinal taps and blood samples , and the subjects' complete trust that such testing was really treatment it makes me feel angry , angry , angry , angry , said regina sellers , a minneapolis social worker it makes me livid none of the 17 surviving subjects of the tuskegee experiment , all in their 80 s and enfeebled , participated in the symposium but their words and faces were never far from people s minds in 1974 , after a classaction lawsuit filed by the subjects and their families , the government agreed to award 37 , 500 to the 70 subjects then living and 15 , 000 to the heirs of each of those who died many relatives had to execute the documents by making marks instead of signatures these descendents showed me how far these people had n't come , bill carter , a tuskegee lawyer , was quoted in the symposium s exhibit the sad thing is that it could happen all over again these people could just as easily be conned and taken advantage of as their fathers and grandfathers were in the syphilis study photo dr louis w sullivan there is clear , demonstrable , undeniable evidence of discrimination and racism in our health care system \( the new york times \)
manchester , nh , april 30 former senator paul e tsongas of massachusetts began a longshot campaign for the presidency today with a scornful indictment of washington mediocrity and a plea for a different path toward economic and political renewal with a quietly reflective speech here and in his hometown of lowell , mass , mr tsongas became the first official candidate of the 1992 presidential campaign today i begin a journey of purpose , he said at an outdoor rally in lowell , where hundreds of supporters listened stoically through a driving rain i ask you to come with me mr tsongas \( the name is pronounced songguss \) enters a race for the democratic presidential nomination that seems frozen by the war in the persian gulf , the remarkable popularity of president bush and the fear among many democrats that the president is all but unbeatable democrats from the rev jesse jackson to senator al gore of tennessee have been considering a race , but only mr tsongas , who left the senate six years ago because he had cancer , has taken the plunge 'values of our ancestors' the 50yearold massachusetts democrat , who underwent a successful bone marrow transplant five years ago , seemed untroubled today by the conventional wisdom , which holds that his chances for the nomination are slim indeed , he offered his candidacy as an antidote to politicsasusual , seeming to play to the same restless mood among voters that showed up in numerous public opinion polls and some elections last year he talked of returning to the values of our ancestors and of recognizing the nation s responsibility to future generations by refusing to burden them with a spoiled environment and a bloated federal debt in the apache tongue the word for grandfather and grandson is the same , said mr tsongas , surrounded by his wife and three daughters they understood linkage they understood honor they understood mutual obligation in washington there is no such wisdom it is all here and now it is all polling data the vision extends only to the next election this failure of political leadership , mr tsongas said , has left the nation drifting , falling far short of its destiny we were never meant to be the world s greatest debtor nation , he said we were never meant to have american workers rank ninth in the world in wages we were never meant to have dysfunctional schools or imploding cities or racial disharmony or an evironment at risk a harder , steeper path in contrast to the madefortelevision messages of most political speeches , mr tsongas s announcement speech had an almost mystical tone i offer a different path , he said , harder but more hopeful , longer but more compelling , steeper but more worthy he compared the political journey facing the nation to his own journey past cancer born out of that adversity was a commitment to devote myself to those people and to those issues that truly matter to me , he said so far , mr tsongas s campaign has revolved around what he sees as the nation s serious economic decline , and he says this demands new thinking and new policies , like a more aggressive federal role in helping businesses develop new technologies he presents himself as a probusiness liberal who is committed to an economic renaissance , and he breaks with fellow democrats on several issues a loyal audience in lowell mr tsongas supports a carefully targeted cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment he backs nuclear power as a means of easing the nation s dependence on fossil fuels , a stance he did not mention here in new hampshire , where the issue has long been controversial and he backs a free trade pact with mexico , an issue that has caused bitter debate among democrats his announcement in lowell this morning drew a loyal audience that came packing umbrellas and determined enthusiasm he s a hometown guy , what do you think \? said david gannon , when asked where he stood on mr tsongas the new candidate delivered his speech against a backdrop of renovated textile mills , intended to reflect the economic development projects that mr tsongas pushed for during much of his political career still , the massachusetts miracle that michael s dukakis rode to the democratic nomination three years ago has long since faded from lowell , mr tsongas drove to new hampshire , where the nation s first presidential primary will be held early next year , then flew on to iowa , which holds the first caucuses in new hampshire he spoke on the manchester campus of the university of new hampshire , where some democratic politicians shied away from assessing his chances but noted that he certainly had an opportunity to fill a void it seems there s few other democrts with the courage or the wherewithal to jump into the field , said joseph grandmaison , former state democratic chairman that gives him an opportunity peggy connolly , spokeswoman for the campaign , said the response of much of the democratic establishment was cordial but not enthusiastic she said mr tsongas , whose campaign at the moment has a fulltime paid staff of three , would obviously not be the democratic party establishment candidate still , he plans several trips to iowa , including a twoweek stay there in july and his announcement tour this week will also take him to denver , los angeles , seattle , san francisco , san jose , calif , and tampa , fla the campaign is clearly sensitive to the issue of mr tsongas s health , making the candidate s physician , dr tak takvorian , generally available dr takvorian , who treated mr tsongas for lymphoma , said the former senator has shown no sign of the disease since he underwent the bone marrow transplant in 1986 regardless of mr tsongas s chances for the nomination , there was the reassuring air today of the old rituals of presidential campaigns grinding forward once again the bus motorcades from manchester to logan international airport in boston , the new hampshire pols sizing up a candidate , the audiences willing and eager for applause lines let s go ! mr tsongas exclaimed at lowell today and with a lurch , the campaign began anew paul efthemios tsongas current job of counsel , foley , hoag eliot chairman , massachusetts board of regents of higher education date of birth feb 14 , 1941 lowell , mass education dartmouth college , ba , 1962 yale law school , llb , 1967 religion greek orthodox military service none married to nicola \( niki \) sauvage , dec 21 , 1969 children ashley , 17 katina , 13 and molly , 9 government positions peace corps volunteer , ethiopia , 196264 peace corps training coordinator , west indies , 196768 city councilor , lowell , 196872 deputy assistant attorney general , massachusetts , 19691971 us representative , 197478 us senator , 197884 other major positions private law practice , 197174 partner , foley , hoag eliot , 198589
alan simpson is a lively kind of guy , the sort who talks about vim and vigor and calls people boobs , who said of opponents of david souter s nomination to the supreme court you could n't change them if you herded them over the cliff in a buffalo romp reporters have always valued people like the senator from wyoming because they make our work easy they open their mouths and the quotes fall out but senator simpson does n't return the favor i believe your problems lie with the western media and not with the us government , he once told another politico as long as you 're isolated from the media , the press and it is a haughty and pampered press , they all consider themselves political geniuses , that is , the journalists do they are very cynical what i advise is that you invite them to come here and see for themselves in retrospect , it seems unfortunate that the politico to whom the senator made those sympathetic comments was saddam hussein but we can tell now that senator simpson did n't mean everything he said at the very least he did n't mean the part about inviting them to see for themselves , because he has turned his whipsaw tongue on peter arnett , the distinguished war correspondent reporting from baghdad for cnn mr simpson called mr arnett a sympathizer who was suspect for staying in iraq when all he can see is what the iraqi government shows him the first problem with the senator s remarks , other than that there is n't a shred of evidence to support them , is that they assume the american people are stupid peter arnett s cnn reports carry more disclaimers than a cigarette box only a person watching the television with the sound off would not know that the information has been carefully newsmanaged by the iraqis nevertheless i think it s better to be there and get part of the story than to leave a major area of the war uncovered otherwise i 'd see no point in having reporters in saudi arabia , where it is the pentagon officials doing the newsmanaging , making sure that reporters only see what they want them to see and go where they want them to go , and detaining them when they try to provide a lessorchestrated version of events poll figures tell us a good many americans are comfortable with press curbs some think we should let the military get on with its business without notebooks and leicas littering its path some prefer to get their information straight from the military briefings , untouched by editorial judgment and competing opinion maybe others have been happy to be spared the kind of sight television brought us from baghdad yesterday , the charred bodies of civilians killed by american bombs but i keep coming at this from a slightly different perspective five years ago i can remember being constantly confronted by readers whose question was this why are you picking on the president just because he takes the occasional nap \? today one of the questions i hear most often is this how come you guys let reagan off the hook on irancontra \? i suppose i could reply that we believed the public did n't care to see him on the hook , but that s a ridiculous answer because what reporters do has nothing to do with popularity , and maybe not even always with immediacy , which i suppose is a peculiar thing to say about a business that lives and dies by the word today sometimes reporting is most important when it takes us , methodically , cumulatively , from here to there watergate as lowlevel political dirty trick watergate as oval office conspiracy my lai as military action my lai as civilian slaughter the early vietnam reporting took on its greatest resonance afterward , when it could be seen as the beginning of a progression leading to the widespread conclusion that the war was fatally flawed maybe we wo n't even notice what we 're missing from today s war coverage until it s too late it s a quilt , what we 're making here , and when it s done we can all see some of the patterns that s why senator simpson is doing what he s doing because he knows what he thinks the pattern should be , and he s not interested in anything but stars and stripes that s why the reporters in the persian gulf are fighting press restrictions , because they think they 're missing important pieces i assume that s why mr arnett remains in iraq , because a few pieces are better than none at all but mainly we 're all doing what we 're doing because it s our job and because the best answer five years hence to the question why did n't you guys tell us what was really going on in the gulf \? is going to be we did
circumstantial evidence , like finding feathers in the cat s milk , can be highly persuasive such evidence links iran to the july 12 murder in tokyo of the japanese translator of salman rushdie s satanic verses and to the earlier stabbing in milan of the italian translator of mr rushdie s allegedly blasphemous novel iran s rulers deny responsibility believing them is no easier than ignoring telltale feathers mr rushdie , a british subject , has been in hiding since february 1989 , when ayatollah khomeini castigated the book and demanded the death of the author and his publishers a few months later , the old ayatollah died and optimists hoped his threat would be quietly withdrawn when britain resumed relations with teheran last september , iran s ruling mullahs promised to abide by world law in december a subdued mr rushdie openly embraced islam and canceled plans for a british paperback of his book none of this made any difference iranian leaders stridently reaffirmed the death threat a private islamic foundation doubled the 1 million bounty on mr rushdie s head last year assassins killed kazem rajavi , an exiled foe of the mullahs , in geneva now comes the murder of one translator and the neardeath of another incredibly , the deeds were endorsed in ringing terms by two leaders of britain s muslim community these people who have translated cannot get away with it that is the position even if it means death such words merely echo the actual intolerance inside iran , where rival mullahs vie for fundamentalist support iranians accused of religious or political crimes are executed , tortured , stoned and whipped the mullahs assume that western diplomats , eager for better relations with iran , will avert their eyes that same mentality guides iran s cruel manipulation of western hostages , including five americans held captive by proiranian gangs in lebanon sadly , intimidation works little or nothing has been said in washington or other capitals about iran s literary vendetta it has been left to private individuals and groups to affirm the obvious writing , publishing or translating a book is not a capital offense , punishable by executioners on foreign soil official mumbling about iran s death decrees only increases the risk that somebody will carry them out , with or without iranian connivance
tokyo , dec 3 for nearly a decade , japan and the united states have labored to bridge their economic differences through a series of unusually intense trade negotiations despite occasional bitterness on both sides , they shared a belief that only a few barriers stood in the way of an even deeper economic alliance from which the whole world would benefit now , however , there is a growing belief that some of those differences may be irreconcilable for the first time since these former enemies bound their destinies together after world war ii , there is a sense that the world s two largest economies are drifting apart the process has simply not gone as well as we had hoped , said j michael farren , under secretary of commerce for international trade it will not get us where we want to go we 'll make incremental progress , but it s not going to put us in the position where the trade frictions are eliminated ironically , many government officials , business leaders and trade experts say that it was the effort to come closer together that accentuated the fundamentally different approaches to economic policy , bringing the two nations to this point of departure the american economy is managed to benefit the consumer , who is given access to cheap imports and protected from overly great concentrations of corporate power the japanese model , on the other hand , is run to maximize the strength of producers , which means its consumers pay some of the highest prices in the world and exercise the least control over corporate behavior it is not just a clash of cultures but a clash of economic strategies , a competition of ideas american officials argue that because of this orientation the japanese economy remains frustratingly closed , in spite of the easing of barriers to some markets , like beef , citrus , semiconductors and wood products it s hard to show that any of these individual breakthroughs have altered the fundamental system , said david c mulford , under secretary of the treasury for international af fairs every time we think we 've made some progress , we keep finding ourselves back at the structural issues nobody is seriously predicting an outright break in this powerful pacific alliance and trade is expected to grow but there are suggestions that each will play less of a role in the other s future the japanese will place more of their emphasis on investment in asia , leaving less capital to finance united states budget deficits or to buy up american companies or open new factories japanese electronic goods and automobiles will not disappear from american shelves or showrooms , but increasingly they will come from factories in asia , rather than in japan or the united states that will mean less job creation in ohio or tennessee , as the japanese start up fewer new ventures in the united states of course , none of this will happen overnight it will take many years to redirect even a portion of what is now a substantial interdependence the united states and japan together account for about 40 percent of the world economy , and much of the business they do is with each other about 140 billion worth of goods will flow between japan and the united states this year , as well as billions of dollars in investments canada remains america s largest trading partner , but japan and the united states are each other s largest overseas trading partners nor will the two sides give up entirely on trying to facilitate the trade that does continue but trade negotiations may face some chages some key government officials also say that the unending marathon of trade confrontations , which has involved meetings almost monthly for several years running , has created a sense of burnout frankly , some of the talks on opening specific sectors have borne fruit , mr farren said they have also persuaded us that the problems are much more fundamental than trade impediments trying to ease off oneonone focus mr farren said there was some interest in both washington and tokyo to try to ease away from the headtohead focus and turn to international bodies to resolve some disputes this approach was resisted for decades because of the special postwar security relationship between the two countries the united states did not want to apply too much pressure on japan or isolate it in opposition to both the united states and europe because of its role as an ally in the battle against communism in asia there is also concern that the bargaining process may be taken out of the hands of the trade negotiators and enter the political arena some members of congress are threatening to raise barriers against the import of some japanese goods as a form of retaliation this prospect is considered even more likely if the large american deficit in autos and auto parts worsens further and there are concerns here that the formation of the north american freetrade zone by the united states , canada and mexico may redirect america s trade strategy toward the americas rather than asia japanese officials still try to put the best face on the situation they generally emphasize the progress that has been made and say the trade negotiations have been necessary to open their economy
washington , sept 22 despite new evidence that robert m gates had received fuller and earlier warnings of the irancontra affair than he previously acknowledged , a majority of the senate committee sitting in judgment appears to believe he is the man to lead the intelligence community through the uncharted waters of the 1990 s the senate intelligence committee , which will resume its hearings tuesday , will continue to cover the old ground of the armsforhostages scandal and to hear closed testimony from witnesses who both assert and deny that mr gates slanted intelligence analyses in his years at the central intelligence agency but unless the committee uncovers some startling new evidence , it seems determined to approve him to head the agency contributing to the positive , at times upbeat , atmosphere of the hearings is the peculiar composition of the committee , its weariness with the irancontra affair and its willingness to please a popular president but the biggest factor may have been mr gates s performance as a repentant , humble and dedicated public servant if there was a defining moment in the hearings , it came only 12 minutes into mr gates s opening testimony after a rather bland opening statement on monday seasoned only slightly with personal anecdote , mr gates pulled out a legal pad filled with doublespaced handwritten notes and gave the mea culpa of a lifetime his seemingly impromptu admission of mistakes and misjudgments had been plotted well in advance , but the committee loved it , seeing the apology as humanizing a man whose public image was that of a driven and ambitious taskmaster a majority of the senators sitting in judgment saw mr gates as someone who was both human enough to forget things and humble enough to admit it in essence , someone like them senator dennis deconcini sharply questioned the witness and then characterized him as almost courageous because he said he was sorry quite frankly , i thought you were going to say , 'i do n't remember , i do n't remember , ' the arizona democrat said that s an easy way out , and sometimes the only way , if it s the truth but you 've gone beyond that , and i want you to know this senator appreciates that david l boren , the oklahoma democrat who heads the committee , later called the long apology the strongest part of mr gates s testimony senator howard m metzenbaum , democrat of ohio , said that when mr gates repented , i immediately thought of richard nixon and his 'checkers speech , ' referring to the emotionally charged nationally televised address that mr nixon , then the republican vicepresidential nominee , gave in 1952 against charges that he was the beneficiary of a secret political fund there s nothing more effective in public life than getting up in front of a crowd and saying you 're sorry , mr metzenbaum said gates got brownie points for that fourandahalf years ago , when mr gates s quest for the same job failed because of unanswered questions about his role in the irancontra affair , there was little patience for what the committee viewed then as his evasive answers but even then , at the height of publicity about the armsforhostages deal and subsequent diversion of profits to the nicaraguan rebels , the scandal was too complicated and abstract to seize the imagination of the public the way the high drama of watergate did with its heroes and villains little passion for old facts today , despite the hundreds of minutely detailed questions to mr gates , there is little passion among the senators when they dredge up old testimony and depositions that their constituents care little about on the contrary , the seemingly neverending investigation by the special prosecutor , lawrence e walsh , has offended some committee members and played into mr gates s hands for those members , the stunning dismissal of the conviction of oliver l north , the former white house aide and a chief architect of the irancontra affair , on three felony counts validated their belief that mr walsh s investigation had cost the taxpayers far too much and had long outlived its usefulness i might say parenthetically that i hope that some day i will never have to talk about this subject again , senator warren b rudman , republican of new hampshire , said while questioning mr gates but i guess it just keeps coming up it s almost like a typhus epidemic in that anybody within five miles of the germ either died , is infected , or is barely able to survive , so i guess we 're back in that mode again mr gates s two democratic opponents on the panel , mr metzenbaum and bill bradley of new jersey , have largely howled alone in the wind in trying to persuade colleagues that the nominee lacks the character and integrity to be the nation s intelligence chief mr metzenbaum s effort to portray mr gates as a man who chose to hear no evil , see no evil , was popular in 1987 , but not now mr bradley s laconic meanderings through the thicket of obscure issues like the slanting of intelligence , the legal authorization of intelligencesharing and the overriding pessimism of the nominee s world view is intellectually enlightening but has not caught fire mr gates also has a number of other factors in his favor
moscow , sept 13 the failed hardline coup and its aftermath have thrown the soviet literary world into turmoil , with those who earn their living by the pen spending most of their time crossing swords instead as during so much of russian history since peter the great , the intelligentsia is split between russophile conservatives who favor strong lawandorder measures to keep their country from being overwhelmed by western influence , and prowestern reformers who want to jerk their country into the present no matter what the price to traditional values today the split among writers became formal , with the proconservative russian federation writers' union declaring independence from the soviet writers' union , an umbrella group originally set up by stalin to keep scribblers in line and reward those who obeyed with stateprovided dachas and other benefits until now , the russian federation writers' group has been a part of the nationwide union , which after the coup elected a new leadership controlled by what the russian federation writers call left , liberal or progressive writers who view their russian federation colleagues as chauvinistic reactionaries writers who seldom wrote some writers under the old system seldom wrote anything , and none had to worry much about how many books they sold the future of subsidies for literary bureaucrats when soviet publishing goes fully commercial , a day rapidly approaching , is another underlying issue things are approaching the point where every writer is going to have to answer the categorical question , 'are you with us or them , for the reds or the whites \? ' irina strelkova said today in the weekly literaturnaya rossiya the politics are increasingly vicious and personal the conservatives , who include such wellknown writers as yuri bondarev and valentin rasputin , accuse their foes of an illegal takeover of the soviet writers' organization last month after the coup , and they have named the poet yevgeny yevtushenko as the main organizer mr yevtushenko and his allies , in turn , accuse the other writers of taking public positions that had the effect of encouraging the coup plotters , who tried to use tanks and troops to overthrow president mikhail s gorbachev at the end of last month , mr yevtushenko was elected vice president of the soviet writers' union by members disgusted with the previous executives' failure to issue a statement condemning the coup while it was under way aug 1921 he then pointed an accusing finger at the conservatives in the russian union we must not leave such people morally unpunished , he said , urging the police to seal the russian federation writers' union s neoclassical headquarters building on komsomolsky prospekt and seize the property for the forces of democracy after a sitin by the angry conservative writers prevented the militia from seizing the building , a moscow city hall official came by , apologized and called off the siege in more conciliatory mood now , in a somewhat more conciliatory mood , mr yevtushenko and other liberal leaders of the soviet writers' union have announced plans for an alternative russian writers' organization , to be called the union of russian writers , for those who do not want to be associated with the conservatives civil war in literature , like all civil wars , is unjust on both sides , said the announcement , published wednesday in the daily newspaper izvestia and signed by mr yevtushenko and more than a score of other writers , including fazil iskander , anatoly n rybakov and robert rozhdestvensky it s the old struggle of slavophiles versus modernizers , said feliks f kuznetsov , who was thrown out of the leadership of the soviet writers' union by the liberals last spring but it is also a struggle for material advantage the dachas we live in , the hospitals where we are treated and many other things are all provided to us by the soviet writers' union literary fund , mr rybakov said the other day in his summer cottage , a tranquil , winterized log cabin in the pine woods of the writers' colony of peredelkino , at the western city limits of moscow mr rybakov author of the novel children of the arbat , which was published here in 1987 at the beginning of an outpouring of soviet literary depictions of the horrors of stalinism did not let worries about his dacha keep him from issuing a condemnation of the coup on behalf of the soviet pen center , of which he is honorary head , on the morning of aug 19 but now , what happens to the soviet writers' union litfond , the endowment that takes care of dachas and other writers' benefits , is one of the hottest political issues among writers those who do not have dachas think they should be privatized and rented to the highest bidder , or sold off the authors of the proposal for a new union of russian writers many of them , including mr yevtushenko , comfortably occupying dachas in peredelkino were careful to include a sentence saying , membership in the litfond and all benefits and services associated with it will be preserved
east rutherford , nj , jan 15 when the giants began practice today for sunday s conference championship game against the 49ers in san francisco , rodney hampton , who broke his leg last sunday , was missing coaches and players said that as good as hampton was in his rookie season , other running backs would take up the slack essentially , that means more work for ottis anderson , who will become 34 years old on saturday he is the oldest starting running back in the national football league , and , after 12 seasons and 2 , 500 regularseason and playoff carries , he is still a solid ballcarrier in last sunday s 313 rout of the chicago bears , hampton carried only twice before he was injured anderson carried 21 times , lewis tillman 9 and maurice carthon 8 in all , the giants rushed 48 times for 194 yards burden on anderson although those three will probably carry against the 49ers , the burden seems to be on anderson i do n't think it was ever off him , coach bill parcells of the giants said when anderson heard that , he smiled the burden has n't always been on me , he said , not really it s been collectively on all the running backs i think we 've all responded well so far anderson and friends will face a difficult task the 49ers have a rock of a nose tackle in michael carter and aggressive defensive ends in pierce holt and kevin fagan fortunately , parcells said , we have some depth in the backfield i have confidence in the other guys hampton has gamebreaking ability he had a nice rookie season but let s not get him to canton yet hampton has many years ahead to reach the pro football hall of fame in canton , ohio anderson has served his time , but he still wants to carry the ball i enjoy that , he said i have good memories of last year , when i had to carry a lot i always look for an opportunity to run but we have so many good backs that we can run them all dominant rushers in the last quarter against the dispirited bears , the giants ran out the clock with a 16play , 51yard touchdown drive anderson carried on three of the first four plays then tillman carried on seven of the next eight then carthon , normally the blocking back , carried on the last 4 i hope we can do that against the 49ers , carthon said we still have a lot of weapons anderson said that no matter who carried the ball for the giants , their offense had to play better than it did on dec 3 against the 49ers the giants lost that game , 73 the intensity of this game will be a lot higher than the first game , anderson said that day , we did n't execute well running and passing success , shortyardage , goalline , none of it was there everything we did , they had a counter for anderson s career as a giant had its genesis in a 1986 pregame conversation between parcells and gene stallings , the coach of the cardinals i asked him if he was going to do anything with his backs , parcells said he said it was possible then joe morris had that allergic reaction to quinine we were down to three backs maurice carthon , lee rouson and tony galbreath and carthon had a broken thumb good insurance the giants were interested in anderson the cardinals felt anderson was no longer the runner he was and traded him to the giants for a secondround and a seventhround draft choice morris missed ony one game that super bowl season so anderson played little , and carried only twice in 1987 and 65 times in 1988 when morris broke a foot in 1989 preseason , anderson became the starting tailback by default and rushed for 1 , 023 yards this season , he rushed for 784 yards against the bears sunday he rushed for 80 yards when we got him , parcells said , he thought he was insurance that s what i told him i said i would see what you can do he was worried about getting cut he came to camp the next year in good condition in training camp the last few years , he certainly has earned a roster spot he has made quite a significant contribution to the team there were some things about him in st louis i did n't like , parcells said he did n't take care of the ball well enough he adjusted here he s done everything i 've asked him to do and with a smile on his face

the fox broadcasting company turned momentum into money last year now the young and restless network has lost ground in the ratings even as it expanded its program base advertising industry executives predict that fox will take in less advertising money for its fall programs this year than it did last year but barry diller , the chairman of fox , is promising an announcement tomorrow on a change in program direction , just before the company officially introduces its fall lineup of primetime programs the announcement appears to be an attempt to counter the impression that the oncehot network has cooled down buzzword of the business the move is consistent with mr diller s and fox s talent for seizing the attention of the television industry last spring , fox was the buzzword of the business , principally for its daring decision to move its sudden and spectacular hit , the simpsons , from a safe haven on sunday night to a thursday faceoff with the most popular show of the previous half decade , the cosby show on nbc at the same time , fox had two other series with growing ratings and reputations , married with children and in living color fox was adding more viewers every week , especially the young adult viewers most sought by advertisers even executives at the other networks were acknowledging that they needed to find foxlike shows for their own schedules a year later , the attention and the noise level surrounding fox are considerably more muted in the television season that ended in april , fox s overall rating slipped from a 65 to a 64 \( each rating point represents 931 , 000 homes \) fox added no new hit series no fox series , not even its big three from a year ago , increased its ratings from the previous season furthermore , fox so overestimated the ratings its programs would receive that it was forced to offer free commercial time to advertisers for most of the second half of the season gene dewitt , the president of dewitt media , an advertisingbuying service , predicts that fox will get whacked real hard by advertisers this year he said fox , which took in about 500 million in advance commercial billings last spring , could fall as much as 200 million short of that amount during this year s upfront advertising buying season i think the upfront could pass fox right by , mr dewitt said , adding that one big advantage fox enjoyed last spring was gone at the time , abc , cbs and nbc were trying to institute a new system for guaranteeing ratings for advertisers , using complicated formulas based on discrepancies in the nielsen ratings fox became close to a mustbuy , mr dewitt said now , after a year of weak advertising sales , you have three networks saying , 'yessir , mr advertiser' and fox is no longer a mustbuy howard stringer , the president of the cbs broadcast group , who had once been outspoken in calling for more foxstyle shows , now dismisses any idea of imitating fox programming that particular enthusiasm has run its course , he said and the producers of the simpsons , disappointed that television s mosttalkedabout show did not grow in its second year as most hit shows do , lobbied hard in the last week to be shifted back to sunday night but none of this apparent bad news has diminished the enthusiasm , or the cockiness , of the fox executives they offer nothing but positive assessments about the television season that just ended , about their expansion in september from three nights of programming to four , plus an occasional monday night movie , and about the season to come 'in very good shape' we have the hard work accomplished , said peter chernin , the president of the fox entertainment group we feel we are in very good shape that optimism may lead fox to an altered plan for the network one senior industry executive , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said mr diller s announcement tomorrow might involve a shift of one entire night of programming , from friday night , when abc s childrenoriented shows dominate the younger audience that fox wants , to either tuesday or wednesday night , when more young viewers would be available sam simon , the executive producer of the simpsons , said the show s producers lobbied intensively for fox to make an equally dramatic announcement about the simpsons this spring we want them to put us back on sunday , he said , though he added , i think it s unlikely no matter what announcement mr diller makes tomorrow , it will almost certainly not include any concession that this year s ambitious expansion was not a success mr chernin said fox had made remarkable strides this year toward its longterm goal of a full sevennight primetime schedule we are now a force , he said fox overcame its chief potential impediment in march when the federal communications commission redefined what a television network is in terms that will allow fox to expand to 15 hours of primetime programs without undermining its television syndication business although the three older networks are still not allowed to sell programs under the new regulations , fox will still be able to earn profits from syndicated shows like a current affair mr chernin said fox had succeeded in growing to a viable fournight network , with the possibility that the mondaynight movie would become a regular part of the fox lineup we have strong anchors we can build on , he said he pointed to one new series , beverly hills 90210 , as a growing phenomenon , especially among teenage girls some advertising executives said fox could be aiming its programs at too young an audience fox s ratings fell significantly this year among both men and women aged 18 to 49 but fox demonstrated sharp growth among both teenagers and children the average age of the fox audience fell to 28 from 29 you can skew too young for some advertisers , said betsy frank , senior vice president of saatchi saatchi advertising she said fox would always be strong with advertisers like softdrink and sneaker makers , but may have trouble selling to packagegoods advertisers who want to reach a more adult audience mr chernin emphasized that fox succeeded so far because it had a vision for the new network and stuck to it we chose to take the ambitious , risky route , he said we do shows that are distinctly fox shows , shows that have a certain edge complaints about slobcoms' some critics have charged that the distinctive fox edge is a lowbrow mentality that often veers into outright vulgarity one recent comedy , top of the heap , has been harshly criticized for heavy doses of sexual innuendo ms frank said the term increasingly being applied to fox s kind of comedies was slobcoms but mr chernin said the criticism was unjust , pointing to the acclaimed work on the simpsons and in living color mr dewitt believes fox s problems are temporary i think they will break out over time , he said they 've done a remarkable job so far they 've gotten to a decent plateau they have to consolidate their gains while on this plateau and then they 'll be ready for another jump photo barry diller , chairman of fox broadcasting , is promising an announcement tomorrow

whenever the irish republican army does something notably ghastly like monday s bombing of two london railroad stations , which killed a civil servant and wounded 40 people a shocked world seeks a rational explanation but none may exist the most familiar theory is that such indefensible acts are designed to seek publicity for the perpetrators and their cause yet the utter irrationality of trying to reap political gain from the indiscriminate slaughter of ordinary citizens was recognized by the ira itself after its 1983 killing of christmas shoppers at harrods department store , arousing universal revulsion thenceforth , the army s killers targeted british soldiers , suspected informers or , as in the recent mortar attack on 10 downing street , british prime ministers though these crimes are ugly , the ira s high command could at least make the claim that the targets were political or military no such claim can be possibly made for the bombing of victoria and paddington stations then why do it \? officials speculate that the lawless army seeks to exploit tensions of the persian gulf war to crack british morale others believe that the attacks are related to feuding within the ira still others say the explosions were timed to undermine appeals in behalf of the birmingham six , alleged terrorists whose earlier conviction is now under legal challenge the idea being that it would suit the ira if the six remained martyrs yet all these concerns seem inadequate to explain why the ira has crossed a crucial threshold a more likely clue may be the title of a famous goya etching the sleep of reason breeds monsters violence is in the air , and desperate men seek specious pretexts to play god and thrill at news accounts of their handiwork the hard , horrible truth that often underlies wanton political violence is that its perpetrators relish deeds that give a semblance of meaning to barren and banal lives americans can only wish british police well as they seek out the demented operatives of this misnamed army
montross , va , july 28 in a pasture next to an old slaves' cemetery , more than 500 people gathered tonight to pay homage to a forgotten virginia aristocrat and an enduring ideal freedom the setting was apt the northern neck of virginia , wedged between the potomac and rappahannock rivers , is the birthplace of a number of americans identified with the concept of liberty george washington was born a few miles from here , as were james madison and james monroe but unlike robert carter 3d , the wealthy planter who was honored near here tonight , none of those familiar figures felt compelled to extend freedom to the darkskinned people who were their slaves 'ahead of his time' he was a man ahead of his time , said nancy carter crump , a distant relative of carter two hundred years ago , carter , one of the wealthiest men in virginia who owned 60 , 000 acres on 18 plantations stunned his family , friends and neighbors by filing what was called a deed of emancipation , or manumission , setting free the more than 500 negroes mulatto slaves who were his absolute property i have for some time past been convinced that to retain them in slavery is contrary to the true principles of religion justice therefore it is my duty to manumit them , carter wrote in the document that was filed on aug 1 , 1791 historians say it was perhaps the largest individual act of emancipation to occur in american history , and it took place more than 70 years before abraham lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation this was an enormous individual case of emancipation , said ira berlin , a history professor at the university of maryland and an authority on freed slaves it was a very signal event that was extraordinary in terms of its rareness and importance john barden , a historian from north carolina who has studied carter , said carter s act showed that contrary to what we have been told all the time , slaverholders were not trapped by the system an individual with a great deal of courage did break the hold of slavery , which worked both ways an unmarked grave yet carter and his actions have been been lost to all but a few historians and local admirers he is buried in an unmarked grave , and his mansion , nomini hall , burned in 1850 in 1988 , parishioners at the new jerusalem baptist church erected a small monument to mark the site of the old quarters cemetery , a burial ground for slaves on a wooded hill that tumbles down to a rushing creek even the local tourist industry makes little mention of carter , concentrating instead on promoting wakefield , washington s birthplace , and stratford hall , where robert e lee was born historians and descendants of carter say this is because he withdrew from politics after the revolutionary war to concentrate on his interests in music and religion the emphasis in american history is to concentrate on people who enter politics , and carter got out of the political cirlce early , mr barden said fittingly , the ceremoney was low key although gov l douglas wilder issued a proclamation commemorating the day , he did not attend the ceremony , nor did any other wellknown political figures the crowd , well integrated in both race and age , sat on folding , plastic lawn chairs facing three flat bed trucks that served as the stage a few of carter s descendants attended , but , none of the descendants of his slaves , at least none to anyone s knowledge julia thompson higgins , an employee of the department of housing and urban development , made the 100mile trip from washington after seeing an article about the ceremony in the washington post that listed the names of the slaves carter released among them was a james thompson , whom ms higgins believes is an ancestor i saw the name and wondered if these were the white folks that owned my folks , ms thompson said historians who have studied carter s life and writings say his action was motivated as much by religious conviction as by the ideals of liberty that were embodied in the thinking of the day some years before , carter had turned away from the anglican faith , the religion of most of the landed gentry , and become a baptist , a religion that was popular among small farmers and the slaves themselves at the time many baptists also sought the abolition of slavery oldest slaves freed first carter s emancipation proclamation did not secure freedom for all 500 of his slaves at once instead , he established a schedule by which 15 slaves , starting with the oldest , would be set free each jan 1 over a period of 21 years and keeping with virginia law , which at the time banned the freeing of underage slaves , carter declared that male slaves would be freed when they reached the age of 21 and females when they turned 18 historians say carter was perhaps the most notable embodiment of a brief period of liberalism that followed the revolutionary war in addition to the ratification of the bill of rights , philosophers of the day , including , john locke , voltaire and thomas payne promoted the idea of the rights of the individual you have to remember that we are dealing with one of the most liberal periods in american history as far as attitudes toward freedom , said mr barden , the historian yet liberalism in the late 18th century only went so far after carter s death in 1804 , his children tried to circumvent his will , possibly to overturn his order freeing his slaves and the window of liberalism did not remain open long when a slave named gabriel organized an unsuccessful slave insurrection in henrico county outside richmond , whites began calling for more restrictive manumission laws in 1806 , virginia amended its law and declared that any slave henceforth set free would have to leave the state within 12 months i know that he s laughing at all this and enjoying every minute of it , said ms crump , the distant relative how would you feel if you did something that was really out of line with the thinking of the time , was so farfetched that your children , your friends and your contemporaries thought you were off your rocker but you did it anyway and bore the whatever bitter fruit you had to then 200 years later , people think what you did was absolutely wonderful would n't that make you chuckle \? today s ceremony was equal parts a celebration of the man and the ideal of freedom and a paean to amateur historians who refuse to let their local history be overshadowed by the study of wars , revolutions and the lives of presidents and kings frank delano , the owner of a petroleum company in warsaw , va , who organized today s tribute , said that without towering colonial mansions or other monuments , something needed to be done to insure that the importance of carter s act would not be forgotten here in virgnia , we have a lot of historical societies , but many of them are centered around incredible edifices , mr delano said unless we remind people of what happened here , one day we 'll look up and somebody will have built a dog pound or a mcdonald s on nomini hall or the old quarter s cemetery photo martha anne page , 64 years old , holding her greatgranddaughter , kim , during the ceremony yesterday that commemorated the freeing of robert carter 3d s 500 slaves in montross , va , 200 years ago \( jose r lopez the new york times \) map of

boston , april 12 though almost none of the nation s newspapers identify rape victims , the wisdom of that practice is being questioned this week by newspaper editors after a nephew of senator edward m kennedy was accused of raping a woman in palm beach , fla the reported rape of the woman by william kennedy smith has raised the issue because the accuser has not been identified by any major news organization in this country , although her identity is no secret in that exclusive island community mr smith has denied the allegations it seems to me that this is a very good example of what is going to happen when we follow a principle that goes against the basic thing we stand for , which is to report what we know , said geneva overholser , editor of the des moines register , who is among those gathered here for the annual convention of the american society of newspaper editors earlier this week , the register won a pulitzer prize for articles in which a rape victim , who graphically described her ordeal , was identified at the victim s request no secret in palm beach in palm beach , the identity of the woman who accused mr smith of rape is so well known that hot dog vendors are camped outside her house serving the scores of reporters as well as curious onlookers but as some editors noted here , if her name is not reported in news reports , she could move to a new place where her past would not be well known while some news organizations have never identified rape victims , the practice became almost unanimous in the 1970 s as a result of pressure from women who argued that rape victims were less likely to come forward for fear of public humiliation many editors said their practices of not identifying rape victims were also based on a desire not to increase the pain of what was already a traumatic experience but some editors now believe that failing to identify rape victims perpetuates the idea that rape indelibly marks women as damaged goods and taints their reputations 'no right answer' it s a problem that has no right answer , said frank a daniels 3d , executive editor of the news and observer in raleigh , nc it goes to the heart of malefemale relations , the power of sex , the invasive nature of the crime of rape and how society has stigmatized it mr daniels said his paper identified rape victims before 1970 , but then stopped and would not identify mr smith s accuser unless her name became common knowledge by being printed elsewhere his reluctance to be first to print the name , and his ambivalence about the overall practice , was shared by many other editors here allan m siegal , an assistant managing editor of the new york times , said ordinarily the times does n't name victims of sex crimes unless there is an extraordinary public interest in identifying them or we have strong reason to doubt their account we consider these things case by case some see time for change some editors said the palm beach case was a suitable moment to break the taboo i believe we ought to name rape victims and treat them the same as victims of other crimes , said irene nolan , managing editor of the courierjournal in louisville , ky nonetheless , she said , her paper has a policy against identifying rape victims and to start doing so would prompt a bloodbath from the community there has to be a middle stage of beginning to name rape victims on a casebycase basis , ms nolan said , and i think palm beach is the perfect case to begin with tom o'hara , managing editor of the palm beach post , disagreed he said his paper s policy was to publish the name only with the consent of the accuser or if it became widely known through other news organizations in the case of mr smith , he said , the post has not been able to reach her name printed in britain the woman s name and photograph have already appeared in the sunday mirror , a british newspaper the newspaper is owned by robert maxwell , who recently bought the daily news in new york the daily news has not identified the accuser in the palm beach incident mr o'hara said that the sunday mirror s action was irrelevant , and that the paper s top executives had decided they would not follow suit if a supermarket tabloid printed the name but he said that if the woman was identified by a local television station he might do so at a convention program on freedom of speech , alan m dershowitz , a professor at harvard law school , scolded the editors for identifying mr smith while withholding the name of his accuser mr dershowitz said such selfcensorship would prove damaging to news organizations because it would encourage efforts to muzzle the press in other situations legislators seek action indeed , ms overholser said that shortly before her newspaper was awarded the pulitzer prize for its series by janet schorer urging openness in rape coverage the iowa house of representatives passed a bill that , if enacted , would forbid putting on police blotters the names of those who accuse rape the main argument they were using was that the media are n't using rape victims names anyway , ms overholser said though almost all newspapers have policies against identifying rape victims , they vary in how far they take such a prohibition for instance , mr daniels of the news and observer said his paper identifies rape victims who testify in court but the rape victim known as the central park jogger testified and was not identified by any of new york s daily papers or television stations
louisville , ky the key , said trainer nick zito , was running in the blue grass that s the key coming here he paused , savoring the geography , and said with feeling , you 're in kentucky nick zito was born and bred in new york but his horse , strike the gold , was born and bred in kentucky more to his point , his horse was raced in kentucky three weeks ago strike the gold won the blue grass stakes at keeneland in lexington , overthrowing even the crown prince of the 3yearold colts , fly so free then he completed the coup saturday at churchill downs when he won the kentucky derby with fly so free running fifth great horses have won the blue grass , the trainer said bull lea , arts and letters , alydar this year , strike the gold it s a matter of spacing they run the blue grass three weeks before the derby they run the wood memorial in new york two weeks before the derby it s tough to get your horse ready for the kentucky derby in two weeks it s the spacing plus the fact that you 're in kentucky it s not that zito lacks feeling for his hometown he studied at john adams high school not far from aqueduct race track in queens he began his career walking horses at the track he now lives on long island not far from belmont park he soon will take his horses north , and will house and race them there this summer my father used to take me to aqueduct when i was little , he recalled the pinkertons at the gate used to watch me you know , 10yearold kid i got my start there hotwalking horses i was probably 16 i got 4250 a week but when zito wanted to provide strike the gold with the precise steppingstone to the derby last month , he ran the colt in the blue grass meanwhile , back in zito s old neighborhood , belmont park opens tomorrow but it will be exactly one more month before it becomes the stage for new york s share of the triple crown , the belmont stakes except for that , new york does n't even have much of a rooting interest in the triple crown since the breeders' cup afternoon of champions at belmont last october , almost none of the horses training for the kentucky derby , the preakness and the belmont stakes did their training in the big apple and only 3 of the 16 horses who ran in the derby here on saturday got there by way of the wood memorial at aqueduct , which is new york s major audition for the derby to be fair about it , two other prime candidates did run in the wood the filly meadow star , undefeated in nine races until then , and cahill road , the full brother to last year s derby winner , unbridled but for them , the wood was waterloo the filly ran fourth and was withdrawn from competition against colts cahill road ran first , but strained the main ligament in his left foreleg at the start of the race and was withdrawn from everything for an indefinite time the three who went on to kentucky ran 123 , in a manner of speaking happy jazz band , third in the wood , ran 11th in the derby lost mountain , second in the wood , finished 12th in the derby , and another review , seventh in new york , ran 13th in kentucky by contrast , the best regional run in the derby was scored by three california horses who finished behind strike the gold in sequence best pal , mane minister and green alligator they have run a total of 28 races in their careers , but only one in new york , and that was when best pal ran sixth in the breeders' cup juvenile last october so , if geography won the derby for strike the gold , what lost it for the others \? distance , maybe , suggested murray johnson , the australian trainer of green alligator the mile and a quarter was a long way to go i guess , said randy schulhofer , who helps his father train fly so free , our horse did n't like the distance that was a question for everybody his father , scotty schulhofer , was even more direct that s the big question , the mile and a quarter i truthfully thought in the blue grass that the mile and a quarter might not be strike the gold s cup of tea , either if i drew a diagram of the race the way i 'd have wanted it run , scotty schulhofer said , it would have looked like the finish we got , except my horse would have won i think we lost the race on the first turn , said ian jory , the young british trainer of best pal the draw for post position was unfortunate , no 15 but i do n't want to cry about anything still , he s got a lot of early speed and he could have gone on ahead of them there were eight or nine of them across the track on the turn if the horses had got off the rail earlier , maybe we would have turned the tables but then , if they got off later , maybe we would have run eighth so , on to pimlico for act 2 the preakness , one week from saturday that track offers tighter turns and a slightly shorter course \( a mile and threesixteenths \) , and the race will include a bunch of fresh horses who sat out the derby at least , they ca n't blame new york for that photo nick zito , left , trainer of strike the gold , with b giles brophy , one of the owners , on winner s stand at churchill downs after the kentucky derby \( barton silverman the new york times \)
city college officials said yesterday that student groups in recent years had been allowed virtually a free hand in running their own activities , even events as potentially perilous as the celebrity basketball game where eight young people were crushed to death saturday night as a result , these officials said , private promoters and community organizations have learned that it is to their benefit to associate with student groups , who can rent them space on campus for a fraction of the cost for private facilities bernard sohmer , a mathematics professor and a former chairman of city college s faculty senate , which sets academic policy for much of the college , said the problem of lax supervision of student activities has been festering at many of the university s campuses for more than a decade these are very important and scary issues , running a thing like that , mr sohmer said of the basketball game , which drew more than 5 , 000 people to an auditorium that can legally hold 2 , 730 university administrators , he said , are making it absolutely legal for kids to be asbolutely in charge , not even a little bit in charge a college spokesman , charles decicco , acknowledged yesterday that clearly students have generally gotten a tremendous amount of autonomy as we 've moved away from in loco parentis , the historic policy of having the college take on the supervisory role of parents a question of arrangements the basketball game , which featured celebrity rap stars as players , was officially arranged by the evening student government , but city college administrators said it was actually put together by a rap promoter , tara geter , who works with the rap star sean combs , known by his stage name of puff daddy neither could be reached for comment college officials said that booking the gymnasium for the basketball game cost roughly 1 , 200 , substantially less than a comparable private space while college officials are supposed to check the credentials of any outside sponsoring organizations , budget cuts have left only two administrators , jean charles , the director of the finley student center , and an aide , james small , to monitor the activities of more than 100 student organizations yesterday , officials in the office of the city college president , dr bernard w harleston , had not been able to confirm the existence of the organization aids education outreach program that was supposed to receive the tens of thousands of dollars in profits from what was billed as a charitable benefit they also were investigating how closely officials in charge of student activities monitored efforts by the evening student government to arrange security , sell tickets , and obtain radio advertising for the game previous student problems there have been previous disclosures of lax supervision of student organizations in the city university , whose 19 campuses include city college last spring , the president of the city university student senate was found to have spent 49 , 000 on a lobbying convention in albany , 13 , 000 on car service and 51 , 000 on salaries for his sister and best friend in july , a

when it was found that guards for the rev louis farrakhan were permitted to frisk students attending a speech he gave at the borough of manhattan community college the policy now states that only security guards hired by the university can frisk students or scan them with metal detectors the evening student government office was closed yesterday and none of the association s leaders could be reached for comment david vargas , vice president for educational affairs of the day student government , disputed the contention by college officials that promoters of professional events often approached the student government with activity ideas mostly the student organization decides on events to raise funds , mr vargas said i am not saying it does n't happen but if that happens it would have to be one or two opportunities mr decicco said the college had rigorous rules for outside organizations that ask to use large campus auditoriums , gymnasiums and lecture halls he said the groups must submit a letter two months in advance on their letterheads describing the events they want to hold and the numbers of people expected to attend and provide a copy of the organization s bylaws but college officials said this process was often not followed one high official , who would speak only on the condition of anonymity , said that scrupulously detailed inquiries were not the rule for events run by student groups we treat them as if they were sponsoring organizations and we do n't remember that many of them are teenagers , he said david fields , special counsel to the university s chancellor , w ann reynolds , said that the university s policy did not allow colleges to turn over its responsibility for public events to students no college can ever abrogate its responsibility for its physical plant , he said photos two days after eight people lost their lives during a stampede at a celebrity basketball game at city college , the stark evidence prevails that the deaths and the many injuries that accompanied them could clearly have been avoided a security guard stands at the stairway entrance to the nat holman gymnasium where the stampede occurred christina brown , mother of

florham park , nj , july 16 for the first time since a sexualharassment incident last year brought him more notoriety than his football exploits ever did , zeke mowatt put on a giants uniform today with his familiar number , 84 he took part in the team s morning workout at training camp here at fairleigh dickinson university then , at a news conference that was unusual for someone who had always shunned the media , he talked of his year away from the giants , a year he would rather forget mowatt joined the giants in 1983 as a free agent , a 6foot4inch , 240pound tight end from florida state who could block he was the starter until mark bavaro , even more talented , joined the giants in 1985 from then until 1989 , mowatt was the giants' second tight end in 1990 , when the giants failed to protect him from plan b free agency , he signed a twoyear contract with the new england patriots for 650 , 000 for the first year finger injury but his first year with the patriots was his last in a preseason practice , he ruptured a tendon in the little finger of his left hand , and the reconstructive surgery kept him out of the first six games of the season when he was activated , he played little he caught six passes all season but his performance was overshadowed by a lockerroom incident in september , after which mowatt and his teammates michael timpson and robert perryman were accused by lisa olson , then a sports reporter for the boston herald , of sexual harassment after an investigation , paul tagliabue , the national football league commissioner , fined the three players and the team mowatt was fined 12 , 500 by the league and 2 , 000 by the patriots , while the other players were fined 5 , 000 each by the league last week , the patriots waived mowatt the player said he was not bitter i could n't control the situation , he said i did n't bother asking my agent why they cut me were the patriots unfair \? i did n't sit there and see who was treated fairly and who was n't , mowatt said mowatt went home and waited for offers from other teams none came until he heard from the giants by coincidence , because of bavaro s disintegrating knee , the giants were about to waive the tight end who six years before had taken mowatt s job the loss of bavaro left the giants with two veteran tight ends , howard cross and bob mrosko two with minimal pro experience , richard ashe and mark hopkins , and a rookie drafted in the 11th round , ted popson the giants needed help and signed mowatt we know things about zeke as a player , explained ray handley , the team s new head coach if he can regain the high point of his career , he will be a valuable addition to the team i told him that he had an opportunity to come in and play there are times when i like to use two tight ends if i have them , i will use them if not , i will put in another back mowatt said he was grateful for the opportunity i 've got to relearn the system and get used to blocking and catching the ball , he said i did n't do that last year i was injured and sat on the bench of another team he has always been a private person i never was one who would talk to a lot of people or do interviews , he said my goal was to play football , not do interviews he was not comfortable during this news conference because there were so many questions on the olson incident he answered politely but firmly he did not want to discuss the subject because olson , now a reporter for a newspaper in australia , has filed a civil suit against him he is also appealing the league and team fines it was an incident that happened , he said it was something i have to learn from and move on i'm happy for the opportunity to play again i was sitting at home with no opportunity by signing the 30yearold mowatt , the giants have left themselves open to criticism handley said he was aware of that i'm not oblivious to what goes on in the world , the coach said it was a very regrettable incident it affected the lives of a lot of people i hope he can become a productive person on and off the field i think it s something zeke would like to put in the past photo zeke mowatt , who started for the giants in 1983 and '84 before mark bavaro arrived , may start again at tight end now that bavaro has been let go \( ray stubblebine for the new york times \) \( pg b7 \) who was this masked man \? lawrence taylor taking part in his first workout yesterday at the giants' training camp \( ray stubblebine for the new york times \) \( pg b9 \)
getting what one pays for in addition to deciding whether democrats or republicans will control the new jersey senate and assembly for the next two years , voters on tuesday will also decide two ballot questions recognizing the rights of crime victims and asking congress to enact a national health care program if approved , neither question will cost a penny and that was important to getting them on the ballot the senate rejected bills passed in the assembly that would have asked voters to approve spending 325 million for clean water and 135 million for affordable housing the senate president , john a lynch , democrat of new brunswick , said this was a time for fiscal prudence when he announced that he would not allow senators to vote on the clean water and housing bond questions the first ballot question the voters will see would amend article 1 of the new jersey constitution to entitle a victim of crime to be treated with fairness , dignity and respect by the criminal justice system the voters will also be asked whether state representatives should urge congress and president bush to enact a national health care policy to control rising costs the question does not have the power of law run , mario , but not here there are a lot of democrats urging gov mario m cuomo to jump into a certain national campaign but here in new york , many democratic candidates in this tuesday s elections are asking him to stay away from their campaigns the governor has made virtually no campaign appearances on behalf of any of the democratic incumbents locked in reelection races for county executive in suffolk , monroe and erie counties nor has he campaigned for the democratic candidate for the open executive seat in albany county , robert lyman , who recently ducked a question during a debate on wtentv in albany about whether he thought mr cuomo was doing a good job as governor the state democratic party chairman , john a marino , agreed that many democratic candidates had not been soliciting the governor s help but said he found nothing surprising in that i think it relates to the fact this is a bad year for incumbents , he said to associate an incumbent county executive with an incumbent governor may not be in their game plan , and we understand that none of these democratic candidates has publicly criticized mr cuomo , although mr lyman s refusal to put in a good word about his fellow democrat raised a few eyebrows in albany the governor , meanwhile , laughed off a recent question at a news conference about mr lyman s lessthanlukewarm comments about him , saying he would not criticize a fellow politician for having the discretion to keep his distance from a guy who s low in the polls offer students ca n't refuse paul j feiner , an adjunct professor at mercy college in dobbs ferry , in westchester county , is confidently predicting that students in his government class may have the highest voter turnout of any class of college students in the country how would he know \?

houston , aug 8 to quell a tide of violence directed against homosexuals , houston police officers have taken to the streets of a downtown neighborhood dressed as potential victims , with results that have startled even gay leaders who for years have called for increased protection since the decoy program , thought to be the first of its kind in the country , was begun last friday in the montrose neighborhood , an area long troubled by gay bashing incidents , 3 undercover officers have been attacked , and 13 people have been arrested two officers posing as a gay couple were sprayed with chemical mace on friday night hours after the program began , and another undercover officer was beaten with a baseball bat early monday the police said both attacks were by groups of young men from outside the neighborhood who thought their victims were homosexuals none of the officers was seriously injured , and the eight people accused in the attacks were arrested and charged with crimes ranging from carrying a prohibited weapon to aggravated assault response to a slaying the decoy program , which homosexuals here helped the police develop , arose in response to the july 4 beating and stabbing death of 27yearold banker , paul broussard as mr broussard and two companions left a gay bar , they were chased down by 10 young men wielding boards and knives one companion escaped , and the other was wounded , although not critically ten men , most of whom are residents of an affluent suburb , have been arrested , indicted by a grand jury and charged with murder in mr broussard s slaying the houston police department fell under heavy criticism from gay and other human rights groups after the incident , especially because homicide detectives initially said there was no evidence the attack was a hate crime , a statement they later retracted since mr broussard s killing , the houston police department has changed its official definition of hate crimes to include those motivated by the victim s sexual preference , along with those motivated by race , religion or ethnicity in an incident on monday night , the police arrested five juveniles who undercover officers said were harassing pedestrians they were charged with possession of alcohol the montrose is a residential area whose preworld war i mansions and bungalows house art galleries and chic restaurants and shops , as well as many of houston s gay bars in the last decade , carloads of teenagers have cruised the streets on weekends , shouting epithets at passersby and sometimes throwing rocks and bottles or attacking them in response to the broussard slaying , more than 1 , 000 neighborhood residents , organized by the group queer nation , rallied in montrose on july 13 , blocking traffic for several hours and chanting at the police on july 27 , about 150 protesters marched at the woodlands , the suburban community where most of the suspects in the killing live ray hill , a leader in gayrights activities in houston for almost two decades , said homosexuals were outraged that the houston police department s definition of a hate crime did not include crimes against homosexuals they have never included us , though these crimes have gone on for years they were out of step with the times , and now they are playing catch up , fast , mr hill said of the fledgling program we are extremely pleased with their response , finally , mr hill added harper wilson , the federal bureau of investigation s chief of uniform crime reporting , said the hate crimes statistics act of 1990 required the 16 , 000 police departments who file reports to his agency to classify attacks on homosexuals as hate crimes he predicts that police awareness of the proliferation of hate crimes against homosexuals will vastly increase with the new reporting requirements this kind of operation , targeting these attackers , may be unusual now , but it will not be unusual for long , mr wilson said the success of the houston police department s undercover effort , thought to be the first longterm operation in the country aimed specifically at apprehending those who attack homosexuals , has drawn support from gay people and surprise from police officials who designed it experiencing the hate even though these attacks are a common part of gay life in houston , i'm just astonished at what happened the first time the officers went out , said david fowler , a founding member of the houston chapter of queer nation , an organization that began in new york in 1990 and has spread to more than a dozen cities around the country i give the houston police a lot of credit for their efforts robert bray , a spokesman for the national gay and lesbian task force , a washington lobbying group that tracks violence against gay people , said he hoped the program s early results would serve as a wakeup call to other lawenforcement agencies capt john adamson of the houston police said , these incidents tell us there is definitely a problem , and it is a persistent one that we are going to have to deal with until it s done with mr bray said 1989 figures compiled by the task force showed texas ranked second , behind north carolina , in reported attacks on gay men and lesbians in 1989 , there were 6 homicides , 38 assaults and 795 cases of verbal abuse reported in texas mr bray also said violence and harassment against gays rose by 42 percent from 1989 to 1990 in six major cities surveyed though police spokesmen in new york , los angeles , san francisco , chicago , and minneapolis said their departments routinely use undercover officers to fight street crime , none has specifically zeroed in on attacks on gays
elizabeth , nj , jan 6 the executive council of the episcopal church has decided to hold the church s convention in phoenix this summer despite requests that it be moved because arizona voters rejected a paid state holiday honoring the rev dr martin luther king jr about a dozen episcopal dioceses around the country had asked that the convention , scheduled for july 1020 , be canceled or held elsewhere but in a meeting here on saturday , the council , the church s 40member governing body , agreed with the presiding bishop , the most rev edmond l browning , that episcopalians should go to arizona to make a witness to the blatant sin of racism bishop browning also proposed that the convention be shortened to 8 days , from 11 , but the council voted unanimously to keep the original schedule and to set up a committee to consider reorganizing the program to focus on racial issues it also endorsed but did not formally approve a 1 million fundraising effort to establish a martin luther king jr scholarship for minority students in arizona bishop urges no change in opening remarks to the council , bishop browning proposed that it modify plans drawn up three years ago but keep the convention in phoenix there s no doubt in my mind , none whatsoever , that this church is being asked to make a witness to the blatant sin of racism , he said my gut , my heart , my reason , my prayer , my whole being says go to phoenix several members of the council objected to holding the convention in arizona bettye jo harris , a lay council member from kaneohe , hawaii , said the church should not try to confront racial prejudice in arizona until it did so within itself meeting in tents is urged the 25 millionmember episcopal church is governed by the general convention , which meets every three years between conventions , the church is governed by the executive council altering the convention plans would have required approval by the executive council , but the decision on moving the convention rested with bishop browning , a church spokesman said the diocese of washington adopted a resolution last month urging that the convention be moved to atlanta , where the local diocese offered to be the host
albany , may 29 the heavy strains of a soaring prison population and major budget cutbacks collided when inmates took hostages at what was intended to be the most secure of new york state s 67 prisons , many guards , lawmakers and prison experts said today with the peaceful end of the uprising at the southport correctional facility this afternoon , the cuomo administration turned its attention to a round of troubling questions even the governor was asking some of them he said today that a union leader for the state s prison guards might have made a reasonable assertion when he charged that a shortage of guards had helped create the conditions that led to the takeover mr cuomo said he had ordered an investigation into issues surrounding the uprising among the questions that have arisen are these was the opening four months ago of new york s own version of alcatraz , which prison officials boasted was a way to save the state 3 million , conceived too hastily \? 1 , 000 layoffs why were guards being laid off at southport even as the most violenceprone inmates in the state were brought into the prison \? and why did prison officials ignore what turned out to be guards' and prisonrights groups' accurate predictions of violence \? perhaps most troubling of all is the question of whether the uprising reflected larger problems in the state s prisons , whose population continues to explode even as the state has made deep cuts in its prison spending while the state s department of correction is facing at least a 150 million cut in its 13 billion budget this year , the number of inmates in the prisons recently hit 55 , 711 , an alltime high and a number that is 1174 percent of the officially listed capacity about 1 , 000 of the state s 18 , 000 prison guards have been laid off or retired in the last several months , a number that could grow depending on the resolution of the battle over a new state budget bunks beds arrive bunk beds have been installed at some mediumsecurity prisons , doubling the number of inmates in some dormitories , a condition that many experts say increases the possibility of violence mr cuomo has said the practice will spread because of the collapse of talks with the legislature over changes in state sentencing laws the changes would have allowed judges to refrain from imprisoning some nonviolent repeat felony offenders , principally drug users the prison population keeps growing , but the cuomo administration , again citing fiscal troubles , has canceled plans to build five new prisons this is crisis management , and many of our guards have reason to fear for their lives because of it , said joseph p puma , the executive director of security and law enforcement employees council 82 , the union that represents state correction officers there are problems throughout the system right now , and it s only may , he added historically , during the summer months we have even more problems mr puma was just one of several union leaders who complained about conditions at southport in the months before the uprising in testimony last month before the state assembly s corrections committee , barry fletcher , the president of the guards' local at southport , described the plan for a maxi maxi prison that would concentrate the state s most unmanageable prisoners as a dream turned into a nightmare separate prisons he said there were simply not enough guards to keep order , and he described many incidents in which prisoners had doused guards with feces and urine he said guards had received little direction in how their jobs would change as the prison was transformed to handle more troublesome inmates in a subsequent visit to the prison , the chairman of the assembly committee , daniel l feldman , a brooklyn democrat , raised other problems for one , he noted that budget cuts had apparently prevented prison officials from replacing cheap metal lockers in many cells these were torn off by some inmates and used as weapons in the uprising this week new york is one of several states that have separate prisons for inmates who pose particular disciplinary problems the concept for southport , a maxi maxi or end of the line prison , stems from one of the country s most notorious penitentiaries alcatraz starting in 1934 , thousands of federal inmates labeled as violent or disruptive were held in solitary confinement in alcatraz , on an island in san francisco bay alcatraz closed in 1963 , a time when psychological and educational programs , rather than harsh treatment , were adopted by many prison officials as a more effective rehabilitation approach but soaring crime rates and a more violent prison population led federal authorities in 1983 to revive the alcatraz theory at the federal penitentiary in marion , ill prisoners who commit violent crimes in federal prisons or who are considered unmanageable are kept at marion for indeterminate terms in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day more than 300 marion prisoners are limited to one hour of exercise a day in confined areas they are barred from talking or seeing other inmates , and meals are taken to each inmate s cell by guards , armed with batons federal prison authorities say segregating the most incorrigible inmates has reduced violence in other federal penitentiaries with marion as a model , california , maryland and oklahoma also have built maximaxi prisons to punish inmates considered unmanageable spokesmen for the prison systems in those three states say their experiments are successful none of them have experienced a disorder on the scale of the one at southport 23 hours a day in cell new york city s jail system also uses a modified version of the marion technique more than 300 inmates who have committed violent crimes while in jail awaiting trials are kept in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day in the james thomas correctional center on rikers island they can be held in the central punitive segregation unit for up to 90 days in southport , inmates can be locked in cells for up to 23 hours a day and their contacts with other people , with the exception of other prisoners , are sharply limited if they 're not violence prone or crazy before you send them into that kind of situation , there s a good chance they will be when they get out , said robert gangi , executive director of the new york state correctional association , a nonprofit group that monitors prison issues like two other major inmate uprisings in gov mario m cuomo s eightyear tenure ossining in 1983 and coxsackie in 1988 this one ended without violence but as also happened with those incidents , this one has revived questions about where the state draws the line between managing its budget and managing its prisoners graph behind bars shows number of inmates in new york state prisons in january of each year , from '83'91 , in thousands \( source new york state division of

to the editor i think it s significant that mitchell duneier s black migrants have done better \( oped , june 11 \) , criticizing my book the promised land , never actually quotes from the book that s because mr duneier s real objection is to an article i wrote five years ago , and his search for offending material in the book leads him into the shadowy realm of impressions and implications i am well aware that studies comparing black migrants from south to north with blacks born in the north show that migrants' incomes are higher i mention several of these studies in the book and in the footnotes , as mr duneier acknowledges he triumphantly announces that there is a study i did n't cite but there are dozens of studies i did n't cite that make the same basic point as the ones i did cite i'm also well aware of william julius wilson s objections to my 1986 articles i had them in mind as i researched and wrote , and i asked dr wilson to read the book in manuscript \( which he generously did , raising no objections to what i say about migration \) the promised land argues that the great black migration was an enormously important shaping event in american society i made a point of including in it the stories of middleclass migrants and of discussing at length the growth of the black middle class i did n't want to leave the impression that the migration was made up only of the rural poor or that most of the migrants did n't succeed in the north still , i chose to make ruby haynes , a former mississippi sharecropper who lived in chicago for three decades , the book s main character she was born to a teenage mother in 1915 , did n't meet her father until she was grown up , had children out of wedlock herself and had a poor education in all this , she was typical of the sharecropper society she grew up in , as a wealth of firsthand scholarly material on that society will attest in telling the story of her life in a highrise , lowincome housing project in chicago , i spent many pages describing how the city s politics , the economy , federal social policies and urban demography affected her i never said or suggested that her background was the sole determinant of her fate quite the contrary i know that impulses exist to dismiss the black migration as a failure , to impute all the problems of the ghettos to migrants and to be blind to the black middle class but none of those impulses animated my book since the book was published , mrs haynes has been treated as a heroine in her hometown of clarksdale , miss i was trying to break stereotypes with my writing , not reinforce them published response to the book contains none of the negative or hostile reaction to the africanamerican experience mr duneier worried it might set off nicholas lemann pelham , ny , june 11 , 1991
washington , aug 7 after 15 months of tests and analysis , navy and independent scientists will present their findings in the next few weeks that suggest the explosion that killed 47 sailors on the battleship iowa in april 1989 may have been an accident , not sabotage as the navy believed among the new discoveries suggesting that conclusion is the existence in navy stockpiles of a small number of gunpowder bags that are prone to ignition under extreme pressure the bags are used as propellent in a battleship s 16inch guns , and the navy had previously said none prone to accidental ignition existed in its inventory investigators say the new findings , gathered while they tested theories first raised by independent scientists in june 1990 , pose the most serious challenge to the navy s earlier conclusion that the blast was probably an act of suicidal sabotage by a despondent young sailor lawsuits filed by the families of the dead sailors could also influence the outcome it is not clear what action the navy might take , although some senior navy officers say they expect the service to reverse itself it may be a month or so before there is a final decision , said rear adm brent baker , the chief navy spokesman turbulent chapter for navy the explosion erupted from a 16inch gun during training exercises about 300 miles north of puerto rico the blast and its investigation are one of the most turbulent chapters in navy history involved are conflicting interpretations of scientific data , veiled accusations of a homosexual lovers' affair and the navy s reluctance to concede that a vexing problem may have no clearcut answer the new technical evidence may only compound the mystery the data offer no definitive cause of the explosion , and some of the findings are hotly contested but many investigators insist that the navy can no longer rule out the possibility of an accident we 've demonstrated a realistic probability that this could have been an accident , said one scientist , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , as did a dozen other investigators and top navy officers interviewed experts in congress criticized the navy when it issued its original conclusions in september 1989 , but the service never seriously doubted the inquiry s technical findings , not even when navy secretary h lawrence garrett 3d reopened the investigation in june 1990 and suspended firings of all 16inch guns after gunpowder bags similar to those used aboard the iowa ignited in laboratory tests 'more rigor' next time many top navy officials now concede that the criminal side of the investigation , which identified clayton m hartwig , a gunner s mate second class who was killed in the explosion , as the likely culprit , was flawed in its overreliance on circumstantial evidence navy investigative procedures were tightened after the case i hope next time there 'd be more rigor and discipline in an investigation like this , said a senior navy officer , and that we do n't get pushed into drawing conclusions before we 're ready to draw them the latest inquiry did not reexamine the criminal investigation as independent experts and senior navy officials prepare two new , and somewhat conflicting , technical reports for mr garrett and the navy s senior uniformed officer , adm frank b kelso 2d , the chief of naval operations , the service faces an agonizing dilemma does it seize on the sliver of technical doubt raised by the latest inquiry to admit the possibility of an accident \? or does it affirm a verdict that many in the navy feel would leave a permanent cloud over the incident and a blot on the service s reputation \? complicating the decision are several lawsuits filed against the navy , including a 40 million claim by mr hartwig s family for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress reversing its position could leave the navy vulnerable to millions of dollars in court damages right now , the whole thing is a major pr problem , said a navy officer but i think there will be some backing off the original conclusion the iowa , a world war iiera vessel , was retired last october the navy lifted the ban on firing 16inch guns last september , allowing two other battleships , the wisconsin and the missouri , to play important roles in the persian gulf war the two battleships fired a total of 1 , 083 16inch rounds without a problem , according to the navy checking gunpower pellets the immediate technical issue is the findings of two investigative teams one working for the naval sea systems command in washington , and the other involving scientists at the sandia national laboratories , a federally financed research center in albuquerque , nm sandia is acting on behalf of the general accounting office , the investigative arm of congress scientists have centered their technical inquiry on three issues in an attempt to solve the mystery of what happened in the iowa s no 2 turret at 9 55 am on april 19 , 1989 in a 16inch naval gun , a hydraulic ram pushes the projectile and the powder bags into the open rear end of the weapon and then is withdrawn before the breech is closed and the gun fired

when a reporter chided him about standing in front of the 3point line , magic stepped back behind the arc and counted aloud as he nailed five of six from deep range it s just like the old days , said johnson , with a smile the smile , of course , was omnipresent johnson joked with reporters about their getting a rare chance to watch riley conduct a workout , because riley keeps knicks practices closed to them when riley told johnson to attempt a 30foot shot from the first row of the lavender , or courtside , seats at the garden , the player complied and missed three straight then he zinged his buddy , riley now you know why he has closed practices , johnson joked this is why you practice shots like this johnson and riley hugged after the workout and johnson meandered past a crush of television cameras to take a shower after changing from lakers' gold to a black pinstriped suit and black turtleneck , johnson displayed his charm with the news media for an additional 25 minutes though the public relations spin doctors were obviously working overtime to prove johnson was feeling fine and to keep his telephone from ringing off the hook , johnson would not concede it he said he was in new york on business and planned to practice with coach riley to work on his jump shot and that someone leaked it to the news media instead of not letting you come , we thought we would just hang out for a little while and let you all in so i can talk to you and you can talk to me , johnson explained delivering his message and talk he did johnson joked about being the latest cover boy on the supermarket tabloids , said he still planned to play for the united states in the 1992 olympics and said he wanted to deliver his message of safe sex to as many youths as possible he explained that he did not miss the recent aids engagements in new york and washington for any mysterious reason he could n't attend on those dates , he said , and organizers in both cities knew that johnson said he felt wonderful and stressed that he had to be healthy to keep the sort of hectic schedule he maintains , which included the raiders football game sunday and the lakers game that night johnson also admitted that martina navratilova was probably correct by saying she would not have been embraced so warmly by the public if she had contracted hiv the affable johnson was at his funniest when he discussed the newspapers that have made his life more public than ever he denied that his wife was sleeping in the maid s quarters and denied he had had an affair with a pornographic film star johnson was composed as he discussed having millions of americans reading what he said were lies about him while they purchase butter and milk that s just garbage , johnson said my wife and i sit up at night and laugh you know , she s sleeping in the basement you know , the porno queen it s funny there is no sense getting upset johnson said none of the rumors were true , including the one that he is having side effects from taking azt both his wife , cookie , and unborn baby are doing fine , he said though johnson discounted the rumors , he was not surprised to see his face on the cover of the supermarket tabloids michael cooper , one of his former teammates , used to purchase the sensationalistic newspapers and magic would read through them in amazement i 'd start looking at them , johnson said , and then i would get caught thinking , really \? that ape gave birth to a tiger did this guy s wife really sleep with 20 men and he did n't know about it \? and then , boom , here i am i think for the last five weeks i 've been on the front page when johnson was asked if he still considered himself a role model , he shied away from the tag and called himself an educator johnson received criticism for advocating safe sex when some groups insisted abstinence is the safest sex of all he said he was just trying to be realistic about sex and the 1990 s a role in the olympics people are going to have sex whether we want them to or not , johnson said i want to get them up to date on the safest way is to use a condom because the united states will have a powerful team laden with nba stars for the olympics , johnson does not expect to play much and probably will not have to if johnson plays , he will probably make a token appearance as a starter , run the show for a spell and then watch from the bench while his teammates pound some poor country that does not mean johnson would object to being a huge part of a few routs he said he misses the big games and the big names more than anything i miss larry bird i miss michael jordan , johnson said i miss the big games i miss the big glitz it s like , 'yeah , i want to do something big now because i'm in new york' that s what i miss photo magic johnson during impromptu workout at the garden as the scoreboard was prepared for last night s knick game \( barton silverman the new york times \)
miami , fla , feb 28 hardened veterans of the pga tour customarily cast a cold eye on phenoms , but phil mickelson is being almost universally accepted as someone who belongs the relationship between the 20yearold amateur , who stunned the golf world with his dramatic victory at the northern telecom open in january , and the playforpay elite is already one of of mutual respect no one questions that the lefthander can play , but the deference and quiet confidence with which he has dealt with his success is what has most impressed veterans it s unbelievable how he has handled all the pressure and expectations , scott simpson , a fellow san diegan who who has known mickelson since he was 12 years old , said today everyone is giving him the next nicklaus tag , which is passed out about every two years and never seems to do anyone any good but he s got a very humble attitude , which is unusual for someone who has played that well that early he realizes that he has a lot of improving to do disappointing finish mickelson s reaction to his twounderpar 70 in today s first round of the doral ryder open is a case in point it looked like he might shoot very low after an eagle three on his 10th hole of the day put him three under par but a bogey 6 on his 17th hole , where his 3wood second shot barely failed to clear a water hazard in front of the green , made for a disappointing finish i could have scored lower , but you can always say that , said mickelson , who is four shots behind the leaders , rocco mediate , keith clearwater chip beck and jim hallet i gambled and lost , but if that 3wood travels another three feet , i'm maybe looking at another eagle rather than answering questions about himself , mickelson seems more intent on making it clear that his respect for the professionals has not changed because of his victory at tucson when you see the way these guys strike the ball and putt , you just ca n't imagine them shooting a high number , said mickelson , who was the high man in a threesome that included mark o'meara , who was at 67 , and mark calcavecchia , who shot 68 they all have this explosiveness where at any given moment they can make eight birdies in a row they can shoot 66 in a heartbeat , and when they catch a hot streak , they can push it that s what the most difficult thing for me out here is you never really know what you have to do , because they can always surprise you with another level , he said consistent player since winning tucson , mickelson s own level has been consistent the defending united states amateur and national collegiate athletic association champion failed to break par only once in eight rounds while finishing tied for 32d at phoenix and tied for 42d at san diego in addition to his college and amateur schedule , mickelson plans to play in the masters , the memorial , the united states open and the british open , and to many in the game , he is a legitimate threat to win any of them there s been a lot of people who have come along with a game as good as his , said simpson , who thinks mickelson will probably have to shorten his long , flowing swing for the rigors of the tour but his attitude is his strength he has an edge in his competitiveness and his ability to handle things when they go well and when they go bad that usually takes most of us a long time to develop , but he has it right now mickelson also has experienced what it feels like to triumph at the highest level of the game , which jack nicklaus thinks could make his immediate future very bright he s going to come out on the tour with the attitude of winning , nicklaus said that s unusual even for some veteran players , and that s why i think he has such a bright future future uncertain when mickelson will finally make the decision to join the pga tour is still undecided because of his victory at tucson , he is an exempt player through the 1993 season mickelson would like to build on his amateur record and finish his college education , and he is also well aware that playing for love and for a living are often very different things not surprisingly , none of the professionals are urging him to hurry and come out they have n't come up and said you should do this , mickelson said the guys have been incredibly nice , they 've gone out of their way to introduce themselves and make me feel comfortable hubert green even told me to go graduate school photo phil mickelson watching a tee shot in the first round of the doral ryder open yesterday in miami \( tom salyer for the new york times \)
east rutherford , nj , sept 18 with scott stevens a question mark , the devils are searching for a way to replace the scoring of brendan shanahan even if stevens , who was awarded to new jersey as compensation for st louis s signing of shanahan , never plays in a devils' uniform , walt poddubny may be able to pick up the slack poddubny had three remarkably productive seasons before joining the devils , but he has been plagued by injuries in his two years with the team , playing only 47 games he is now 31 years old and is returning from major knee surgery walter came into camp in good condition and he has shown us that he has n't lost his scoring touch , said marshall johnston , the devils' director of player personnel if he stays healthy , we 're in business he scored nearly 40 goals a year for three straight years , coach tom mcvie said about poddubny , who scored 78 goals in two seasons for the rangers and 38 in a season with quebec before joining the devils a little more than two years ago it s difficult to get a scorer like steve larmer or something , mcvie said , referring to chicago s right wing , who has scored 298 goals and has n't missed a game in the last nine seasons the goal scorer we 're looking for can be right here walter can be it he has been looking great he drives the goalies crazy judging from the kind of training camp he is having and from the preseason games , poddubny has lost none of his scoring touch and he could easily match shanahan s 29 goals last season the big question , however , is how will his right knee hold up 'i'm not worried' poddubny suffered torn ligaments in the knee in a game against the rangers on feb 19 , 1990 , an injury he thought would be corrected through physical rehabilitation after several unsuccessful attempts at playing , he had knee surgery dec 12 the knee is now apparently healthy i was a little tentative in the first game , poddubny said , but i'm not worried about my leg it s been feeling better and better it s really coming on gradually i'm grateful that tommy is giving me enough time to play my primary concern right now is to play a lot of games and see how i am physically poddubny is one of only a handful of players that mcvie has used in all three preseason games poddubny played a regular shift in every game and was used a great deal on the power play , scoring two goals i know i can produce if i have a chance to play , poddubny said what it boils down to is under what capacity they 'll use me i just do n't know right now what my role will be poddubny admitted that as a result of his age , and the condition of his knee , it had crossed his mind that his national hockey league career could be over but he said he was was getting more and more encouraged as a result of his preseason performances although poddubny is listed as having played 47 games , 33 of them in his first season for the devils , his ice time was limited in those games for two reasons first , poddubny was n't in the best shape when he reported to camp his first year after his arrival from quebec secondly , jim schoenfeld , the coach at that time , used poddubny sparingly because he was under pressure to win this is my third year with the team and i have n't done anything here , said poddubny , who has also had success in four years with the maple leafs besides his years with the rangers and the nordiques i really want to help this team because they have been very good to me slap shots gus badali , the agent for kirk muller , said wednesday the devils had made no attempt to contact him badali said his last contact with the devils was when he informed them monday morning that his client had decided to walk out of camp muller and ken daneyko , who is also a holdout , have been skating on their own the devils will visit the flyers at the spectrum thursday night and will play host to the rangers in another preseason game friday night

detroit , april 11 stump merrill s description was perfect ugly , the yankee manager said today it s an ugly loss even though the season is just three games old , the yankees already seem to have found their level they lost 40 and 52 leads today and left for kansas city following an 115 loss to the detroit tigers roberto kelly had a threerun home run and drove in a careerhigh five runs , and don mattingly and steve sax had three hits apiece , but the yankees are now 12 after their first series , and the remnants of this defeat are certain to chase them to their next stop poor way to lose it was not so much that they failed to hold leads it was more the way they let them go an error by third baseman mike blowers in the sixth inning helped the tigers take the lead with two unearned runs , and then eric plunk wild from the moment he took the mound put the game out of reach there were other blunders , of course merrill ordered plunk to pitch to cecil fielder in the seventh inning with first base open and runners on second and third , and the decision was costly instead of intentionally walking fielder , plunk gave up a tworun single that made it 85 plunk also gave up basesloaded walks , one in the seventh and another in the eighth why not walk fielder and open the possibility of a double play \? 'going for the strikeout' i was going for the strikeout , merrill answered if i was n't so afraid he 'd walk the guy behind fielder , i would have done it the concern is that eric is having trouble throwing strikes merrill said he left plunk in in the seventh and eighth because he did n't want to use his bullpen in a game that was already over but he eventually called for greg cadaret i'm trying to stay out of the bullpen , merrill said , but i'm also trying to avoid embarrassing anybody including myself plunk did not try to offer excuses his control , he conceded , has always been a problem lifelong , he said with a helpless shrug i think i'm just trying to do too much i tell myself before i go out there , 'do n't overthrow , ' but it happens i 've never had a problem with lack of ability it s just a matter of doing too much merrill was still clearly upset over plunk s performance when the game had ended there seemed to be no real solution he s had problems in the past throwing strikes , he said we thought he had things worked out last year , but i guess we 'll have to go through it again just because the scoreboard says 3 and 2 does n't mean you have to go 3 and 2 on every hitter you just have to go out and get them and play defense but there was none of that the yankees had a 54 lead in the bottom of the sixth when blowers failed to pick up a ground ball by fielder that gave the tigers a base runner with john habyan pitching a twoout single by rob deer , a walk to mickey tettleton and travis fryman s single put detroit in front then things unraveled with plunk on the mound fielder s tworun single and a basesloaded walk to fryman accounted for three runs in the seventh one inning later , plunk loaded the bases again on two hits and a walk and sent in another run on a walk to deer in two appearances against plunk , fielder is 2 for 3 with 5 rbi worse , plunk has allowed 14 of the 19 batters he faced in two games to reach base i keep thinking i 'll get the next guy out , plunk said that s the way i feel sometimes it happens , sometimes it does n't kelly , meantime , seemed to accept the fact that his big day was in vain it s frustrating to have a game like that and lose , he said you like to feel that you 'll help the team win but those things happen we did n't have it today no one did , except for kelly , sax and mattingly the yankees had as many hits \( 10 \) as the tigers inside pitch trouble in paradise \? not exactly , but stump merrill s revolvingdoor lineup has finally found an unhappy yankee , shortstop alvaro espinoza for the second straight day , espinoza was left out of the starting lineup instead , yankee manager chose randy velarde , who went 2 for 4 wednesday and gave the team what it needs most offense the decision left espinoza angry , hurt and wondering whether he belonged on the team he said he had not spoken with merrill , nor did he intend to i'm not going to say anything to anybody , espinoza said i 'll let my agent work it out a postscript velarde struck out three times thursday and made an error in the seventh inning that led to three detroit runs yankee starter dave eiland , bothered by a severe cold , took his troubled spring into his season debut he gave up four runs in four innings although he did n't get the loss after allowing 17 hits and 10 runs in his final seven and twothirds innings in florida i knew off the bat he would struggle to get through five , merrill said he was n't throwing well his stuff s got to be better than that if he s going to be successful but eiland responded that s his opinion i'm not causing a big commotion , but i thought i threw the ball well , i do n't care what anybody says scott sanderson , who nearly pitched a nohitter wednesday , will be the yankees' starter in their home opener monday afternoon against the chicago white sox in two other home openinggame starts , he is 20
austin , tex , april 24 one hundred days after becoming governor of texas , ann richards still seems to be campaigning for the job , except now she looks as if she is having fun crisscrossing the state last year , ms richards proclaimed her intentions to create a new texas and now , as she dashes around the state capitol , the slogan remains her rallying cry just as she did in the campaign , she offers specific policies on only a few carefully chosen issues , all the while avoiding any commitments on tax matters instead of enjoying the honeymoon usually afforded newly elected officials , ms richards , a democrat , has been courting and cajoling the state legislature and the executive bureaucracy , trying to establish her spheres of influence rather than expending political capital , she has been trying to create it she stepped into this job at the worst possible time , given the condition of the state , said george christian , an austin lobbyist , and she has not tried to shake everything up from top to bottom because that could have been a disaster for her some unfinished business appointing women and members of minorities to state jobs has been one of governor richards s major preoccupations she has also pressed for legislation tightening the regulation of the insurance industry and the disposal of hazardous waste , and she has joined other politicians in promoting a new government ethics law so far , however , none of her major legislative projects have been enacted her strategy seems to be to fire a few wellaimed rifle shots , not broadsides , said mr christian , a former press secretary to president lyndon b johnson meanwhile , she is doing everything she can to prepare for the big crisis ahead in midsummer the governor and the legislature are planning to contend with a deficit last estimated at 46 billion in a twoyear budget of about 53 billion unlike other states facing a temporary shortage of revenue because of the recession , the financial problems in texas are more permanent for nearly a decade , low prices and declining production in the oil and gas industry have robbed the state of onceabundant revenue at the same time , state and federal courts have required texas to increase spending on public schools , prisons , welfare and the care of the mentally ill after a briefing on the budget by fiscal experts early this year , gib lewis , the speaker of the state house of representatives , said , i move we recess and go throw up somewhere a reaction of that sort has become a common sentiment among texas politicians but governor richards , who often seems to be grinning under her crown of white hair , is an exception we look at this mess and we see all the valuable things we can do with it , said mary beth rogers , the governor s chief of staff actually , this is a wonderful time to be an activist governor of texas so far , ms richards has made only one foray into fiscal matters , and it failed when her proposal for a state lottery was rejected by the legislature otherwise , she has postponed any action on the budget , insisting that all decisions on financial policy should wait until a special legislative session she plans to call sometime after july 1 on that date she is scheduled to receive a special audit of state agencies that is intended to show how up to 1 billion can be saved by streamlining the state government and eliminating waste on the same day a special commission headed by former gov john b connally is supposed to report on alternatives for raising new revenue but the options are limited texas is one of only five states with neither a personal nor a corporate income tax relying on sales and property taxes to make up for lost oil revenue has already driven those tax rates to some of the highest levels in the nation as a result texas may have the most regressive tax structure in the united states one recent study showed that a family of four earning 10 , 000 a year paid about 71 percent of its income in state and local taxes , while the rate for a family the same size earning 100 , 000 was about 44 percent throughout the primary and general election campaigns last year , ms richards shied from taking firm stands for or against changes in the tax structure , much to the frustration of her opponents she has been equally elusive since her inauguration , but her reticence matters less now because others have taken the lead on the tax issue a redefined political agenda three weeks ago lieut gov bob bullock , a democrat , presented a plan calling for corporate and personal income taxes while reducing sales and property taxes the plan instantly redefined the state s political agenda , and not only because mr bullock , as chief officer of the state senate , holds a powerful post in the state government the tax question can be resolved , but only with a massive town meeting at which texans decide who they are and what they want to be , said george shipley , a democratic political consultant and lobbyist bullock can put the deal together on the inside , but ann is the one who is going to have to close the sale by going to the public , he said , referring to the governor by her first name , a practice commonly used by her friends and foes alike as she bides her time and guards her options , ms richards has taken a position on the importance of the issue , but not on how to resolve it earlier this month she told the connally committee we cling to the pretense that we are living in the 1940 s with the lowest fees , the lowest taxes and the best business climate as we prepare to enter the 21st century , we can no longer trade in pretense and myth so far she has given no signs of whether she is willing to join forces with mr bullock , who is both a political ally and a rival but ms rogers , the governor s chief of staff , said , people are all assuming that its an income tax or nothing , and i am not sure we are there yet photo gov ann

those who worked closely with paul w mozer during his dazzling 12year career at salomon brothers say they are shocked and baffled by the pivotal role he played in the bond scandal though he traded government securities with gusto , mr mozer was not perceived , before this month , as a man who would cross the line into illegal or unethical activity many of mr mozer s former colleagues said they were reserving judgement until he tells his story mr mozer , through his attorney , lee richards , has declined to comment but if , as the firm contends , mr mozer submitted illegal bids at treasury auctions , none of his former colleagues said they could understand why mr mozer , a short , softspoken man who was the head of salomon s government bond desk until being dismissed last weekend , attacked his work as aggressively as he hit tennis balls on the private court outside his spacious weekend home in sands point , li he runs down every ball he can , said one salomon trader , who , like the six other current and former salomon employees interviewed , insisted on anonymity he plays until he s exhausted the trader said mr mozer never resorted to cheating on line calls to win a match if anything , the trader said , he s too lenient to the other guy it s difficult for me to imagine he broke the law , said one salomon trader it s not difficult for me to imagine that he would trade in an aggressive fashion within the boundaries of the law paul william mozer , who was born on april 23 , 1955 in new york city , showed promise at an early age a secondgrade classmate at st mary s elementary school in manhasset , li , who also became a government bond trader , recalled that he was one of the brightest kids in the class one of eight children raised by robert mozer , a labor lawyer , and his wife , patricia , mr mozer once had dreams of becoming a rockandroll drummer he kept his hair long and straggly and enrolled at the berklee college of music in boston in the fall of 1973 but though his interest in rock music has persisted a picture of guitar legend jimi hendrix was prominently affixed to the side of his desk at salomon he soon decided that he had little talent he transferred to whitman college , in walla walla , wash , where he majored in economics , edited the school newspaper and graduated in 1977 after earning his master s degree at the kellogg graduate school of management at northwestern , mr mozer joined salomon s chicago office many people did n't like him , said one trader who worked with mr mozer early on he set very high standards for himself he expected a lot from other people in the summer of 1983 , mr mozer s life underwent two dramatic changes in june , he married francine lee , whom he had met in the salomon training program four years earlier \( and who is now a principal in the fixedincome division at morgan stanley company \) then , one month after his wedding , mr mozer was transferred to the government bond desk of salomon s new york office there , he was admired for his intellect , his mastery of the markets , his shepherding of young traders and his composure under immense pressure i think , in the entire world of bond trading , he considered himself the best there is , one former colleague said and i think he is every bit as good as he assumed himself to be as a current salomon employee put it , this was not driven by personal gain , if this is true there s a game here and it was a desire to win the game

for those who have been preparing to run for seats on the new york city council , the justice department s recent decision to reject the redrawn district lines has stirred fears and frustration candidates interviewed yesterday said they hoped that the rejection would not knock the elections planned for this fall off schedule some said that a delay would be unfair to the scores of candidates who had spent so much time and money on their campaigns others questioned the logic of the justice department s decision , which was meant to prevent discrimination against hispanic residents one hispanic candidate in brooklyn , martin malavedilan , even warned that changing the boundaries of the districts that were cited by the justice department as improperly drawn could decrease the chances for increased hispanic representation on the city council 'does n't make any sense' considering that all of the candidates in the 37th district are all hispanic and all of the candidates in the other brooklyn district are hispanic , this justice department decision really does n't make any sense , said mr malavedilan , the district leader , who is running against mauricio hernandez brooklyn is guaranteed two hispanic councilmen if the election went on , he said if they drastically change the lines , that could leave brooklyn having only one hispanic and maybe none besides district 37 , which includes the brooklyn neighborhoods of cypress hills , east new york and parts of bushwick , the justice department rejected the lines drawn for neighboring district 34 , which covers williamsburg and parts of bushwick in brooklyn , and district 8 , which covers east harlem and parts of the south bronx 'absurd and cynical' phil reed , a candidate for the district 8 seat , criticized the justice department finding , calling it a transparent attempt to pit hispanic residents against their africanamerican and white neighbors philip shelly , who along with the district leader , william del toro , is also running in district 8 , was also critical regardless of race , we are all suffering from our city s senseless budget and fiscal policies , he said in a statement released on friday the idea that only a latino representative can understand and address this on behalf of the latino population is patently absurd and cynical i completely reject the racist notion that the ethnic background of district 8 or any other district has any bearing on its ability to elect good representation , added mr shelly a black council candidate , janice l robertson , who is running against nine others for the district 45 seat in brooklyn , also opposed delaying the elections but for more pragmatic reasons this is like a nightmare i 've put a lot of time and money in , she said if they are going to stop things they should have let us know earlier , especially those of us who are n't incumbents and have to work hard to raise money

dublin , sept 30 the ancient celts , fierce in battle though they were , had a nagging fear that if they angered the gods , the sky would fall on their heads their descendants , especially prime minister charles j haughey , probably know the feeling in recent weeks , a wave of scandals involving public officials has combined with ireland s worsening economy to shake mr haughey s proven ability to rule this country of 36 million with a firm hand , taking backtalk from no one on friday , four members of his party , fianna fail the warriors of destiny stirred the political world here by criticizing him publicly , possibly setting the stage for a heave movement , as dumping a leader is known in ireland to deprive his opponents of time to organize , the 66yearold mr haughey moved up by a week an important party conference , rescheduling it for wednesday the party could replace him as leader , which might lead to a battle with government coalition partners over a new prime minister , or failing that , to a general election mr haughey has never had an easy ride , a spokesman remarked today every three years he has had to prove his manhood of the scandals and the political moves against the prime minister he said , hysteria everybody wants blood and they want it now findings of investigations begun by the government will be made public within six weeks , he said as for the motives of the party dissidents , he said that they might honestly wish for better government , or possibly hope for promotions for themselves by a new leader for the better part of mr haughey s tenure he has been prime minister in 9 of the last 13 years much of ireland has seen relatively good times even his adversaries agree on that as one of the smaller european community members , just ahead of portugal and greece economically , the country enjoyed a mild boom from european subsidies and began to attract foreign companies to invest in plants and offices although unemployment in some regions was high by european standards , it was eased by emigration about 40 , 000 people a year left the country in the late 1980 s for britain , canada and the united states , sending back millions to their families but in the last year , mostly because of the american and european recessions , the irish boom has collapsed unemployment is now above 19 percent , and the haughey government is considering reneging on pay raises it negotiated with public employees whose leaders say the government should instead catch the multimillionaire tax cheaters for the money it needs were all this not bad enough , the scandals , most of them disclosed in the irish times and the irish independent , have given many people the impression that ranking government officials have been filling their pockets at public expense the cats among the pigeons , the editorial writers like to say parrying with a laugh mr haughey , an accountant and lawyer , who instead of prime minister is called the taoiseach , \( pronounced teeshuck \) , the irish word for chief or leader , has tried to brush it all off , smiling and quipping in the style he has used for handling the public since he was a star soccer player in college asked last week about the scandals , he said , look at london and new york there are scandals there daily which make anything that happens here seem in the halfpenny place the most prominently reported of the scandals concerns a charge that officials of the irish national sugar company used insider information to make a 10 million profit on shares of stock they acquired before the company was partly privatized last year the officials also reportedly arranged millions in golden handshake pensions for themselves sugargate , the tabloids call it in addition , the chairman of telecom eireann , the staterun communications system , resigned , professing purity , after a company he partly owned sold a property to telecom at a profit of 5 million goodman international , a meatprocessing and fertilizer company that controls much of the country s major meat exports , is under investigation by another commission on charges that it obtained unfairly advantageous loans from the government , and sold the world cheap meat certified as topgrade in none of these has there been a suggestion that mr haughey himself was tainted but his ministers and friends in high office , where he put them , are being portrayed and perceived as naive , conniving or venal but one situation seems to get close to him , the sewerpipe case a public sewer line that local officials considered unnecessary was run under property that mr haughey owns near his estate in the north dublin suburb of kinsealy members of parliament from the principal opposition party , fine gael the tribe of the gaels said mr haughey was in effect using public funds to improve the value of his property this even though the land is now a complex of modest cottages mostly without indoor plumbing mom and a school speech in interviews , some of the residents said mr haughey was a good neighbor , and they thanked him for the sewerage others complained that their old mothers still had no bathtub in the house and had to go outside to the toilet mr haughey , who does not own the cottages , said he had no intention of selling the land for more luxurious housing the prime minister , a gifted speaker who refers convincingly to virgil or to gorbachev , has thrown no formal counterpunches but the other night , the irish times reported , he noted at a school cememony that he had received two gifts that day , the same day that members of his party started the ouster process one was a bag of dirt from a place of religious importance , the garden of st colmcille in county donegal , the other a sharp steel letter opener having refused to comment directly on the ouster attempt , he dealt a simple haughey parable i would like to assure everybody that that little bag of earth preserved me from disasters of any kind , and if the miracles do not work in this regard , i 've got this little knife photo hysteria everybody wants blood and they want it now , prime minister charles j haughey of ireland said of the scandals that have rocked his government and of the political moves made against him \( kyran o'brien irish independent \)
madrid , oct 31 in salvos of intransigent oratory , israel and its arab neighbors said today that they all hoped to end the bloodshed in their region , but disagreed about almost everything else who was at fault , what to do about it , even where further peace talks should be held on a day when the palestinians at last found their place at a major middle east peace conference , the arabs demanded that israel stop creating settlements in occupied territories and give up territory it had taken from arabs in 1967 the israelis in turn demanded that the arabs recognize israel s right to exist each accused the other of deception , brutality , treachery and aggression , exactly as they have done for most of the 43 years that they have been at each other s throats both sides listen but for the first time , representatives of much of the arab world listened across the same table to an israeli leader denouncing them , remaining in their chairs throughout , and the israeli leader , prime minister yitzhak shamir , listened to their replies he stayed put even though the palestinian delegates identified themselves in so many words with the palestine liberation organization , something the israelis had said could prompt them to walk out in one especially heated passage , farouk alsharaa , the syrian foreign minister , accused mr shamir of faking facts and history excerpts from speeches , pages a10 and a11 in reply , at a later news conference , benjamin netanyahu , an israeli deputy foreign minister , accused the arabs of complicity with hitler , himmler , ribbentrop and eichmann in planning the holocaust , and said syria had spoken in terms of vituperation , slander and condescension less rigidity expected these are just their opening statements , maximalist bargaining positions , a senior american official said a lot of it is for television and the political audiences back home people will start to soften their ideological rigidity once facetoface negotiations get under way but other toplevel americans who have worked for months to bring israel , syria , lebanon , jordan and the palestinians together in madrid expressed disappointment at what one called the truculent tone of today s speeches none could point to any overt sign that the participants were ready to yield ground in the private , direct talks scheduled to start sunday indeed , it was unclear when , where and even whether those talks would begin the israelis and the arabs remained deadlocked tonight , despite mediation efforts by secretary of state james a baker 3d , over mr shamir s demand that they be held in the middle east , with a first round in israel the arabs insisted that the plan had always been to negotiate in madrid and argued that they would be recognizing israel , in effect , by going there there was even some doubt expressed that the single organizational session that everyone had agreed to for sunday at the royal palace in madrid would go forward as planned the palestinians said explicitly for the first time that they would accept limited selfrule in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip as an interim stop on the way to statehood in accepting the terms of invitation to the conference , they had implictly said the same thing , but some saw an incremental step forward israel accepts the idea of limited autonomy , which it had agreed to in the 1978 camp david agreement with egypt and the united states , but rejects the idea of palestinian sovereignty nonetheless , there has been very tentative talk among the palestinian delegates and others here in the last 48 hours of some form of eventual confederation , possibly economic , possibly economic and political , involving jordan , israel and some sort of palestinian entity jordan faults radicals there was also a small conciliatory note from jordan its delegate urged both sides to work for the dawn of a new era and pointedly called on arab radicals to shed their rigid ideologies so the initial two days of the conference here , the first of which was dominated by speeches by presidents bush and mikhail s gorbachev , have developed into a microcosm of the middle east , marked by hopeful words from the great powers , hateful words from the countries of the region and fragile theorizing about what might be so far , madrid has been spared the physical violence that has long disfigured the eastern end of the mediterranean the mood inside the 18thcentury conference hall , with its marble columns and pilasters , its glittering chandeliers and immense renaissance tapestries , was somber and businesslike there was little applause after the day s five speeches , ranging in length from 30 to the full 45 minutes allowed mr shamir opened this morning s session with a blunt warning that arabs would lead negotiations into an impasse if they proceeded immediately to demand the return of the remaining land israel captured in the 1967 middle east war the west bank , the golan heights and east jerusalem israel returned all of the sinai captured from egypt in 1967 as part of the 1979 peace treaty with egypt earlier hostility noted
with an emotional depth and a comic flair worthy of the cinema s best short subjects , the bird and the mouse tells of a friendly rodent who teaches a baby robin to fly , later to be saved by the young avian from a ravenous hawk although done in simple black and white , the animated cartoon evidences creativity and pathos in fact , it was the product of john ramirez , chris chavez and stewart pera students in david master s animation course at john a rowland high school , a public school in rowland heights , calif in a twist on dr timothy leary s famous dictum , many american schools like rowland are inviting students to turn on , tune in and drop by the subject is the communications media , and after decades of ambivalence about their opportunities and perils , educators now appear to see such study as an avenue to teaching the basic skills like reading and writing in some high schools , students are learning to create animated cartoons as a way of promoting writing skills and analytical abilities elsewhere , children as young as 7 are making videotaped public service announcements , as a way of learning the differences between types of messages and how they are communicated whatever techniques they employ , these courses and others throughout the nation are designed to teach young people media literacy the capability of understanding the codes and conventions of television and other communications media numbers growing no government organization keeps tabs on how many media literacy programs exist in the united states , and none of the organizations that have struggled for two decades to bring these programs to the schools can say how many there are but education experts believe the number is growing , largely because communications equipment has been flooding schools and teachers are being forced to figure out not only how to use it , but how to make students aware of its power a june 1990 survey by quality education data , an educationresearch company in denver , found that 43 percent of the1 , 262 school districts surveyed \( of the 14 , 698 school districts in the united states \) used interactive videodisk equipment , more than double the percentage using such technology the previous year fortyfive percent of the districts had cable television in at least seven schools half the districts screened cable news network for instructional purposes there is a growing awareness now that television , film , computers and other media cannot be marginalized , said barbra s morris , who teaches television analysis at the university of michigan and heads the commission on media for the national council of teachers of english enough council members are teaching about the media that the group asked her to prepare a guidebook to help teachers use media analysis as a classroom aid most elementary and secondary level media courses tend to be ad hoc , developed to address a specific local need or opportunity nonetheless , some organizations have begun to develop textbooks and other aids educational technology publications , a publisher in englewood cliffs , nj , has recentlybrought to market media you , a media literacy curriculum for elementary school teachers the workbook , emphasizing visual games and exercises involving television watching and newspaper reading , introduces children to the concept of mass media , then teaches them about production techniques , the structure of news stories and the nature of advertising it even helps them analyze television entertainment programs the workbook was written by donna lloydkolkin , a health communication specialist , and kathleen tyner , the executive director of strategies for media literacy inc , a san francisco organization devoted to furthering the study of media in the schools and the nation s best clearinghouse for information about media curriculums , programs and developments the group publishes a quarterly newsletter , strategies advanced materials even more advanced materials are available from canada s association for media literacy in weston , ontario last september it published a resource guide for teachers , media literacy , that has already sold 50 , 000 copies , according to its author , barry duncan he has also written a textbook , mass media and popular culture , which is in use in some canadian schools the association s model curriculum takes students from television to film to radio , through popular music and rock videos and photography and print , all the while emphasizing an understanding of each medium s codes and conventions the specific ways in which they communicate the association also publishes a quarterly newsletter , mediacy finally , several mediaeducation specialists are available for interested schools james a brown , an associate professor of telecommunication and film at the university of alabama at tuscaloosa , who has written a book on media education in the united states , said most of the programs he studied used an inductive approach to understanding the media the programs try to help children look reflectively , and understand what they themselves bring to the medium , to make them understand even more strongly the differences , say , between a political ad and a news report , dr brown said

renton , wash the rear flap of an airplane wing is going through its paces on a computer screen in response to instructions keyed in by lawrence d smith , a design engineer at the boeing company at his command , the flap unfolds from a fully stowed position to maximum extension hydraulic lines and bundles of wiring can also be seen on the screen , so that mr smith and other architects of boeing s new 777 widebody plane can be sure that no two items are being designed to occupy the same place at the same time there is no going back to the drawing board for boeing engineers there are no more drawing boards nor are there any drawings , in the conventional sense all the design and engineering for the 777 , scheduled for delivery in may 1995 , is being done on computer screens , making it the first fully paperless airliner boeing executives say the paperless approach will save money by greatly reducing the number of lastminute changes that typically are needed to make the two million or so pieces in an airplane fit together it will also make it unnecessary to build a fullscale mockup of the plane , allowing boeing to make do instead with a model of just the nose and flight deck and they say it will help the 777 gain early approval from federal regulators to fly over oceans , a crucial factor in boeing s competition with airbus industrie and the mcdonnell douglas corporation , which are challenging its control of the widebody market oceangoing certification is essential because many of boeing s target customers fly the pacific and atlantic every engineer since leonardo has had to think in three dimensions but draw in two dimensions on paper , said philip m condit , the boeing vice president in charge of the 777 program , based in this seattle suburb the computing tool allows you to design in 3d a lot is riding on the change the 777 represents a 4 billion gamble by boeing to retain the dominance in the commercial airplane business it has held since introducing the first alljet airliner , the 707 , in 1957 since world war ii , some 54 percent of all airliners ordered worldwide \( excluding the former communist bloc \) have been boeings , the company says head to head to head but mcdonnell douglas , with its md11 widebody , and airbus , whose a300 series of planes is subsidized by three european governments , have been taking orders away from the seattlebased company for several years now boeing executives are betting that the 777 a twinengined plane that can carry 305 to 418 passengers will fill a product gap between its 747 jumbo jet and its smaller widebody model , the 767 , and stave off the md11 and some newer models coming from airbus the last time three manufacturers went headtohead with similar planes when boeing , mcdonnell and lockheed introduced the first widebodies in the early 1970 s lockheed was driven out of the civilian aircraft business today , the competition is even more intense as airlines look for every saving they can find in a cutthroat , deregulated market the md11 has been flying for almost a year , and has captured 156 firm orders airbus has 250 or so orders for its two new models the a340 , due in january 1993 , and the a330 , due in early 1994 even though the 777 will not begin carrying passengers for almost four years , it is getting substantial orders , too late last month , japan airlines placed a 2 billion order for as many as 20 of them two months ago , boeing booked a 36 billion order from british airways in all , about 80 777 s worth about 92 billion have been ordered by six carriers , a healthy number , industry experts say , for this stage of development yet not everything is clear skies for boeing some critics , including the air line pilots association , are raising safety questions about the government s willingness to use a fasttrack procedure to approve a twoengine plane for longdistance flights over water if the government does not give early approval , orders would likely suffer and the company s reputation for reliability would be damaged as important as the 777 is to boeing , more is riding on its success than one company s bottom line jet transports are one of the few categories of manufactured goods still dominated by american companies even the japanese continue to accept the role of subcontractor in boeingmanaged projects boeing is the best in the world at what it does , said david garvin , a manufacturing specialist at the harvard business school indeed , despite the competition from airbus and mcdonnell , boeing s order book is bigger than ever in dollar terms , totaling 95 billion so the way boeing designs , engineers and assembles an aircraft has implications for american manufacturers in all sorts of industries that compete with imported products boeing established its hegemony by means of its technological leadership , declared a massachusetts institute of technology study of american industry published in 1989 and company executives say it is technology like that used to design the paperless plane that will keep boeing ahead of the pack a lot of bytes
americans seem fated to ignore the dark shadows of idealism in foreign policy yugoslavia is the most recent case in point some of america s finest essayists and talkshow artists are doing a devilishly effective job of selling a cleverly unshaded argument their pitch is that america s basic choice in yugoslavia \( and the soviet union \) boils down to this selfdetermination , freedom and democracy versus order , stability and dictatorship if that were the real choice , the decision would be easy but it is not selfdetermination has its dark side virulent and oppressive nationalism stability and order have a positive side a context for peaceful change the fact that croatia and slovenia have freely chosen to separate themselves from yugoslav and serbian domination does not suggest , or guarantee , a free and democratic future for their citizens croatia is known more for its nazis than for its democrats slovenian leaders are largely unknown quantities the balkans are not exactly a tinderbox of democracy yugoslavia is rife with ethnic inequality , with the serbs at the top of the food chain but separated republics could treat their minorities still more unfairly perhaps the large serbian population in croatia has more to fear from an independent croatia than croatia does from serbdominated yugoslavia minority rights are every bit as essential to democracy as majority rule the economic effects of separation could also be devastating slovenes and croats expect that after independence their standard of living could plunge by onethird many who voted for separation might then vote with their feet and flee westward , creating enormous problems in eastern and central europe many who stay might find themselves freely electing dictators to restore order as a practical matter , where should selfdetermination begin and end \? why ca n't the serbian minority in croatia vote to join serbia \? why ca n't the germans in poland elect annexation to germany \? why should n't northern italians freely choose to separate themselves from southern italy \? if the russian republic can declare its independence from moscow , why ca n't russia s own 16 autonomous republics freely establish their own sovereignty \? fragmentation could have frightful consequences most new states would quickly become economic basket cases , begging for aid and loosing refugees on their wealthier neighbors the opportunities for mischievous diplomacy and war would multiply as the new states jockeyed to survive none of this is to say that the us should forsake its commitment to selfdetermination , for which americans died in two world wars , a conviction that springs from our own revolutionary heritage it is to plead that our actions like those that we and the european community are now pursuing in yugoslavia be tempered by commonsense guidelines we cannot and should not stop peoples from seeking selfdetermination but we can and should employ our influence to urge extended cooling off periods as was just arranged between slovenia and yugoslavia this gives time for all to reflect on the risks as well as the rewards of independence we have to make plain that spilling blood or provoking bloodshed is no way to gain our support economic and political pressures are fair instruments killing is not we have to insure that the parties understand we will not help bail them out of whatever economic mess they create if they simply act unilaterally , they will have to fend for themselves we ourselves have to understand that there is no one , final answer to the problem , and that those states closest to the problem generally must be the principal diplomatic midwives it is no accident nor is it merely an act of selfishness that every european state except germany and denmark opposes uncontained , unilateral selfdetermination in yugoslavia and to them all , stability and order are not abstractions for them , nasty nationalism and dictatorship loom in the shadows of selfdetermination unchecked by reason and history americans ought to hear out these european worries and appreciate our state department s own agonies before we start leading the selfdetermination parade
reflections by graham greene selected and introduced by judith adamson 325 pages reinhardt books in association with viking 1995 it is n't easy to find a thread of continuity among these six dozen brief pieces by graham greene , written over the span of half a century for various newspapers and journals the volume s editor , judith adamson , who teaches english at dawson college in montreal , cites in her introduction the many travel pieces she has included , and suggests that we look to them for the reality that later was transformed fictionally into the unique vision of greene , who died in april this is fair enough , especially if you have the enterprise to read these pieces alongside such novels of greene s as the quiet american , our man in havana , the comedians and travels with my aunt but this reader was immediately sidetracked by the first selection , impressions of dublin \( 1923 \) , in which the 19yearold greene describes a traincompartment scene in which a mother leaves her little boy behind while she goes to retrieve her forgotten luggage , and the child becomes hysterical when the mother fails to return immediately what is astonishing about the piece \( although unremarked by ms adamson and , presumably , the editors of the weekly westminster gazette , where the piece first appeared \) is that greene neglects to tell us whether the mother ever did return unless this sentence is supposed to clear up the mystery at last everything was settled comfortably , as in a popular novel , and the train started it does n't for this reader so the questions linger why would greene not bother to include such a vital piece of information \? does the peculiar omission have any connection to greene s famously eccentric personality , which he himself characterized by its love of escape through travel and the sort of risk taking most dramatically evident in his youthful period of playing russian roulette \? reflections is not exactly a minefield of answers to these questions indeed it is difficult to make any generalizations about a collection as diverse and uneven as this one was bound to be , with its film and book reviews , speeches , travel pieces , reflections on the novel , introductions to other writers' books and scraps of ideas for unrealized projects the better pieces are sharp and amusing the best autobiographies are written by old ladies , greene begins a review of wyndham lewis s blasting and bombardiering , malice trained over the tea tables , the sharp eye for foibles , and a nostalgic memory of the days when top hats were worn to church there is a hilarious account of greene s abrasive relations with his fellow travelers during a 1957 sojourn through china \( a weed among the flowers \) the less good pieces the majority , unfortunately are dull and obscure but the shock of that missing mother echoes in the reader s mind so one keeps an inner ear tuned for the hidden side of greene in a way , he fends off such a reading of the unconscious with trivializing references to the psychoanalytic implications of travel and the freudian interpretation of dreams about secondhand bookstores but then in a speech on shakespeare , he faults the greatest of all poets for not being a rebel against the state , and adds , surprisingly we grow a little tired of the artificial problem of the prince of denmark \( a mother s incest and a father s murder is not an experience we can easily share \) and a young suicide is unlikely to brood so deliberately in the wittenberg manner on the dilemma 'to be or not to be' here , one suspects , lies the heart of the matter graham greene , one gets the feeling , embraced the act of rebellion against the state more passionately than he did the causes of rebellion as he writes in a parallel vein , i am not a fanatic for punishment i may even have a prejudice in favor of the criminal classes if they confine their activities to stealing from those who are richer than themselves the richest and most powerful state in greene s experience was of course the united states of america , and many of the countries he wrote about and explored were smaller nations that had in common their being objects of american intervention , to which greene was always vehemently opposed vietnam , cuba , haiti , chile , panama and nicaragua in particular how might greene himself have explained his interest in these countries \? they also have in common a strong roman catholic tradition , and as a catholic convert himself he was always concerned with the survival and fate of what he called christian civilization in one of the longest and most eloquent pieces in reflections , an address given at a 1948 catholic conference in brussels , which he entitles the last pope after a story he intended at the time to write , he attempts to define what a christian civilization might be he writes my conviction that the christian conscience is the only satisfactory sign of a christian civilization is reinforced by the fact that this trait was completely lacking in the pagan powers that so recently reigned over the world the totalitarian state contrives , by educating its citizens , to suppress all sense of guilt , all indecision of mind but then , some 40 years later , in a speech given in moscow in 1987 , he observes there is no division in our thoughts between catholics roman catholics and communists citing what he sees as cooperation between marxists and catholics in the sandinista leadership of nicaragua , he arrives at the following overgeneralization there is no longer a barrier between roman catholics and communism from all the evidence in reflections , it is hard to resist the judgment that a hidden psychological agenda was operating in graham greene s thinking of course , none of this explains precisely why he neglected to tell us whether that mother in that train compartment ever came back to her child that i leave to more audacious freudians with a fresher recollection of greene s own unhappy childhood but the incident does serve to catch the reader s attention and to provide an interesting subtext to what is otherwise a basically humdrum collection photo graham greene \( amanda saunders viking \)
to the editor to my surprise , none of the six contributors to guns , guns everywhere \( oped , jan 4 \) put forth what i think is the most promising solution to the problem of gunrelated violence a ban on bullets if the manufacture or sale of the most frequently used bullet calibers were limited or banned , gunrelated violence would decrease almost immediately this approach has several merits \( 1 \) it is almost unheard of thus , its wouldbe enemies are unprepared for it quick bulletcontrol legislation might be passed before the gun lobby could respond \( 2 \) the argument can be made that a bullet ban , unlike a weapons ban , is legal while the constitution grants the right to bear arms , it does not necessarily grant the right to bear loaded arms \( 3 \) the logic behind bullet banning is the same as the logic behind a more popular anticrime movement , the war on drugs the drug war is waged against cocaine , heroin and marijuana , not against crack pipes , plastic bags and rolling paper bullet banning follows this example people can have as many guns as they want , just so long as they do n't put any bullets in them by bringing an end to gunrelated violence , a bullet ban will prove that guns do n't kill people , and people do n't kill people it s bullets that kill people though skeptics may argue that this approach will never work , they must admit that at the very least it s worth a shot peter freed research associate , national council on crime and delinquency san francisco , jan 4 , 1991
beijing , june 4 jiang qing is the first of the gang of four to die the four , who said they were following mao s orders to wage continuous revolution , presided over the cultural revolution of 196676 , during which millions of chinese were persecuted none of the four have been seen in public since their trial in 198081 the surviving three reportedly remain in prison or in detention , but in announcing ms jiang s suicide at age 77 the government acknowledged that she had been allowed to leave prison for medical reasons in 1984 the others are wang hongwen , a shanghai textile mill worker whose radicalism in attacking mill bosses at the start of the cultural revolution brought him to fame and eventually the post of vice chairman of the communist party born in 1935 , he was the youngest of the four and had a reputation as a playboy he was sentenced to life in prison zhang chunqiao , born in 1917 , who was vice premier and director of the political department of the army during the cultural revolution his rule of shanghai was like that of a warlord , with a private militia of thousands like ms jiang , he was given a death sentence that was commuted to life in prison yao wenyuan , born in 1931 , was a shanghai journalist who launched the first salvo of the cultural revolution when , on ms jiang s orders , he wrote a review condemning a popular beijing play as an attack on mao he was rewarded with a seat on the party politburo he later confessed to falsifying evidence against deng xiaoping , who was purged during the cultural revolution but reemerged as china s top leader in 1978 mr yao was sentenced to 20 years in prison

maybe it is worth it after all , whatever else can be said about the 50story office tower , the row of restored landmarks and the new home for the venerable henri bendel store that together make up the justfinished midmanhattan project known as 712 fifth avenue , this place stands as proof that the tortuous , infuriating and perplexing process of getting landmark projects approved in new york city can actually yield some real public benefit the angry debate , the long rounds of public hearings and eventually the active involvement in the design of this project by the landmarks preservation commission may have given the developer a sevenyear migraine as well as added substantially to the project s cost but they have created a vastly better design than would have existed otherwise in 1984 , when this new skyscraper was first announced , it was mainly an occasion to mourn the further decline of fifth avenue in 1991 , the instinct is to celebrate for this mix of new architecture and old , skillfully integrated , holds more promise for the revival of fifth avenue than anything that has happened to that troubled boulevard in the last decade where to begin this saga , now that its happy ending is known \? probably back in 1983 , when the developers ware travelstead and david and jean solomon began assembling a row of commercial buildings on the west side of fifth avenue between 55th and 56th streets with the goal of replacing it with a skyscraper as a gesture to the old buildings , one of which housed the rizzoli bookstore , another of which contained a garish electronics store but had been built originally for the house of coty perfumery , the developers ordered their architects to plop the tower atop a low base that would loosely echo the form and shape of the old buildings such sentiments tried to pass as respect for landmark preservation in the early 1980 s they did n't get too far few critics liked the tower , a slanted , vaguely egyptoid shaft by kohn pedersen fox , and a movement grew to save the old buildings , which at the time had no official landmark status but then came andrew dolkart , an architectural historian who was to be this project s unsung hero at the end of 1984 , mr dolkart discovered that the grimy windows atop the electronics store were original lalique glass , an art nouveau window wall created for coty in 1913 and forgotten when coty abandoned the building in the 1940 s mr dolkart s discovery that the electronics store had a front that could be considered a priceless work of architectural art was enough to galvanize the city s landmarks and preservation community by early 1985 , the landmarks preservation commission had declared both the rizzoli and coty buildings city landmarks , forcing the developers and their architects back to the drawing board they had to come up with a revised scheme that would save the old buildings or abandon the project altogether working closely with the commission , by mid1985 william pedersen of kohn pedersen fox had produced a different scheme it called for the preservation of the rizzoli and coty buildings to a depth of roughly 50 feet back from fifth avenue , the creation of a new threestory building in the classical style to go beside them \( replacing a twostory storefront structure that was not deemed to be of landmark quality \) , and the restoration of the lalique windows as the central element in a public retail atrium that was to go in the new buildings the tower was changed in design and pushed back from fifth avenue so that it would rise behind the 50foot section of the old buildings that was being preserved once all this was approved , the cast of characters changed , and so did portions of the project in came henri bendel , flush with cash from the limited , the huge retail chain that had bought the venerable retailer in 1985 the landmark complex looked like just the venue to give bendel s a shot of adrenaline , and the store signed a lease for all the retail space in the complex leslie wexner , the limited s owner , brought in his own architect , the firm of beyer blinder belle , which designed the store and took over as architect in charge of the restoration of the old buildings meanwhile , ware travelstead sold his interest to alfred taubman , whose company eventually took over the entire tower which , if you can keep all of this straight , had switched along the way from being an apartment building to being a hotel to being an office tower and so it finally is , now , in 1991 a slender office tower rising above two real landmarks and a third imitation landmark it should n't work as well as it does , given the byzantine history of the project , not to mention the basic absurdity of putting 50story skyscrapers on top of townhousesize historic structures but this has turned out to be the kind of project that may well give facadeism a good name for the critical decision here as important , in its way , as saving the lalique glass was the insistence on saving not just the facades of the old fifth avenue buildings but 50 feet of their depth they can stand on fifth avenue with at least a modicum of architectural integrity , as \( almost \) real buildings , not as stage sets pasted onto the bottom of a fancy skyscraper
walking in moscow last week , an american visitor turned a corner near the russian parliament and froze in the distance he saw a huge convoy of soviet tanks , guns pointed skyward he was horrified another coup \? westerners held hostage \? worse \? quickly he recognized that such imaginings made no sense muscovites were milling calmly around the tanks the soldiers carried no sidearms so the visitor edged forward warily he tried to ask passersby what was going on but none spoke english so he rushed back to his hotel where , on bbc television , he got his answer it was broadcasting pictures of the tanks and reporting why they had rumbled into moscow for a movie about the failed august coup
fears of terrorism and concerns about the logistical difficulties of international travel since the start of the persian gulf war have forced several american orchestras to reconsider their plans to tour abroad in recent weeks , the st louis symphony has canceled a european tour that was to have taken place this month the minnesota orchestra has canceled a tour of japan that was to have started on march 19 and a student orchestra from the juilliard school canceled a tour of france that had been scheduled for early march spokesmen for other orchestras with tour plans say that their musicians , boards and administrations are discussing the situation and will make their decisions closer to the time their tours are to begin among them is the new york philharmonic , which is scheduled to inaugurate an easter festival in lucerne at the end of march and to give concerts in holland and belgium when the orchestra voted on the question on feb 16 , a sizable minority voted against the tour it was decided that musicians who felt that the tour put their lives in danger should tell the orchestra s personnel manager of their intention not to go i'm not sure whether they 'll be able to tour with a significantly reduced orchestra and still call it the new york philharmonic , said one player who insisted on anonymity another musician , who said he would be glad to go , doubted that the tour would take place the philharmonic s management is saying little except that the tour is still officially on we 'll probably be arguing about it until the moment we get on the plane , a spokesman added groups visiting the us american orchestras clearly feel more vulnerable than their foreign counterparts spokesmen for carnegie hall and lincoln center said none of the european orchestras that have been booked for performances here have withdrawn , although one soloist , the yugoslavian pianist ivo pogorelich , has canceled his march 13 recital at carnegie , citing the war as his reason for avoiding travel the jerusalem symphony has canceled an american tour in early april but the israel philharmonic is proceeding with its plans , which include a march 14 concert at carnegie hall zubin mehta , the music director of both the israel philharmonic and the new york philharmonic , is scheduled to conduct both orchestras' tours that , along with mr mehta s visit to israel at the start of the war , has added to the new york orchestra s concern about its safety other american orchestras with tours hanging in the balance include the philadelphia orchestra , scheduled to tour europe in may the boston symphony , which has a tour planned for late august , and the atlanta symphony , which is supposed to tour in october one issue for us , and i trust for other orchestras , said joseph h kluger , the executive director of the philadelphia orchestra , is that we have longstanding contractual commitments to make our tour and the only condition under which we would break our word is if security experts advise us that it is unsafe to travel right now , they say that it s too soon to make a judgment about conditions in may delays for airport security deborah borda , the president of the minnesota orchestra association , said that the decision by some of the japanese tour s corporate sponsors to cancel their employees' international travel helped tip the scale she also cited her board s feeling that the attention paid to the dangers of touring would overshadow the orchestra s performances logistical problems also contributed to some orchestras' decisions as soon as the war broke out , we met with a security expert , said james f mann , a spokesman for the st louis symphony but instead of briefing us on security issues , he looked at our itinerary of 16 cities in 20 days , and said that under the current conditions we could not possibly make the connections just getting the players through airport security would take two to three hours , not to mention having every violin case opened and inspected besides which , airlines have been changing their schedules the tour cancellations are not likely to have much financial effect on the orchestras unlike pop music tours , which can bring in millions of dollars through ticket sales and merchandising , orchestra tours are not typically profitable orchestras tour to enhance their reputations outside their own cities , which can be useful in negotiating international record contracts and raising money from corporations and government agencies the cost of a twoweek tour can run as high as 600 , 000 , most of which is covered by corporate sponsors alternatives to tours orchestras that have canceled tours have been able to keep some of this money by coming up with substitute programs that their sponsors find attractive the st louis symphony , for example , raised 500 , 000 for its european tour , and was able to keep 400 , 000 to present a festival of mostly free concerts featuring american music in st louis and nearby cities but other orchestras may not be so lucky if the boston symphony cancels its august tour , it will not be able to perform at tanglewood , its summer home in the berkshires , because it has already invited the cleveland orchestra to take its place the new york philharmonic may also be at a loss for something to do if it stays home avery fisher hall is already spoken for , and except for carnegie hall , which is also fully booked , there are few halls in the city suitable for fullscale orchestra concerts we might just have a paid vacation , said one of the musicians
washington , june 2 the senate appears likely to approve a bill this week allowing the seven regional baby bell telephone companies to manufacture equipment the legislation s prospects are far less certain in the house of representatives , where drafts of a similar bill have been circulating for months if it becomes law , the measure could mark the biggest change in the communications industry since the breakup of the american telephone and telegraph company in 1984 at the time of the courtsupervised breakup , the regional bell companies were barred from manufacturing equipment because of fears that they could use their overwhelming dominance in local telephone service to compete unfairly the companies were also barred from competing in the longdistance telephone business or providing electronic information services att fears loss of business the current debate pits the bell companies against their former parent , at t at stake is access to the 35 billion domestic market for communications equipment that is dominated by at t the bell companies argue that the manufacturing ban is slowing american development of advanced telecommunications technology but opponents say they still fear that the regional bell companies will stifle competition and att , the bells' biggest supplier of equipment , fears it will lose a good part of that business under the courtsupervised rules , most of the bell companies sell telephone equipment made by other companies in many cases , overseas manufacturers proponents of lifting the manufacturing ban contend that the regional bell companies are well positioned to strengthen american competitiveness in the worldwide communications market they note that the united states has been a net importer of communications equipment for the last eight years , with last year s deficit totaling 792 million in addition , the bell companies argue that the ban is slowing the development of advanced network technology by preventing them from investing in research and design for a new generation of intelligent network systems these will provide special telecommunication services for the handicapped , highspeed electronic library services and systems that can transmit medical records and images over telephone lines the united states is losing its leadership position across the board in communications and consumer electronics equipment , said senator ernest f hollings , democrat of south carolina , who sponsored the bill crosssubsidies feared but many equipment manufacturers , particularly at t , are fighting the measure they fear the telephone companies will buy only their own products , as occurred when at t only bought equipment made by its western electric subsidiary they also suspect the companies will try to subsidize entry into equipment markets with profits earned in their regulated local telephone business at t supplies about half of the equipment bought by the regional telephone companies and views itself as potentially the biggest loser if the measure passes this is absolutely no 1 , said michael baudhuin , at t s vice president for federal government affairs if the answers on this come out the wrong way , our company will be hurt so severely that other issues will be less important a bell responds the regional phone companies contend this argument is nonsense at t has deliberately distorted the real issue , which is that they would be subjected to new competition , said ronald f stowe , vice president for washington operations at pacific telesis group he said the bell companies were primarily interested in getting the equipment they want opposition is coming from other quarters as well att s rivals in the longdistance business , the mci communications corporation and u s sprint , fear that lifting the ban on manufacturing will hasten the day when the bell companies are allowed to provide longdistance and information services two other restrictions imposed by the consent decree and many large corporate communications customers fear that the bell companies will squeeze competition they 're monopolies , and you do n't have any alternative but to use them , said brian moir , head of the international communications association , a washington group representing corporations that spend more than 1 million annually on telecommunications federal district judge harold h greene , who oversaw the breakup of the bell system and continues to have jurisdiction over the restrictions , has long resisted removing them although he has relaxed them somewhat he has , for example , allowed the bell companies to invest in foreign equipment manufacturers , as long as the products are not sold in the united states and domestically , he has authorized the telephone companies to carry information services originated by other companies while not allowing them to create such services themselves a federal appeals court has ordered the judge to consider giving the bells greater latitude in information services , but his ban on manufacturing has been upheldl t in congress , various bills to relax the bell restrictions have been introduced in recent years , but none have ever reached a full vote in the senate or the house tuesday vote possible the senate is expected to begin debate monday on senator hollings s bill , with a vote possible as early as tuesday lobbyists on all sides give it a strong chance of passage to satisfy democrats worried that the bell companies might set up production in foreign countries , the measure would require them to carry out all manufacturing in the united states and would limit the percentage of component parts that could be bought from foreign suppliers that feature is opposed by the bush administration , which otherwise supports the measure but the political bargain has made it possible to attract a bipartisan list of 25 cosponsors democratic cosponsors include senators albert gore of tennessee , sam nunn of georgia and lloyd bentsen of texas republican cosponsors include senators john c danforth of missouri , ted stevens of alaska and jesse helms of north carolina in the house , there is little consensus yet among key democrats , and no bill has yet been formally introduced aides to represenative edward j markey of massachusetts , chairman of the subcommittee overseeing telecommunications , say he generally supports lifting the ban on manufacturing if the proper safeguards are in place supporters of the hollings bill appear confident that they have the votes to win passage but senator howard metzenbaum , democrat of ohio , is expected to push for more safeguards to prevent the bell companies from selfdealing , and some lawmakers are known to favor a provision that would bar a bell company from producing equipment for its own network it remains unclear whether the bush administration will slow the process the justice department and commerce department both favor lifting the ban on manufacturing but fear that the provisions aimed at keeping production in the united states could spark retaliatory measures by other countries along with the pacific telesis group , the regional bell companies include ameritech , bell atlantic , bellsouth , nynex , southwestern bell and u s west these companies had combined revenues of 77 billion in 1990
hoboken , nj patty dellatorre discovered why her friends talked up hoboken s nightlife on her first visit here two weeks ago on a late friday night , the sidewalks were full , the pubs were packed and the mood was as giddy as a fraternity party it s a fun place to hang out , said the 21yearold , who danced on a bar and won a trophy for her efforts ms dellatore , who lives in ridgefield park in bergen county , has since decided to make hoboken a regular weekend event and she has plenty of company on weekend nights thousands of young people descend by the carload on this milesquare city of 33 , 000 people , coming from nearby towns and counties , as well as brooklyn and queens , and swelling the population by 2 , 500 to 10 , 000 the phenomenon is changing this old waterfront city thriving restaurants and bars are resuscitating its fragile economy when most cities in the region are still choked by recession there are so many new establishments opening , said mayor patrick pasculli , it bodes well the night traffic has also made the streets even safer than before there are street lights on formerly dark corners even elderly women walk their dogs later and later but the flip side of this prosperity is what the mayor calls qualityoflife problems and the police call nuisance crimes when the bars close 3 am on fridays and saturdays people spill onto the streets , some of them still drinking bottles are tossed and fights break out men and women sometimes urinate on buildings and bushes there is massive gridlock it s mayhem , said the police chief , carmen v labruno , adding that the city is still adjusting to the shock of rapid gentrification over the last 10 years 'crossroads of hell' it s taken a long time for the oldtime residents to get used to all the cafes , boutiques and professionals , he said now this happens you put 10 , 000 people on the streets , and it s assaulting in fact , in a city where violent crime is now rare there were two reported rapes last year and two murders in the last 18 months weekend nuisance crimes now dominate police calls , chief labruno said each weekend , the police department increases its street presence by 25 percent it may make 6 to 20 barrelated arrests and defuse several incidents it s like fort lauderdale 10 years ago , said mary ann monteverdi , who lives in a waterfront condominium , the hudson mews , surrounded on three sides by new and popular bars the condominium , half a block from the path train terminal , was considered one of the most desirable locations in hoboken until the bars arrived , she added we 're smack dab in the crossroads of hell , she said midnight on a saturday is like the indy 500 i cannot believe that all these people are 21 and older , the way some act ms monteverdi , a hoboken native , said she remembers when hoboken was a harbor town filled with sailor bars but there was never these problems , she said somehow , word has gotten around that hoboken is the place to come and raise hell downside of success most people say that only a handful of hoboken s 106 bars , including liquorserving restaurants , have created this stir but the situation led some members of the city council and planning board to propose closing all bars at midnight that idea , along with zoning changes that would place restrictions on location , size and how the establishments operate , among other things , was shot down after fierce lobbying by the food and beverage association , a yearold organization of 91 restaurant and tavern owners thomas newman , a city councilman who presides over a neighborhood that is home to 27 bars and liquorserving restaurants in the city s central business district , attributes the defeat of the proposals many of them his on the tremendous hysteria of bar owners hoboken is drowning in its own success , he said we have many terrific restaurants , wonderful taverns but we could close the bars earlier , make them something that would make hoboken a little less attractive to the young crowds but chris onieal , who heads the food and beverage association and owns a bar that bears his name , said the tavern owners believe that the solution to the nuisancecrime problem lies in policing and better management of the bars they keep talking about the waterfront here , he said well , no one s built so much as a toothpick on the waterfront we 're making a base here for some incredible development in the future these problems of prosperity could be worked out increased police patrols the industry is willing to bank on it in a novel partnership with the police department , the food and beverage association has spent 12 , 000 on police overtime over the last four weeks paying for a special patrol of eight officers stationed in eight bar zones throughout hoboken while it is too soon to tell whether the experiment will work , on weekends the police have become a conspicuous presence besides the bar patrol , the city itself has added community police officers , a fivemember dawn patrol , which starts at 8 pm , and twoofficer patrol cars along washington street , the city s main corridor , police in patrol cars or on foot show up on nearly every other corner most bar clients do n't seem to mind , mr onieal said if you mind , then you 're probably a jerk , he said and if you 're a jerk , then we do n't want you here the bar owners have also begun keeping watch themselves many stand outside their businesses like bouncers , giving the yea or nay to prospective clients , depending on how crowded the place or how drunk the customer stefan fabian , is one of those owners he opened fabian s hoboken brauhaus in 1946 , when the bars were smoky , rugged places , hoboken belonged to the longshoremen and the city was nicknamed the barbary coast now , his bar is subtitled a gathering place of the arts , his crowd is writers and musicians and his idea of a successful night is one without a problem i watch , i make sure everyone coming in is ok , he said , standing outside his corner bar at 1 30 on a saturday morning he admits that he was closed down twice five years ago for having clients who were too drunk the experience cured him of the desire for customers at any price besides , these days , he can be choosy 'keeps getting trendy' there are enough customers for every bar in hoboken , he said no need to feel you have to rush everybody in mr onieal agrees he and other members of the food and beverage association have instituted a peer management assistance program , a fancy name for informal advice that the group offers to new bar owners one piece of advice is to turn away large crowds waiting to get in if there are 20 people standing outside a bar waiting to get in , he said , what good does that do \? if a place is too crowded for them , well , rarely do 20 people leave at once it does n't give the bar any business , it does n't make the customers happy and it does n't give other bars that potential business to chief labruno , a hoboken native who has seen the city s popularity ebb and flow , the latest phenomenon may die down as suddenly as it started he remembers how artists came in the 70 s in the 80 s it was manhattan commuters and musicians , who made the city a mecca for underground music now , it s postcollege tourists then again , he said , none of those groups have left hoboken has come a long way , he said but it s funny how this little city keeps getting trendy photo thousands of young people are coming to hoboken , nj on weekend nights , causing the face of the old waterfront city to change for better and worse \( f n kinney for the new york times \)

aranyaprathet , thailand , nov 8 as hundreds of thousands of cambodian refugees in thailand hail a peace settlement in their country and prepare to return home , many express the fear that they may be maimed or even die from land mines that were laid across the cambodian countryside during the last 12 years of civil war no one has a reliable figure on the number of mines laid during the war by guerrilla factions and by troops of the vietnamesebacked cambodian government in phnom penh the estimates vary from 500 , 000 to five million , and specialists say that it will be several years before the bulk of the mines can be detected and disabled because of the mines , the suffering from the war will last for many years after the war is finally over , said soeun mao , a 30yearold cambodian who waited today for his new artificial leg to be sanded down at a prosthesis workshop at the largest cambodian refugee camp in thailand , known as site 2 mr soeun mao lost his left leg in 1982 when he stepped on a mine while on patrol as a soldier with one of the rebel factions , the rightist khmer people s national liberation front fears for family he said he now fears that his family a wife and four young children could also be maimed by mines if they are forced back across the thai border into cambodia too soon it enters my dreams , he said in my nightmares , i worry for my family and i remember the mines many people will die because of the mines the situation in cambodia is similar to that of afghanistan , which as mined by the soviet army during its occupation in the 1980 s , and kuwait , which was mined by iraq prior to the americanled invasion in february but unlike afghanistan and kuwait , cambodia is covered by dense jungle and paddy fields that make locating mines difficult the job is made more difficult by the fact that many of the mines laid in cambodia during the civil war were made of plastic , rendering traditional metal minedetection equipment useless four factions mines were used by all four factions in the civil war the phnom penh government , backed by vietnam and the soviet union the khmer rouge , supported by china , and two noncommunist groups that had american and other western backing the khmer people s front and a smaller faction headed by prince norodom sihanouk , cambodia s former head of state and now chairman of a transitional state council the united states says that its assistance to the rebel groups did not include weapons or ammunition , although it is widely believed that some of the american aid was converted by the rebels into weapons , including mines none of the four factions the same groups now forming amounts to a cambodian coalition government have shown any ability , or inclination , to find the mines and disarm them nor is there any international strategy for removing the mines the job , which will cost millions of dollars , may eventually fall to united nations peacekeeping troops , but that is undecided process could take years armies are very good at laying down mines but they do n't have the answers for finding them again , said rae mcgrath , a retired british soldier and mine specialist who traveled to cambodia earlier this year on behalf of asia watch , a new yorkbased human rights organization finding all the mines will be a process of years , he said in a telephone interview it could be 15 years before some cambodian villages are inspected even if you had all the resources you needed and there was no limitation on money , this is not a problem that cambodia can solve in a few months relief organizations report that hundreds of people in camboida , including many children , undergo amputations each month after stepping on mines mr mcgrath and the other asia watch investigators reported last month that there were now 30 , 000 amputees in cambodia the united nations , which will be responsible for the repatriation of the cambodians on the thai border under the peace plan signed in paris last month , is warning refugees of the dangers they face by returning home too quickly , urging them to wait at least several more months for now , people in the camps should n't even think about returning , said guy ouellet , a bangkokbased official of the united nations high commissioner for refugees it s simply not safe , and not only because of the mines there are a lot of bandits in cambodia there is also lots of malaria refugees ignore warnings despite the danger , many cambodian refugees in thailand are expected to try to go home soon , fearful that if they delay too long in returning , they will be unable to claim good farming land they will leave early , but they will be foolish , said phan phear , 20 , who waited in the offices of a frenchbased charity , handicap international , to have a wooden prosthesis attached to what is left of his right leg a former rebel soldier , most of his leg was blown off by a mine last year mr phan phear motioned with a crutch to three small cambodian boys , perhaps 7 years old , who were playing and giggling in the distance if these boys go home to cambodia , one day they may go and play in the fields or the jungle , he said and maybe there will be a land mine waiting for them the mines will stay there they will wait forever photo phan phear , a former cambodian rebel who lost his right leg to a mine last year , waiting to have an artificial limb fitted at the refugee camp in thailand known as site 2 he feels that cambodians who rush back to their country in the wake of the recent peace

n't remember when all 47 players and coaches completely quit i just ca n't from the opening kickoff , we played like we did n't have a chance i do n't know what it is about philadelphia it intimidates

hostetler came off the field , his ankle was not taped handley said hostetler could have gone back in the game , but the coach said he saw no reason for that that brought up the weekly question of whether handley might make a quarterback change i do n't know , handley said i have to think about it by losing , the giants' record fell to 45 the eagles climbed to 45 the frigid crowd of 65 , 816 at

khafji , saudi arabia , jan 20 since allied warplanes began their sorties against iraq on thursday , this virtually abandoned saudi city just a few hundred yards from the kuwaiti border has taken the brunt of the damage done in saudi arabia by iraqi forces the shelling has shut down the city of 15 , 000 and damaged both the oil refinery and the desalination plant , which provides the city with its drinking water the electric current has been cut off , the water tanks are empty and the telephones do not work at the far end of the city , near the border , smoke from a smoldering fire in a damaged oil refinery spiraled slowly upward today into the gray morning haze nothing stirred as the propellers of a united states craft , an ov10 bronco , droned over the deserted houses , the empty cars left in the middle of the street and the shuttered and padlocked shops a target is located the slowmoving plane , apparently locating a target , fired a white phosphorous marker rocket toward iraqi positions one or two miles inside kuwait moments later united states marine corps harrier jets streaked across the sky and dumped iron fragmentation bombs near the thin plumes of smoke , sending up gray and charcoal colored clouds that were followed , for those watching from a distance , by a loud report iraqi antiaircraft guns briefly swung into action , chattering away at the planes without success afterward , a saudi soldier standing near the surf that gently rolled into the strip of white sand along the city s beachfront said it is very peaceful here now it is very calm the night the war began , saudi soldiers manning trenches near the border retreated from their positions , leaving behind scattered pieces of clothing , food and even boots at dawn on thursday , iraqi artillery opened fire on the city , hitting a storage tank in the arabian oil company refinery and a few outlying buildings the smouldering tank has become a rendezvous point for allied pilots who are heading into kuwait civilian population flees the civilian population , including the police in their patrol cars and the firemen in their trucks , stormed out of the city on the road heading south shortly after the artillery rounds began to fall none have returned in the seaside restaurant in the khafji beach hotel today , halfempty pots of tea and uneaten breakfast rolls still rested on the white tablecloths a salt breeze fluttered a curtain near an open screen door above the mirrored double doors at the hotel entrance , an unlit string of red , green , yellow and blue carnival lights hung in an arch troops from the royal saudi marine corps , camped outside the city , returned today to set up a roadblock out of yellow oil drums and moved around the streets in toyota pickup trucks with 50caliber machine guns mounted in the back 3 americans wounded several soldiers said they found the empty city eerie and unsettling the enemy is not far away , said the colonel in charge of the unit , who asked to remain unidentified we see him and he sees us , sometimes the sporadic artillery fire , which amounts to a few iraqi salvos a day , has caused little damage , although two united states marines and a navy hospital corpsman were lightly wounded thursday night the iraqis are firing their lighter stuff at the town , said a united states marine corps major who is assigned as an adviser to the royal saudi marine unit and who asked to remain unidentified they fire their heavier stuff , like their longrange rockets , at the troops massed at the back of the town behind khafji , and along the road leading to the border from dhahran , a fourhour drive away , columns of tanks and bradley fighting vehicles , part of the united states army s second armored division , moved into position troops , ferried in passenger buses , disembarked at camouflaged desert encampments that include dugin positions overhead an assortment of united states gunships thundered past the convoys toward the depots either they 're really bad shots or they have no idea where everything is , a marine lieutenant , jim tuemler , said of the iraqi salvos 'the shooting is blind' but united states officers said the iraqi armed forces might be husbanding their artillery the shooting is blind , said the marine major they are trying to hit the area where our troops are massed , but they are afraid to shoot too much because they will get pinpointed and get hit they have got a lot more stuff back there we have n't seen the american forces have called in imposing fire power to crush suspected enemy artillery positions for the last few nights , the battleships in the persian gulf , the wisconsin and the missouri , have lobbed huge shells into the kuwait border region , lighting up the horizon on the persian gulf with brilliant gun flashes and shaking the doors and windows of the city cobra attack helicopters and a10 attack planes have assisted harrier jets in carrying out raids , often littering the ground around suspected iraqi emplacements with rockeye cluster bombs but each night a few lone shells are lobbed obstinately back toward the allied forces , often sending up a flash of pale yellow light when they explode and forcing soldiers to slip on their gas masks and take cover it is normal now , the saudi colonel said , standing on the road just a few hundred yards from occupied kuwait it is like a piece of cake for us
kyoto , japan it would be hard to find a country that reveres its traditional design forms more than japan but it has taken a design competition for a new railroad station in this ancient city to awaken many japanese to how dramatically kyoto s historic character is being altered by a wave of ultramodern architecture an unlikely coalition of buddhist priests , architects , urban planners and housewives has organized out of concern that old kyoto has been nearly destroyed by a feverish burst of development during the 1980 s futuristic steel and raw concrete structures illuminated with neon have replaced scores of traditional wooden shops and homes in kyoto s many narrow streets the emotional controversy that has blown up here over the prospect of a huge glass and steel structure dominating kyoto s skyline , once a patchwork of tiled roofs and graceful wooden pagodas , goes beyond style to the question of how the japanese see themselves contemporary architecture has long been regarded as an emblem of the economic success japan has pursued so singlemindedly in recent years slowly that has started to change the competition for the new station has become the focus of intense debate it is a battle not just over architecture some of those seeking to save the city s historic legacy say they welcome modern architecture in certain settings but over the scale of buildings and the extent to which they incorporate features that harmonize with more traditional structures the matter of greed opponents of the new station argue that it is a product of the greed that they say is ruining japan s cultural soul the station has been designed as a commercial anchor for a revitalized business district it will include a hotel , a department store , a convention center , a theater , a large shopping mall and a garage with 1 , 250 parking spaces supporters of the project insist that kyoto risks turning into a lifeless museum if it does not prepare a bold 21stcentury face kyoto is a city with one and a half million people it has both old and new and it changes all the time , said tetsuhisa shima , head of the planning department of the kyoto station building development company , the consortium running the project however , people tend to view kyoto only as something old and traditional that is the problem i understand that it is difficult for some people to understand the difference between ideas and reality but you ca n't say the city will stay the same forever masatoshi hisanaga , a local architect who is part of a group that produced a modestly scaled alternative design , disagrees this was not a competition for a station , he said it was for a commercial center that happens to have a station ninety percent of the building will be used for purposes other than a railroad station it is a reflection of the fact that people have this view in japan that anything can be done if it s for a commercial purpose a difficult challenge the prominent japanese and foreign architects who participated in the competition , among them james stirling , bernard tschumi and kisho kurokawa , faced an immensely difficult challenge the area around the station has nothing traditional about it it includes an undistinguished series of plain office and commercial blocks looming overhead is kyoto tower , a 430foottall structure meant to look like the candles in buddhist temples , with the obligatory circular restaurant and observation deck yet the new station is the gateway to a city that is the repository of much of what the japanese admire in their culture kyoto was the imperial capital for more than 1 , 000 years and is the home to grand shinto shrines as well as exquisitely austere zen buddhist temples and gardens the station carries additional symbolism because it was conceived to celebrate the 1 , 200th anniversary , in 1994 , of kyoto s having become japan s capital an international jury was formed to choose the winning design from among seven finalists in may the jury selected hiroshi hara , a professor at tokyo university who has developed a technique of creating structures that look like like clustered villages a rectangular box his design is basically a huge rectangular box that runs alongside the tracks it has a relatively simple facade consisting of a variety of triangular and rectangular window shapes , a sculptural glass roof to refract the kyoto sky and surrounding mountains and a wide central entrance sheathed in glass the atrium is a large open area that forms a valley between banks of escalators and stairs leading to rows of shops and restaurants as mr hara described it , it is like a traditional kyoto home in that nearly all the visual interest is focused inward , with a simpler face directed to the world mr hara s structure was the lowest entry , at just under 200 feet but it will still be massive , at 1 , 500 feet long the railway tracks already cut kyoto into northern and southern halves mr hara s design will look like a huge wall of metal panels and glass accentuating this boundary
citibank once advertised itself to new york consumers as the bank that never sleeps but it is discovering that rivals have also been staying up late while citibank remains the largest consumer bank in the new york area , its lead has narrowed chemical bank , long the area leader in serving small and mediumsized businesses , says it is now the primary bank for about 10 percent of the households in the new york area , up from 7 percent five years ago manufacturers hanover has expanded by acquiring 24 branches , with 28 billion of deposits , from the failed goldome savings bank and chase manhattan , whose name is highly regarded by wealthy consumers , has launched a series of new products , most recently a package of special services for checking and savings account customers over the age of 50 indeed , from 1989 to the end of march 1990 , consumer deposits at citibank rose only 13 percent , as a total of all savings accounts , certificates of deposit of less than 100 , 000 , and money market accounts that compares with increases of 127 percent at chemical , 202 percent at chase and 116 percent at manufacturers hanover but citibank is now waging a campaign to invigorate its new york branch system , a push that is a reminder of the increasing importance of the consumer business at a time when banks are suffering heavy losses on commercial real estate loans and weak loan demand from corporations apart from the profits to be made from lowcost deposits and highinterest loans to consumers , the large new york banks view stronger consumer deposits as a way to reduce their borrowings of hot money in the wholesale markets as citicorp accumulated losses in 1990 of 299 million from real estate and other corporate lending in the united states , europe and japan , officials began pushing harder to increase deposits from the consumer business , which provided profits worldwide of 979 million , more than twothirds of which analysts estimate came from credit cards and the new york branch network citibank plans to capitalize on its winning credit card business and its 1 , 200 automated teller machines to cultivate new business rather than to imitate the offers for highinterest rate deposits or lowinterest loans dangled by banks in the crowded new york market citibank s existing stable of customers could represent a promising pool allen r decotiis , president of psi , a tampa , fla , research and consulting firm , said that surveys show that citibank customers , bar none , are the most loyal and appreciative of their bank but he added that having wellsatisfied customers does not mean citibank will have an easy time expanding the competition is tougher and consumers have become more sophisticated success , if it comes , is not expected to change wildly the balance in the new york metropolitan market , where 47 million households hold nearly 30 million accounts unlike in consumer electronics , where a hot , new product can propel a company , success in banking is measured by gains of a few percentage points in market share it s an inch a day business , with no home runs , said john s reed , citibank s chairman growth of a consumer banking business comes in two ways by selling new products to existing customers or by attracting new customers pamela flaherty , head of the new york branch system , said that citibank is still convinced that expanding our share of the consumer s wallet is the most profitable way to grow that was the focus of citibank s marketing in 1990 but in 1991 and 1992 , she said , we plan to pay more attention to the acquisition of new customers citibank , however , does not expect miracles from the new campaign loren smith , director of marketing for citibank s new york branch system , says a gain of up to 200 , 000 customers , each worth more than 100 of profit a year , would be a welcome addition to its existing 15 million customers that would be fewer than the 300 , 000 customers citibank attracted when it pioneered the automated teller machines in the late 1970 s , or the 300 , 000 added in the early 80 s with the introduction of a combined statement for all accounts the bank hopes to win new customers by making banking more convenient it is joining the cirrus network of banks , which has 60 , 000 teller machines in 20 countries , and this month expanded its 24hour bankbyphone service in addition to simple inquiries about , say , account balances , customers can now make transfers between accounts one example of the bank s program to improve branch design is the new megabranch in grand central terminal the branch , which is open while it is being renovated , is modeled on a major branch at a train station in chicago with long hours , from 7 am to 7 pm , 20 automated tellers , an investment center for securities sales and purchases and a staff trained in all the bank s products , the grand central branch , citibank hopes to attract customers from the suburban towns served by the commuter railroads since citibank entered chicago seven years ago , its branches have been so successful that it is now neckandneck with first national bank of chicago as

for the novelist nadine gordimer , direct involvement in the political battles of south africa is absolutely necessary writing is not enough , she says miss gordimer , who says she remains a fairly active member of the african national congress , as she has been for many years , has had some public disagreements with other writers over this issue and while she does not discount the value of literary exposures of the reality of apartheid in her country she has written some of the best she remains firm in her political stand yet , she said in a recent interview in new york i am a late developer in politics my first book was published in 1949 and at that time i knew nothing of it i was filled with literature , that s all many people of my generation , especially men coming back from world war ii , had political ideas and they joined the south african communist party , which was not then outlawed i had nothing like that i was drawn into politics not through ideas but through friendships with many black people through the years little by little i began to see what i was a part of her latest novel , my son s story \( farrar , straus giroux \) , is more directly concerned with politics especially with black politics and the politics of protest than all her other work it has received tremendous critical acclaim in britain and in this country it had not yet been published in south africa , and miss gordimer said she had no idea whatever how it might be received no more censorship at least it will not be received as some earlier work was with a government ban for books , censorship does n't really exist anymore , she said after all , they probably figure , who reads now anyway \? they do n't even bother with nonfiction books now they go after the news media and they accomplish their ends by controlling coverage in my son s story , sonny , a schoolteacher who is , in south africa s peculiar classification scheme , colored , not black is turned almost unwillingly into a leader of the revolt against apartheid as his story unfolds along with the stories of his wife , aila , his daughter , baby , and his son , will the racial torment of south africa is exposed layer by layer the revelation is all the more powerful because miss gordimer keeps the reader s attention so tightly focused on the initially confused and then angry response of the teenage son to his discovery that his father has a white mistress in fact , the novel is a series of revelations about the characters , their pasts , their politics , the implications of their actions , which they themselves do not realize leading up to a disclosure in the final paragraph that restructures the whole story in retrospect , miss gordimer says , the fact that sonny and his family are colored must have been a subconscious choice they seem to be a mixture a dab of malay and a lot of black and all sorts of things that s what we all are in south africa there is such a mixture so their color , it turns out , is symbolic characters are composites none of the characters are modeled on anyone miss gordimer knows they accrete , she says they are composites who knows where they come from \? you hear a phrase , you notice a look , all sorts of impressions come to you but when you think about it , no matter how long you know someone you never know anybody really well everyone invents what happens to the narrator at the end of the novel is the process of fiction you realize that the person telling the story has been filling in what he could n't know although the characters in my son s story make a passage through suffering , imprisonment and violence , and through profound transformations of political and philosophical outlook , there is no peace at the end however , miss gordimer says , it is not a book about failure the people in it are rising above their personal concerns , she says that s the beginning of hope the only one who is negative is will she pauses a long time as though considering what to say about someone she cares about deeply then he will never recover , i think he is never going to have a fulfilled emotional life after what he has found out one deliberate message in the novel is found in the story of sonny sonny s not a mandela , miss gordimer says he is just one of the people who rises to some level of leadership if the whole liberation struggle depended on one or two people it would never have happened there are all kinds of people involved at different levels and there are all sorts of internal conflicts i wanted to show some of that 'expectations were too high' she says she is more hopeful now about the future of south africa than she was a few years ago , even though at the moment i am distressed because of the things that have not happened so far i suppose our expectations , those of the whole world , were too high , she said the problem is that we are not emerging from a history that started in 1948 when the nationalists came to power , but from 350 years of it

santa clara , calif , jan 15 the last time the giants were in candlestick park was on a cool monday night in december when the san francisco 49ers would edge them by 73 only one principal player in what was arguably the game s biggest play returns on sunday when the teams clash for the national football conference championship the play unfolded with 3 minutes 55 seconds left and with the giants standing poised for a touchdown that would give them a 107 lead at the 49ers' 9yard line , on fourth down , phil simms , the giants' quarterback , took the snap and looked toward the front , right corner of the end zone lionel manuel had sped there , but so had darryl pollard , the 49ers' fourthyear cornerback simms let the football fly and manuel and pollard lunged for it pollard got there first , slapping the ball away and deflating the giants new york would get one more chance the giants regained possession at the san francisco 44 with 36 seconds left but it proved too much distance and too little time no fearing simms and manuel simms wo n't play on sunday his injured foot has sidelined him since the giants' 15th game of the season manuel wo n't play either he was cut by the giants late in the season for what giant management and coaches called insubordination but pollard will play and he again expects the giants to throw his way ever since the 49ers' cornerbacks tim mckyer and don griffin , the blanket and the quilt , they used to call themselves were separated when mckyer was traded during the off season to miami , pollard has been the target for the opposition s passing attacks quarterbacks keep coming his way too often , now , they are regretting the choice griffin has savvy and experience and is a hard hitter the same should now be said for pollard good communication during the 1990 regular season , pollard , who also played on special teams because of his speed and tackling ability , made one of the 49ers' 17 interceptions he said that he and griffin have a close working relationship that includes constant communication during practices , during games and on the sidelines basically , manuel was running a slant pattern , pollard said they were trying to get the ball on the inside even though the route was run toward the outside it was a play i just followed the receiver but kept in position to make a play on the ball manuel is gone , but mark ingram and stephen baker are two good receivers this is going to be another dogfight , just like it was against the redskins both teams have talent out wide to make big plays interception against redskins a finish like the one against the redskins would suit pollard fine in san francisco s 2810 playoff victory in candlestick park last saturday , pollard made one of three secondhalf interceptions of the redskins' quarterback , mark rypien , after washington had driven into scoring position it has become a common pattern with the 49ers over the last three seasons unheralded young players who season quickly and help the team win a championship at this stage everybody knows what to do , pollard said the rookie part in every rookie is gone you have to play the game your way and work hard , and when the ball comes your way , you just make the play being older or younger , that is n't a requirement of the job key recovery in super bowl pollard obviously realized that in san francisco s 2016 victory over cincinnati in super bowl xxiii in january 1989 before the 49ers' long march that ended in joe montana s scintillating , winning touchdown strike to john taylor in the final seconds , it was pollard who recovered taylor s fumble of a cincinnati punt if pollard had n't made that recovery inside the 49ers' 10yard line , that final march almost certainly would not have been made pollard was cut and resigned several times with the 49ers before he finally stuck and now , he said , there is no looking back all of that is totally behind me , pollard said i do n't think about job security or anything like that anymore i think i 've proven i have a place and it was because i stayed focused on my goals that s important for the whole team now everyone is talking about the super bowl , us making a third one and even the super bowl being delayed because of the persian gulf situation that s all very important , but none of that matters on sunday the giants have to be the only thing that matters for us on sunday photo the 49ers' darryl pollard breaking up a pass to mark ingram during the giants' final drive in the fourth quarter of their dec 3 game at candlestick park in san francisco \( associated press \)
gerontius by james hamiltonpaterson 264 pp new york soho press 1995 an artist is on his own , grumbles sir edward elgar in james hamiltonpaterson s wonderfully readable , wonderfully insightful first novel , gerontius he s stuck up a tower preaching to pigs that metaphor permeates this book , a fictional account of a brief and largely ignored period in the aging composer s life it s an odd conceit , since elgar epitomized an edwardian correctness seemingly far removed from such bitterness and since this particular tale takes place mostly on the open sea and in the amazon basin , where towers and snowy peaks and the selflacerating saints who live upon them might seem in short supply but in a manner combining the philosophical metaphysics of thomas mann with the artistic ruminations and exotic evocations of joseph conrad , e m forster and bruce chatwin , mr hamiltonpaterson makes it stick this is neither mr hamiltonpaterson s first book nor his first novel to be published here playing with water an account of the four months each year that this onetime journalist spends on a rocky volcanic outcropping in the philippine archipelago , spearfishing for his food and that time in malomba \( in england , the bellboy \) , a comic second novel of innocent ambition and tooinnocent eroticism in an imaginary southeast asian spiritual bazaar , have already appeared here , to warm critical and cool public response gerontius , which won the whitbread prize for the best new fiction in britain in 1989 , is only now appearing in an american edition and not a minute too soon mr hamiltonpaterson is not a musical professional , but he is an artist to his toes his current life , spent mostly as a perhaps overcivilized englishman in isolated exotica , is surely what led him to celebrate elgar and music in this unusual manner the theory that all books about someone else are really about the author is handsomely reaffirmed here when mr hamiltonpaterson is n't on his philippine island , he can usually be found in a small tuscan stone house at the top of a hill , without electricity he does have a small generator , however , which he cranks up in the evening to listen to his favorite disks , elgar among them born of modest provincial means in 1857 , edward elgar was goaded to greatness and social status by his wife , alice it was he more than any other who heralded the rebirth of english composition after the 200year silence between himself and henry purcell elgar wrote in an undisguisedly postwagnerian idiom that retained some of the classicism of mendelssohn and brahms he was championed by the german progressives the conductor hans richter , the composer richard strauss before he was recognized by the stodgy british establishment after that recognition came the adulation of his countrymen , a knighthood and , in 1924 , his appointment as master of the king s music elgar s greatest scores came in fairly close order , after growing fame and a modest income from composition permitted him the freedom to create and before social obligations and a festering lack of selfconfidence brought on premature creative exhaustion from 1899 \( the enigma variations for orchestra \) to 1911 \( the second symphony \) , elgar counted as one of the great figures of european music in between came the dream of gerontius , a setting of cardinal newman s poem of an everyman facing death and ascending to god , especially beloved in anglican england despite its roman catholicism the pomp and circumstance marches , the first as patriotic as god save the king the first symphony and the violin concerto , along with several other cantatas and oratorios daunted by the horrors of world war i i cannot do any real work with the awful shadow over us , he wrote in 1917 he was left bereft at his wife s death in 1920 his creative life was effectively over , although he lived on to the age of 76 , dying in 1934 after conducting a series of important recordings of his music in late 1923 , still despairing and apparently eager to avoid the forced jollity of christmas , elgar booked himself passage on the liner hildebrand for a sixweek cruise from liverpool to manaus , brazil , and back the trip has been largely ignored by elgar s biographers , who make passing reference to his interest in the lavish manaus opera house mr hamiltonpaterson leaps gleefully into this void partly his book is a plausible invention of what elgar might have thought and done , a meditation on a declining artist musing about his past life and bleak future , yet momentarily beguiled by the beauties of the voyage and the vagaries of his fellow passengers , most of them standing for the 1920 s new man from whom he felt so estranged when he reaches manaus , however , elgar is confronted with mr hamiltonpaterson s most extreme invention , an almost entirely fictional german woman whom the composer is supposed to have loved in his youth now a widow named frau von pussels , she has been marooned in manaus and maintains a solitary outpost there of german , and hence european , civilization amid the jungle s riotous fecundity
a blueprint for ridding the fulton fish market of racketeers is still on the drawing boards , six months after new york city officials announced it the plan for the comprehensive reform of the wholesale market in lower manhattan the largest of its kind in the country would tighten supervision over the sales of about 2 billion a year in fish and seafood but city officials say the plan has been delayed by legal complications and budget cuts that have prevented the hiring of city workers to supervise the market the market has been a mafia stronghold for 60 years , lawenforcement officials say a federal administrator , frank h wohl , said in a report last august that extortion , violence and other crimes there have led to higher retail prices for fish in the new york area my understanding is that the city does not have the money to put agents and regulators into the market , mr wohl said in an interview in august , he warned that he would intervene if the city did not act promptly 'improvements' noted wallace l ford 2d , the commissioner of the city s department of ports and trade , the agency mainly responsible for supervising the market , said substantial improvements had been made in the last year in policing the market and in sanitation and traffic conditions he said dinkins administration officials had been working on the problems outlined by mr wohl before mr wohl finished his report for the first time , mr ford said , the city was making random inspections to insure the freshness of the fish and seafood sold there still , he conceded that licensing and regulating businesses had been hampered by the fiscal crisis it takes time to change these conditions , mr ford said in an interview the department s original operating budget was cut by 1 million to 94 million in recent months , and 35 of its 200 employees were laid off a spokeswoman for the department , jill fine mainelli , said the department s daily staff for supervising the market had been reduced to five from nine changes were promised mr wohl , who was appointed in 1986 by a federal judge to monitor conditions at the market , said in a report on aug 8 that the city had abdicated its responsibility to supervise the market the next day , the ports and trade department said that the dinkins administration had approved a plan for comprehensive reform of the operations and that it would be put into effect in about 30 days when he issued his report , mr wohl said that if the city did not impose regulations to help suppliers and retailers operate without intimidation , he would do so himself on friday , mr wohl said he would disclose his intentions soon the market , on south street between dover and fulton street on the east river just south of the brooklyn bridge , conducts most of its business between midnight and dawn , when refrigerated trucks arrive with fish and shellfish for the wholesalers the trucks are assigned by some unknown authority to unload , mr wohl said the suppliers have no say in how their cargo is taken to wholesalers , and many truckers and wholesalers say the fees are extortionate similarly , retailers who come to the market are assigned parking places by unlicensed loaders , who deliver the seafood from the wholesalers to the retailers' cars or vans city laws require that loaders and unloaders be licensed , but apparently none are they are also supposed to pay annual fees , but apparently none do in his report , mr wohl estimated that it costs about as much to transport fish 50 feet across south street as it does to truck it hundreds of miles from the gulf coast the cost in either case is 135 per 100pound box corporation has control mr ford said his agency had intended to issue rules for licensing loaders and unloaders but he said this had been postponed because the south street seaport corporation , the realestate arm of the south street museum , has sole authority to administer the leases and collect rents at the market , which is on cityowned land the city transferred these duties to the corporation in 1980 the seaport museum is just south of the market on south street mr ford said the city is negotiating with the seaport corporation to return the leases gerald j mcmahon , a lawyer who represents 11 of the 18 unloading and loading companies , was unavailable for comment on the licensing plan , an aide said mr mcmahon previously described mr wohl s charges of high costs and criminal activities at the market as totally false
this building is falling down around our ears , said betty allen it s only 12 years old , but there are so many things wrong with it she was speaking of the harlem school of the arts , whose awardwinning quarters on nicholas avenue near 141st street opened a few months before she became the executive director the design , by ulrich franzen , was fine , she said the main problem was the execution by the subcontractor , who disappeared before completing the job , and the contractor , who , she said , went bankrupt before the school could take him to court also , construction these days , it seems , is n't what it might be what do you want , lady \? she recalled a plumber telling her the world trade center leaks ! miss allen detailed the structure s woes ranging from sewage backups to a flat roof that was supposed to have been slanted while discussing imminent changes at the institution , one of the nation s first major multidisciplined arts schools serving mainly black and hispanic youngsters she will step down as executive director as soon as a successor is found in the meantime , she has been named president a new title to head a capital fund drive whose details are to be announced in the weeks ahead career interrupted a mezzosoprano who appeared in opera houses all over the world , miss allen stopped singing publicly in the mid1980 s because of lung problems she traces to the sooty air of youngstown , ohio , where she grew up she hopes to become a consultant for the school when her contract expires in three years miss allen said she hoped the new executive director could pick my brains and ease into the role while she was still on the scene that would contrast with her own experience when she took over from the soprano dorothy maynor , who founded the school in 1964 miss maynor had hoped to help pave the way for miss allen but could not do so because of illness at that time there were 500 students , 50 faculty members and a staff of a dozen or less , she recalled now there are 1 , 500 students , 78 teachers and 19 staff members , some of whom occupy offices converted from studios the yearly budget has increased from nearly 500 , 000 to 18 million since miss maynor began it with a dozen students in a church , the harlem school of the arts has educated thousands of youngsters who have gone on to colleges and conservatories all over the country some have developed careers in the arts singers have appeared with opera companies including the metropolitan and the glyndebourne festival tuition fees are comparatively low and scholarships numerous no child is turned away for lack of finances , miss allen said about half the students are from manhattan , mainly harlem the remainder are from other parts of the city and the suburbs they take classes in music , dance , drama and the visual arts , coming in after regular school hours , during release time or on saturdays they are taught by professionals , most of whom also perform the students perform , too , at the school and elsewhere , and are tested we are not babysitting , miss allen said future fund raising thanks to challenge grants , miss allen managed to free the school of debt , paying off a 16 million mortgage on the 4 million building in 1982 still , fund raising is going to be a big part of her successor s job future plans for the school include expansion next door the city had allotted 3 million for that project a year ago , as part of an effort to upgrade harlem but facing its own money problems , it reduced the figure to 2 million , put off to 1994 the immediate goal , miss allen said , is to keep the building from falling down which she thinks would cost about 250 , 000 and develop a reasonable cash reserve or endowment as for the building s troubles , miss allen began with her own office , whose gray cinderblock walls are marred by water stains , as are walls in the library below the room was virtually airless when she arrived and has needed repeated work to make it livable i firmly believe the ducts are in backward , she said it was also cold , so radiator covers were removed , revealing only two of the eight units that were supposed to have been installed as for the rest of the building , she said , someone in their infinite wisdom made the sewage pipes too narrow the rugs , which are important for soundproofing , are very worn and need to be replaced , she said , and the whole place needs a serious painting the library will have to be completely redone , she said the rugs are mildewed it smells like the basement of the house of usher indeed , the smell was dank as she led a visitor there , interrupting a boy s saxophone lesson his teacher could not use his own studio because it was temporarily occupied by a harpist even in summer , when only some 200 students attend , space is at a premium none of the walls of the school are straight there s a bend here , a bend there , she pointed out but that s not a focus of their needs , she said i'm talking about heat in winter , being cool in summer , lights to see and you do n't have a backup in your cellar and your roof does n't leak this is pretty basic anything else is fabulous photo betty allen , the executive director of the harlem school of the arts , with students at the school \( william e sauro the new york times \)
washington , sept 30 in these rough economic times , one might expect arena stage , the premier resident theater in the nation s capital , to use its art to prod politicians into action but arena is instead opening its new season with william saroyan s san francisco barroom reverie of 1939 , the time of your life , surely the most comforting american play to emerge from the depression , and will soon follow it with a musical adaptation of frank capra s it s a wonderful life , another work that champions the power of fundamentally decent americans to vanquish any misfortune singlehandedly far from challenging washington s conventional wisdom , arena s 41st season the first under the artistic direction of douglas c wager , zelda fichandler s successor seems eager to chime in with its own program for a thousand points of light the wattage will have to be a lot higher than it is in liviu ciulei s staging of the time of your life if arena is to convince anyone that the country is as full of good samaritans as its chosen scripts would have audiences believe mr ciulei , a romanianborn director and designer capable of startling visions of classics , would seem to have a special fondness for saroyan s play though he has now been working in the united states for nearly two decades , it is the first american play he has chosen to direct here yet , with the exception of one major performance , by casey biggs as joe , and a few minor ones , this production is sloppily acted as well as flaccidly paced , running three hours despite textual trims mr ciulei s approach to the work is pure stock even his saloon set looks as prefab as a pizzeria uno franchise and his only bold directorial gesture is to change the play s favored jukebox tune from the missouri waltz to you go to my head it would be easy , but wrong , to blame the evening s failings on saroyan the standard line on this writer , who died a decade ago , has long been that he is a sentimentalist whose literary string ran out when world war ii rendered his sunny world view obsolete but he has never lacked for critical defenders edmund wilson , mary mccarthy and harold clurman have been among them and in truth the time of your life seems less dated than many other touchstone american plays of the same period unburdened by ideology , the work has none of the antiquated preachiness of odets bereft of structure , it is free of the creaking plot mechanics of kaufman and hart yes , the play s characters , from the philosophical longshoreman to the lovable cop to the whore with a heart of gold , are too good to be true , but they have their own poetic reality saroyan s offcenter vignettes about his ethnic crosssection of drifters and his shaggy , unforced sense of humor make his play , initially titled the light fantastic , as brightly colored and animated as the pinball machine at center stage for the show to fly , each character s turn has to be supercharged with theatrical personality , not naturalistic acting , like succeeding comic acts in a vaudeville bill or a circus though the time of your life was written in the same year that o'neill wrote the iceman cometh , the denizens of its bar dream attainable dreams , not pipe dreams , and the play upholds magical illusions rather than spreading disillusionment in an arena cast exceeding two dozen , the light fantastic is tripped only by joey mckneely , who brings a dead end kid s tattered innocence and a hoofer s grace to the role of an erstwhile natural born dancer and comedian originally played on broadway by gene kelly , and , to a more incidental degree , by jeffery v thompson as the bartender , nick , and teagle f bougere as an itinerant honkytonk pianist among the more central and damaging performances are those of pamela nyberg , who acts kitty , the sweet and distraught prostitute , as if she were a cross young suburban matron , and kevin james kelly , who goofily and sexlessly caricatures the young man smitten by her in a class apart is richard bauer , outfitted in long whiskers and full buffalo bill regalia as a mock frontiersman who calls himself kit carson a mountain of mannerisms odd crouches , vocal twangs , stomach pattings , whiskyeyed winks he pays attention to the other actors only if they threaten to upstage him during his longest soliloquy , the cast surrounds him in worshipful , openmouthed poses \( a prostrate posture of adulation mimicked by a minority of the audience \) while mr ciulei spins the revolving stage to show off his prize specimen of ham from every angle as joe , the mysteriously wealthy , champagnesipping philanthropist who functions as the play s unofficial stage manager , mr biggs is a most elegant antidote to such shenanigans this is a very , very fine performance in an impossible role the wry , distanced joe could seem bland next to the barflies around him , and he often seems to be saroyan s standin for god an urbane figure in a gray suit , mr biggs wears his halo lightly he is serene without being unctuous , a martinidry rather than syrupysweet humanitarian he sounds the dark notes in the play the european drums of war , most notably without being portentous , gently nudging the audience to recognize that saroyan had more on his mind than the wonderfulness of little people in the compassionate , troubled undertow of mr biggs s joe , which recalls the worldweary tone of the wartime hollywood performances of claude rains , one feels the brunt of the play s principal refrain , recited by an unnamed arab no foundation all the way down the line one does not want to make too much of saroyan s seriousness even so in the time of your life , live is the play s main , and lightweight , message , and it is as a fantasy , an entertainment , that the play must live , not as any kind of exercise in social realism from its first production , there have been arguments over how best to realize the piece saroyan drove away the original , fabulistinclined director , robert lewis , and designer , boris aronson , during the new haven tryout and one can see why if the time of your life never had much to add to political debates , it remains a fertile ground for esthetic debate and experimentation in the theater but the play s dream world of 1939 is no more present at arena stage than the real world of 1991 milking saroyan merely for his hokiest jokes and cheap nostalgia , mr ciulei has reduced an artist s genuine feat of escapism to a truly irrelevant , and synthetic , heap of corn the time of your life by william

washington , june 19 president bush said today that his chief of staff , john h sununu , had created an appearance problem by using government planes and cars and corporate jets for political and personal trips , but he defended his aide and said he was doing a firstclass job specifically , the president expressed concern over a possible appearance of impropriety from mr sununu s use of a chauffeurdriven government limousine last week for a 250mile trip to new york for a stamp auction at which he spent about 5 , 000 it was the second time mr bush had publicly rebuked mr sununu during a continuing controversy over his travel conduct six weeks ago , the president told the chief of staff that he must get the approval of an official junior to him , c boyden gray , the white house counsel , before he could use government planes what they did n't want this time , although he argued that it had been appropriate for mr sununu to take a limousine to new york for a stamp auction , the president added pointedly that , it does n't set a precedent , it does n't say anyone that has access to a car can go any place anyone wants at any time friends of mr bush , inside the government and out , said he was perturbed that his administration had been caught up in what one called exactly the kind of chintzylooking behavior the president wants to avoid but republican officeholders and strategists said they saw no implied invitation to mr sununu to resign in mr bush s criticism , which was coupled with the comment , this beating that he s taken is unwarranted , in my view officials said that the president , who is known for his fierce loyalty to his staff , was unlikely to force the former new hampshire governor to step down unless there were further , much more damaging revelations you 'd think a guy with a genius iq like sununu could see he s hurting the president , but this guy sees things in a strange way , said a conservative republican senator who is highly regarded at the white house as far as i can tell , he s staying , and everything continues to flow through him charles black , a leading republican campaign consultant , argued that the sununu controversy , which in the last couple of days has focused on his active solicitation of transportation on corporate jets , meant very little to the average voter there s no damage out in the country , mr black said , but this is a constant distraction for the president , and that s bad john and our people in the white house have to find some way to end it , and quickly a liability in some eyes other leading republicans , who asked that they not be identified , used stronger language several described mr sununu as a liability , not only because of his capacity for attracting criticism in the news media but also becuse of his supposedly heavyhanded treatment of members of congress and lesser federal officials yet none said they thought mr bush shared that judgment indeed , they expressed the view that mr bush considered the former governor invaluable if not indispensable marlin fitzwater , the white house spokesman , said later that mr sununu realizes that this is a situation that s created an appearance that no one wants , and i think that that will help everybody in making judgments about uses of the car in the future mr sununu defended his traveling in a political appearance tuesday night in des moines , saying that he wants to stay in touch with the public , the associated press reported you ca n't get here without traveling , mr sununu was quoted by the ap as telling about 1 , 500 republicans at a fundraising dinner i know that s a very complicated concept for some in a brief reference to the criticism of his travels , mr sununu said it is nice to get out of washington to see real people in hometown america there are some folks who keep asking why i have to travel the fact is that the president bush administration really does love to spend time with folks who make up the heart and soul of this nation , to see you , to discuss issues with you frankly , we 'd rather listen to you than the selfstyled experts in washington the political bloodletting raised questions about mr bush s 1992 campaign , which mr sununu has been expected to oversee if he gets weaker and weaker , a former bush aide said , it s hard to see how he can play the key role in the campaign that problem could be especially serious because two of the other leading figures in the successful bush effort of 1988 are unavailable for the president s expected bid for a second term lee atwater has since died , and james a baker 3d has told friends that he has no interest in leaving his post as secretary of state , which he would have to do if he were to take an active political role opposites that mesh one campaign professional said mr sununu s troubles made it more likely that robert teeter , mr bush s polltaker , would be brought in to run the campaign next year the controversy also has prompted washington insiders to ask themselves about the relationship between mr sununu and mr bush the two men are profoundly different one abrasive , one a compromiser , one a selfmade man , the other a patrician , one a conservative ideologue , the other a pragmatist yet mr bush has allowed mr sununu to assume a dominant role in the administration , compared by many to that played by another difficult and domineering new hampshire republican governor , sherman adams , who was chief of staff in the eisenhower era i think that george bush has always found personal conflict and confrontation difficult , said an old friend , but he knows that it s a major part of politics at the presidential level someone has to do it , and he likes having john there to do it but in the washington political community , mr sununu is faulted for two things his seeming lack of concern about the look of things , such as spending government funds lavishly at a time of fiscal stringency , or using jets belonging to corporations with major issues before the government , and his apparent arrogance what one republican called his tendency to act as if he s president he has his defenders , but many enemies , too mr bush seemed to be walking a fine line when he talked with reporters during a white house photo session this morning , seeking to give mr sununu his support without voicing full approval of what he had done , seeking to rein him in without actually saying the chief of staff had to mend his ways or leave on the day mr sununu drove to new york , the president said , we had a lot of very important negotiation on legislation and a very important speech that needed finetuning the chief of staff has said he dealt with those matters , among others , on the car phone mr bush told reporters when you look at the facts surrounding this particular trip , this beating that he s taken is unwarranted in my view , and i would say it s special , for reasons i 've outlined to you but nobody likes the appearance of impropriety on the other hand , i think fairness dictates you ought to look at the particular fact about it mr bush added you should n't be judged by appearance you ought to be judged by the fact , so that s what i'm saying here there s plenty of reason that this was done neither mr bush nor other officials have explained why mr sununu could not handle his business from his desk , then fly from washington to new york on the commercial shuttle photo president bush defended his chief of staff , john h sununu , saying he was , doing a firstclass job mr sununu , center , attended a meeting at the white house yesterday at right was vice president dan quayle \( associated press \) \( pg d22 \)
the end of laissezfaire national purpose and the global economy after the cold war by robert kuttner 304 pp new york alfred a knopf 2295 one wonders how many times robert kuttner s title , the end of laissezfaire , has been used in the last century and a half for speeches , symposiums , articles , books , even as a slogan mr kuttner has purposefully borrowed it from what is perhaps its most famous previous use as the title for an essay by john maynard keynes , written in 1926 keynes s essay was not concerned with the condition of domestic market economies but with international economics with trade balances and currency exchange rates , tariffs and customs unions , the gold standard and world capital markets keynes s theme was how to avoid the beggarthyneighbor excesses of protectionism without succumbing to the utopianism of free trade , so beloved by orthodox economists then and now this is mr kuttner s theme , too in 1984 , in the economic illusion , he argued the case against pure laissezfaire in the management of a domestic economy this volume amounts to a sequel , extending the argument to the more complex world of the international economy , a realm in which the forces of private commerce are far more difficult to tame , for the obvious reason that the reach of the nationstate ends at its borders mr kuttner , an economics correspondent for the new republic and a columnist for business week , insists that his quarrel is not with capitalism itself , only with its utopian variation , and i quarrel in the spirit of keynes his book appears at a moment of transition in world politics and economics that is comparable to the fateful period of postwar instability when keynes wrote his essay mr kuttner observes that his subject is the second end of laissezfaire for if keynes s advice was not heeded in the 1920 s , the great depression of the 30 s and the government interventions unleashed by world war ii had the effect of retrospectively elevating him to prophetic stature not only did he become the virtual architect of the fiscal interventionism and , to a lesser extent , the welfarestate policies adopted by the american and british governments that came after the war , but he also played a leading role at the 1944 bretton woods conference intended to establish a new international economic order free of the disastrous instabilities of the previous decade , the conference created a global interventionist framework featuring fixed exchange rates and centered on two new institutions , the world bank and the international monetary fund yet after these reforms , belief in laissezfaire made a steady comeback , culminating in the antigovernment policies of the reagan administration the intriguing question , mr kuttner writes , is why the utopian vision of a pure market economy proved so potent why it came back to life , after being so thoroughly discredited by events half a century ago and after most advanced nations successfully built their postwar societies very much in the spirit of a mixed economy rather than a laissezfaire one roughly half of the end of laissezfaire tries to answer this question , focusing on the united states the other half advances prescriptions for a new regulated world economic order that , far from challenging american national purpose , could , in mr kuttner s view , reinvigorate it the international monetary fund and the world bank never became the genuinely supranational authorities envisaged by keynes essentially , they developed into institutions that provided loans and economic advice , primarily to less developed nations they were not permitted to take the key step of establishing an international unit of exchange , a standard by which national currencies could be both measured and regulated instead , under bretton woods , the united states dollar , the currency of the dominant political and economic power in the postwar world , emerged as a kind of international unit of exchange , although philosophically the united states was unprepared to play the role of world banker that its currency s position seemed to require washington ardently supported unrestricted free trade on ideological grounds moreover , given the productive superiority of the american economy , free trade served american interests just as it had those of britain in the 19th century , when the british were the major world power and a lack of trade restrictions assured their economic dominance the united states , however , has clung to a belief in the unqualified virtues of a free world market long after the loss of its postwar economic dominance , and despite the manifest failure of japan and europe to practice laissezfaire , either domestically or internationally the combined effect of the japanese and european revival in the 1960 s and the domestic american inflation resulting from the war in vietnam so weakened the dollar that its position as an international unit of exchange became untenable this led president richard nixon to abandon the bretton woods exchange rates agreements in 1970 the united states announced it would no longer defend the position of the dollar on international markets and no longer exchange gold for dollars henceforth , the american currency floated
qiryat arba , israelioccupied west bank , june 4 while israel has promised not to settle any of its new ethiopian immigrants in the occupied territories , nearly 200 ethiopians from the last airlift , in 1984 , say they have been trapped against their will for seven years here in the west bank s most militant jewish settlement as soon as the 14 , 100 new immigrants stepped off the planes late last month , simcha dinitz , the nation s most senior immigration official , said all of them are going to be housed in our 100 absorption centers , and none of them are in the territories mr dinitz s promise seemed to satisfy the united states and other governments that had expressed concern but here in the west bank s oldest settlement , in the heart of hebron , erez mekerit , a 22yearold soldier , and his friends are asking what about us \? mr mekerit was a part of operation moses , the secret airlift in 1984 that brought 10 , 000 ethiopian jews to israel a few months after they arrived , before any of them had got their bearings , they brought us out here , said avraham kasu , 20 , another soldier 'wo n't let us' leave and for seven years we 've been requesting to leave , mr mekerit said but they wo n't let us we do n't have any options his friend rutti kasa , 18 , a high school student , nodded at that and said everybody here wants to leave lots of people are afraid there s no place to work out here our relatives are afraid to visit us we 've been crying and complaining the whole time we 've been here but they wo n't let us go with hardly an exception , nearly all of their ethiopian neighbors agree it is not that these people are prisoners of the west bank in theory every one of them could pack up and leave qiryat arba tomorrow some of them have but the ethiopians cannot move without significant government assistance , and that has not been forthcoming spreading them across country in 1984 , as now , the ethiopian immigrants arrived in israel with few possessions , no money , little education and not much idea of how or where they should live in israel for the first year , the government made almost all of their decisions for them fed them , clothed them , found them jobs and assigned them places to live late in 1984 , after the immigrants had been in the country for about six months , the government moved them out of absorption centers and into permanent homes they had been assigned the policy then , as now , was to spread them all over the country as gad ben ari , spokesman for the jewish agency , puts it now , there was much less sensitivity about these things then so about 60 families , more than 300 people , were assigned homes in qiryat arba the mayors of some small towns in israel were complaining that they had too few apartments for their own residents' children but qiryat arba welcomed the ethiopians with open arms like all settlements , it was always eager to expand , other places do n't want them , the settlement s leader , elyakim haetzni , said at the time we 'll take all they can send us protested in 1985 when the united states learned of that early in 1985 , the reagan administration delivered an official protest to israel but yaacov tzur , the absorption minister then , assured washington that qiryat arba would not be the immigrants' final home soon the matter was forgotten and now , six years later , the ethiopians say they have been forgotten , too most of these people are not ideological few of them seem to care much about the debate over the west bank they want only to be near places of employment , close to their families one after another of them complained that their parents , brothers , sisters and others would not even visit them here they think it s like lebanon out here , mr kasu said time and time again they have put in requests to move but many are unemployed , for there is little work in the west bank and for most of those who do have jobs , the work is menial i do n't have any work i ca n't find any work out here , said eli noga , who is 34 it s pretty here the people are nice but like everyone else , i 've asked to leave i want to live with other ethiopians needs government subsidy but mr noga , like the others , lives in a governmentsubsidized apartments he would need another wherever he lived i remember that many of them did n't want to be there even in 1984 , mr ben ari said but then , he added , the division of the jewish agency involved in settling immigrants was controlled by a likud party official , a strong advocate of west bank settlement there was also a likud government of the time with mr dinitz at the head , the jewish agency is under labor party control today but now , with all the new soviet immigrants , there is a drastic housing shortage nationwide the jewish agency is a quasigovernmental organization but the government would have the largest role in trying to resettle qiryat arba s ethiopians still , the rightwing administration of prime minister yitzhak shamir , struggling to catch up with the drastic housing shortages while also eager to see the west bank s population grow , has shown no inclination to help them priority to the homeless we know they are unhappy , mr ben ari said but they already live in their housing solutions for new homes , we need to give priority to those people who are still in absorption centers and do n't have any permanent homes at all so the ethiopians say they are trapped maybe they are n't trying to keep us against our will , miss kasa said but nobody s giving us any place to go and you definitely see that they want new immigrants out here with that , she gestured behind her to a large shipping crate that had held the belongings of new neighbors , a family that had just arrived in israel the stenciled letters on the side of the box were in russian others like it are scattered among several buildings in the last two years , some of the ethiopian families with independent means have managed to move out of qiryat arba on their own and in almost every case that an apartment is vacated , miss kasa says now , russian immigrants are moving in photo nearly 200 ethiopians airlifted to israel in 1984 have been kept against their wills for seven years in qiryat arba , the west bank s most ilitant jewish settlement everybody here wants to leave , said rutti kasa , right , an 18yearold high school student we 've been crying and complaining the whole time we 've been here but they wo n't let us go miss kasa joked with friends at the settlement \( micha

the nets may ask several veterans to restructure their contracts to give the team more financial flexibility to sign kenny anderson norman blass , the attorney for sam bowie and roy hinson , said the nets have asked if either player would consider deferring some of their current salary to later seasons that would give the nets more room under the national basketball association salary cap \( 125 million \) to sign anderson , the no 2 pick in this year s draft anderson is seeking a threeyear contract worth around 35 million a season the nets' latest offer was a sixyear package worth around 22 million a season proper compensation blass said both bowie and hinson would consider renegotiating but the nets have not told blass exactly how much money they need to sign anderson blass wants to insure that both of his clients are compensated properly if they are asked to sacrifice money this season hinson is supposed to be paid 145 million this season , while bowie is scheduled to make 25 million if the nets appoached us with a reasonable offer within a framework that we considered fair , we would consider it , blass said yesterday from his manhattan office but until they know how much they need , we ca n't talk in specific terms willis reed , the nets' general manager , plans to meet with the team s owners this morning to discuss their strategy concerning anderson the nets are around 100 , 000 over the cap reed said the cap is limiting their firstyear offer to anderson , a 20yearold from queens who starred at archbishop molloy and then left georgia tech after just two seasons training camp opens oct 4 , and unless there is serious movement on both sides , anderson will not be there i think we 'll sign kenny sooner or later , but it may be later rather than sooner , reed said yesterday i'm trying to stay optimistic , but i think you can say we 're far apart asked if the nets were considering restructuring several veterans' contracts , reed said that s a possibility restructuring contracts , trades , roster moves we 're going to discuss the gamut of our options the main thing is to firmly establish a number for signing kenny that we can live with , something that s equitable , but something that we think is fair to us but what is fair \? the nets are adamant that they cannot pay anderson more than derrick coleman , the power forward who was rookie of the year last season as the no 1 pick in 1990 , coleman signed a fiveyear , 15 million contract but rookie contracts historically rise every season there is speculation that larry johnson , this year s no 1 pick , may sign a contract with the charlotte hornets worth more than 3 million a season , because charlotte is well under the cap if johnson signs for more than 3 milion , how can anderson , the no 2 pick , feel good about signing for 22 million a season \? none of this year s top 10 picks have signed , further evidence of how difficult it has become to sign rookies before training camp but both richard howell , anderson s attorney , and the nets agree that anderson would benefit from as much training camp as possible anderson must familiarize himself with the nets' system , with new teammates and with the nba meanwhile , the nets want anderson signed from a marketing standpoint he is an exciting player who is extremely popular in the new york metropolitan area , evidenced by the loud roar from the crowd in madison square garden on draft night when the nets chose anderson if anderson makes an impact this season , he will help the nets not only on the court , but also at the box office hinson , who has missed most of the last two seasons after knee surgery , is considering retirement if hinson retires , 50 percent of his salary would be exempt from the nets' payroll and bowie , who still has three seasons left on his contract , may be agreeable to deferring some of his money to a later season photo kenny anderson may not be present when the nets open camp oct 4 , unless the team can solve its salary cap problems in order to afford the rookie \( william berry \)
washington , jan 13 the environmental protection agency has rebuffed what researchers say was a white house attempt to weaken an epa report that finds health risks in household electromagnetic fields a panel of outside scientists will convene a threeday meeting in washington on monday to review the report the review is the customary last step in the preparation of the agency s scientific documents , and the group s suggestions will be incorporated into the final report when that panel was being selected last summer , the white house s science adviser , d allan bromley , sent epa officials a memorandum urging them to select some candidates from a list he provided of scientists known to believe that electromagnetic fields pose little or no risk a copy of the memorandum , which the epa in the end did not follow , was obtained by the associated press skeptics and disbelievers the researchers on dr bromley s list range from skeptics to vociferous disbelievers , said david savitz , an epidemiologist at the university of north carolina in chapel hill he has done studies on the health risks of electromagnetic fields , which are created by power lines and household electrical wiring and devices if the panel had been composed exclusively of those on the list , he said , they would predictably put less credence in the suggestions of adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields robert adair of yale university was one of dr bromley s candidates for the panel , but he agreed that the list did not represent a wide range of opinion he termed the epa s preliminary report an advocacy document , very poor scientifically , adding , i feel that anybody who thinks that was a good document is a nitwit some minds made up in the end , the panel consisted of scientists representing a broad range of scientific disciplines including biology , physics and epidemiology it also included some scientists aligned with the utility industry none of the people dr bromley proposed were selected we went over the list and discussed it with the membership committee and could n't find people who would bring objective expertise , said donald barnes of the epa s scientific advisory board they were people who had basically taken a public position mr barnes said dr bromley s candidates mostly reflected the view of some physicists that it does n't make any sense that electromagnetic fields could pose health risks sarah keegan , a spokeswoman for dr bromley , said he was unavailable for comment criticism and delay in december , e , p , a , officials said dr bromley s concerns about the report were delaying its release that brought dr bromley a rebuke from representative george e brown , a california democrat who heads the house science committee , and two other congressmen , who said the delay is more likely to fan public concern than to allay it in a second letter , the three congressmen criticized the epa for allowing crowell moring , a law firm representing utility companies , to arrange for a number of speakers to address the panel in its publiccomment period this week mr barnes said everyone who asked to speak to the panel would be allowed to speak he said the epa did not receive requests to speak from consumer groups or public interest groups the epa report , which reviews existing studies , says studies finding evidence that fields cause cancer are biologically plausible

chicago , july 16 the american medical association has announced plans to publish singletopic medical reports sponsored by drug companies the reports would include articles rejected by the journal of the american medical association and its specialty journals , transcripts of symposiums and articles from other journals that a drug company might want to send to a larger audience , the association said robert kennett , vice president for publishing at the association , said the reports , to be sent to doctors , would undergo the same review as those accepted for its journals many of the things we do not publish are good papers rejected only for lack of space , mr kennett said , adding that the reports would help finance the journals but a consumer advocate said the decision would tarnish the association s reputation dr sidney wolfe , director of public citizen , a consumer advocacy group in washington , said the association was trying to cash in on an enormous market for articles rejected by established journals or those that had not been submitted for peer review , the process by which a journal asks experts to evaluate reports grants of 25 , 000 to 150 , 000 from drug companies will pay for the reports , which may include drug advertisements but none related to the report s subject , mr kennett said
dying when she did , in 1924 at the age of 35 from scarlet fever , the russian artist liubov popova at least never had to face what befell her comrades in the avantgarde alexei gan and gustav klucis ended their lives in stalinist labor camps kazimir malevich completed his days harassed by soviet officials and in poverty popova s life , by contrast , followed a straight , vertical trajectory she is the subject of a fine retrospective at the museum of modern art , through april 23 , organized by magdalena dabrowski , an associate curator in the department of drawings \( the show will travel to los angeles , cologne and madrid \) with more than 100 of the artist s paintings , drawings , theater and textile designs , and accompanied by a catalogue for which ms dabrowski has written an essay , it is the first largescale examination in the united states of this important figure in the history of russian modernism it is also the latest in a series of events exploring that great era of early20thcentury culture the malevich retrospective that was seen last year in washington and los angeles has taken up quarters , through march 24 , in the metropolitan museum of art a popova exhibition in moscow last year dwarfed the modern s display popova is also the subject of an excellent new monograph by dmitri v sarabianov and natalia l adaskina , published by abrams and there has been more the sweeping survey called art into life russian constructivism 19141932 last summer occupied the henry art gallery in seattle , where it was organized , before traveling to the walker art center in minneapolis an important russian collection of constructivist architectural drawings was on view last year at the modern , and drawings by the constructivist architect yakov chernikhov are on display at the columbia university architecture galleries through march 9 a new book on soviet choreography of the 1920 s by elizabeth souritz was recently published by duke university press and the university of california will soon publish a book by william craft brumfield on the origins of modernism in russian architecture the opening of previously inaccessible soviet collections to american and other foreign museums has provided an irresistible opportunity to organize exhibitions of a scope that could not have been imagined even a few years ago the malevich and popova retrospectives would have been considerably different , if not impossible , without loans from the soviet union and with news of repression in the baltics and elsewhere in the soviet union dampening hopes for progress there , the glory days of the russian avantgarde and its brutal demise have taken on special poignance that extraordinary moment when the goals of the country s most advanced artists and its revolutionary leaders coincided has come to seem increasingly like a distant dream popova embodied that dream as much as any artist , and in drawing inspiration from the likes of malevich and his great rival vladimir tatlin she bridged gaps between disparate avantgarde camps her work demonstrated the close cultural ties between moscow and paris at the start of the century and the independent course that russian artists pursued in the 1910 s it also typified their extreme ambition in aiming for an abstract art whose newness would match the newness of postrevolutionary society today especially when so much of the art world is pervaded by irony and cynicism and grapples so painfully with the world of politics the boldness of the russian avantgarde can still shock the modern s popova retrospective turns out to be weak only in the area where nowadays , considering the ubiquity of political art , interest may be strongest the last few years of her life , when she , like many colleagues in the avantgarde , publicly renounced painting in favor of industrial , textile , graphic , typographic and theatrical designs the idea was to serve more directly the cause of art for the masses this facet of her work is represented in the show by a few sketches for the groundbreaking sets and costumes she designed for vsevolod meyerhold s production of the magnanimous cuckold , alongside several drawings for fabric designs and magazine and book covers \( meyerhold invited her to teach a course in set design at his school sergei eisenstein was one of her pupils \) ms dabrowski decided against models of stage sets and reconstructions of clothing of the sort that enriched the art into life show in seattle because she wanted nothing on view whose accuracy and authenticity might be questioned the resulting profile of popova as a painter first and last is not perfectly accurate but she was a gifted painter popova was no malevich , the great innovator , the artist of wideranging vision , although the two artists shared a good deal , as the current shows demonstrate they were both attracted to artists like natalia goncharova , whose garishly colored peasants provided a russian response to french postimpressionism like so many russian modernists , they both saw french cubism through the prism of italian futurism , creating for several years in the early 1910 s an art that combined elements of the two movements

the day was grand the play was grander the yankees were cruising to a convincing eightrun victory over the california angels on oldtimers' day at yankee stadium yesterday and nothing could ruin this special event george steinbrenner could have showed up the fans would have laughed don mattingly could have played first base with a boston red sox cap they would have howled even harder it was that pleasant everyone forgot that tim leary was in the bullpen the leary who lost his spot in the starting rotation and refused to accept a demotion to the minors the leary whose splitfinger fastball has deserted him that leary they should not have been laughing leary ca n't get an out leary helped turn the rout into an adventure by allowing four runs and three hits in the eighth inning when california rallied for six runs to make the game uncomfortably close the yankees then needed steve farr to quiet the angels for the final five outs before emerging with a bizarre 1210 triumph before 45 , 647 at the stadium the snowball kept getting bigger and bigger and it was rolling down the hill , said manager stump merrill we were fortunate that we found a way to stop it it got exciting there at the end it sure did and leary was more to blame than anyone he allowed a walk and three singles to the only four batters he faced to start the eighth and set up california s valiant comeback i have nothing to say , he said after the game steve howe replaced leary with the score 126 and none out he gave up a single to pinchhitter lance parrish to load the bases and , after retiring dick schofield on a fly ball , threw a wild pitch that scored dave gallagher and sliced the lead to 127 pinchhitter bobby rose then stroked a shot to left field that hensley meulens leaped for and could not catch as a few fans competed with him for the ball it was ruled that the ball had indeed cleared the fence for a threerun homer and so , amazingly , the angels had suddenly crept to 1210 then farr came to the rescue by retiring dave winfield and gary gaetti on fly balls to end the eighth farr then proceeded to the ninth , where he found himself in a state of mind that he referred to as ultimate panic luis sojo singled with two out and parrish came to bat as the tying run parrish swung and ripped a long shot to left that would have tied the score had it not curved foul it was a scare , but farr rebounded from it to strike out parrish looking that s sort of what i like , what i live for , farr said it s not legal to drive 100 miles an hour on the side of the road so this is something that keeps me living on the edge farr was not surprised he wound up pitching in a contest that stood at 124 after seven innings the fat lady had n't sung yet , he said on a day when joe dimaggio was honored with a mercedesbenz , when they hammered out 15 hits , including a pair of tworun home runs by matt nokes and another tworun shot by pat kelly , why did the yankees look so glum \? probably because the end of the story was not as satisfying as the beginning and it is not much fun seeing leary suffer he s got to keep battling , said greg cadaret , who won his first game as a starter since april 28 , 1990 , with five and onethird decent innings he has no alternative he ca n't go hide explanations for why leary was hit so hard , so quickly , were difficult to find everything he threw got hit , merrill said when nokes , the catcher , was asked if leary had trouble with his splitfinger fastball , he said , it was just i do n't know merrill said there was a possibility the club would again ask leary about going down to class aaa columbus there is a chance the yankees could release him despite the fact he is only in the first year of a threeyear , 59 million contract , but that possibility seems remote we 'll try to work with him in the bullpen and see what we can get for him along the way , merrill said it s not going to be easy that s for sure inside pitch bobby rose s home run off steve howe was the first one the pitcher has allowed since oakland s terry steinbach hit one on sept 15 , 1987 the streak spanned 34 games and 179 batters howe did not play in the majors during the last three seasons matt nokes has hit two home runs in a game three times this month chris chambliss doubled in elliott maddox to lift the b team to a 10 victory over the a team in the twoinning oldtimers' game scott kamieniecki and jim abbott , the starters for today s game , were teammates and road roommates for the university of michigan in 1986 abbott was a freshman with the focus on him because he does not have a right hand and kamieniecki was an injured senior who pitched 15 innings i was always more impressed with his character , the person he was , than his baseball talent , kamieniecki said to me , he was a great person photos mickey mantle , acknowledging ovation at yankee stadium yesterday , standing next to , from left , whitey ford , ron guidry and reggie jackson \( pg 1 \) on oldtimer s day , joe dimaggio once again brought yankee staduim spectators to their feet , and reggie jackson a single \( pg 5 \) \( barton silverman the new york times \)
willie randolph waits , but the phone does n't ring if it does , it could be the yankees calling with an offer to make randolph their everyday third baseman this season as improbable as it sounds , the yankees are discussing the possibility of bringing back randolph , not as a reserve infielder but as a regular at third , where he has never played he s been thought of , gene michael , the yankee general manager , said yesterday if we did it , we 'd look for him to be our regular third baseman i do n't know if he s the answer , but we 've been thinking about it randolph , who is still without a team or a contract , said he would be willing to accept a move to third after 15 seasons as a second baseman , 13 with the yankees i have no problem with the adjustments i 'd have to make , he said obviously , spring training would be a very important time , but getting used to third means getting used to the angles i would look forward to the challenge quest for lefty failed the yankees have been unable to acquire a lefthanded hitter to platoon with either mike blowers or randy velarde at third because they are reluctant to hand the job to either player on a fulltime basis , they are looking for someone who can handle the position regularly , which could be the 36yearold randolph , who is also righthanded although michael said there had been no final decision made regarding blowers or velarde , he did say he intended to speak soon with randolph and his agent , ron shapiro the two sides have discussed the possibility of a return by randolph for more than a month , but this is the first time michael has raised the specter of making the former yankee captain an everyday player that , more than anything else , appeals to randolph , who said he was in the best shape of his career i want to play , he said what i'm dealing with this off season is totally new to me i feel i 've got a lot to offer , but the teams i 've talked to seem to want to reduce my time talks with 3 other clubs so far , randolph said he had spoken with only three other teams the oakland athletics , the toronto blue jays and the milwaukee brewers although none offered him an everyday job he finished last season with the a s , who did not offer him arbitration , making him an unrestricted free agent he is looking for a team that will allow him to play at least 120 games this season i have n't given up yet , he said if i'm forced to do something else , i would do it because i'm forced to the feeling i'm getting from teams is that they 'd like to have me , but to do something else rather than play every day the yankees , of course , could be a viable alternative and while randolph could not provide the power that teams seek in a third baseman , he nonetheless remains a good hitter , a talented onbase player and a reliable defensive performer , even at third he said there would be no problem changing his throwing style , nor did he think he would have trouble with the longer throws he said that a move from second base to shortstop , or from third to short , would be more difficult to me , as long as you have a good , strong arm , you can do it , he said 'good worker' michael , a former infielder , also believes randolph can accomplish the move , although he may have no choice it would be a tough adjustment , but i think he could probably play there defensively , he said he s a good athlete and a good worker returning randolph to the bronx would also be a positive public relations move for the yankees he was brought up in brooklyn and lives in new jersey , and his last season in new york was 1988 , after which he left for free agency and signed with the los angeles dodgers he appeared in 26 games for the dodgers last season , then went to oakland , playing in 93 games for the a s all things being equal , randolph said i 'd definitely want to come back to the yankees regardless of what happened to me in 1988 , the yankees are still a part of me i know in my heart that i'm a yankee pact for espinoza the yankees and alvaro espinoza agreed to a oneyear contract yesterday for 610 , 000 , a raise of 325 , 000 over last season , avoiding arbitration the yankees had offered the shortstop , who batted 224 in 1990 , a salary of 500 , 000 espinoza countered with a request for 760 , 000
rebels the irish rising of 1916 by peter de rosa illustrated 536 pp new york doubleday 25 on easter monday 75 years ago , april 24 , 1916 , some 1 , 600 illarmed irish separatists seized buildings in central dublin and proclaimed a republic from the steps of the general post office the easter rising had been intended as a general insurrection , but an ensnarlment of orders , counterorders and countercounterorders had limited it to the city , and , as its leaders well knew , had sentenced it to failure we are going out to be slaughtered , one of them told a colleague the organizers the poets patrick pearse , joseph plunkett , thomas macdonagh the implacable conspirators thomas clarke and sean macdermott , the labor organizer james connolly knew that their rebellion was doomed at its end , they and 10 others were executed by firing squads in the stonebreakers' yard of kilmainham jail but for six days the rebels maintained a fierce and heroic battle against the greatly superior forces of the british crown they were relying , beyond the battle , upon the irish historic imagination , the unimaginativeness of empires and what ruth dudley edwards , in her fine biography of pearse , calls the triumph of failure at first the rising had horrified most irishmen , many of whose sons and brothers were serving in the british army in the war against germany but the sentiment changed when martial law was declared , for , as f s l lyons says in ireland since the famine , the military were bent on doing what the civil government had so signally failed to do destroy revolutionary nationalism root and branch this they attempted first by shelling the center of dublin and then by dragging out the executions over a period of more than a week you are letting loose a river of blood , the moderate nationalist john dillon warned the house of commons two days before the last of the executions , those of macdermott and of the wounded connolly , who was strapped to a chair because he could not stand in a letter not quoted in rebels , the portrait painter john butler yeats wrote to his daughter these men are now embalmed in the irish memory , and hatred of england , which might have died out , is now revived kept alive in prison , ireland would have pitied and loved and smiled at these men , knowing them to be mad fools but it was left to yeats s son , in easter 1916 , to give the rebels' transformation to martyrdom its most celebrated expression i write it out in a verse macdonagh and macbride and connolly and pearse now and in time to be , wherever green is worn , are changed , changed utterly a terrible beauty is born by october 1920 , when william butler yeats s poem was first given a public printing , ireland was in the midst of a guerrilla war inspired partly by the cult of the easter rising terence macswiney , an irish republican army commandant , lay dying on a hunger strike in a london prison , and an 18yearold ira soldier , kevin barry , awaited the gallows in dublin as pearse had said at the graveside of the aged rebel jeremiah o 'donovan rossa a year before the rising , so the young soldiers could have said of pearse four years after life springs from death and from the graves of patriot men and women spring living nations the rising , tragic in its own terms and crucial to the history of modern ireland , has garnered a small library of both scholarly and popular narrative and analysis , not to mention the devotional literature of the cult in the 1960 s alone , three reliable , hourbyhour accounts were published the easter rebellion by max caulfield , agony at easter by thomas coffey , and six days to shake an empire by charles duff none rises above the level of vivid popular history all are preferable to peter de rosa s rebels the irish rising of 1916 mr de rosa , the author of vicars of christ and formerly the dean of theology at corpus christi college in london , dedicates rebels to irish people everywhere with profound respect and begins with a declaration of principle rebels is not faction , still less is it fiction this is a true story , but so extraordinary that it is only believable because it happened with talleyrand , i say , 'je ne blame , ni n'approuve je raconte , ' 'i blame not , i approve not i merely tell a tale' the foreboding roused by this heady combination of the bathetic and the fatuous is borne out by the rest of the book for instance , when the old rebel o 'donovan rossa died in new york city , the decision to return his body to ireland was made by john devoy , his fellow exile , and according to mr de rosa was expressed thus why not send the old bugger home \? in plain fact , devoy was an old man himself and had always regarded rossa with affection and respect if this quotation is neither faction nor fiction , some other word must be found , and fact will not serve mr de rosa deals with the conspirator tom clarke in a similar way since clarke had served a long sentence in a prison in england , and had lived in america before settling in ireland , mr de rosa has him estimating pearse s capabilities in words that strive to fuse the three national varieties of english too many rebels funk the ultimate test pearse ai n't one of them under that schoolmasterly exterior , i reckon , is a spine of steel clarke is supposed to have spoken thus to sean macdermott , and there is reason to believe that this was his judgment , but de rosa does not tell us which of the notoriously tightlipped conspirators chose to preserve clarke s words for posterity , or how rebels is furnished with photographs , maps , a select bibliography and an elaborate index perhaps advisedly , though , it lacks footnotes mr de rosa s method is to take a fact and hammer it into a cartoon thus pearse , evaluating the moderate john macneill , thinks him capable of chickening out constance markievicz , an angloirish gentlewoman who had espoused the rebel cause , never appears without cries of old bean , absolutely spiffing , dear old darling , old chaps , and other utterances supposed by mr de rosa to be appropriate to her social rank a halfblind rebel lad asks her permission to fire and she helpfully points his rifle in the direction of the shelbourne hotel , saying the enemies of arland , sonnie , are over thar , and i reckon you have as much right as anyone to take a few potshots at 'em it may seem impolite to cavil at mr de rosa s verbal ineptitude , from which the heavens themselves are not safe the sun went down in glory as though it had been dynamited , leaving a grapepurple glow in the sky his tin ear prevents him from listening to the story he is telling and gaining a sense of its historical and moral complexities here is a judgment of pearse the mystical element in him , his lyrical lunacy could not be reached he probably dreamed in his dreams he wanted to make necklaces out of dewdrops , carve statues out of clouds these thoughts are attributed to michael joseph o'rahilly , who initially had sought to prevent the rising , but then , in a characteristically chivalrous and reckless act , joined it , and was shot dead leading a final lost charge out of the post office there is no reason to imagine he thought of pearse in such vulgar and grotesque terms there is also no need for mr de rosa either to blame or to approve , but he seems not to know that there is no such thing as merely telling a tale to be told , a tale must be understood and the understanding expressed the teller must know the shape and weight and color of the words he uses to tell it at one point mr de rosa describes john o 'reilly , who served in the rebels' city hall garrison , as a spindly giant of a man it may be said that he himself has written a spindly giant of a book he has taken a magnificent if ofttold tale , and transformed it into a puppet show whose figures move jerkily across the stage and are made to speak in eerie and uncouth tongues if this is the way he displays his profound respect for the irish people , then may the blessed saints in heaven , as he might phrase it , shield them from his scorn photo the labor organizer james connolly , who was wxecuted for his part in the irish uprising of 1916 \( from rebels \) \( pg 10 \)

east aurora , ny a glass of beer and the family of a high school quarterback have forced this town to confront issues of teenage drinking that many communities fail to recognize or choose to ignore it began on labor day , when an assistant coach of the town s high school football team saw the quarterback , matthew j plauman , 17 years old , drinking a beer at a fire department picnic and reported him to school officials , who decided to enforce the rule that a student caught drinking be banned from athletic teams for an entire season mr plauman s father , incensed that his son was being singled out when drinking among high school athletes was as common as afterschool cruising down main street , supplied school officials with a list of other athletes who had attended a drinking party along with his daughter the list led the school superintendent to suspend seven other members of the 33player football team , along with the quarterback , for the season the eight admitted they violated school training rules by drinking , but their punishment set off a storm of publicity in footballloving western new york and split this town of 7 , 000 on the outskirts of buffalo around the buffalo area , residents argue about just how prevalent teenage drinking is and how it should be dealt with buffalo area radio talk shows , television news programs and newspaper pages here have been full of debates over whether east aurora punished the drinking athletes too sternly or not sternly enough this has really tripped people s triggers , said j r gash , host of a radio talk show in buffalo that dedicated two days to the east aurora controversy the reaction has been total and complete passionate interest many people here as well as nationally recognized experts on teenage drinking say east aurora is unusual only because the link to football made this town s selfexamination of especially public alcohol is rampant in high schools east , west , rural , big city , it does n't matter where , said judy shelton , the chairwoman of the chemical health committee of the new york state public high school athletic association , which governs the state s school sports programs east aurora is no different than anywhere else it s football , mr gash noted it s taking the moral high ground it s , should a kid have his opportunities for a football scholarship ruined for one minor indescretion \? ' according to some national studies , more than 90 percent of high school students have tried liquor by their senior year and nearly a third said they had had five or more drinks in the two weeks before being polled several high school students said the football players' suspension and resulting furor have forced people to talk about the secret saturday night world of teenagers some still in junior high in a onemoviehouse town all the people in the town are just opening up their eyes to it now , said michael hammond , 17 , a suspended player who said that he drinks at parties every weekend and that someone gets drunk at almost every party the younger kids do it just because they want to be like the older kids , mr hammond said the older kids do it because it s the social thing to do they want to be like the adults mr plauman , the quarterback whose labor day beer began the controversy , said , the way i look at it , in this town there s not much else to do after you 've seen the movie once , what are you going to do , see it three times \? usually , every weekend , you can find a party in east aurora mr plauman s father , frederick c plauman , said he thought it was unfair of school officials to ruin his son s chance at an athletic scholarship when so many of his teammates also drank that belief led him to draw up the list of athletes who attended another labor day party where alcohol was served it also led the family to file a lawsuit against the school board , challenging the severity of the punishment and the state liquor authority is investigating matthew plauman s assertion that he was allowed to drink beer by the fire company sale of liquor to people under 21 is illegal in new york rule being reviewed east aurora s school superintendent , robert fort , said the plaumans were trying to force the town to choose between enforcing its nodrinking rule and having its football season ruined mr fort and the school board decided to stand by the rule , which they are reviewing to see if it needs to be changed in the event of future cases some school districts have training rules that are less stringent than east aurora s , including a one or twogame suspension for a player caught drinking other districts impose harsher penalties , like suspension from all school sports for a year parents of some of the other suspended athletes and other residents have pleaded with the school board to reduce the punishment , though none of them have yet joined the plauman suit charging that the school board abused its discretion the suit contends that the school board unfairly imposed the same harsh penalty on those who told the truth about alcohol use as on repeat offenders who routinely lie about their habit a state supreme court justice , robert whelan , has so far refused to intervene but the plaumans are due back in court on tuesday , seeking to have their son play while they appeal some residents here said the controversy has been helpful because it has opened discussion of what has been hidden too long but some , like the episcopal minister here , michael e hartney , said the issue has been blown out of proportion by buffalo news organizations intent on giving a black eye to a comfortable town and by some of east aurora s own children boasting , he said , is a part of being in high school i just do n't believe it and some residents have said the town is lucky that its catharsis was provoked by football and not , as in nearby cheektowaga last year , by the deaths in an automobile crash of four high school students who had been drinking , including two football players and a cheerleader an uncomfortable test we have a serious problem with our youth drinking , much more serious than the majority of you think , wrote one area resident , dawn m matot , in a letter published last week in the east aurora advertiser many of those caught in the battle said the controversy has been an uncomfortable test mr fort , the school superintendent , said he has been distressed by the heat generated over an athletic issue that would seldom accompany an academic issue terry j grajek , the school board president , said the whole town has had to confront its views of such normally private issues as discipline i do n't like having to go through this , she said , because it s tearing the community apart there are some rifts that are going to take a long time to heal but it s important to say it s ok to stand by your values the other day , as he drove his chevrolet down main street , matthew plauman was trying to sort out what exactly are the values of the adult world he knows he misses football , but even when it comes to the sport he cherishes , the messages he is getting are confusing when you watch a football game , he said , what s the commercial you see \?

trenton , nov 7 the newly elected republicans descended on the state house this week to proclaim loudly and clearly that they carried a very big axe the overwhelming will of the electorate to cut taxes the voters finally had their say on the governor s 28 billion tax package , said the assembly republican leader , garabed \( chuck \) haytaian , who will become speaker when the new majority takes over in january the people want the legislature to cut their taxes and reduce the size of government a second republican message was not as loud but equally clear the tax cuts will not be big , they will not be soon and they will not be easy mr haytaian and other republicans conceded that they would cut only 590 million , less than a quarter of the 28 billion increase pushed through a democratic legislature by gov jim florio 16 months ago they will not do so before next july , and they have not said how they can do even that without devastating an already reduced state government formidable shortfall the problems they face are formidable even without a tax cut or a dime s growth in spending , the shortfall in the budget for the year beginning july 1 , 1992 , will be at least 550 million that is true because the state has already instituted two oneshot revenue producers it cannot use again , the sale of a state road to the turnpike authority for 400 million and accelerated utilitiestax collections that added 150 million in revenues this year if the republicans cut the sales tax , as they say they will , that will add 590 million to the potential deficit , bringing the total to almost 12 billion making up such a huge shortfall will not be easy sagging revenues have already forced the florio adminstration to cut spending , and 5 , 000 state jobs have been eliminated through attrition , early retirements and layoffs by july 1992 , when the proposed tax cut would take effect , an additional 3 , 000 jobs will have been cut , andthe state workforce will have been reduced more than 10 percent , from 73 , 000 65 , 000 if payroll savings had to make up the 590 million in revenue losses produced by the sales tax cut , an additional 17 , 000 jobs would have to be eliminated to make up the entire 12 billion deficit would require the elimination of twice that many jobs , more than half the existing work force mr haytaian and other republicans have said that downsizing government is a priority , but they have not been specific about numbers robert pursell , the new jersey director of the communications workers of america , which represents about 38 , 000 state employees , said the union is extremely worried about cutting taxes without replacing the revenues , but has not decided on a course of action if a tax cut forces further layoffs a sizable expenditure the republicans have said they will reduce but by no means eliminate is the 700 million the florio administration spent on propertytax rebates , a staple of new jersey government and politics for 14 years mr florio expanded the program , more than doubling its 305 million cost , and included renters for the first time republicans say they will revise the rebates but have provided no specifics beyond saying that mr florio had changed a property tax relief program into an income redistribution program mr haytaian and john h dorsey , who will be the republican majority leader , say that while the total elimination of the popular rebate program is not in the cards , substantial cuts are possible but even if the program is cut in half the savings would amount to only 350 million , less than a third of the potential 12 billion deficit and the political costs would be substantial , perhaps prohibitive when a republican lawmaker suggested deferring the rebates this year , governor florio described it as a vampire of an idea that should have a stake driven through its heart the republicans backed off another rich but politically volatile area for savings and one the courts may rule is untouchable is the governor s quality education act , which has already gone through a substantial revision on the ground that it was too costly the original act , which became known as qea i , mandated new aid to poor and middleincome school districts totalling 11billion it necessitated the increase in the income tax that went along with the sales tax rise when it became clear that if all the money went to the schools none would be left to fund the propertytax rebates on which the democrats pinned their political futures , they voted to take back 360million and impose spending caps on the schools , which eliminated an additional 229million the combination of the takeback and the spending caps so infuriated the education establishment that the teachers union , the new jersey education assocation , for the first time in memory endorsed a slate of virtually all republicans now , those same republicans are looking at the possibility of revising the formula once again , possibly achieving some savings but beyond the firestorm that would result among educators and parents , the education act is now bound up in a lawsuit that could prevent any of the money even that taken away by the democrats from being diverted education money untouchable beyond even that , there is still another problem the money earmarked for the education act came solely from the income tax , and any effort to use even a nickel of it to offset any general fund losses , like the one that would result from a salestax cut , would be unlawful beyond these bigticket items , there are possibilities for smaller cuts one is phasing out the staterun system of auto inspections in favor of a private system that would most likely result in much higher costs to motorists there are also politically and educationally unadvisable cutbacks in higher education and myriad other programs , each with its own defenders and none easy to cut or drop but , mr haytaian pledged , the sales tax increase will be rolled back , and whatever it takes , we will balance the budget , as required by law
washington during the last 20 years of his life , in his studio home alongside the family house in prout s neck , me , winslow homer painted between 20 and 30 seascapes that changed american art and made him a near mythic figure these paintings are remarkable , as original in their own american way as the landscapes monet and cezanne were painting at the same time in france like these french artists , homer escaped the city and devoted himself to observing and exploring a landscape he loved like them , he found in nature a dynamic relationship between permanence and change alongside his seascapes , much of the other american painting between 1890 and 1910 when homer died , at age 74 seems predictable and limited these seascapes are the subjects of two related but very different shows one , at the national museum of american art , documents homer s life in prout s neck and surveys the kinds of painting he made under its spell the other , at the corcoran gallery of art , offers some of the strongest passages of the homer epic and examines its effect on subsequent generations of american painters the two shows underline the importance of one of the most reclusive , taciturn and imposing of american artists they suggest how many sides there are to his work and how conflicted and yet resolved it is homer was a realist , but he was also a symbolist \( in his expressive and psychological use of color \) , a classicist \( in his feeling for geometry \) and a romantic \( in his interest in big emotions and ability to paint them so that others could experience them with him \) winslow homer in the 1890 s prout s neck observed , at the national museum of american art , was organized by patricia junker for the memorial art gallery of the university of rochester , where she is curator of american art the exhibition includes 15 paintings , 13 works on paper and 18 photographs of homer and his surroundings in maine \( after closing on may 27 , the exhibition travels to the sterling and francine clark art institute in williamstown , mass \) some of the paintings are quiet and gentle , almost pretty some are raw the dark , crawling , cauldronlike coast of maine is almost hellish the fisher girl , with its youthful , attractive , cliffsolid woman staring into the fog , encourages the viewer to wait , like the woman , for something to happen in west wind , the most tonal painting in either show , a woman is making her way down a cliff in a gale alongside a soupbrown , taunting sky and a whitehot sea reckoning with winslow homer his late paintings and their influence \( at the corcoran through may 12 \) is in every way a bigger show organized by bruce robertson for the cleveland museum of art , where he is an assistant curator , it includes 15 homer oil paintings and 43 paintings by john sloan , george bellows , john marin , marsden hartley and others the homers here are generally rougher and more turbulent than those in prout s neck observed , more indicative of homer s wish to make paintings that not only record but also breathe the grandeur of nature homer had the rare ability to sympathize with almost everything without being sentimental as opposed to mid19thcentury american landscape painting , almost everything in his seascapes seems to have a character of its own because of the diverse brushwork and color , seaweed , spume , stone and sky retain their individuality you can feel the waves pounding the shore and the shore being pounded you are always aware of the absolute difference and bond between shore , air and sea like monet s series paintings of the 1890 s , many of which were linked in imagery to french history and identity , homer s seascapes are filled with nationalistic meaning in his consistently fresh and insightful catalogue to the corcoran show , mr robertson discusses the late19thcentury obsession with being american and how homer s seascapes helped define what american meant for many admirers , homer embodied the virility , energy , stoicism and artlessness that distinguished america from europe , particularly france his seascapes have little of the softness , and almost none of the feeling for leisure , found in french impressionism homer described the calm sea that was a common feature in french and american impressionist painting as that duck pond there is no dead time and no frivolity in homer s seascapes people either wait in anxious and unknowing anticipation , or the moment they inhabit occupies them so completely that it seems emotionally filled homer had the courage to look ultimate realities in the face the most famous painting in these two shows is right and left \( at the corcoran \) from a boat in the background of a stormy sea , an almost invisible hunter fires a shotgun toward us in contrast , his victims , two ducks that have just been hit by his pellets , are large and distinct both are between life and death while one duck s feet try to grip space , its head has begun to pitch into the sea while the legs of the other duck have gone limp , the body is still trying to fly we are looking at that instant when it knows it is dead but has not yet died
pink slips are no longer the rosy hue they used to be six thousand new york city municipal employees are getting pink slips this week in other words , they are being laid off but none will literally receive a pink slip uniformed sanitation workers have been getting their notices through a teletype in the garages around the city where they are assigned anne canty , a sanitation department aide , said that while termination by telex might seem insensitive , it is the traditional way to send messages to the department s uniformed workers another 178 provisional sanitation workers and 98 fulltime civil service employees were notified by their immediate superiors and given letters signed by gordon keit , the department s director of personnel to soften the impersonal effect of notification by teletype , the uniformed workers , too , will receive letters from mr keit the 2 , 700 health and hospitals corporation workers to be laid off are being given letters by their supervisors we want it to come from someone they know and work with , an aide said no one is sure where the term pink slip originated , but it seems to be a holdover from the days when workers were paid in cash each week s wages came in an envelope and anyone being laid off would find a notice the reviled pink slip in the envelope along with his final wages the pink slip had an ominous air about it because , in the days before union contracts , it could and usually did arrive unexpectedly the earliest reference to the pink slip that the editors of the random house dictionary could find was 1910 the oxford english dictionary found nothing before 1923 but noted that it has also turned up as a verb and cites a line in thomas pynchon s 1966 novel crying of lot , which states his wife had left him the day after he was pinkslipped
tokyo the tokyo stock market is finally recovering from a vicious yearlong plunge , wall street is showing signs of a rejuvenation and , most important , financial systems around the globe are being deregulated it would seem to be a time of fresh opportunity , yet yoshihisa tabuchi , the most powerful individual in japan s financial markets , speaks like a troubled man over the past few years , we may have overemphasized the positive side of all the changes taking place , said mr tabuchi , president and chief executive of the nomura securities company , the world s largest brokerage house there was a relatively small amount of discussion of the negative side , the limits that we would face especially when i look at the american financial markets , i see confusion indeed , even for a formidable global colossus like nomura it has a staggering 147 billion in equity behind it , fourandahalf times as much as merrill lynch company , america s largest brokerage house these are trying times the firm s profits are expected to plunge up to 60 percent in the fiscal year ending march 31 , from 21 billion the previous year the performance is expected to be better than nomura s japanese rivals , the other members of the socalled big four all were battered by the market plunge , set off by a steep rise in interest rates and then iraq s invasion of kuwait but that is scant comfort since none of the others daiwa , nikko and yamaichi has set its sights as high , or taken such bold steps to become a global financial supermarket nomura s dominant position in many businesses is under siege , too for instance , it retained its no 1 ranking last year for underwritings in the euromarket , the fourth straight year it has held the top spot but its market share was slashed almost in half , to less than 9 percent in tokyo , it was late in taking up the newest imported fad , computerized program trading , and thus finds itself a distant fourth in the lucrative activity behind three american securities houses worried and ambivalent the firm s challenges run much deeper than a bad year , however , and that is what worries the 58yearold mr tabuchi , who became chief executive in 1985 securities executives have long claimed their business thrives on change , and fundamental shifts are indeed gripping the financial world but mr tabuchi expressed a thoroughly ambivalent attitude toward those prospects while fighting to instill new thinking at nomura , where he has spent his entire 35year career , mr tabuchi is resisting mightily the fundamental liberalization of the heavily regulated tokyo financial markets , the source of nomura s raw power it is a contradiction that speaks volumes about nomura it also provides a sobering insight into how elusive a goal globalization , in which nomura had been expected to take a lead , is proving there are two types of deregulation being debated here one is to permit the use of new financial products and to ease outmoded controls , such as those on interest rates the other type , lowering the rigid barriers that limit competition between different kinds of financial institutions , is much more threatening japanese trust banks , commercial banks and longterm credit banks cannot invade each others' turf , and thus enjoy cartellike benefits more important , japanese banks are prohibited from entering most areas of the securities business as in the united states those days appear to be ending , however in a historic move , treasury secretary nicholas f brady early last month proposed scrapping the wall separating the two financial areas in the united states japan s finance ministry has also made it clear that , in one form or another , it intends to force nomura and the other securities houses to share their cozy domain with japan s giant banks , perhaps by 1993 question of ethics nomura is fighting hard against that threat , warning of the damage liberalization has allegedly caused during the course of deregulation and financial innovation , people tended to forget about the ethics of the market , mr tabuchi said whatever new business you do you must remember to protect your customers and investors but the tendency was for players to forget these ethics for their own immediate profits the desirable approach is not to ask who does what and who is not supposed to do what , but how efficient and how convenient the new financial system will be having said that , mr tabuchi added , in a telling afterthought , further deregulation of new financial products should progress that is an entirely different issue , how to innovate and make these new securities available to investors mr tabuchi issued his brooding , if ambiguous , verdicts in firm but measured tones , puffing on one cigarette after another in an executive suite that lies on the most elite plane in japan s securities world the whisperquiet hallways at nomura s squat brick headquarters are elegantly hung with chagalls and corots there is an air of haughty selfassurance , for few japanese companies dominate their business as nomura does
algiers , dec 23 oil prices have plunged deeply since opec last met at the end of november , bringing tension within the cartel to a crucial stage with prices now down 5 a barrel since then , to around 17 a barrel , algeria called today for an emergency meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting countries itwarned that if the group did not trim its production by at least two million barrels a day soon , prices could tumble further , to 10 a barrel , under the combined impact of worsening recession in the united states and other industrialized countries and the organization s runaway production but so far saudi arabia , by far opec s largest producer , has opposed an emergency meeting and resisted appeals to reduce its enormous production of 85 million barrels a day , or 35 percent of opec s output , arguing that the unexpected oil price plunge resulted from the actions of market speculators today the nicosiabased oil newsletter , the middle east economic survey , quoted senior saudi officials as having given a negative reply to an inquiry about an emergency opec meeting by the group ss president , jibril amino , the oil minister of nigeria , who polled the group s 13 members speaking in an interview here today , algeria s energy minister , nordine ait laoussine , said , we think the organization should move immediately to cut its production by at least 10 percent otherwise we will face an even greater collapse , which none of us can afford nigeria , iran and libya have also expressed alarm over the impact of the fall in their anticipated revenues because of the oil price decline analysts and industry officials fear that unless action is taken to trim production , currently 24 million barrels a day , prices may touch record lows in the spring , particularly because earlier expectations of a quick end to recession and strong winter demand for oil have failed to materialize market speculation can move prices by 1 a barrel one way or the other , but a fall of 5 a barrel over a few weeks indicates a much more structural problem , mr ait laoussine said the price of north sea brent crude , a benchmark for oil prices , has fallen from 2250 a barrel in early november , before opec met in vienna , to 1740 a barrel just before last weekend the opec average oil price has fallen too , from close to 21 a barrel to around 16 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange light , sweet crude oil has fallen from about 23 a barrel in early november to as low as 1830 in trading today such a fall in price was supposed to happen in the spring , not now , said peter gignoux , chief oil trader in london for shearson lehman hutton for this time of year , 17 a barrel is a very low price not viewed as critical saudi arabia continues to maintain that while it is not in favor of very low oil prices , it does not see the present situation as critical a majority of oil experts and industry executives , however , maintain that the price drop is highly unusual , because winter demand normally lifts oil prices they also say that the depth of the recession has combined with a steady rise in production to depress prices this goes against all the rosy predictions of higher prices by opec during its november meeting , john h lichtblau , president of the petroleum industry research foundation in new york , said in a telephone interview it is a big and surprising fall in oil prices by any standards , this is dramatic but saudi arabia , venezuela and the united arab emirates , which significantly increased their output after the persian gulf crisis , have been reluctant to consider a rollback in output or an emergency opec meeting , which by itself could raise prices some political analysts say their reluctance carries political dimensions that it may reflect the desire of some producers not to take measures that would help oil producers that were viewed as having sympathized with iraq during the gulf crisis , like algeria and libya but mr ait laoussine of algeria cites facts in arguing for a price increase we are far below the opec price target of 21 a barrel , he said there are indications that the recession in industrialized countries like the united states , western europe and even in japan is going to get worse it is clear that certain opec countries have been too optimistic in their forecasts he also noted that the oil production and exports of the former soviet union s various republics had steadied despite the political chaos there he also noted that there is a chance that iraq may resume exporting oil in the next quarter , further adding to the oversupply of the market iraq will meet with united nations representatives in early january to consider ending the embargo on its oil exports imposed in august 1990 , after it invaded kuwait moreoever , mr gignoux of shearson lehman hutton said , the united states , whose oil output has dropped to 75 million barrels a day , is drowning in oil inventories none of these facts coincide with opec s calculations of just a few weeks ago , which counted heavily on continued shortages of oil to justify the fact that the group was pumping oil at maximum capacity opec s economic experts expected that oil demand would drop by early february and had scheduled a meeting for the group s market monitoring committee on feb 12 in geneva to take stock of the situation but events seem to have overtaken these assumptions experts now say if opec does not act earlier , it risks seeing oil prices closer to 10 a barrel by february , which would bring prices to the lowest level since they crashed in 1986 to between 8 and 10 a barrel
trenton , oct 30 republicans have their best chance in 20 years to capture both houses of the new jersey legislature one sign of their confidence is that they have already begun fighting among themselves over who will lead them should they take over democrats now hold a sixseat margin in each house of the legislature but the republicans think they can persuade voters to change that on tuesday by striking back at the legislators who helped gov jim florio pass an unpopular 28 billion taxincrease package last year they have already begun a wellfinanced and unusually public contest for the leadership of the senate that will influence not only the direction of the republican party , but also how the state will function if the governor is a democrat and republicans control the legislature lining up support the current senate minority leader , john h dorsey , and senator donald t difrancesco have both spent weeks trying to line up support , wooing some republican candidates with thousands of dollars in contributions and coaxing others with promises of committee chairmanships ordinarily , said a senior republican official , republican leadership in the senate would mean nothing , except this year there is a brass ring to grab at , possibly the majority leadership at stake in the senate is the most powerful elected office in new jersey after the governor s the senate president is acting governor whenever the governor travels out of the state , and the control of the legislative agenda gives the senate leader the final say on which legislation gets voted on long knives come out at times like this , said the republican official it s not ideology , it s personality it has to do with camps nearly a dozen republican politicians , consultants and executives interviewed during the last week eagerly discussed the struggle over the senate leadership but fearing retribution or citing party loyalty , none of them wanted to be quoted by name mr difrancesco , a 46yearold lawyer who has served in the senate since 1979 , is being supported by a moderate faction of the state party that includes former gov thomas h kean mr dorsey , 53 , a senator since 1981 and minority leader since 1989 , is part of a more conservative bloc and was a sometimes strident critic of mr kean during the governor s two terms both men are expected to win reelection easily on tuesday mr dorsey , whose morris county district is heavily republican , faces a democratic opponent , adele montgomery mr difrancesco s only challenger is a populist party candidate , john l kucek beyond the ideological and personality issues that might influence support for either man in the senate leadership battle is the question of how a republicancontrolled legislature would want to deal with mr florio it is believed that mr dorsey would be more confrontational he is described by one aide as a takenoprisoners kind of guy a senior republican state official said he was combative , even with republican colleagues mr difrancesco is seen as more conciliatory , republican colleagues said dorsey may have edge republicans who are watching the race say that mr dorsey may have a slight advantage because he is the incumbent minority leader he survived an attempt by mr difrancesco to unseat him as minority leader last december , an effort that was pushed by what one republican official called the keanite faction of the party , a reference to mr kean and his continued influence if mr dorsey can lead republicans to a senate majority , it would only enhance his position failing to name him majority leader , said a republican consultant , would be like tossing eisenhower out after dday republicans are expected to caucus several days after next week s election to choose their senate leader and party officials say it appears that the contest is a dead heat when it comes to support from incumbent republicans the swing vote is going to be the incoming republicans , and dorsey and difrancesco are on these guys like a rash , said the consultant democrats now control the senate 2317 they have a 4337 advantage in the general assembly , where no challenge has developed to assemblyman garabed \( chuck \) haytaian , who has been minority leader since 1990 mr haytaian , who represents parts of the northern new jersey counties of sussex and warren , served as majority leader in the 1986 and 1988 legislative sessions when the republicans last controlled the house campaign contributions since they have not had to concentrate on their own races , mr dorsey and mr difrancesco have spent much of the campaign season on the stump with other candidates for the senate while doling out more than 50 , 000 each in contributions mr dorsey has been drawing on state party funds , while mr difrancesco has tapped his personal campaign coffers andrew ciesla , making his first bid for statewide office , found himself overwhelmed with offers of help from both candidates in his race for the ocean county senate seat that had been vacated by the democratic incumbent , john f russo he received 9 , 000 from mr dorsey and then mr difrancesco weighed in with 7 , 500 and both men have campaigned with him they have not exercised any undue influence on me to date , mr ciesla said , but obviously each has an agenda he said he had not decided whom to support for republican senate leadership if he is elected to the senate surprised by challenge several leading republicans said they were surprised by mr difrancesco s outright challenge to mr dorsey generally , everyone else concedes the fund raising and the campaign organization to the minority leader , but difrancesco has been running on parallel tracks , said a republican consultant mr dorsey has said he will run again for the republican leadership in the senate his confidants say that if the republicans take the senate , mr dorsey believes he will have earned the right to be senate president he has not commented publicly on the challenge from mr difrancesco but one of mr dorsey s closest advisers said the minority leader was surprised and upset over how close mr difrancesco came to unseating him in a challenge last december and over how openly mr difrancesco has been campaigning to unseat him it s almost like deciding who will run the conquered country before the invasion has occurred , said the republican consultant mr difrancesco said his actions , to date , have all been geared toward helping mr dorsey elect a republican majority in the senate until then , i'm going to be a team player , said mr difrancesco , who was minority leader from 1982 to 1984 certainly people know that i 've always wanted to be in leadership in the majority it s not like i'm throwing mr dorsey out of a position , because no one has it
when the declarer is establishing a suit in a notrump contract , it does not occur to the average defender that it might be right to help him do it it occurred to west , who is not an average defender , on the diagramed deal from the goldman pairs in manhattan in may sitting west , defending three notrump , was karen allison of newark , who has represented canada in the open division of the world team olympiad she led a spade , and east was allowed to win with the ten the next spade was won with the ace in dummy , and a club finesse lost to the queen the normal defense , followed at other tables where the same situation arose , was for west to persevere with spades but he was then in trouble when south won and played a club to the ace west was able to cash his spade winner , but then had to break a red suit the best he could do was to lead a diamond south was able to win with the ten , cash a winner in each minor suit , and cross to the heart ace the ending was diagram now the lead of the last club from the dummy forced a heart discard from west , and south knew what to do he led to the heart king at the 12th trick to make his game , since west s reluctance to lead the suit earlier indicated that he held the queen but none of this happened to allison when she won the club queen at the third trick she carefully cashed the ace before leading another spade this gave south his club winners but beat the contract the endplay and squeeze possibility that developed at other tables disappeared drawing
as the 1966 season approached , george allen was the los angeles rams' new coach , but george halas was still steaming halas had won a bitter court judgment that ordered allen to remain as the chicago bears' defensive coordinator with the validity of the bears' contract upheld , halas set allen free to take the rams' job , which allen had pursued without the bears' permission but now , at a national football league owners meeting , the papa bear was growling george allen is a liar ! halas said george allen is a cheat ! george allen is full of chicanery ! across the table , dan reeves , then the rams' owner , was starting to squirm until vince lombardi turned to him dan , the green bay packers' coach and general manager said , i think you 've got yourself a winning coach in the laughter , even halas and reeves smiled but in george allen s dozen seasons as an nfl coach , seven with the washington redskins after five with the rams , both assessments would be accurate allen was fined 5 , 000 for trading draft choices he did n't own he assigned a spy who was caught by the dallas cowboys he denied the identity of his son bruce to avoid a penalty for insulting an official from the sideline that kid s not with us , allen told the official he must be one of those people the eagles gave us as ballboys but for all his foibles , if not because of them , george allen who will be buried today after having died of a heart spasm monday , at age 72 was a winning coach who knew how to construct a winning team with winning players in swapping draft choices to put together his over the hill gang in washington , he preferred experience to potential the future , he liked to say , is now although none of his teams ever won the super bowl \( his 1972 redskins lost to the 170 miami dolphins , 147 \) , each finished the regular season with a winning record , the best an impressive 1112 and twice no worse than 86 of those nfl coaches with at least 100 victories , including postseason games , allen , with a 681 winning percentage \( 118545 \) , ranks fourth behind lombardi \( 740 \) , john madden \( 731 \) and don shula \( 683 \) even so , george allen wandered through the last decade of his life as a coach without an nfl team yes , he coached chicago and phoenix in the united states football league for two seasons he was chairman of the president s council on physical fitness and last season he coached long beach state to a 65 record after an 03 start begun by a 590 loss to clemson but he yearned to coach in the nfl again , and never did why \? in alienating the three club owners who dismissed him because of his obsession for authority and spending , george allen also alienated other club owners who might have hired him in ending allen s first term with the rams after the 1969 season , dan reeves said , i had more fun losing in dismissing allen , who would n't accept a 1 million , fouryear contract offer throughout the 1977 season , the redskin president , edward bennett williams , said , i gave george unlimited patience and he exhausted it in earlier years , williams had said , i gave george an unlimited budget and he exceeded it in ending allen s second term with the rams after only two preseason games in 1978 , carroll rosenbloom said , i made a serious error of judgment in believing george could work within our framework for all of allen s winning seasons , many club owners did n't think he now was worth the annoyance , the expense , the departure of draft choices and the challenge to their authority some owners considered hiring him , but none did allen was obsessed with football , especially with the play of his defensive units he popularized the coaching trend of 16hour days he sometimes slept at the redskin park complex he designed i think the reason george likes ice cream , his wife , etty , once said , is because he does n't have to chew it chewing would take away his concentration from football before super bowl vii , he had an aide check the sun s angle at the los angeles coliseum during game hours for team meetings on road trips , he demanded new chalk , new erasers and a room temperature of 64 degrees to keep the players alert leisure time , he once said , is the five or six hours when you sleep at night but his obsession also created his legacy in reviving the redskins as a super bowl contender and cultivating the friendship of president richard m nixon , who occasionally visited redskin practices , he created an enduring romance with pro football in the nation s capital and when george allen died , he could n't have been happier as the long beach state coach , he had had a winning season photo george allen \( associated press , 1971 \)
washington tuesday s carbombings in athens that wounded the turkish ambassador to greece violently illustrated the continuing strife between the two nations two days later , president bush told the greek parliament that none of us should accept the status quo in cyprus to reach a settlement , he must live by his words , and risk fraying his excellent relationship with turkish president turgut ozal mr bush has several reasons to get involved in the 17 yearold occupation the most dramatic is to avert the possibily of fullscale hostilities between two nato allies greece and turkey almost went to war in 1974 and 1987 the eruption of the cyprus conflict could destabilize a region that sits uneasily between the middle east and the baltics fortunately , compared to other regional conflicts , the cypriot situation appears solvable greekcypriot president george vassiliou has promoted a reasonable settlement in which turkishcypriots \( 18 percent of the population \) would enjoy greater political power than their numbers would warrant in exchange , vassiliou seeks freedom for all cypriots to move freely and hold property throughout the island however , the turkishcypriot leader , rauf denktash , appears content to be 'president' of a state recognized only by turkey rather than vicepresident of a republic representing all cypriots and has consistently rejected mr vassiliou s offers mr denktash s intransigence indicates that the key to a solution lies not on the island but in ankara his regime is dependent on the 35 , 000 turkish troops that maintain the 'green line' that divides cyprus troops funded in part by more than 500 million in military aid the united states gives turkey every year president bush must make it clear to mr ozal that this aid can no longer be justified as support to a bulwark against soviet expansionism turkey s dependence on america cannot be underestimated president bush must make it clear that this money is conditional president bush has a carrrot as well as a stick for the turks in 1984 , congress approved a 250 million cypriot reconstruction fund that would become available upon a settlement of the division in the absence of negotiations this legislation has gone unfunded the president could guarantee the money and that some of it would be used to reimburse turkish cypriots forced to return property they now occupy to its original greek cypriot owners in exchange for concessions prompted by mr ozal turkey s satisfaction with the status quo is puzzling in that pays a high political cost for its occupation of cyprus its actions have been condemned by the united nations security council the united states congress , angered by the occupation and eager to maintain the peace , gives greece 7 for every 10 in military aid it gives turkey and perhaps of greater importance , the european community has made it clear that without a resolution to the cyprus problem , turkey s application to the ec will remain on hold the united states also stands to gain from a resolution for 17 years america has been unwilling to help enforce the un condemnations on cyprus rather than strain relations with natomember turkey in the wake of the gulf war , this apparent double standard hurts our credibility as a world peacekeeper this is , in fact , a chance for mr bush to resolve another illegal occupation without resorting to warfare
this week it was revealed that the complainant in the palm beach rape case requested that her alleged assailant , william kennedy smith , be tested for hiv infection , the virus associated with aids today , the issue of rape inevitably raises the possibility of hiv infection the question is , is it really in a rape complainant s interests to compel a suspect to be tested for aids \? increasingly , women who bring a charge of rape are asking for the results of an hiv antibody test of the suspect s blood in response , many district attorneys' offices have incorporated the hiv antibody test into plea bargaining by offering admitted rapists reduced sentences in exchange for submission to the test although such a bargain may seem worthwhile on its face , in fact women receive little useful information the benefits to the rapist , however , are clear he spends less time in prison and is back on the streets sooner if a rapist tests negative for hiv antibodies , it may mean he does not have the virus but it might also mean that he was infected so recently that he has yet to develop detectable antibodies , though he is capable of transmitting the virus to others on the other hand , if the rapist tests positive , it does not necessarily mean he was infected at the time of the rape or that he transmitted the virus during the rape any lapse of time between the rape and the test introduces the chance that the rapist was exposed to the virus after the rape given the fact that few convictions are obtained immediately after the crime , even by plea bargaining , this possibility almost always exists in addition , the virus is not automatically transmitted through vaginal intercourse in fact , the most reliable evidence from aids epidemiologists puts the likelihood of transmission after one incident of sexual intercourse at one chance in 300 to 500 imagine that an admitted rapist is tested five months after the crime he contracted hiv and developed antibodies while out on bail or in detainment the survivor learns that the rapist tested positive but has no way of knowing when he was exposed what she has gained is the knowledge that she may or may not have been exposed to hiv when she was raped exactly the same information she would have had without obtaining his test results and a greatly increased anxiety level what the rapist has gained is more tangible a lighter sentence who benefits here \? or imagine that the rapist is tested two months after the crime he was infected at the time of the rape but still has not developed antibodies his negative test results cause the survivor to believe that she has not been exposed she may neglect to seek information about her own hiv status if she was infected , she may pass the virus to someone else it must also be remembered that accused rapists , like all accused persons , are entitled to the presumption of innocence unless guilt is established given the rampant discrimination associated with aids , sacrificing an accused person s right to privacy and confidentiality sets an unacceptable and dangerous precedent and it should also be remembered that no matter what the complainant learns about an accused or convicted rapist s hiv status , she will need to be tested herself immediately and again , 10 to 12 months later the complainant should avoid high risk behavior in the interim and should have available to her the most effective treatment available against hiv infection the possibility of exposure exists with every rape some argue that any information , however inconclusive and uncertain , is better than none yet testing the admitted rapist not only fails to tell the survivor whether she has been infected but can result in false alarms and false assurances plea bargaining for information about a rapist s hiv status may well backfire , leaving the victim , her partners and her community at increased risk
i always assumed the one person play was the theater s way of dealing with the shrinking dollar you really ca n't get more basic a performer , a platform , a text take away anything else and what do you have \? a loon emoting in the street or a mime show lately , though , i 've been wondering if the form , which usually brings a historical figure back from the grave to chat with us presumably in his or her own words is n't curiously attuned to our times in a deeper way we have never been so besotted with celebrities we have even come to believe that celebrityhood carries with it one duty above all others an obligation to spill the beans it s still too early to pin a label on the current season but if you 're looking for distinguishing characteristics beyond the hullabaloo caused by the coming to town of miss saigon there s no avoiding the rash of solo endeavors julie harris , assuming the strange , silvery persona and exotic wardrobe of the danish writer isak dinesen in lucifer s child , is only the latest example she has been preceded by reincarnations of virginia woolf \( a room of one s own \) , huey long \( the kingfish \) , lyndon baines johnson \( lyndon \) and florence aadland \( the big love \) , among others economics , of course , is not to be discounted in any of these cases the new penury is upon us the city is cutting back on services , department stores on their inventories , restaurants on the 50 entrees it follows that the theater would scale back , too , although when a show like the big love ends up costing 800 , 000 , scaling back is a relative term there is , however , another explanation for this vogue of oneperson plays we 're very close to it when , for example , miss harris first mentions the lifelong syphilis , the flowering of nemesis inside me , that ravaged isak dinesen s health there are two things a woman can do in such a situation , she explains forthrightly , accept it or shoot the man then , fixing the audience at the music box theater with a look that is both elegant and defiant and perhaps a little mischievous , too , she explains what she did instead i gave my soul to lucifer in return , he promised to transmute my sorrow into tales the whole world would read so , you see , i am lucifer s child the british actress eileen atkins , who is the sly , piercingly intelligent and altogether bracing virginia woolf in a room of one s own at the lamb s theater , is ostensibly talking about women and literature when she asserts that it is fatal for anyone to be a man or a woman pure and simple one must be womanmanly , or manwomanly the act of fruitful artistic creation , she argues , depends on some collaboration in the mind between the woman and the man for a second , her fierce intensity goes beyond the confines of literature and seems to dare us , presumably so sure of our definitions , to define gender a revolutionary s zeal is clearly stirring in this concentrated creature in both instances , the characters are approaching confession , and confession , these days , has become something of a national obsession rare is the sin that cannot be absolved by being publicly aired keeping secrets , once a component of good manners , is suspect and in the theater , the quickest way to get characters to reveal themselves is to put them in oneperson plays what other choice do they have \? they 're there to reminisce , settle scores , set a record or two straight and generally sum themselves up occasionally , they will answer the telephone or call out to an invisible maid but those are just diversionary maneuvers we 're the ones they 're really addressing owning up to , you could say conventional plays expect us to be no more than onlookers but the oneperson play casts us as confidants there was some critical disagreement over the value of what florence aadland had to tell the world in the recently departed big love as the mother of beverly aadland , onetime 1950 s starlet and underage mistress of errol flynn , she witnessed hollywood lowlife from the sidelines and fooled herself into thinking she was at the center of bigtime glamour but tracey ullman s extraordinary performance gave no hint whatsoever that the woman was holding anything back for better or worse , sympathy or ridicule , there she was a flashy , foolish nobody , pouring out her tinseled heart to us and , since her candor was stronger than her vanity , admitting to an artificial foot , as well likewise , miss harris s magical presence is the glory and redemption of lucifer s child , a more ambitious play , but not necessarily a more successful one the script is by william luce , who has already stitched the retiring existence of emily dickinson into the luminous belle of amherst for miss harris and fashioned the travails of lillian hellman into the feisty lillian for zoe caldwell this time , however , his work seems particularly piecemeal and unfocused the setting is denmark just before and just after a lecture trip that dinesen , then in her mid70 s , made to america in 1959 hardly a pivotal event in her life why , it may well be asked , are we tuning in here \?
cairo , may 13 through a long and crisisprone rule that has often resembled a poker marathon , president hafez alassad of syria has rarely blinked , always believing that the chips at game s end would vindicate the way he played the hands the strategy has been the same from his move into lebanon in 1976 to his backing for iran in its war with iraq to his support for the americanled coalition in the persian gulf war all damaged his reputation as an arab radical and were unpopular with his people , but ultimately succeeded in enriching the trove mr assad most cherishes regional power in damascus on sunday , after unproductive negotiations with secretary of state james a baker 3d , the syrian leader seemed to be pursuing a strategy that gambled the outcome of middle east peace efforts and his newly strengthened ties with the united states against the longerterm calculation that power and survival itself depend on advancing himself as an arab champion untainted by compromise throughout the latest middle east peace effort , syrian officials had emphasized that they would not compromise on the basic demand the return of all arab lands occupied by israel in 1967 to do so , in the syrian view , would be to forfeit the political basis of the government and the syrian leader apparently believes others will blink first on the side of the winners his seemingly unshakable belief that his policies will stand hindsight s scrutiny emerged in a speech he gave to muslim clerics last month our stand seemed weird to some people for a certain period of time , he said , referring to the hostility with which many of his people greeted his decision last august to reverse decades of antiamericanism and side with washington in the war against president saddam hussein of iraq but with the defeat of president hussein by allied forces , syria emerged on the side of the winners the course of events , he told the clerics , has proved repeatedly that our stand was the correct and healthy one , exactly like our stand on lebanon and the iraniraq war we did what we could according to our national interests the stalemate with washington possibly reflects a sense that this time the stakes are higher than ever , for , in this region s politics , any hint of softness toward israel carries severe political and physical risk , as president anwar elsadat of egypt discovered 10 years ago when he was assassinated after making peace with israel president assad has not given away anything that would enable anyone to point a finger at him later , a regional diplomat said weeks ago , syria s officially controlled newspapers began to harp on a familiar theme if peace efforts break down , israel is to blame because arabs have proved flexible while israel has been intransigent moreover , syria has reportedly spent more than half of the 2 billion it got in aid from the gulf nations after the gulf crisis on new weapons , notably enhanced scudb longrange missiles capable of hitting israel the syrians feel that israel never gave anything to weaklings , an arab diplomat said several games at once the syrian leader is also playing several games at the same time , all of them ultimately centering on the purported source of his political legitimacy steadfastness in the arabisraeli dispute in lebanon , he is seeking to promote an arab pact called the taif accord , which , with united states support , acknowledges syria s primacy there under the accord , syria is committed to disbanding all lebanese and nonlebanese militias in the country but a syrian official said damascus did not wish to move against palestinian and iranianbacked militias while israel still controlled its socalled security zone in southern lebanon in the maneuverings over an arabisraeli peace conference dispute , the syrian leader has emerged as the most important arab player by far his decision to support iran in its war with iraq and then to back the arab moderates against baghdad in the gulf war has placed him in a position to bridge iranian and arab interests none of syria s maneuvers are uncomplicated but a senior western diplomat said that in virtually all of them he needs the united states because the demise of soviet power has led him to a fundamental reappraisal of syria s position no longer can syria play the role of a confrontational soviet proxy in the middle east on all fronts , however , the syrian leader is calculating that the united states needs him , for he alone controls something that determines whether there is peace or not his cooperation
washington , may 10 the federal aviation administration has ordered commuter airlines to inspect immediately a type of engine used on scores of the world s most popular small passenger planes , looking for worn propeller parts that could cause pilots to lose control of the propellers suddenly federal investigators said they were examining whether the problem with worn propeller parts might have been a factor in the crash that killed former senator john tower in georgia last month although the propellerdriven airplanes involved are widely used instead of larger jets to carry small groups of passengers , the order is unlikely to disrupt service substantially because many planes either are not affected or have already been inspected voluntarily the inspections take a few hours to complete , and many planes can be returned to service without any repairs we 're well under way toward completing the inspections and making any necessary replacements , said peter kowalchuk , a spokesman for hamilton standard , the windsor locks , conn , company that makes the propellers that are to be inspected mr kowalchuk said as many as 500 sets of propellers were affected by the order the agency sent its urgent order to commuter airlines by telegram on thursday night , after investigating three recent incidents in which pilots reported becoming suddenly unable to control the pitch the angle at which the blade cuts through the air of their propellers by changing the pitch of propeller blades , some engines vary the amount of forward thrust they deliver during flight the three episodes involved planes that were on the ground , and no accidents resulted all three incidents were found to involve unusual wearing down of propeller parts caused by rubbing against a new type of metallic coating not previously used in the engine the same worn condition that apparently caused these incidents was also found on parts from the atlantic southeast airlines plane involved in the recent georgia accident , which killed all 23 people on the plane that was carrying mr tower to a coastal georgia resort the faa s order affects planes of several types , not just the model that crashed in georgia in the united states , the planes are operated by many commuter airlines , including pan am express , trans world express , continental express , west air commuter , skywest , comair , delta air trans , west air flight , mesa airlines and transport aerie william kiel , an official of the regional airlines association , said today that he believed many airlines , if not all , had made the inspections advisory from manufacturer hamilton standard had issued an advisory to its customers alerting them to the problem on may 7 , and telling them how best to inspect the problems this is the common approach taken in such cases , and it allows airlines to fix problems even before they are required to do so by the aviation agency although the agency s action is not likely to cause much , if any , disruption to commuter airline schedules , it could cause concerns by reminding passengers of technical difficulties with a widely used piece of equipment the commuter airline industry is a thriving sector of the airline business whose niche is flying small loads of passengers to and from many airports not served by larger passenger jets the faa s action is the second one in the past year meant to address problems with engine and propeller equipment manufactured by subsidiaries of the united technologies corporation , including its propeller subsidiary hamilton standard hamilton makes a special propeller whose blades swivel as they spin around and around the varying pitch of the blades changes the thrust in just the way that a crew member on a rowing shell , by changing the way an oar slices through the water , can change the force provided from rowing the faa s first order involving this type of engine affected only brasilia model planes like the one that crashed with mr tower aboard the order called for changes to prevent the engine from spinning the blades too fast , which could happen if a pilot improperly changed the propeller s pitch that change , the result of a long series of reported difficulties , was completed before mr tower s plane crashed there are nearly 150 of the brasilia models in service in the united states among the other planes that use the hamilton propellers are the saabscania ab sp340 , the aerospatiale atr42 and atr72 , the dehavilland dhc8 , and the construcciones aeronautics cn235 none of the planes are built in the united states , but most of them are flown here
state air pollution regulators and representatives of the automakers squared off for a debate wednesday over whether new york should adopt california s tough standards on tailpipe pollution , and succeeded in making the audience , about 80 auto dealers , very nervous but perhaps because of heightened environmental consciousness among their customers and among the dealers themselves , the new york state automobile dealers association has not taken a position on the rules the reason , one dealer suggested , is that the people who sell cars do not trust either the government or the auto manufacturers new york and 10 other states from virginia to maine have pledged to adopt the standards , which will require that , beginning in the mid90 s , cars emit far less carbon monoxide , a poison , and far less of the chemicals that cause smog but the manufacturers , mounting a statebystate resistance campaign , flew a team from detroit to urge the dealers to oppose the rules you will all remember 1981 , said al weverstad , general motors' manager of emission compliance , referring to the year when federal regulations required yards of extra vacuum tubing in every car , creating balky engines that caused what detroit calls driveability problems warning of price increases every time you force the technology , you take that risk , he said , arguing that if the new rules are adopted prices will rise by 1 , 000 a car , performance will drop and consumers will simply stop buying mr weverstad said that everything from baking bread to pumping gasoline to using hair spray adds chemicals to the air but thomas allen , director of the division of air resources of the department of environmental conservation , said the automobile industry was being told to spend only a modest amount , per ton of pollutant removed , compared to what factories and other polluters were being ordered to do to point at everybody else s ox and say , 'gore that one , get the fuel guys , get the hairspray guys , ' is not fair , he said none of this cheered the dealers gathered at a holiday inn near la guardia airport they are having a miserable year because of the recession , and are not anxious to take on anything that a customer will not love think of the last thing they tried to sell that did n't run on gasoline diesels , said henry famularo , the service manager at penn toyota in roslyn , li sitting next to him was frank apollo , service manager at sunrise toyota in oakdale , li we have a few of those kicking around , very few , he said people thought they were buying a car like a gasoline car , only it s not the diesels started differently , drove differently and had to be maintained differently , he said , and buyers disliked them several possible changes just what design changes the new rules would require is uncertain , but the cars available in a few years could include preheaters on catalytic converters that could make them slower to start , or incorporate more radical changes , like using natural gas or electricity instead of gasoline despite their wariness of new technology , though , the dealers are not rushing to detroit s defense mark schienberg , executive vice president of the greater new york automobile dealers association , an affiliate of the statewide group , said that before condemning the california rules , the dealers were waiting to see that this is not another air bag situation in that case , he said , the dealers enthusiastically backed detroit s contention that air bags were impractical , too expensive and perhaps dangerous , until chrysler corporation abruptly switched positions and began using them as a selling point down the road , five years from now , he said , i do n't want lee iacocca riding around in a california car saying it s the best thing ever invented , and us getting another black eye a selling point \? jason grumet , an assistant to mr allen at the department of environmental conservation , also referred to the air bag case my sense is that the one thing moving cars off your lots now is air bags , he said he predicted that dealers could make a selling point of cleaner cars , too the dealers are clearly divided new york has had an air pollution program for 20 years , and i do n't see any difference in the pollution , said jim farley , a volkswagen dealer in new hyde park , li they have n't proved to me that they 're able to solve the pollution bob bialer of forest hills chevrolet criticized the system under which california passes rules that require inventions , but agrees to review the rules every two years and change them if the necessary technology has not been developed that , he said , was like playing chicken by standing in front of oncoming cars and waiting for them to swerve mark herrmann of mark buick in yonkers said that he was not eager to offer anything for sale that would reduce customer convenience , as seat belt interlocks did in the 1970 s and if new pollution standards led customers to defer their purchases because they did not like the new cars , that would hurt sales tax receipts as well as dealers' revenues but he added we do have a moral , social responsibility , not only to our children , but to our grandchildren i do n't know which way you should go
everyone , it seems , expects computers to change photography , but no one is really sure just how or whether the change will be a good thing some people contend that because altering photographs is becoming much easier with computers , the medium is losing its authority as a record of reality in the future , the argument goes , no one will know for sure whether news photographs have been changed or how other observers , concerned less with journalistic uses of photography than with its role as an art medium , are more optimistic many see computers as a powerful new artistic tool that will enable photographers to shape their images with unprecedented control an important new exhibition of photographs by peter campus that he has altered with a computer offers a chance to consider some of these questions the pictures , at the paula cooper gallery in soho , are far from the psychedelic mandalas and images of surrealistic bubbles floating over the grand canyon that have given computer art a bad name instead , they feature natural objects rocks , tree trunks , leaves and so on of the sort that mr campus has been photographing and drawing since the early 1980 s mr campus scans the photographs into a macintosh computer , changes them in various ways , then makes large blackandwhite prints of the resulting images many of the alterations are readily apparent the objects have a powerful presence in themselves , and for the most part he avoids changing them much but in all the images the backgrounds have been replaced by computergenerated patterns sometimes smooth expanses of tone , in other cases distinctive patterns that suggest driving rain or the visual noise of a blank television screen other effects are subtler images are softer , as if the pictures were slightly out of focus edges of objects have an unnatural crispness and appear to sit on the surface of the print even when the object itself seems to recede into space at times , mr campus reverses large or small areas of an image into negative tones , achieving an unsettling surrealistic quality all these effects were available to photographers before computers , but the new machines allow them to be achieved with unprecedented ease and control for mr campus , the landscape has always suggested aspects of the body , and these works are no exception rocks , tree limbs , branches and leaves all suggest body parts skulls , torsos , bones these imposing objects recall the hulking sculptures of william tucker but have unexpected sexual overtones as well the trunk of a tree in one image seems about to burst out of its skin , with woundlike slits appearing on the bark elsewhere a piece of wood that suggests a twisting female torso floats above a twotone background generated by the computer by isolating the objects against artificially simplified backgrounds , mr campus underscores their sculptural qualities one of the main effects of his manipulations is to remove the forms from the entanglements of their surroundings so they can be contemplated more closely , in the process producing an effect like that of a zen rock garden occasionally mr campus s images offer meditations on mortality , with his alterations adding to their impact in one , a cluster of leaves and berries appears in the center of a light circle of computergenerated tone but the individual leaves and berries have been worked over in the computer as well , making it seem as though they have been coated with ice these are not ingratiating works they enforce an emotional distance and command respect for their seriousness this mood can get heavy , and it s almost a relief that some of the images seem corny or contrived in one photograph , mr campus has wiped out the background behind a birch tree only to tuck a computergenerated full moon just behind the trunk in another , leaves float down in front of a boulder but the leaves have been reworked so much that they seem leaden all the images take on a somewhat artificial air through mr campus s ministrations , blurring distinctions between the natural and the manmade in particular , they challenge photography s claims to be a sort of visual alchemy , a natural mystery , instead presenting it as a process that answers to cultural dictates the fact that the pictures have been consciously manipulated subtly changes the meaning of the images as well , giving greater weight to mr campus s intentions in making them than to the objects themselves it s all too obvious that these pictures are the product of an artist , one who is exercising absolute control over his work there is none of the sloppy and often surprising excess of information that we expect from a photograph , no matter how carefully set up and controlled instead , these become more like drawings , which viewers read not so much for what they show of the world outside the picture but for the record they provide of the interaction of the artist and his medium photographs by peter campus remain at the paula cooper gallery , 149 wooster street in soho , through nov 2 photo decay , 1991 , a digital photograph by peter campus \( paula cooper gallery d james dee \)
the television networks said yesterday that they were trying to scale back the amount of live coverage they were devoting to the war in the persian gulf specifically , network executives said they were trying to get away from covering small developments in the story or sideshows , as one news executive called them as well as full live coverage of every military briefing but several network executives said the effort to reduce live coverage was hampered by pressure from affiliated stations and the competition from the cable news network abc and nbc have extended their evening newscasts to an hour abc and cbs are now reporting brief updates of war developments every hour , and all three have 11 30 pm news programs to summarize the day s events the purpose , an abc news executive said , is to insure that viewers have the latest information without the need for constant interruptions in regular programs it is now reaching a stage where not everything that moves is news , said the executive , joanna bistany , vice president of abc news we 're not going on for the sake of going on the public is more informed now they all know what a scud is ms bistany said abc would now wait to cover a possible missile attack , whereas earlier the network jumped in live to cover false alarms don browne , executive vice president of nbc news , said , essentially , we 're only going to break in with a real development he cited a live interruption sunday when nbc had what it considered especially dramatic videotape of its correspondent , arthur kent , ducking an incoming scud missile 'war , all war' but the networks continue to be pressured by the continuous war coverage on cnn , said howard stringer , the president of the cbs broadcast group we 're trying to be judicious , he said but there s a certain level of distortion going because of cnn it s news judgment by volume of coverage in effect , they 're the war channel it s war , more war , all war a sizable number of viewers are interested in that sort of heavy war coverage ratings for news programs have been up all week 60 minutes had its highestrated telecast of the season on sunday night , when it showed three warrelated reports other news specials have proved unusually strong in the ratings cnn ratings have soared many network stations affiliated with cnn continue to mix in cnn coverage with their network s , usually when cnn has videotape not running at that moment on the network suddenly these stations are doing a menu , mr stringer said if they can cherrypick coverage , what does it say about the stationnetwork relationship in the future \? mr browne said nbc had overcome an early problem of affiliate defections largely because of a 24hour news service that nbc is now providing its stations pictures have impact the networks continued to report military briefings live yesterday , but abc left yesterday afternoon s briefing before the other networks or cnn and none of the networks interrupted regular programs to report on the firing of a scud missile that fell harmlessly into the persian gulf network executives are becoming increasingly critical of cnn s allconsuming war coverage the level of their reporting is very low , said one executive , who spoke on condition of anonymity they 're getting a lot of things wrong , but they just want to get the pictures on it s pictures , pictures , pictures but the pictures are having impact mr stringer said that most of the affiliate defections were taking place because they see that cnn has some picture that we do n't have yet in effect , he said , they 're becoming our critics but an audience study conducted by cbs last week indicated that cnn s strategy had been effective viewers were definitely switching channels throughout the early coverage , and often moving to cnn , said david f poltrack , cbs s senior vice president for research
many of the same interest groups that successfully fought robert h bork s nomination to the supreme court in 1987 are reassembling to oppose judge clarence thomas but with confirmation hearings only days away , some organizers admit that they are off to a slow start and that they will face difficulties in quickly mobilizing public opinion it is not going to be a grassroots effort that defeats thomas because there s just not enough time to put it together , said david a jones , a houston lawyer who is leading the antithomas campaign there it is going to have to happen in the senate only last week did a broad coalition of civilrights , abortionrights and other groups begin a flurry of activity against the nomination , setting up phone banks and organizing letterwriting campaigns to sway senators' votes the senate judiciary committee hearings start tuesday some ambivalence on race for his part , president bush spoke out for the nominee in a radio address yesterday , calling him an extraordinary man who conquered deprivation without selfpity or complaint page 22 opponents say they hope that aggressive questioning from the judiciary committee , and perhaps blunders by the nominee , will arouse the general public to influence the final senate vote , expected next month but though they said they thought judge thomas could still be beaten , leaders of the opposition groups said in interviews that their efforts had been hampered by members' ambivalence about opposing a black nominee and some said that unlike four years ago , this time they are battling a widespread perception that there is little hope that defeating a conservative nominee could change the direction of the supreme court in 1987 , with william j brennan jr and thurgood marshall still on the court , it was far less conservative than it is today , and democrats had high hopes of electing a president in 1988 who would appoint liberal justices when bork went into his hearings , he was already on the defensive , said arthur kropp , president of people for the american way , a washingtonbased organization that focuses on constitutional issues bork was made into a big issue that whole summer , and by september the polls showed that public opinion was running against him thomas disappeared as an issue this summer and he goes into his hearings in a much better position in alabama four years ago , for example , the aflcio did a direct mailing to 215 , 000 people as part of a large and ultimately successful effort to pressure senator howell heflin , a democrat , to oppose the bork nomination jim albright , executive vice president of the union s state federation , said no such mailing had been done this time and so far none is planned besides the question of mr thomas s race and the general discouragement over changing the direction of the court , mr kropp and other opponents said numerous factors had inhibited the development of a fullblown public relations campaign to fight the nomination many of the groups are already expending their influence on other legislative battles designed to undo actions already taken by the supreme court , like the civil rights act of 1991 , and a bill that would in effect overturn the rust v sullivan decision of last may , which allowed social agencies dispensing information on abortion to be denied federal funds finally , the bush administration is credited with seizing the public relations initiative by highlighting judge thomas s upbythebootstraps personal history when the nomination was announced , and the upheaval in the soviet union is blamed for eclipsing the issue in recent weeks group opposition more than 50 national organizations have opposed the nomination , including the national association for the advancement of colored people , the aflcio , the united auto workers , the national education association , the national organization for women , the national abortion rights action league and the mexican american legal defense and education fund last week the national baptist convention usa , the nation s largest black religious organization , and the national council of churches joined the opposition some groups that were active in the fight against the bork nomination , most notably the american civil liberties union , have taken no position on judge thomas despite such difficulties , the judge s foes say an effective campaign can still be mounted we have strong grassroots organizations already in place in a couple of dozen key states , and we are going to start to see tens of thousands of letters pouring into senate offices next week , said ralph g neas , executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights , a coalition of 185 national organizations that is helping coordinate the fight against confirmation starting to build' the momentum is just starting to build now , and it will grow quickly once the hearings put judge thomas back in the news , he said mr neas pointed to news conferences held this week in houston , chicago , memphis and other cities at which the local chapters of national organizations that oppose the nomination announced plans to begin lobbying efforts with their senators
washington , june 18 fresh from his impressive victory as the first popularly elected president of the russian republic , boris n yeltsin arrived here today and sounded a conciliatory note about his political rival , president mikhail s gorbachev speaking at a hot and crowded reception at the soviet embassy tonight , mr yeltsin said that the fact that the people of russia have had an opportunity to elect directly and for the first time ever by popular vote a president is first of all due to the initiative of the prodemocracy movement launched by president gorbachev in 1985 many men and women indeed doubted that our people were ready for that kind of change , he said rejecting any idea that he or his country were supplicants for western aid , mr yeltsin said the first question he was asked when he arrived in washington this afternoon , at the start of his fourday visit to washington and new york , was , how much money , mr president , are you going to beg \? 'we have not come here to beg' we have not come here to beg , we have not come here hat in hand , he said , speaking russian that was translated by an interpreter we have come here to tell you the truth about the russia of today his comments seemed to be a subtle effort to distinguish himself from mr gorbachev , who has called for western economic assistance to help the soviet union make the transition from communism to a more westernstyle economy mr yeltsin , who has attracted a wide following in the soviet union , was clearly trying to capture some of the same positive attention here that mr gorbachev has generated on his visits no sooner had he arrived at andrews air force base than he broke away from his security contingent to shake hands with spectators , in the sort of spontaneous pressingtheflesh that has won mr gorbachev so many admirers in america mingling with the crowd at the embassy tonight , mr yeltsin quickly dispensed with formal protocol , abandoning the new soviet ambassador , viktor g komplektov , in the receiving line , so he could move into the throngs and mingle more informally mr komplektov , for his part , had not relinquished his living quarters to mr yeltsin in the giltlaced downtown embassy , as the soviet ambassador has done during visits by mr gorbachev mr yeltsin is staying at the madison , a luxurious washington hotel favored by foreign dignitaries mr yeltsin wants to erase the bad memory left by his last visit to the united states in september 1989 , when some reporters depicted him as indulging in a long drinking and shopping spree here , accounts that were reprinted in the communist party newspaper , pravda pravda apologized to mr yeltsin after encountering a storm of protest from readers and after several witnesses disputed many details in the unattractive profile , which first appeared in an italian newspaper in contrast with his last visit to washington , mr yeltsin was somber and judicious in the delivery of his remarks , although an occasional flash of his customary puckishness came through although the embassy was stocked with caviar in the heyday of communism , there was none in sight tonight the american and soviet guests had to settle for cucumber and ham hors d'oeuvres and warm vodka new envoy to moscow the guests included president bush s choice to be the new ambassador to moscow , robert s strauss , and his wife , helen mr strauss was greeted by the secretary of housing and urban development , jack kemp , who laughingly told the ambassadordesignate that gorby will have a hard time getting a word in edgewise with you in moscow mr kemp , who was a quarterback for the buffalo bills before becoming a republican congressman , also advised mr strauss to import professional football to moscow mr strauss said he has been so busy getting briefings from the state department that he had postponed his russian lessons until he gets to the soviet union stronger and stable interaction' even though his visit is officially billed as private , mr yeltsin had insisted on landing at the military air base used by the president and other administration officials , as well as important foreign visitors , as a sign that the united states regards him with the proper degree of respect when he arrived at andrews after the 11hour flight from moscow , mr yeltsin said that he hoped his visit would launch a direct dialogue between russia and the united states in the interests of stronger and stable interaction between the ussr and the united states he was met by the senate republican leader , bob dole of kansas , and the senate majority leader , george j mitchell of maine , who are acting as his hosts while he is in washington senator dole told mr yeltsin that his meetings with president bush and top legislators demonstrate the new reality of the soviet union and the russian republic , a reality that we are perhaps a bit belatedly coming to accept the highest ranking administration official who came to the airport was curt kamman , a deputy assistant secretary of state in the bureau of european affairs the bush administration is engaged in a delicate choreography this week officials do not want to give mr yeltsin too much attention , because that could annoy and undercut president gorbachev yet they do not want to offend the proud and popular russian politician , especially now that it seems that he is destined to be a potent force in the future of the soviet union yeltsin 'led the way' we want to convey the idea that we must deal with the central government of the soviet union , said a senior white house official but we also want to encourage pluralism and convey that it is important for the soviet union to have elections and for yeltsin to have led the way at his briefing today , the white house spokesman , marlin fitzwater , stressed that he does not want mr yeltsin s reception to be seen as a challenge to mr gorbachev s leadership president bush has met with the presidents of the other republics , as well as the baltic states , and we certainly are anxious to meet with president yeltsin as well , mr fitzwater said , adding that our relationship has been with the central government of the soviet union for the last 40some years , and that s the way it will remain so there will be no change in that relationship state department officials said that , when mr bush meets with mr yeltsin on thursday for an hour , he will want to hear his plans for economic liberalization the president will want to know to what extent he s constrained by the central government and to what extent he thinks he can move forward with these ambitious economic plans he s got , said a state department official involved with the trip mr yelstin said tonight on the abc news program nightline that he does not like mr gorbachev very much because the soviet president has shown inconsistency , halfhearted decisions and a tendency to change positions under pressure since april , when mr gorbachev , mr yeltsin and leaders of eight other republics agreed to reorganize the union , president gorbachev has been more stable and has kept his word , mr yeltsin said through an interpreter mr yeltsin was scheduled to appear on the nbc news program today wednesday morning , before spending a day on capitol hill meeting with leading lawmakers photo boris n yeltsin , center , the popularly elected president of the russian republic , arriving yesterday at andrews air force base near washington among those who greeted him was bob

washington , april 1 the treasury department , hoping to expose and neutralize a hidden financial and trading network used by iraq to acquire military technology , released a list of 52 companies and 37 people today that it has identified as being fronts or agents for iraq today s action means that the people and companies , about half of them in britain , are now subject to the trade embargo and asset freeze imposed by president bush last august following the invasion of kuwait the financial impact in the united states is limited because the treasury s action affects only transactions under american jurisdiction , and only two of the 52 companies identified and none of the people are in the united states as part of the asset freeze , treasury officials said they had identified about 1 billion in iraqi assets held by american institutions , but much of that stems from commercial transactions that were under way at the time of the invasion , like oil or grain sales , rather than militaryrelated procurement john e robson , deputy secretary of the treasury , told reporters today that the disclosure of the names will disrupt the ability of saddam hussein or a successor to employ this network to rebuild iraq s military capacity or to divert funds that rightfully belong to the iraqi people for other nefarious purposes or personal gain he said that some foreign governments had moved to freeze assets of some of the companies named today , but he declined to provide any details many of those named today had previously been disclosed through law enforcement investigations and news accounts in the united states and other western countries the companies on the list appear for the most part to be small private businesses , scattered throughout europe and the middle east britain was a key base from which iraqi agents legally and illegally acquired military goods and equipment over the last decade mr robson declined to disclose details about the activities of those listed describing the treasury s process in naming someone as an iraqi front , he said the information was gathered from a variety of official and unofficial sources and then weighed aginst a number of qualitative tests anyone in american jurisdiction doing business with iraq or identified as an iraqi agent is subject to civil or criminal prosecution unless he or she gets prior permission from the treasury called the 'first step' mr robson called today s action the first step in a series of steps but declined to discuss how many other companies or individuals might be under investigation the task is complicated because iraq is a secretive society where the line between the private and public sectors is often blurred furthermore , baghdad s covert network often operated in countries with strict bank secrecy laws , making it harder to trace the flow of money kroll associates , a new york private investigative firm hired by the kuwaiti government , has identified a panamanian management company based in switzerland as a secret front for president hussein s money , according to a report last month on the cbstv news program 60 minutes although the kuwaiti government and its investigators worked with treasury officials , the management company is not on the treasury s list mr robson said the treasury was investigating such hidden assets , but declined to elaborate the list of 57 companies included iraq s central bank and iraqi airways , as well as obscure machine tool , electronics , engineering , shipping and trading companies in britain , jordan and italy the list also included 160 ships under iraqi control , as well as the 37 people , most of whom were based in britain , jordan and brazil one of the american companies listed , matrix churchill , a cleveland area machine tool company , is now defunct , its assets having been blocked last september it was a subsidiary of a british company and turned up in law enforcement investigations of iraqi military acquisitions more than a year ago the owner of the other american company , bay industries in los angeles , also figured in those investigations there was no answer today at the telephone of the los angeles company the names were compiled by the office of foreign assets control , a small treasury unit that puts into effect and enforces sanctions against cambodia , cuba , libya , north korea and vietnam none well known none of the 37 people listed as working for iraq were well known they included 12 people with addresses in britain eight in jordan , five in brazil , three in iraq ,

a sound engineer taking a break from a dance at the brooklyn botanic garden was shot in the arm monday night , apparently by a burst of submachinegun fire from a nearby rooftop , the police said police officers outside the garden , which has many visitors this time of year to see its cherry blossoms , heard three bursts of gunfire and herded people through the garden s wroughtiron gates one of the bullets in the second burst struck norman david thomas , 42 years old , of east brunswick , nj , as he went to ask a guard whether he had been hearing gunshots investigators were unsure last night whether the shots were stray or intended to hit people leaving the dance for the garden s trustees , sgt joseph piraino of the 70th precinct detectives said it s not uncommon for thrilltype shootings in that area , sergeant piraino said it appears it came from a rooftop in a telephone interview yesterday , mr thomas said he had been strolling with a lighting technician when he heard gunshots curious , he went to a gate , where he found at least 15 people in formal wear huddled just inside then , i heard a ping , mr thomas said i think the bullet had hit the iron gate or the fence itself i knew immediately that i was shot it s not nearly as painful as you think it might be it s like a push it stung he was taken to kings county hospital with a gunshot wound , but doctors decided to leave the slug in his upper left arm for now detectives yesterday canvassed the neighborhood around the garden , at 1000 washington avenue in crown heights , for witnesses and searched several rooftops within a fiveblock radius for spent shells , but found none , the sergeant said
phoenix , feb 27 arizonans have elected a governor for the first time since the impeachment of evan mecham three years ago , but most attention here remains focused on allegations of bribery involving a number of state legislators fife symington , a moderate republican in his first political effort , won a narrow victory on tuesday and described it as a magnificent opportunity to turn things around afterward , arizonans voiced relief that a bitter campaign that lasted nearly a year had ended , and they expressed hope that the new governor would provide badly needed leadership and begin a healing process that will help put behind them a number of political traumas on tuesday , mr symington , a phoenix businessman , defeated terry goddard , a democrat who is mayor of phoenix , by a vote of 52 percent to 48 percent in a runoff election that was required by law because neither candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote in last november s balloting the two candidates differed more in style than in policy , and as the campaign lengthened , it grew steadily more bitter as each man tried to find and emphasize their differences by election day , some arizonans said they were voting simply to put an end to the backbiting the great mass of people out there are saying 'the heck with you guys you 're all a bunch of crooks , ' said joe lane , the former speaker of the house what we need is somebody who will stand up and take charge , somebody who will stand up and say , 'follow me' enhanced influence is seen though the state s constitution describes a relatively weak role for the governor , mr symington s influence is likely to be enhanced by the continuing problems in the legislature when democrats took control of the state senate last fall , the two branches became split politically for the first time in a decade with the legislature thus divided , mr symington s election is expected to give the republican party the edge in the crucial redistricting that begins later this year in addition , the legislature , because of the ethics investigation , is expected to face a heavy turnover among its members even before the next election seven legislators and 11 other people were indicted three weeks ago on bribery and related charges after a 16month police undercover operation and political analysts here said they expected additional indictments in the weeks that followed , videotapes were televised showing the legislators receiving packets of cash from a police agent who said he wanted to open gambling casinos since then , one legislator has pleaded guilty and resigned , and there are reports that others are engaged in plea negotiations that could produce further guilty pleas one lobbyist implicated in the operation has also pleaded guilty and has agreed to cooperate with the police two investigations the investigation , known here as azscam , coincided with an ethics inquiry in washington involving both of arizona s united states senators in that inquiry , the senators , dennis deconcini , a democrat , and john mccain , a republican , were both criticized today by the senate ethics committee for their involvement with charles h keating jr and his lincoln savings and loan association the committee s findings about mr deconcini s dealings with mr keating were considerably stronger than those about mr mccain s here in arizona , the state legislative scandal brushed close to mr deconcini as well on tuesday when a top aide , michael crusa , resigned after admitting that he had accepted 10 , 000 from a state legislator , who he said wanted him to launder the money tuesday s runoff election was itself a symptom of the turmoil in arizona politics mr mecham , a republican and a political extremist , was elected in 1986 with less than 40 percent of the vote , and he was impeached and removed from office on charges of corruption in 1988 rose mofford , a democrat , was named to complete mr mecham s term , but she has not been an active figure in state politics and she announced her retirement before the election campaign we have n't really had a governor in arizona in four or five years , mr lane said to prevent the future election of minority candidates like mr mecham , the legislature required future candidates for governor to face a runoff election if none received more than 50 percent of the vote mr symington won the general election with 497 percent of the vote to mr goddard s 492 percent the margin was just 4 , 000 votes political shocks after the mecham impeachment , arizona suffered a series of political shocks , the latest and most stunning of which was the announcement of the legislative bribery allegations the spectacle of police videotapes on nightly television showing elected legislators eagerly accepting bribes has been stunning and has cast a pall over state politics as damaging , political analysts say , has been the cynicism about government displayed on the tapes in colorful and often earthy language by the legislators the spectacle seems to have contributed to a measure of cynicism among the voters themselves it s real hysterical the sting and this crazy governor s election and the whole bit , said mary ficklin , a secretary , after voting tuesday you either have to laugh or cry it s just sad that we have to pick either of the two bums the corruption charges have also paralyzed the legislature , which is now engrossed in ethics investigations and remains on tenterhooks over possible additional indictments many in the state are also embarrassed by the defeat of two referendums last november to create a paid state holiday to honor the rev dr martin luther king jr both candidates in the gubernatorial campaign , for the most part , kept their distance from these difficult issues their campaigns focused on increased financing for education , economic development , water supply and the environment the two men also aimed personal attacks at one another s finances and integrity photo fife symington and his wife , ann , celebrating in phoenix after he won election as governor of arizona \( associated press \)

that paul henry lang wrote history vividly and beautifully is a matter of public record but as anyone who regularly conversed or corresponded with him can attest , he was an even more colorful and entertaining storyteller with respect to events experienced firsthand some day , he promised in a particularly delightful letter of may 1980 , when i feel senility descending upon me , i will stop writing new things and write up the many funny stories in my life lang , best known to inveterate music lovers as the author of the monumental survey music in western civilization \( 1941 \) , which has remained steadily in print for 50 years , died recently , at the age of 90 the very good news is that senility never descended , and he continued to write new things to the extent that a relentless round of physical ailments allowed the bad news is that this brilliant and influential musicologist , critic , editor and teacher , who crossed paths with many of the great musical figures of this century , never paused to reminisce in any concentrated way , despite the impertinent badgering of at least one younger colleague in that letter , lang did permit himself a moment to savor the notion of memoirs , spinning two wonderful yarns from his days as editor of the musical quarterly \( 194573 \) and a teacher at columbia university \( 193369 \) on one occasion many years ago , schoenberg sent me an unsolicited article about his string quartets since it was written in swahili and was about the length of 'paradise lost , ' with innumerable repetitions and really abrasive quips about some of his colleagues , i cautiously wrote back that while we were proud and delighted to have an article by him , the piece would have to be somewhat abbreviated and slightly edited to suit our code back came a wire from los angeles 'no shorting am sending you six more pages when i write english , it needs no editing' so i declined the piece , which created a furor and \( together with my tiff with stravinsky \) will probably mark me as the second hanslick \( after schoenberg s death i published the piece , properly edited , which enraged his literary executor \) on another occasion i declined an article on the origins of venetian music by malipiero gian francesco , a composer and musicologist as being musicologically puerile needless to say , while doing so , i shamelessly buttered him up , yet all hell broke loose i had insulted one of italy s greats they went to their foreign office , which called the united states ambassador , who reported to our state department , and they went to ike the future president dwight d eisenhower who was then the president of columbia he called me in and read the riot act i told him that this had nothing to do with the university , hence it was none of his business the hanslick of the schoenberg tale was , of course , eduard , a conservative \( some would say reactionary \) viennese critic of a century ago , remembered as much for his futile carping at wagner , liszt and bruckner as for his prescient championing of brahms if anyone today compares lang to hanslick , it might be the most ardent proponents of the earlymusic movement though present at the creation , with his biography of handel \( 1966 \) and other writings , lang could never muster sympathy for the fashionable resuscitation of period instruments and performing styles when , still in the same letter , he finally got around to the business at hand , of high fidelity magazine , it was only to beg gracefully out of an assignment the telefunken boccherini quintets are played by one of those 'original instruments' groups no vibrato , no expression , everything scaled down in a laboratory style i am tired of these things , and i do n't think still another protest would enliven high fidelity but all the while , lang was preparing his ultimate blast the project that consumed his last years and precluded any serious discussion of memoirs was a revisionist study of performance practice , which he never finished apparently , he set out to demonstrate once and for all that the earlymusickers had repeatedly if not systematically misinterpreted or distorted historical evidence the book would undoubtedly have contained many truths but it would just as surely have been ridiculed and ignored by the advocates of a movement that , for good or ill , had passed lang by no matter whatever the fate and possible worth of that truncated tome , its mere existence represents a triumph of the human spirit through most of the last decade , lang s letters contained , almost by way of formula , a clinically detached account of his latest physical setback , immediately followed by an impatient resolve to get back to work after losing most of his eyesight , he had to rely on finger memory at the typewriter eventually he needed to install a gigantic magnifying glass in his study and , after heart failure , even an oxygen tank but he kept writing he also maintained his longstanding position with w w norton , advising on prospective additions to the music list as toughminded in his private affairs as in his scholarship , lang never sought pity and however sorry we may feel for ourselves that he failed to get around to those memoirs , there is no point in inflicting sentimentality on him he would have had none of it this was in any case a life lived to the full , a life to be remembered only in celebration now look for lang where , in a letter of august 1987 , he confidently anticipated he would end up , playing pinochle with haydn in heaven
the kitchen god s wife by amy tan 415 pp new york gp putnam s sons 2295 within the peculiar construction of amy tan s second novel is a harrowing , compelling and at times bitterly humorous tale in which an entire world unfolds in a tolstoyan tide of event and detail no doubt it was daunting to attempt a second book in the wake of the enormous success of the joy luck club , but none of ms tan s fans will be disappointed the kitchen god s wife is a more ambitious effort and , in the end , greatly satisfying the novel gets off to a slow start , but ms tan eventually relates the story of jiang weili \( weiwei \) from the time she was 6 years old in the china of 1925 through the present , in which she is winnie louie , the widowed matriarch of an extended chinese family living in san francisco it is unfortunate that we first encounter her through the eyes of her 40yearold daughter , pearl , because winnie seems disappointingly stereotypical she is full of dour aphorisms , is preternaturally cranky and so intrusive that pearl has kept secret for seven years the fact that she is afflicted with multiple sclerosis perhaps it is ms tan s intention to present us with a formulaic character and then slowly reveal to us our own misconceptions but i believe she was searching for a subtle way to pose a philosophical question i think she faced the problem of how to tell the amazing tale she needed to tell and persuade us to ponder it apart from being merely entertained by it in the long run , she succeeds in this remarkable book , even though her method is initially awkward and sometimes downright unbelievable it turns out that it is not only pearl who has been hiding a crucial truth for so many years winnie also has harbored secrets that , for various reasons , she finally feels compelled to relate to her daughter the method of this revelation , however , is labored winnie persuades her daughter to visit one afternoon , serves her a bowl of soup , a cup of tea , and for the next three hundred pages or so relates the story of her life while pearl sits at her mother s kitchen table amy tan manages to get away with this , although it is irritating each time she insists on bringing us back from winnie s mesmerizing tale whenever winnie halts her narrative to ask her daughter some question whose answer we only infer pearl does not speak ms tan challenges our suspension of disbelief but never mind these occasional intrusions are momentary and , indeed , it is very nearly hypnotic to be submerged in the convoluted story of the life of jiang weili her mother abandoned her under mysterious circumstances when weiwei was 6 she was sent away from her father s prosperous , communal household in shanghai to live with her paternal uncle s family in the countryside over 60 years later winnie louie still suffers the pangs of the abandoned child she once was for many years , my mother was the source of funny and bad stories , terrible secrets and romantic tales i felt so bad to hear them and yet i could not stop myself from listening i wanted to know how it could be that my mother left me , never telling me why now i no longer know which story is the truth they are all the same , all true , all false so much pain in every one and so , too , is the reader persuaded that all is true , all is false , as the tale unwinds her mother s disappearance is the first of many losses , humiliations and sorrows so great that it is only weiwei s exasperated humor and her tone of harsh certainty a kind of bossiness that maintains credulity in 1937 , when she was 18 , she made what she had hoped would be a marriage that would change her luck , that would remove her from a household in which she was treated kindly , but certainly not cherished her marriage to the dashing young pilot wen fu , however , was disastrous almost from the first day her desperation first to comprehend and then to escape the brutality and degradation of this union shapes the rest of her story , which carries through world war ii in china to weiwei s second marriage and eventual immigration to the united states as weiwei s story encompasses the deaths of her first three children and the further disintegration of her first husband s boorish and finally psychotic personality , we begin to understand that this is a chronicle not only of a woman s victimization , but of the unwitting conspiracy within society to ignore and therefore perpetuate the condition there are still , unfortunately , many contemporary parallels ms tan also manages , even within often tragic circumstances , to illuminate the nobility of friendship and the necessity of humor but the major question posed by the investigation of the life of jiang weili weiwei winnie is how much our circumstance is fated and how much is shaped by individual choice , or if , in fact , fate and individual choice are even entirely separate things this idea is like an undercurrent throughout winnie s tale , and i wish ms tan had not underscored her point by making the equation between the horrors that befell winnie and the disease that has befallen her daughter this is not to say that multiple sclerosis is less terrible a deprivation of autonomy , but jiang weili was trapped in a time and culture that all but precluded individual choice in her case her daughter has been stripped of a degree of individual choice by her disease the problem , however , is that the consequences the two women endure are simply not equally horrific , and pearl s real despair and fear , when she finally confides in her mother , is diminished in our minds when we inevitably make the comparison i would rather not have had to deal with this problem when talking about the kitchen god s wife i would rather say something to the reader much like what i said to my children in their early teens when i urged them to press on through war and peace it s not important the first time around to worry about the names , the war or the peace just read it to see what happens that s what i want to convey do n't worry about the obstacle of the framework of this novel , simply give yourself over to the world ms tan creates for you it s the story she tells that really matters drawing
president bush vetoed the democrats' bill to aid the longterm jobless because it would n't pay for itself yet the republican proposals he prefers are a sham they help too few people and depend on gimmicks that waste future revenue more than three million of the nation s eight million jobless are collecting unemployment insurance new claims have mounted slowly but steadily mr bush has made much of his measures to boost the economy by easing credit but he ignores the depressing effects of job insecurity people do n't spend when they fear being laid off the vetoed bill and two republican bills all offer added benefits to workers who exhaust , or have exhausted , the basic 26week maximum the democrats' 65 billion bill offered up to 20 weeks more the republicans propose a maximum of 10 more weeks in one bill , for 35 billion , or up to 15 more in the other , for 39 billion all three bills would aid workers whose benefits expire in months to come , if they work in states where the unemployment rate exceeds a specified level but democrats and republicans are far apart on helping idle workers who have already exhausted the basic entitlement the democrats would have helped more than a million in 34 states the republicans , with a much tighter formula , would help only 200 , 000 in six states and puerto rico the other big difference is financing the democrats' bill has none it would add to the deficit and to the federal debt that s forbidden by last year s budget pact between congress and mr bush , except in undefined emergencies the democrats argue that the distress of the longterm unemployed warrants emergency treatment , no less than the emergency aid that went to iraq s kurds mr bush says he wants to help the unemployed but must also protect all taxpayers thus he rejects new deficit spending but he s wrong to think the republican approach protects taxpayers it avoids new taxes or more borrowing now , but it robs the future some of the republican financing comes from student loan delinquencies washington already duns delinquents by deducting their debts if they claim tax refunds authority for this expires in 1994 the republicans want the authority renewed now , so that future collections can be counted on the 1992 books federal budget accounting may tolerate such trickery , but it s still trickery the bulk of the republicans' revenue scheme rests on a fire sale of unused radio frequencies mr bush has proposed an auction starting in 1994 to rush it through in the next 12 months is throwing money away the congressional budget office estimates a quick selloff could yield as much as 2 billion but that a properly managed sale later could yield up to 45 billion the democrats are rightly concerned but even though communism s collapse has invalidated last year s assumptions , the budget pact still stands , giving mr bush a reason to veto voting to override the veto is expected today if the president prevails , the wisest , most honest course would be to pay for extended benefits with a higher tax on employers but given that 1992 is an election year , that s not likely what is likely is that the losers will be america s jobless

ithaca , ny in a converted dairy barn , a stable and a boat storage shed outside this finger lakes city , a number of fledging entrepreneurs and cornell university professors are trying to make aquaculture history for nearly a year , they have been raising trout indoors more important , they have been doing so with a method so economical of space and energy that three tanks , a water recycling system and a starter crop of 2 , 500 fingerlings would cost under 10 , 000 the system would require little more than a gallon of water per fish and comfortably fit in 750 square feet a typical onebedroom apartment and if it works , it could make fish farming as viable in abandoned innercity warehouses as it is in idaho s open fields we 've figured out how to make water recycling costeffective almost anywhere , said r g douglas ley , manager of the northern fresh fish cooperative , a consortium of eight wouldbe fish farmers who are serving as the new system s guinea pigs the we that mr ley referred to comprises professors at cornell university s college of agriculture and life sciences , who were looking for an industry that could enhance their tompkins county economy already a billiondollar business in the south and midwest , trout farms seemed tantalizing , except for their intensive use of water most trout farms are near flowing streams , which send millions of gallons of fresh water gushing through the manmade ponds on a onetime ride tompkins county , despite its lakes and its frequent snowfall , does not have water to spare but it does have an agricultural college with professors itching to solve seemingly insurmountable problems indeed , for five years , several of them have been tinkering with ways to raise trout in recycled water the system they came up with uses standard circular grain bins with polyvinyl chloride liners , each 12 feet in diameter and about 3 feet high and with a capacity of about 2 , 500 fish a feeder above the tank sprinkles fish food every 15 minutes the fish feed constantly and therein lies a recycling problem what to do with the inevitable aftermath of that feeding fish excreta are very high in ammonia , which can be toxic to the fish in flowing streams , naturally occurring bacteria convert the ammonia to harmless nitrites and nitrates in a closed system , the ammonia can build up so fast that even the hungriest of bacteria cannot keep up since bacteria multiply in direct proportion to the surface area available for them to grow on , the trick was to create a large surface area in a tiny space cornell s answer , on which it has a patent pending , is its rotating biological contactor , a latticework wheel consisting of hundreds of honeycombed plastic cylinders that provide the bacteria with huge amounts of surface on which to grow water is continuously pumped from the fish tanks into a separate vat that holds the wheel , which is constantly rotating to keep the water aerated and to give the bacteria a chance to work without the contactor , none of us would have thought of going into a waterintensive business like fish farming , said laurene m gilbert , a landscapearchitectcumfishfarmer and the cooperative s chairwoman theoretically , once the water is ammoniafree and nitraterich , it is safe to pump back into the fish tank but in practice , it often contains solid waste residue , which although chemically harmless could lodge in a fish s gills and interfere with its breathing no question , filtration of solids is the weakest link , said richard j marisa , a member of the cooperative the novice fish farmers and the cornell professors together are experimenting with processes to get rid of solids one prototype system , which pumped water through a fine nylon mesh , required too much energy for the pump and too many unclogging sessions for the screen the group is now trying a gravitybased system that has the water flowing through a black plastic material that looks like corrugated cardboard the plastic retards the flow , thus letting the solids settle out by weight mr marisa is about to try a third system , patterned loosely after the closedcycle clothtowel mechanisms common in public washrooms a plastic cylinder hooked to the edge of the tank will rotate finemeshed plastic screening through the water , where it will pick up solids as the plastic emerges from the tank , a jet spray of water will blow the solids off the plastic into a nearby settling tank the cleaned plastic can then rotate back into the tank an added bonus the nitrogenrich solids can be collected for use as fertilizer any one of these systems could clean and aerate water from tanks much larger than 12 feet across but the professors are advising the cooperative to expand by adding many small tanks , to prevent diseases , contaminants or accidents from jeopardizing an entire crop of fish one large tank may seem more efficient , but how much risk do you want to associate with one unit breaking down \? asked michael b timmons , a cornell associate professor and one of the researchers another source of risk , of course , occurs on the business side of the venture to wit , will restaurants and supermarkets buy the fish \?

washington , nov 10 here comes the atlanta falcons' blitz there goes the ball there go the washington redskins' receivers sprinting into the end zone blitz bomb touchdown that was fun let s do it again the falcons and the redskins did this routine all afternoon today , and washington ended up punishing atlanta s overeager and inept blitz and its singlecoverage cornerbacks for six passing touchdowns in a 5617 rout before 52 , 461 fans at robert f kennedy stadium it was all too easy for quarterback mark rypien , who threw for all six of those redskin touchdowns , completing 16 of 31 passes for 442 yards he took himself out of the game before he reached sammy baugh s team record of 446 passing yards , but he did break baugh s national football league record for average yards per completion in a single game baugh completed 24 passes for 446 yards against boston on oct 31 , 1948 , for 1858 yards per completion rypien s average today was 2763 yards the record is 100 it s more of a thrill to be 100 , rypien said , referring to washington s undefeated status it s a team football game i do n't need to go in and break records rypien also scored on a 4yard bootleg run for the redskins' other offensive touchdown linebacker andre collins finished off the falcons with a 15yard interception returned into the end zone with 52 seconds left atlanta s defense always lives on the edge it goes after the quarterback with reckless abandon , essentially telling the cornerbacks , you get that guy , you lock up on that one , and good luck , you 're on your own the falcons , now 55 , had won two straight games , five of their last seven and had beaten the san francisco 49ers twice , all while employing this defense the redskins ripped through it , though , with receiver gary clark scoring three times on catches of 61 , 19 and 82 yards in all , clark made four grabs for 203 yards and art monk seven for 164 yards , including touchdown receptions of 19 and 64 yards even tight end terry orr hauled in a long pass his was for 37 yards and his firstquarter scoring catch from 9 yards out gave washington its first points on the way to a 283 halftime lead why are the redskins only the 14th team in league history to reach 100 \? they do n't have a weakness , said falcons coach jerry glanville and what is the redskins' strength \? pick out something , glanville said , and that s their strength oh yeah , they had two punts blocked today yeah , that s what they 've got to work on glanville smiled a wry smile , but sounded as crushed as his team atlanta , with all of its blitzing , did not sack rypien once and seldom even got near him washington sacked quarterback billy joe tolliver \( 14 of 31 , 243 yards , two touchdowns , one interception \) six times , with tackle tim johnson earning two of the sacks atlanta lost three fumbles washington did not fumble once atlanta suffered three interceptions washington suffered none the only defensive back the redskins did not burn was deion sanders he did not play , sitting out with a deep thigh bruise most of their big plays came in single coverage , but rarely were we just flatout beaten , falcons cornerback tim mckyer said there was a lot of miscommunication out there on our parts they get after you , everybody knows that we 're gonna have to do something about our defense no quarter left untouched washington s scoring line went this way 7 points in the first quarter , 21 in the second , 7 in the third and 21 in the fourth we tried to run the ball , said redskins coach joe gibbs , whose club did outrush the falcons , 108 yards to 62 yards they had people up there to stop the run you just ca n't run against that of course not they blitz you bomb we missed a few early , maybe three scores that were right there , but i credit mark and the coaching staff for staying with the long pass , said joe jacoby , the redskins' 11thyear offensive tackle last week , our long pass against houston was something like 22 yards houston sits back in the zone this team comes and comes hard but when you get 'em blocked , you make things happen
jerusalem , july 19 in advance of secretary of state james a baker 3d s arrival here on sunday , several israeli government officials said today that they were skeptical about his assertion that syria has suddenly shown a change of heart and is now ready to negotiate peace with israel at an international conference the officials spent the day conferring , and though none of them said exactly what they would tell mr baker , their comments suggested they were suspicious , anxious and in some cases angry about his agreement with syria with an agreement on a proposed peace conference fresh in hand from the syrian president , hafez alassad , mr baker clearly intends to seek concessions from israel that prime minister yitzhak shamir has already said he is unwilling to make many israeli officials suspect that the united states has negotiated some sort of secret agreement with syria designed to force israel into a trap they are therefore asking , even demanding , a copy of the letter that mr assad sent to president bush agreeing to the american terms early this week doubts about a conference if it s very important news , as we hope it is , i think we 're entitled to see it , the israeli deputy foreign minister , benjamin netanyahu , said it s important that we do i do n't think baker will leave here with an agreement that is acceptable to all sides and will bring about the meeting he wants to organize , defense minister moshe arens said in a published interview israeli officials do not believe that syria s attitude has genuinely changed they fear that mr assad may be playing a tactical game , one so shrewd that even the americans do not recognize it that is why they insist on seeing the letter we are on guard , and we will check every comma of the letter , foreign minister david levy said today we insist that the americans stick to the understandings we worked out together he referred in particular to a pledge that israel says mr baker made not to negotiate secret agreements with other parties hint of flexibility but mr levy , who is coming to be viewed as the most flexible of the cabinet ministers , also suggested that israel might become more interested in the american plan once it has had time to explore syria s position if it becomes clear to us that there s a real change in the syrian position , that finally it has begun to take the path of peace and is ridding itself of its stubbornness and is n't setting preconditions and that nothing has been said that s in conflict with what has been agreed with us then we 'll be able to welcome it , mr levy said the israeli government s chief concern is that the united states may have promised to support syria s demand that israel return the golan heights , captured in the 1967 middle east war retaking the golan heights would be syria s chief goal in any negotiations with israel but israel has virtually annexed the area by putting it under israeli law , and the government says it has no intention of giving it up while israeli opinion remains divided over what should be done with the west bank , the vast majority of citizens believes that israel must hold onto the golan , poll results indicate i 've asked the question repeatedly on and off since 1967 , said a poll taker , hanoch smith , and always the answer runs above 90 percent many israelis remember the days before 1967 when syrian gunners on the strategic plateau showered the galilee farmland with rocket and artillery fire about 12 , 500 israelis now live in settlements on the golan heights , and housing minister ariel sharon has vowed to double their numbers within three years prime minister shamir has said that if negotiations begin , he would happily discuss the golan with syria syria has the right to ask us to withdraw from the golan heights , he said this spring if syria does ask , we shall say we do not agree administration holds back letter asked about mr assad s letter , bush administration officials said that they do not release correspondence received from heads of state , even if other heads of state ask to see it we do n't do that , mr baker said this week in london his remark suggested that washington has not given syria a copy of a letter that it received from mr shamir in june , either israel did not budge from its positions in the letter , and mr shamir declared that he would stick by the letter s terms when the syrian agreement was made known the most important concession sought by mr baker may be an israeli agreement to let a united nations representative attend the proposed peace conference israel opposes that idea , saying the united nations has a long history of siding with the arabs un would observe only the american proposal accepted by syria calls for a lone united nations representative who would sit in on the conference but take no direct role in the proceedings we 'll listen to hear what the role of this representative will be , mr levy said even if it s a quiet one , he added , israel wants to know whether the representative will create a situation in which the other side will be able to create obstacles or wo n't make progress , because it will be hoping for the un to make statements that will be an obstacle to peace
the finance ministers and central bank presidents of the group of seven industrial democracies are hastily trying to arrange a meeting for this weekend , perhaps in new york , to discuss aid to the soviet union and what to do about the sharply rising american dollar a treasury department spokeswoman said yesterday afternoon that active discussions concerning such a meeting were under way , but that a final decision had not been made the issue was not whether to hold the meeting that has already been decided , by all accounts but whether the session can be scheduled on short notice they do n't want to go to the economic summit without having some idea of what they are going to tell the soviet union about aid , said stanley fischer , former chief economist at the world bank government officials offered a similar explanation , although none wanted to be quoted by name a preparatory meeting he referred to the meeting july 15 to 17 in london of the leaders of the group of seven britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states the soviet president , mikhail s gorbachev , is to meet with these chiefs on the final day at the conclusion of their gathering to prepare for the summit , the finance ministers of these same countries would gather this weekend , probably in new york but perhaps london , along with each nation s central bank president treasury secretary nicholas f brady and alan greenspan , chairman of the federal reserve , would represent the united states the soviet aid issue is essentially the need to reach agreement on a set of conditions that the soviet union would have to fulfill to qualify for aid , whether it is the 20 billion a year that a group of harvard and soviet economists have proposed , among them mr fischer , or a lesser amount you have to agree on certain basic steps that the soviets must take , like enacting a treaty of confederation and a satisfactory agreement on economic union , mr fischer said the rising dollar the meeting would also prepare the way for summit discussions of another major issue how to coordinate economic policies now that the united states recession is apparently coming to an end the immediate issue is the dollar , now rising sharply against the german mark and the japanese yen maybe they 'll try for an agreement on a ceiling for the dollar s value , said david smick , a washington economic consultant a connected issue is how to adjust interest rates in each country to accommodate an american economy that might be coming out of recession lower interest rates in the united states would be one way to weaken the dollar , by making investments in dollardenominated securities less attractive but the federal reserve is not likely to reduce rates at a moment when the recession might be ending
new delhi , july 7 the finance minister of india says his impoverished nation has begun a fundamental shift in priorities that looks , for the first time , to south korea and prosperous southeast asian nations as guiding economic symbols for more than four decades , india s policies have been marked by suspicion of capitalism , the united states , foreign investment and trade india is now in a new ball game , said manmohan singh , the newly appointed minister of finance , a selfeffacing international economist who virtually acknowledges that he is seeking to lead a revolution our country is now prepared for big changes and i think we can launch a process of changing the mindsets of our people in an interview in his office last week , mr singh said india hoped to attract multinationals to look upon india as an opportunity for investment and an opportunity for profitable business unthinkable in the past such comments by a senior government official , no less the finance minister , would probably have been unthinkable in the 1970 s and 1980 s , when india viewed the west , and multinational corporations , as rapacious mr singh said , essentially , that the nation s elite must forget their ideological hangovers , because india has no viable option except to open its doors to the west as well as asia to deal with the worst balanceofpayments crisis in the nation s history , a huge international debt , a plunging credit rating , 14 percent inflation and dwindling foreign exchange reserves at the edge of an economic crisis , india has urgently requested a multibilliondollar loan from the international monetary fund in a series of sweeping moves in recent days , mr singh has pledged to open india s doors to multinational companies , overhaul the crippling bureaucracy , scale down subsidies , accelerate trade and , perhaps most fundamental , turn india away from the socialist model that has traditionally guided its economic path a second devaluation on wednesday , india devalued the rupee for the second time in three days , with mr singh saying the indian currency was finally at the appropriate level to maintain the competitiveness of the country s exports at this point , mr singh exerts considerable muscle in the government , partly because he has become the point man on economic policy , partly because of his candor and partly because of his reputation as a man without political or ideological baggage but his critics say mr singh s talk may not ultimately match his accomplishments , suggesting that he is politically naive and has failed to come to grips with the powerful realities of india s bureaucracy and business class , which have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo mr singh , a thickly bespectacled 59yearold former governor of the reserve bank of india , has held senior economic jobs with the indian government as well as the united nations he was an adviser to former prime minister indira gandhi , who viewed american economic involvement with hostility influence of the soviets the overall thinking of the economic profession of this country was greatly influenced by the soviet model , mr singh said with the collapse of the command economy of the eastern european type , everybody is convinced that it is time for fresh thinking mr singh said his travels , especially to asia , left him with a deep feeling of dissatisfaction about india s economic progress he said we have tremendous potential , a country of 850 million people , a vast domestic internal market we have a tremendous reservoir of managerial , entrepreneurial and technological skills and our people , when they compete abroad , are second to none whether it s in terms of academic institutions or in terms of making money in the us or uk yet i found india has become increasingly marginalized 'india has to wake up' there must be a deep examination of what has gone wrong why is it that south korea is talked about \? in 1960 , south korea had the same percapita income as india today , south korea s income is 10 times india s other economies of asia , including indonesia , impressed mr singh i got the message that india has to wake up , he said foreign investment in india totals 100 million a year , of which 20 million comes from the united states i would hope that this small trickle will turn into a flood , he said japanese officials have already told mr singh that japan could invest 2 billion annually if india had the right policies but fundamental changes in the way india operates are a herculean task , mr singh acknowledged certainly the nation s crumbling public services , enormous poverty and illiteracy , mammoth bureaucracy , backwardness , social and caste systems and blurred ideology leave india almost locked in a cycle of economic despair politicians , within the congress party as well as the opposition , have voiced uneasiness , if not resentment , at the new government s efforts and the labyrinthine bureaucracy has a vested interest in maintaining the blizzard of licensing that stirs considerable corruption as tavleen singh , a colmunist in the economic times , wrote last week the trouble with our earlier finance ministers has been that they have made policies , even some very good ones , in the ivory towers without ever going into why the policies never seem to work on the ground has any finance minister gone into why an exporter still needs 200 signatures before he can export his first shipment \? the finance minister said resistance on the part of the bureaucracy was possible i do not minimize the difficulties of the task , he said but i get the feeling that now is the time to do big things because most people now , in their heart of hearts , feel that the old habits of thinking have not yielded results photo our country is now prepared for big changes and i think we can launch a process of changing the mindsets of our people , said manmohan singh , india s newly appointed minister of finance \( pana india via agence francepresse \)
washington , march 2 the bush administration began planning an offensive campaign to dislodge iraqi forces from kuwait early last fall even as administration officials insisted in public that the only mission of united states forces was to defend saudi arabia and enforce united nations sanctions according to a reconstruction of major internal deliberations and decisions by president bush and his senior advisers during the sevenmonth persian gulf crisis , offensive military planning began in earnest in september on oct 30 , a week before congressional elections , the president secretly approved a timetable for launching an air war against iraq in midjanuary and a largescale ground offensive in february that would strike deep into iraqi territory to outflank and encircle president saddam hussein s army this warplanning process went forward in conjunction with american diplomatic and economic pressure on iraq to leave kuwait , and senior officials indicated that mr bush all along hoped at times even believed that sanctions coupled with the threat of war would be enough to dislodge the iraqis the planning steps that the president approved in october were those carried out when the air war began on jan 17 the only element of the plan made public was the announcement by mr bush on nov 8 , two days after the election , that he had ordered a major reinforcement of american forces in the persian gulf to give them an offensive capability that critical decision increased american troops from 230 , 000 to more than 500 , 000 and provided the allies the troop strength for the decisive flanking action carried out in february in the iraqi desert another plan submitted to the pentagon early in october by gen h norman schwarzkopf , commander of united states forces in the persian gulf , had been rejected because it envisioned a ground offensive directly into the heart of iraqi forces and fortifications in kuwait in addition to the timetable for offensive military action , the administration s reconstruction of events shows that while the gulf crisis ended on the high note of military victory , earlier officials had been short of insight into president hussein s intentions and bereft of military options to stop his invasion of kuwait last summer it also shows that despite the administration s carefully maintained image of unanimity on major decisions , there were debates at the white house and the pentagon over how to respond to the iraqi aggression a briefly contentious point was whether and how to keep israel from striking back in response to iraqi scud missile attacks at one stage , the president s advisers seriously debated letting the israelis unleash their jericho missiles on iraqi territory when this was rejected , the white house arranged for the israelis to receive intelligence information on american military progress against the scuds the reconstruction also provides an insight into a central mystery of the gulf crisis why mr hussein ignored all warnings that his army would be destroyed and his country crippled according to top officials , tariq aziz , the iraqi foreign minister , told secretary of state james a baker 3d at the end of their meeting in geneva on jan 9 your arab allies will desert you they will not kill other arabs your alliance will crumble and you will be left lost in the desert you do n't know the desert because you have never ridden on a horse or a camel sending troops the allies debate how soon to help at 2 am on aug 2 , 80 , 000 troops from iraq s republican guard pushed across the kuwaiti border and headed south toward kuwait city , the capital the first intelligence reports reached washington around 6 30 pm aug 1 , eastern daylight time , as the invasion was occurring at 9 15 pm , kuwait s crown prince and prime minister , sheik saad alabdullah alsabah , telephoned the american embassy asking for immediate military help to stop the invasion , but , worried about how this would be seen in the arab world , he insisted that the request not be made public or treated as official at 10 30 pm washington time , the embassy got a second telephone call from sheik saad ignore the first request , the desperate kuwaiti said now the government was officially requesting help and was willing to make this public but before an answer could be conveyed back to sheik saad , he had dashed to dasman palace to pick up the emir , the country s ruler , and was heading south in the royal limousine to saudi arabia we had told them all along , 'you ca n't ask us for help when your enemies are knocking on the palace door , ' a senior administration official said we just did not have the military assets in place indeed , the nearest significant american military help , the aircraft carrier independence , was far away in the indian ocean the view in washington was that for the time being kuwait was a goner , as a senior official said the whole focus of thinking was how far south would the iraqis move \? the first official contact with saudi arabia was made through the united states embassy in riyadh , where a senior diplomat asked what the kingdom wanted from the united states the saudis were a little flustered , a little scared , a senior official recalled they did n't know what they wanted the pentagon offered to send a squadron of tactical fighter planes we 'll get back to you , a saudi official replied

q we wallpapered our bathroom with a solid vinyl , and the edges are now peeling the walls are plaster , which we covered with wallpaper lining and then primed we overlapped the vinyl wallpaper strips by about oneeighth inch , and these edges are curling back i tried several adhesives , but none held up for long some places will not stick down at all any suggestions \? a there are a couple of things you did wrong first , you should never use a wallpaper lining under a vinyl wallcovering , for the vinyl will pull the paper lining away from the wall second , you should not paint or prime a wallpaper or lining this makes it very difficult to remove later third , never overlap the edges of vinyl , for it will not stick over itself in most cases your only solution is to strip everything off the wall and then start over q the dry well in my yard is backing up and is apparently clogged i have no idea how long the well has been in use assuming it is leaves , is there any product i can pour in to get rid of them without harming the lawn , or must i rebuild the well \? a i know of nothing you can pour in the well that will solve your problem the only cure is to either uncover the well and clean it out , or to dig a new well and connect your gutters to it to prevent this happening again , i suggest you cover the gutters with mesh guards so as to keep out leaves
washington , may 31 after four years of research , scientists from the department of agriculture have found that a virus similar in genetic structure to the aids virus is more common in cattle in united states than researchers had anticipated the scientists say there is no evidence that the virus can infect people the virus , bovine immunodeficiencylike virus , or biv , is spread through the blood and is a member of a family of slowacting viruses that have been shown to reduce the activity of an animal s immune system such immune suppression , veterinarians said today , can open the way for other infections the virus , which was first isolated in 1969 , has been shown to cause illness in calves , a top scientist at the department of agriculture said today scientists say they believe that the virus causes immune suppression in adult cattle , but how powerful it is remains uncertain researchers said much more needs to be found out about the virus to understand its importance to the 55 billion cattle and dairy industries we will continue to do research on this virus because it will help create a body of information that may provide a way to reduce the costs of production , said dr harry mussman , the deputy assistant secretary of agriculture for science and education it is very important that the public understands that this is not the aids virus we do not have the aids virus in cattle millions lost to disease dairy and cattle producers now lose hundreds of millions of dollars each year because sick animals must be culled from their herds in addition , cattle and dairy farmers spend 300 million to 500 million for antibacterial agents , antibiotics and other drugs to treat sick animals the food and drug administration has sought in the last two years to crack down on the use of such drugs because some are known carcinogens and residues have been found in meat and milk , posing a threat to public health it is uncertain what the findings about the bovine virus infections will mean for the agency s effort until now , most agricultural experts have attributed the rise in veterinary drug use to modern husbandry practices in which greater numbers of animals are being confined in pens and dairy barns whether the cattle virus is also related to the increasing drug use by causing immune suppression in adult cattle has not yet been studied , scientists said the shortterm research conducted so far wo n't give us an answer , said dr matthew a gonda , a molecular virologist and head of the laboratory of cell and molecular structure at the frederick cancer research and development center in frederick , md we really have to go back and do more research , take fresh isolates of the virus and put it into more animals and see what happens another important consequence of the research on the cattle virus could be the effect on american exports of semen , embryos , and breeding stock , a 68 millionayear industry , according to the department of agriculture european countries , the major purchasers of american genetic material , are scrupulous about avoiding the risk of contamination by animal infections the bovine immunodeficiencylike virus was first isolated in 1969 by dr martin j van der maaten , a veterinarian at the agriculture department s national animal disease center in ames , iowa , who found it in a cow s blood serum collected in louisiana the virus did not receive intense scientific scrutiny until the mid1980 s , when dr gonda began to study the cattle virus and determined that its genetic structure was similar to the human aids virus both viruses have eight genes , dr gonda said today , and magnified by an electron microscope , they look remarkably alike prompted by a petition from the foundation on economic trends , a washingtonbased public interest group concerned about the virus s effects on the farm economy and human health , dr van der maaten and his colleagues in iowa began a new study in 1987 the research had four goals to determine how prevalent the virus was in cattle , see whether it could produce illness in people , determine if it could cause significant infections in the nation s 99 million dairy and beef cattle and find out how it was spread no human infection found the early research shows that the virus is much more common in cattle than dr van der maaten thought he and his colleagues in iowa have identified the virus in blood serum collected from cattle in louisiana , texas , kansas and iowa dr cecelia a whetstone , a microbiologist at the national animal disease center who was in charge of the studies on human health , said in an interview that the potential for human infection from biv is zero laboratory workers who handled the virus in concentrated form , animal caretakers exposed to the virus and two workers who accidentally pricked themselves with infected needles are regularly tested for antibodies to the virus the tests showed none of the workers had been infected there is circumstantial evidence that the cattle virus may be causing production problems in some herds dr van der maaten noted that dairy herds he has examined that had more illness from common diseases also had more cows infected with the virus than herds that were performing well we need a sound statistical study nationwide to help us understand what this could mean , he said dr van der maaten and his colleagues also determined that the virus is spread in cattle through blood farmers could prevent infections from spreading by taking greater precautions in how they handle their animals using the same needle to draw blood or administer veterinary drugs on 60 or 70 animals is one way to spread the virus in a herd , he said the foundation on economic trends today filed a formal petition with the department of agriculture asking the government to take immediate steps to quarantine infected cattle , and accelerate the pace of research al strating , a director in the animal and plant health inspection service , the agriculture department division that orders quarantines , said the government had no plans for a nationwide program to quarantine or cull infected cattle
aside from language , spanish and mexican cuisines have very little in common yet , many diners confuse the two casa luis will add to their confusion the new spanishmexican restaurant in smithtown offers the food of both nations under one roof the owner arrived at casa luis from spain by way of the iberian restaurant in huntington , where he was a chef and partner the menu at casa luis is classic spanish , but with enough mexican choices to satisfy diners who gravitate south of the border the decor at this cozy bungalow on the northern side of jericho turnpike combines both cultures the warm wood paneling , ceiling beams and brick fireplace could be a backdrop for any cuisine , but the mexican sombreros , spanish travel posters and paintings tell a tale of two nations casa luis s duality is brought home by the arrival of tortilla chips accompanied by salsa , together with hot rolls and butter mexico wins this first encounter the rolls are ordinary , but the chips are toasty and the salsa spirited the staff is spirited , as well , being warm , welcoming and on their toes bowls of chips are replaced before they can cool off restaurants like casa luis that receive a rating of good fall into one of two categories they either have food that is uniformly satisfying but no more , or dishes ranging from bestever sensations to doggybag disasters casa luis is in the latter group on the sensational side are all ajillos , or dishes with garlic sauce shrimp ajillo , pork marinated in garlic , mushrooms ajillo and chicken ajillo are terrific that winning sauce combines garlic with enough red pepper to set taste buds singing broiled chorizos , slices of spanish sausage so often dried out and dreary at spanish restaurants , are plump and full of flavor at casa luis another sparkling appetizer is the salpicon , a large refreshing seafood salad full of real crab meat , firm shrimp and scallops from the mexican list of openers , choriqueso , a pizzalike flour tortilla topped with melted cheese and spanish sausage , was fine , but the zing from the promised jalapenos was minimal the properly chunky yet creamy guacamole could also use a boost in firepower soups were in that same bland mold , with lovely texture and ingredients , but short on seasoning many entrees deserve the same criticism carefully cooked paella with tender seafood was boring mariscada in a parsley and herbflecked green sauce is a better seafood bet the doggybag designee was flounder a la gallega , rolled fish fillets simmered with potatoes , peppers , onions and peas its brown sauce was gloppy , the fish and vegetables miserably mushy a similarly uninspired sauce covered veal a la extremena and veal a la chef nevertheless , the meat in each of these offerings was fork tender better choices are the sizzling chicken fajitas served with four warm flour tortillas and an array of the usual accompaniments , and chicken villaroy , two large succulent breasts enclosed in creamy bechamel sauce and then crisply deep fried entrees come with rice , green beans or spanish fried potatoes the choice is easy go for the spuds the rice was routine , and the beans were emeraldgreen perfection one night , yet waterlogged another but the crunchy , round chips were first class dessert is as mixed as the rest of the meal flan , the ubiquitous spanish egg custard , and cheesecake are rubbery , but chocolate mousse cake natilla , which is vanilla pudding topped with creme de cacao , and sopapillas , ice cream in a crisp tortilla shell topped with cinnamon syrup , end the meal on a sweet note casa luis offers the best of both spain and mexico at drink time , spanish wine and mexican beer spanish wines , although not as famous as france s , offer remarkable value

tokyo , march 11 the international business machines corporation , revamping its strategy in japan , said today that 11 major japanese computer makers would join it in a concerted attack on the nec corporation , which dominates the highly fragmented personal computer market here under the plan , which ibm has been circulating in the japanese computer industry for several months , ibm s japanese subsidiary would broadly license the rights to personal computer technologies that had been closely guarded here the data will allow the companies which include some of ibm s fiercest competitors to run common software on their japanese machines , much as they already do on ibmcompatible computers in the united states at present , nec holds about half the japanese personal computer market the rest is fragmented among manufacturers that have been unable to agree on a single alternative to nec shift in thinking until now ibm has shied away from allowing competitors to have total compatibility with its japaneselanguage machines ibm s most attractive selling point here has long been the ability to exploit software developed around the world for ibm s personal computers but with the company s share of the japanese market stuck below 10 percent , ibm s leadership in the united states decided in early december that it needed to establish a single alternative to nec even if other japanese companies would be big beneficiaries it is a major risk , said nobuo mii , the ibm vice president who has championed the shift we will have to produce laptop computers and desktop machines at the lowest cost in japan , even compared to toshiba or hitachi but we should have the confidence that we can do it in a few years , said mr mii , who is responsible for battling ibm s biggest competitors on their home turf , i will look either very , very stupid or very , very smart big names involved the companies that announced today that they would sign contracts with ibm to build the new machines include the toshiba corporation , which has been one of the world s most successful makers of lightweight laptop computers fujitsu ltd , the world s secondlargest computer maker and perhaps ibm s most bitter corporate rival hitachi ltd the matsushita electric industrial corporation , and the mitsubishi electric corporation also signing contracts are the sony corporation , the sharp corporation , the sanyo electric company , the ricoh company , the oki electric industry company and canon inc none of the companies are expected to drop their current computer designs , and some already offer some compatibility with ibm others are tied up with ibm s rivals sony , for example , is widely reported to be building the first notebook version of apple computer s macintosh machine under the agreement , all the companies will be able to design computers that are fully compatible with ibm s what we want to do , at some point in the future , is develop computers that will operate our own operating system and ibm s , a toshiba spokesman said but we cannot say now when that will definitely be some special difficulties achieving true compatibility among personal computers is more difficult in japan than elsewhere displaying kanji characters the thousands of ideographs drawn from china and two phonetic alphabets that are also used in everyday japanese writing requires very highresolution display screens and complex instructions for processing characters a result has been a plethora of operating systems a few years ago , ibm took a major step by abandoning its efforts to build dedicated machines for japan and moving instead to merge the ps 2 personal computer line with its japanese entries within a month or two ibm is expected to make another big , if belated , step by bringing out a new generation of laptop and notebook computers if laptops are important to success in the united states and europe , they are essential here while americans tend to use the machines as their second computers , in crowded japanese offices and homes they are often the primary machine , and japan s computer makers have dominated the technology so far smaller models sought ibm has moved much of its design work for its portable machines here , and a notebook computer , weighing four or five pounds , will probably be available in japan before it moves to the united states and europe in 1992 a crucial part of the ibm strategy will be a new generation of thin liquidcrystal display screens capable of displaying a huge range of rich colors production of the screens will begin in may by an unusual ibmtoshiba joint venture
in an age when the reigning philosophy says less is more , palio remains an oversize nonconformist from its splendiferous bar to its tag team of greeters to its leatherbound menu and a copious wine

italy , called the palio this theme is strikingly depicted in the groundlevel bar with a bold wraparound mural by sandro chia showing the tumultuous annual competition the bar is a wonderful place for pretheater drinks and snacks , although service there can be exasperating as you head to the secondfloor restaurant , a greeter checks your reservation and ushers you into an elevator at the

, the uniformed staff descends quickly with water and bread now i do n't usually get excited over something as mundane as breadsticks , but these crunchy oliveoilandrosemaryflavored batons are worth dueling for , as are the excellent breads mr hellrigl has divided his menu into three tasting dinners and a long list of a la carte choices a seafood menu began with a glistening plate of smoked sturgeon , salmon and scallops with a mild horseradishflavored oil , followed by a wonderful gazpacholike tomato soup with bits of lobster then came risotto with shellfish that had a rich lobster bisque flavor it was not creamy like most risottos , but the flavors were excellent sea bass came with an astringent lemon sauce that was surprisingly apt , along with mixed vegetables a balsamic vinegar menu was not quite as good as it sounded it began with smoked scallops with a delicious sauce of pureed potatoes and balsamic vinegar the scallops , though , were insufficiently smoked and nondescript the highlight of this menu was macaroni with lobster in a terrific , sweettart sauce made with 25yearold vinegar , veal stock and lobster stock poached fillet of beef with vegetables and balsamic vinegar was unremarkable because of insufficient saucing a tart vinegar dessert , though , chilled fruit soup with yogurt and fresh strawberries , was as refreshing as a blast from a garden hose on a sweltering day recommended starters on the regular menu are paperthin bresaola with a cluster of shiitake mushrooms and greens in the center , and marinated salmon under a drizzle of the potato and balsamic vinegar sauce palio boasts an encyclopedic wine selection the italian list is outstanding , while the french and american ones are impressive , too unfortunately , the document is elitist , with only a handful of wines under 25 the staff , which is highly professional in an unobtrusive way , will help you with this formidable list if you ask my major gripe concerning the service is with the poky kitchen , which takes too long between courses three of my four meals ran to three hours pastas , all of which are homemade , are superior taglierini comes with a blissfully delicate sauce of smoked salmon , chives and a splash of cream taglierini is tossed in an oceanic shellfish broth tinted with saffron that is generous with mussels , scallops and baby clams ravioli filled with goose liver and duck meat and tossed in a melted sage butter sauce should come with the business card of the nearest cardiologist spaghetti with ripe tomatoes and basil is clean and bright at the other extreme are a main course of poached swordfish with grainy mustard sauce a good sauce but rather dietetictasting fish and a much better fillet of sole with a ripe and tasty blend of tomatoes and eggplant sea scallops came with unevenly cooked crusts of potato and deepfried spinach , which was really redundant the potatoandherb crust works better with lamb chops , which were perfectly cooked desserts excel you ca n't go wrong with the orangeflavored polenta cake with ice cream and orange cream sauce , the espressoflavored chocolate terrine , black polenta cake with white

each year , the national hockey league offers a variety of awards that rival hollywood s oscars in number and in detail along with major trophies like the hart for the most valuable player and the vezina for the best goalie , there is the lady byng for gentlemanly play , the selke for best defensive forward and even the budweiser man of the year award for many positive attributes , none of which involve consumption of beer perhaps , some day , the league will recognize an overlooked category and institute the bob clarke award for comeback of the year by an executive , not a player certainly , clarke could win such an honor this season failure in philadelphia last spring , after six years of declining point totals , mediocre drafting , deteriorating relations with team ownership and a rare failure to make the playoffs , clarke was dismissed as general manager of the philadelphia flyers , whom he had helped to win two stanley cup championships as a hall of fame player this spring , clarke has a chance to win another cup ring as general manager of the minnesota north stars , who visit pittsburgh wednesday night to open the fourofsevengame final against the penguins clarke s tale is just part of a whirlwind of individual success stories blowing out of the northern midwest so resolutely humble that he usually says we when he means i , clarke says he would prefer as little individual attention as possible , although he does n't mind that a rising tide lifts all boats we 're enjoying it , he said of the team s growing fan and media following we know what it s like to have no coverage we struggled an eye for talent when he took the minnesota job last spring , it appeared he was in for the struggle of his life the man who hired him , howard baldwin , could n't complete the purchase of the team and sold it , instead , to norman green although such a switch is not usually the ideal situation for a new executive , green then a partowner of the calgary flames was the one who had suggested to baldwin that baldwin hire clarke i think bob clarke is the best , green said he knows talent as well as anybody and he has a great way with these kids they love to be associated with him he knows what chemistry he needs finding fine print clarke , just as he did as a player , enjoys the little battles and the dirty work for instance when the brothers george and gordon gund sold the north stars and bought an expansion franchise for san jose , calif , they negotiated a deal that would give them 30 players from the minnesota system , including some prime , young talent through a series of negotiations and threats , green and clarke have changed the bargain in minnesota s favor , both say specific details have n't been announced , but green says it was clarke who read the fine print and found the loopholes i appreciate what norman says , clarke said , but the loopholes in the agreement were the type that any manager would have picked up on right away and would have probably done the same thing there s no genius involved jack ferreira , general manager of the san jose sharks , remembers bargaining with clarke when ferreira worked for the north stars and clarke worked for the flyers he is pretty intense and pretty competitive , ferreira said a deal with him is n't usually done in one conversation he s always looking for the edge i think that is a carryover from when he was a player a tough player as captain of the broad street bullies of the 1970 s , clarke twice won the hart trophy bill clement , a former teammate who now announces hockey on television , remains a friend of clarke and remembers him as a ruthless player we revered him and we felt threatened by him , clement said when it was time to say something , he 'd come up to your face , one on one and when it was time to break someone s ankle with a hockey stick , clarke would do that , too , the way he did to valery kharlamov of the soviet union in 1972 clement said clarke was painfully shy as a young player and has never needed accolades from others for selfesteem both clarkie and bob gainey are shy , they are introverts who are secure in themselves , clement said although clarke speaks nothing but repectful words about his philadelphia experience and admits mistakes that led to his exit , clement and several others said clarke was shaken by the first professional setback of his adult life it was pretty easy to sense his pain , clement said it was a sad deterioration of a situation he grew up as an infant in that organization he did n't arrive in that organization as an adult businessman , the way he did in minnesota now , he is much freer emotionally in minnesota he got a clean start with a brandnew organization he s doing well good for him photo bob clarke , who helped turn the north stars around in one year , during clinching game against edmonton glen sather , oilers' president , was on monitor \( associated press for the new york times \)
oakland a tiny brick building near the ramapo river here stands as mute testimony to the delicate balance that exists between man and his fragile environment within the darkened building is a well a shaft thrust 120 feet deep into the quarternary stratified drift , a vast underground reservoir formed more than 16 million years ago the pump in the well house is now silent until last fall , it drew 700 , 000 gallons of water each day and then dispersed it to the residents of oakland but now the reservoir goes untouched , for somewhere nearby or perhaps even miles away a manmade chemical has seeped through the ground and tainted the underground pool we 're trying to find the source of the contamination , said robert hammer , borough administrator for oakland , but it s sort of like looking for a needle in a haystack chemical used in dry cleaning the contaminant is tetrachloroethylene , a chemical most frequently used as a drycleaning agent according to standards set by the state department of environmental protection , one billionth of an ounce of tetrachloroethylene in a single ounce of water renders it unsafe to drink the amount of the contaminant in water drawn from the well is two and onehalf times that level as a result , the well , called oakland well no 5 , was shut down , and officials have been scrambling to replace the lost water well no 5 represents 20 percent of our production capacity , mr hammer said we could have a problem if we do n't replace it by the summer the contamination was discovered last april during a routine waterquality test the test disclosed contaminant concentrations of 25 parts per billion in the water drawn from the well david fagerlund , director of oakland s public works department , said the well was monitored over the next several months to determine whether the april reading had been a passing anomaly we tested the well three different times , he said , and found the test results to be no different than the first time continuing use is criticized the department of environmental protection was notified , he said , and the well was closed in october residents , however , are troubled that officials allowed the well to be used after the results of the first test indicated problems i feel strongly that the minute the contamination was known , the public should have been advised , said carolyn karg , president of voices of concerned citizens alliance , a local environmental group i have two small grandchildren who come to visit me and if i had known , those babies would have had bottled water mrs karg said her organization was also monitoring the cleanliness of the ramapo river , which flows through oakland anything that goes into the river can eventually end up in the drinking water , mrs karg said and though it s treated before we get it , that s not a wonderful thing to contemplate mr fagerlund , however , said the contamination found in the well probably did not come from the river tetrachloroethylene , being a volatile chemical , he said , evaporates quickly upon contact with the air as a result , he said , it is not ordinarily found in surface water and as for the delay in closing the well , mr fagerlund said , the levels detected were not severe enough to require immediate closure the state says that i can run that well for a year if i want to , even with the results we have , he said the reason , he said , is that water from the no 5 well mixes with the water from all the other wells in the borough s water system and as a result the contaminant is diffused to acceptable levels nevertheless , he said , the borough decided to close the well as soon as the contamination was confirmed by the third test since that time , he said , officials have been busy investigating the problem and potential solutions converse environmental east , an environmental engineering firm in parsippany , was hired to determine the source and the flow direction of the hazardous chemical , but the company was not able to locate the origin of the contamination , said joseph zaniello , a borough engineer though there are several dry cleaning establishments in oakland , mr zaniello said , none of them are particularly suspect we still do n't know where or what direction it s coming from , he said the borough considered treating the water to remove the contaminant the possiblities include aeration , which would cause the chemical to evaporate ionization , a method of removing impurities through electrical charges , and charcoal filtering but all three methods are costly , mr zaniello said , and none could be completed in time to meet the expected increased demand for water this summer one alternative rejected mr hammer , the borough administrator , said that one other cleaning method had been considered we could run the well to waste , he said , which would mean pumping water out of the aquifer and into the river until the water runs clean that alternative has been rejected , he said , at least for the time being my experience in another community was that we pumped a well to waste for a year and it never cleared , he said at the end of the year we had to treat it anyway upon the recommendation of the township engineer , public works officials decided to seek an alternative to the tainted well they have examined a test well across town that had been dug 18 years ago , when oakland was considering selling water to neighboring municipalities we pumped it , and we tested it , and it tests out fine , mr fagerlund said right now it s just a bare pipe sticking three feet out of the ground but hopefully it will be in operation by july 1 mr fagerlund said that before the well could be used , it would have to be redrilled and fitted with larger well casing a pump will then be installed and connections made with the borough s main water system it s a larger well than the one we shut down , mr fagerlund said it should be ideal it will give us an extra margin of safety despite the fact that the new well is expected to be operating by summer and will produce twice as much water as the contaminated well , officials and residents are still quietly concerned about the potential for future pollution of their water supply well no 4 , for instance , which produces 8 percent of the borough s water supply , is only 250 feet from the contaminated well no 5 though well no 4 now tests clean , officials say , it is impossible to accurately predict the flow patterns of underground aquifers fuel truck struck in accident and recently , oakland residents and officials experienced an environmental nightmare that has intensified their concerns on feb 25 , at 6 am , a fuel truck making a delivery to an oakland gas station was accidentally struck by another vehicle the truck s discharge valve was damaged , causing 4 , 000 gallons of gasoline to gush out of the tanker though police officers and firefighters at the scene were able to rescue the driver of the automobile , they were powerless to stem the flow of fuel into the street and nearby streams because oakland residents use septic tanks , the borough has no central sewer system to direct wastewater to treatment plants as a result , the fuel that ran down storm drains ultimately ended up in the ramapo river officials have been testing all the town s wells since the incident so far no contamination has been found and mr fagerlund said there were no plans to change the slogan that appears on some public works department trucks and stationery one of the best things about oakland is its water photos the view along ramapo valley road , above , in oakland , and veterans' park , with the public library in background officials found that one of the borough s wells , representing 20 percent of capacity , was contaminated \( photographs by keith meyers the new york times \) map highlighting the town of oakland
high levels of a kidney hormone can predispose people to heart attacks even if they have no other risk factors , a new study has found in an eightyear study that followed 1 , 717 people with mild to moderate high blood pressure , investigators discovered that those who had elevated levels of the kidney hormone renin \( pronounced reenin \) were five times more likely to have a heart attack than those whose renin levels were low this relationship was independent of other conditions that predispose people to heart disease , including smoking , high cholesterol levels , high blood pressure , and diabetes in addition , none of the subjects in the study with low renin levels and no other risk factors had heart attacks prevention could result heart disease researchers said the finding , if confirmed by other studies , could lead to preventive treatment for people at high risk for heart attacks two clases of drugs widely used to treat high blood pressure also lower renin levels tests for renin levels are already available through commercial laboratories in addition , knowing renin levels could help doctors determine treatments for people with heart disease those with high renin levels could undergo bypass surgery or other more drastic treatments earlier dr john laragh of new york hospitalcornell medical center , is the principal author of the new paper , which appears today in the new england journal of medicine he said the results could also explain one of the mysteries of heart attacks in world studies to date , at least half the heart attacks occur in people with normal cholesterol levels , who do n't smoke , who do n't have diabetes and who do n't even have high blood pressure , he said why are they having heart attacks \? the clue , he said , could be renin experts call for caution but experts also called for caution in interpreting the results they emphasized that it could be very costly to suddenly start treating high renin levels a drug that lowers renin levels , ace inhibitors , for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors , is expensive another type of drug that reduces renin levels , beta blockers , are less expensive but have more side effects in addition , tests for renin levels are complicated and involve additional health care costs several experts said they would like to see much larger studies confirm the result and demonstrate that lowering renin levels prevents heart attacks before recommending wholesale changes in medical practice this is an important paper , said dr victor j dzau , an expert on high blood pressure from the stanford university school of medicine who wrote an editorial in the medical journal accompanying the study while calling for further studies , he said it is quite impressive that the heart attacks occurred in the high renin patients he also said that he personally would prescribe ace inhibitors to lower blood pressure , all other things being equal it s very intriguing , said dr charles hennekens , an epidemiologist and internist at harvard university school of public health but i would be much more inclined toward recommending changes in medical care if the study were confirmed by a larger studies renin regulates blood pressure and the amount of salt the body retains but although high renin levels cause high blood pressure , they are not the only cause as many as a third of people with high blood pressure have normal renin levels for years , some investigators have regarded renin as a very likely culprit in causing heart disease previous studies by dr laragh and dr michael alderman of the albert einstein college of medicine who was a principal collaborator in the new study have indicated that people with high renin levels might be more likely to have heart attacks or strokes but those studies were not designed to answer that question definitively renin unleashes a flood of a second hormone , angiotensin angiotensin , in turn , makes blood vessels clamp down like they were held in a vise when scientists inject animals with angiotensin , the animals have heart attacks and strokes not only does renin predispose animals to heart attacks but the converse also seems to be true , dr dzau said recent animal studies have shown that when renin is blocked by ace inhibitors , the heart is protected from damage in heart attacks it is not known whether people who take ace inhibitors are protected from heart attacks but dr laragh said that other studies have shown that people who take beta blockers have fewer heart attacks and drugs that raise renin levels when they lower blood pressure have not prevented heart attacks these drugs , diuretics , are the oldest and cheapest of the drugs marketed to lower blood pressure investigators have been disappointed by studies showing that they prevent strokes but not heart attacks dr laragh said diuretics cost a patient a few pennies a day , beta blockers about 20 cents a day and ace inhibitors about 1 a day

mayor david n dinkins announced yesterday that the city would mount a major campaign to evict public housing tenants who own guns illegally in a dramatic reflection of his theme , his speech in a brooklyn housing project was interrupted by the noise of nearby gunfire the plan , modeled on programs under which hundreds of drug dealers have been evicted , would be the most sweeping effort of its kind in the nation , although a similar effort has been mounted in chicago but civil liberties advocates in new york immediately challenged the constitutionality of evicting people merely for possessing guns illegally no one was injured when a string of shots rang out across the cypress hills houses project in the east new york section , but some in the crowd of 150 listening to mr dinkins ducked and others started to run after a moment of shouts and confusion , the mayor calmed the jittery crowd , telling them to let the police handle the situation he then finished his 25minute speech and stayed to shake hands with residents of the drugembattled project the irony of it , the mayor said later here i am talking about gun control and i'm hearing gunshots hearing shots and ducking for cover , people in the audience said later , is a familiar activity in the cypress hills houses , where a 4yearold was hit in the leg by a stray bullet early monday to the mayor , the gunshots probably came as a surprise , said timothy luis , who is 40 years old to those of us who live here and raise our children out here , the shots were nothing out of the ordinary in the last six months , 72 people have been killed and 470 have been wounded by gunfire in public housing projects in new york city , housing officials said the program the mayor announced includes a number of initiatives to rid the projects of people who own guns illegally the plan would start eviction procedures against tenants who have been arrested on weapons charges , would speed criminal prosecution of the cases and would offer cash bounties to people who tip off the police about residents who keep weapons it also calls for the deployment of 63 officers on overtime wages to patrol nine of the most dangerous projects every day between midnight and 4 am 'why should i harbor criminals \? ' people are living in terror and many are living captive to the inner rooms of their apartments , said laura d blackburne , the chairwoman of the housing authority it infuriates me because it is not necessary i have 200 , 000 good families on my waiting list who want to get into public housing , so why should i harbor criminals \? ms blackburne and the plan s proponents say they are certain of their legal right to evict people for possessing illegal guns , but civil libertarians say such a blanket rule may run afoul of constitutional guarantees to due process under the 14th amendment we have serious problems with it because it s another attempt at a shortcut , norman siegel , director of the new york civil liberties union , said what they would have to show in our opinion would be activity that interferes with other tenants and their rights ms blackburne and federal housing officials disagree , saying the state housing authority law and federal regulations give the authority the right to evict undesirable tenants we believe that we have as much right to require occupancy standards as any other landlords , ms blackburne said the possession of illegal firearms is a crime and we have no responsibility to house criminals if we can evict people for keeping unauthorized dogs in their apartments , then we can evict people who keep guns in their apartment ms blackburne said the authority would also require all tenants to sign an amendment to their leases specifying that illegal gun possession and drugrelated activity are causes for eviction in addition , the authority will set up a hot line number \( 212 \) gunsend for residents to provide information about illegal gun possession to the police on an anonymous basis the authority has been successful in ousting residents accused of drug dealing in addition to using the normal eviction procedure , which can take up to three years , housing officials said , the authority , along with district attorneys and federal prosecutors , has also used a state statute , the bawdy house law , that allows the evictions of tenants who use their apartments for illegal or immoral activities , and federal forfeiture laws to cancel the leases of drugdealing tenants in 1990 , the authority evicted 492 families and individuals for drug dealing none of the evictions have been successfully challenged , officials said in chicago , lawyers for the city s housing authority said they had not met any serious legal challenges to evictions for gun possession , although the national rifle association has threatened to take the issue before a judge there was no evidence that the shots that interrupted mr dinkins s speech were intended for the mayor , said vincent pizzo , the chief of detectives for the housing police he said the shooting was caused by an argument between two groups of young men in front of a cypress hills building at 700 euclid avenue , which is about a block and a half from where the mayor was speaking a 22yearold man who lived in that building was arrested last night and charged with firing the shots the suspect , ivan mcloughlin , who is unemployed , was charged with reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon mr pizzo said the two groups were apparently arguing over drugs or turf he said the gun had not been recovered the mayor had received an anonymous death threat earlier in the day , but the police discounted it and said there was no connection to the shots photo as mayor david n dinkins described his program to evict public housing tenants who own guns illegally , the sound of gunfire interrupted his speech , causing some spectators to duck or run for cover with the mayor at the cypress hills houses in east new york was laura d blackburne , left , chairwoman of the new york housing authority , and housing authority police officials \( new york city housing authority photo unit \) \( pg b2 \)

vistas high school , just off the lobby of the headquarters of honeywell inc , which makes home thermostats and aircraft instruments nearly all the students are teenagers , single and collecting welfare checks and food stamps or living with relatives who do inside , they give their children breakfast and deliver them to a daycare center adjacent to the girls' schoolroom classes start at 9 30 and end at 4 this is a novel venture , a school for young mothers in the lap of big business now in its second year , the school is an effort to steer two generations , the mothers and their children , from dependence on welfare honeywell proposed the school , supplied the space , largely equipped it and cleans it the minneapolis school system runs it , provides the buses , the courses and two teachers hennepin county provides childcare workers , and other agencies provide a parttime nurse and volunteer help new vistas is a corporate adaptation of the 20yearold , much larger new futures public school that honeywell contributes to in albuquerque , nm , and that serves only teenage mothers , motherstobe and their children what makes the school here unique is the students' daily exposure to the business world unpaid internships in honeywell s credit union , paid summer jobs at honeywell and volunteer mentors for some students here , babies that might have been agents of failure and despair have instead become catalysts for growing up fast and getting jobs she s so important , tiffany santucci , 18 and a senior , said of her 18monthold daughter , amanda she shows me how important life is , how important it is to get educated all the things i did n't do i want to do for her if it was n't for this school , i would be at home taking care of her angela carrier , 17 , mother of a yearold son , davonte , lives on 437 a month in aid to families with dependent children and 150 in food stamps i'm going to college next spring to be a nurse , ms carrier said new vistas is largely the project of the chairman and chief executive of honeywell , james j renier , 61 and a father of eight he has testified before congress on federal aid for children and has headed committees of the nation s biggest businessmen dealing with education in all , mr renier is probably the business world s leading proponent of building a better school system to accommodate the poor and of bringing early childhood education and social and health services all under one roof dollarsandcents decision however charitable his feelings for children , mr renier says his corporate interest is purely economic welfare is costly for honeywell and all other taxpayers for every dollar spent on child care and education , honeywell officials say , the taxpayer saves 6 a study of adolescent mothers by the minneapolis planning department five years ago found that 50 percent were on welfare five years after their pregnancy to the degree that we can avoid these things , we are helping all industries' bottom line , mr renier said in an interview poor prenatal and child care also restrict the supply of competent future workers available for honeywell and other employers and the lower birth rates of the 1970 s and 1980 s , in restricting the supply still more , give industry an extra incentive to see that children are brought up healthy it s one of the most selfserving things in the world for a corporation , mr renier said with the help of welfare support and financial aid , two of last year s five seniors have entered the university of minnesota here , a third will enter in january and a fourth has enrolled in a local community college the fifth works as a a retail store clerk and is now off welfare new vistas is quite unlike the conventional high school there are no cliques , proms or sports and none of a high school s bustle the students seem fiercely focused on just two things their babies and graduation computers and a personal pace students must take the same basic courses required in other city schools , plus courses in family planning and child development and a day each week helping in the daycare rooms there are no lectures or classes as such admission is voluntary , and the school is no more selective than any regular high school its calendar follows that of the city s other schools the school is a large , quiet room on one side are small tables where the two teachers and volunteers sit with two or three students and help with textbook work on the other side students work at computers that lead them through courses at a pace each student sets for herself
detroit , july 25 the minnesota twins regained their hitting touch tonight , and the timing was great for scott erickson after two days of failing to hit with runners on base , the twins pounded out 14 hits , and beat the tigers , 93 , to keep a fourgame lead in the american league west the hitting helped erickson pick up his 14th victory , tops in the major leagues erickson \( 143 \) gave up three runs , two earned , on six hits in five and twothirds innings he threw 110 pitches in his third start since his stint on the disabled list , which was plenty of reason for manager tom kelly to

washington , aug 4 congressional democrats agree that president bush could be vulnerable on domestic policy matters but they cannot agree on how to capitalize on that vulnerability or just how potent such an approach might be by the time congress left town this weekend for its august recess , leaders in both the house and the senate had spent weeks trying to muscle through bills on transportation , abortion rights , crime , civil rights and unemployment , all of which president bush has threatened to veto democratic strategists and lawmakers are convinced that this is potentially strong campaign ammunition the lawmakers have delivered dozens of floor speeches criticizing the president on racial issues , unemployment and even drought relief they are trying to paint mr bush as a president with a oneword answer to every domestic problem no the president has acknowledged his interest in foreign affairs , senator george j mitchell of maine , the majority leader , said in an interview last week , and his disinterest in domestic affairs is now obvious to all americans criticism from gephardt at a news conference on friday , representative richard a gephardt , the house majority leader , said up until now , the president has found a lot of emergencies , aid to the kurds , aid to many different countries around the world but he ca n't quite bring himself to see that there s an emergency here in the united states with people who are out of work , who 've exhausted their unemployment benefits and are having trouble taking care of their families the coordinated congressional attack has clearly hit its mark in a response in a friday news conference , the president said americans should not listen to the charges by frantic democrats trying to say we do n't have a domestic policy and i am not going to lose interest in world peace , and i do n't think the american people want me to but democrats remain divided about whether forcing vetoes that congress cannot override is a good political strategy for a sometimes disorganized caucus of lawmakers who have a wide variety of priorities and , as yet , no compelling presidential candidate to take on the president directly in short , the democrats have figured out just how to call george bush s bluff , but they cannot agree on the message or the messenger they have themselves over a barrel , eddie mahe , a republican campaign consultant , said they cannot come to any consensus in any real way mr mahe , like republican partisans in congress and in the bush administration , is gleeful about the democrats' problem on friday , mr bush met with house republicans to assure them that he was prepared to work with them to promote the republican party s domestic agenda that agenda is likely to repackage issues like home ownership for the poor , education and preventive health care espoused by such cabinet members as louis w sullivan , the secretary of health and human services lamar alexander , the secretary of education , and jack f kemp , the secretary of housing and urban development there are ideas on the table that change the way government interacts , said rich bond , a republican strategist with ties to the white house what s wrong with that idea \? republican strategists inside congress and out expect the president to redefine the nation s domestic agenda to fit his own definitions , continue to veto what he does not like and blame congress for stalemates and republicans are gearing up to dispute the democrats' contention that the president has no domestic policy it s the only strategy they have , senator phil gramm of texas , the chairman of the national republican senatorial commmittee , said of the democrats in politics , you go to your strong suit , even if the highest card happens to be the seven of spades but for all their boasting that the white house has a domestic agenda , republicans are aware of the polls that show how vulnerable the president may be on domestic policy a new york times cbs news poll conducted june 36 found that while 68 percent of those questioned said they approved of the president s handling of foreign policy , 48 percent disapproved of his handling of the economy and only 41 percent approved the telephone poll of 1 , 424 adults had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points even more recently , a wall street journal nbc news poll of 1 , 004 registered voters conducted july 2629 , showed 74 percent approved of the way mr bush has handled foreign policy , while 52 percent disapproved of his handling of the economy thirtyeight percent said they approved of his handling of the economy the poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points yet , with precious few presidential candidates on the horizon to articulate mr bush s perceived weaknesses , the democrats are essentially stymied we have had an inability to create an awareness of our policy , mr mitchell said obviously , we 're not doing it as effectively and as well as we could , but it is very hard to compete with the president for access to the attention of the american people mr bush has shrugged off such challenges with a series of veto threats at least 10 made during the 102d congress since he took office in 1989 , mr bush has vetoed 21 pieces of legislation none of the vetoes has been overriden by congress i think vetoes are a dangerous strategy for him , said kevin phillips , a republican political analyst , except he has enough credentials in foreign and defense policy not to have to worry about the losses he is likely to absorb if he vetoes domestic issues mr phillips , like other republicans , says democrats are not well equipped to take on the president they have an instinct for the capillaries , not the jugular , he said part of the democrats' problem is that they do not adhere to a single political discipline this was demonstrated again last week , when two strongwilled committee chairmen , representative dan rostenkowski of illinois and representative robert a roe of new jersey , argued to a standoff over the gas tax as part of the transportation bill if the democratic party were in europe , it would be five distinct parties , said representative joe moakley of maasachusetts , the chairman of the rules committee , where the gastax negotiations fell apart we have an awful big umbrella covering an awful lot of different people mr rostenkowski is no fan of forcing vetoes to make a political point democrats , he said , should be expending more energy negotiating legislative differences so that congress can produce a bill the president would sign the problem with democrats is we promise more than we can deliver , and then we do n't deliver on the promises we make , and people view us as irresponsible , mr rostenkowski said no one knows those weaknesses better than george bush clearly , bush is playing a political game where he s trying to use congress as his foil , said geoffrey garin , a democratic consultant a good presidential campaign by the democrats will take an awful lot of the pressure off of congress democratic leaders are counting on the white house to do some of their dirty work for them we do n't think they run a domestic policy effort at the white house , said paul tully , the political director of the democratic national committee we think they run a continuing election campaign photos rep richard a gephardt democrat of missouri he ca n't quite bring himself to see that there s an emergency here in the united states with people who are out of work \( david conklin \) senator phil gramm republican of texas it s the only strategy they have in politics , you go to your strong suit , even if the highest card happens to be the seven of spades \( paul conklin \)
washington , sept 13 the american public may still be befuddled about judge clarence thomas s views on abortion and affirmative action but what has clearly emerged after four days of senate hearings is a better glimpse of the supreme court nominee s personal side after weeks of intense rehearsals at the white house , judge thomas was surely delivering a somewhat calculated performance but beneath that is a vivid , though unfinished , portrait of a person who exudes a sense of humor that is often ingratiatingly selfdeprecating at one point today , senator howell t heflin , an alabama democrat , asked judge thomas what his minor was at holy cross college i think protests , replied judge thomas , in a reference to his days as a campus demonstrator the audience broke into laughter judge thomas s humor may be one of the strongest things he has going for him for he has also displayed a certain lack of confidence , although it is not always apparent on the television screen at certain points on wednesday and thursday when the questioning got particularly tough , he sometimes nervously braced himself , sticking his left leg straight out and wrapping his right leg under the chair contrast with souter nor have judge thomas s responses been as seamless as those of justice david h souter before the committee a year ago justice souter revealed little of his personality as he sat stonefaced before the senators judge thomas s moods are closer to the surface he looks alternately at ease and tense chris brewster , a washington lawyer who is an old friend of judge thomas , said he chatted during thursday s lunch break with the 43yearold nominee , who remarked about the strain he was under he just said , 'it s tough out there , ' recalled mr brewster , who worked with judge thomas in the missouri attorney general s office and later for senator john c danforth , republican of missouri , who is the judge s chief patron i told him that today he looked particularly strong he said , 'well , it s hard' and senator alan k simpson , a wyoming republican and a staunch defender of judge thomas on the committee , said everybody gets a chance to play a shrink here there s a lot of head stuff going on the questions on his credibility would hurt or pain anyone he seems to be controlling himself well if judge thomas is coming across as a man who does not have an answer for everything , that may work to his benefit for a nominee who is trying to emphasize his common sense and compassion rather than his scholarship , an occasional foible can be a plus indeed , judge thomas sometimesseems able to transform a gaffe into a victory during a probing line of questioning thursday , senator herb kohl , a wisconsin democrat , pointedly reminded the nominee that he had attacked congress as a coalition of elites and you said that congress was no longer primarily a deliberative or even a lawmaking body , mr kohl pressed judge thomas is that how you feel \? today \? the nominee asked with a weak smile and perfect comic timing today , the senator said uh judge thomas began , breaking out into a big laugh mr kohl , who by now was also chuckling , quickly moved on to another line of questioning in the 23 hours of hearings , judge thomas has had to do far more listening than speaking he has always managed to look interested in what the senators have to say although there have been tense moments , judge thomas has not lost his cool he has remained courteous , careful to address each lawmaker as senator he also exhibited discipline , resisting the enticement of the five flavors of roll candy that the staff of senator joseph r biden jr , the delaware democrat who heads the judiciary committee , placed before him to further disarm his inquisitors , judge thomas has also sprinked in reallife anecdotes whenever he can he recounted in his opening statement , for instance , how as a child in georgia we caught minnows in the creeks , fiddler crabs in the marshes but many lawmakers had heard judge thomas s stories before frederick d mcclure , the white house congressional liaison who sits behind judge thomas at the proceedings , said many of the judge s remarks this week echoed comments he made in courtesy calls to the senators earlier this summer the one thing that surprised him , mr mcclure said , was judge thomas s quip about professional football asked why he has refused to give his positions on some issues , the nominee turned the discussion to how the dallas cowboys lost to the washington redskins monday night and i am totally convinced , judge thomas said , that every referee in those games is a redskins fan , but none would admit to it pressed by mr biden , he admitted he was a cowboys fan i did n't know he was going to pull the cowboys thing , mr mcclure said that was kind of cute photo judge clarence thomas kissing his wife , virginia , during the midday break yesterday in his confirmation hearings at right was his son , jamal \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
for two dozen homeless people , the spot under the west side highway in manhattan was their coop community , a place with television , homecooked meals and reading lamps yesterday , they were forced to leave it , to pack up their sleeping bags , books and cooking equipment and make way for the demolition of the ramp where they had built a camp , near west 73d street at the edge of riverside park they left behind the tarpaulincovered plywood shelters that they had built after a previous eviction , from the rotunda near 79th street yesterday , most of them refused help from city workers who offered them shelter instead , they chose to travel together in search of a new home we look out for each other , and we do n't want to be separated from our friends , said one man , who called himself the captain he said the others look to him for guidance 5 pm deadline joe russo , the director of bridges for the city s department of transportation , said that the ramp , which slopes along the ground above an amtrak tunnel , was being removed because it is corroded and dangerous the homeless people had to move by 5 pm the eviction broke up what one of the homeless people said was no transient community this is a stationary thing , said the man , who referred to himself only as papa doc it is a closed community , a coop we residents vote on everything , including who can come in , which is no one now papa doc , who described himself as a recycler and a fresh air environmentalist , hurried to pack his belongings his home , like most of the others , had a bed , shelves and chairs that he had scavenged among the items he was discarding were cans of furniture polish , milk crates and a hardcover copy of the power broker alexi , the resident cat , scurried about as papa doc asked that the mess be excused we would n't usually have it like this we could n't the rats would come we always kept it clean it s our house joint housing unavailable watching the eviction were workers from the city s human resources administration , neighborhood residents and a few police officers preparing to dismantle what was left behind from what i see , this has more of the aspects of a community then most other encampments , said raymond diaz , a deputy commissioner of the human resources administration i see less substance abuse , i understand many of these people are employed , and i suspect that they would like to move together as a community but the city is not prepared to provide housing for them as a community many of the homeless people , among them a pregnant woman , said that although they work and receive welfare benefits , they cannot afford housing and shelters , they said , do not offer the safety or space of their own camp 'i have 15 suits' none of us want city facilities , the captain said why would we when everything we have is right here \? i work for the public works program , he added i have 15 suits and 35 dress shirts i could n't keep that stuff in a shelter i would n't have the room the midnight runners , a westchesterbased advocacy group for the homeless , helped the residents pack and provided them with garbage bags it s bad enough to lose their homes they should n't have to lose their possetions too , said jeanne newman , a volunteer for the group residents of nearby apartment buildings said they were sorry the encampment was disrupted but some added that they were relieved to see the homeless people go i think it s pathetic that anyone is homeless , but i have also been menaced , said judith weiss , who lives on riverside drive she said the recent killing of a woman walking her dog not far from the area confirmed her fears i can no longer walk home from lincoln center alone at night , she said the homeless people said they would go peacefully , but none would say where this is not the 60 s we 're not protesting , the captain said we 've got damn good sense all i really feel right now is empty , he said
boston at the end of the battle of agincourt in shakespeare s henry the fifth king henry says this note doth tell me of ten thousand french that in the field lie slain where is the number of our english dead \? edward the duke of york , the earl of suffolk , sir richard ketly , davy gam , esquire none else of name and of all other men but five and twenty o god , thy arm was here victory in the war with iraq leaves us with such feelings of awe with half a million soldiers on each side , the united states and its coalition partners had only about 140 killed how did it happen \? what are the consequences \? even at this early hour we can begin to draw some lessons for the future first , the united states had outstanding political and military leadership having decided on war , months ago , president bush prosecuted it with impressive skill in colin powell and norman schwarzkopf he had generals of uncommon intellect and resourcefulness to pay those deserved compliments is to recognize a second feature of this war going it alone treating it as an american show would not have worked our leaders were successful in good part because they understood that president bush and secretary of state baker worked hard to organize the coalition mr bush even managed to handle the lastminute soviet peace initiative with just enough politeness to avoid fatal injury to ussoviet relations general schwarzkopf s concern was evident at his victory briefing in the praise he carefully gave each participating force the united nations played a crucial role a third point the security council s resolutions shaped the coalition and the politics of the conflict to the very end its authorization to use force was essential if mr bush s talk of a new world order is to have any meaning , the united nations will have to play a much greater part in future in preventing war the un system can work we know that now and prevention is far better than war that is a practical point , not just an idealistic one for a fourth lesson of the persian gulf war is that neither the united states nor the world can afford to repeat it we fought the war on money promised from others the us will not want that to be a pattern , making itself a provider of mercenaries the colossal effort of sending 500 , 000 soldiers halfway around the world cannot be made again soon , if ever it is not just a question of money the particular combination of interests and opportunities that made this war go as it did is not likely to recur do n't get the idea it will always be this easy there is a fifth lesson , put that way by prof barry posen , a military expert at mit the terrain was favorable to our hightech weapons , and we were up against a secondrate gangster we must not confuse what we did here with using military power to redirect the domestic politics of a society saddam hussein did make it easier seldom has a tyrant had more military confidence with less reason seldom has one missed with such consistent folly every chance to save something from defeat there is another factor that made it possible to win this war so quickly one that we have mostly put out of our minds that is the terrible punishment that we inflicted on iraqis from the air the casualties are as disproportionate as they were at agincourt estimates of the number of iraqi soldiers killed approach 50 , 000 an unknown number of civilians died in the bombing , too , and civilian deaths are likely to increase as a result of the destruction of water , power and sewage facilities in iraq s major cities arabs and others who were entranced by saddam hussein will quickly be disenchanted , i think but they may go on asking themselves whether the world would have paid so little attention to western deaths in such numbers weaponry has been glorified in this war but we have to remember that the war occurred because of the weapons the world supplied to saddam hussein over the years the fundamental lesson has to be that we must control the sale of arms to the whole region from here on not just to iraq but to all the players if we arm saudi arabia , then israel will want more , then syria , then iran at a minimum , this war should teach us that the middle east is too dangerous a place for limitless weaponry
a new effort is under way to bring the 1994 world cup closer to new york , a move that would satisfy the wishes of the world governing body for soccer to have a greater presence in the largest united states city officials at the new jersey sports and exposition authority and rutgers university are planning to develop a bid that would bring the opening ceremonies of the monthlong tournament to giants stadium in east rutherford , nj , and one or more games to the university s football stadium in piscataway implicit in the proposal would be an enlargement of the rutgers stadium to 40 , 000 seats or more currently , it can accommodate 23 , 000 on benchseats with room for an additional 7 , 000 with temporary stands a source familiar with the plans who asked that he not be identified said yesterday that new jersey at least intends to bid , although the number of games for rutgers had not yet been determined cities that have an interest in staging any of the 52 games of the tournament , generally regarded as one of the premier sports events in the world , have until may 1 to submit their bids to the 1994 organizing committee already , nine cities have filed the hostcities deposits required with bids the venues selected are scheduled to be announced in december until recently , the nearest site to new york with interest for participating in the world cup was new haven , where officials plan to submit a bid proposal for the yale bowl , a charming but old stadium with 70 , 896 permanent seats none of the major metropolitan area facilities yankee stadium , shea stadium or giants stadium had shown any interest the first two had prior committments to baseball giants stadium demurred because of the costly construction necessary to remove roughly 12 rows of seats to accommodate the wider field required by international regulations princeton had initially expressed an interest in participating but later declined alan rothenberg , the president of the world cup organizing committee , said yesterday from los angeles that he was aware of renewed interest by new jersey but was uncertain of the details it s something that sounds very attractive , he said after the idea was explained i like the idea of another feasible option he added that he did not envision a bid by new jersey affecting new haven s efforts on a recent visit to the area , officials from the federation internationale de football association , the zurichbased world governing body , better known by its initials , fifa , were impressed , he said , with the new haven bid new haven has put together an excellent bid , rothenberg said now we can see which looks better or maybe we can use them together the possibility that the world cup would have no presence closer to new york has been a major irritation to fifa ever since the united states won the staging rights to the tournament in 1988 once the 1990 tournament , held in italy , ended , fifa officials began stressing their preference for a new york site but it has only been in the last few weeks that the idea emerged to combine efforts for world cup activities at the two new jersey sites
in april 1945 , american troops occupying a german town called quedlinburg were ordered to guard a mine shaft containing an extraordinary trove of medieval artworks and manuscripts they were the treasury of a local church , and had been placed there for safekeeping at least twice , a soldier named joe t meador sneaked into the mine shaft and left with quedlinburg treasure hidden under his coat wrapping the items in plain brown paper , he sent them home to whitewright , tex , where he died in 1980 last year the quedlinburg treasure was finally tracked to texas by then a german foundation had paid a hefty fee , later adjusted to 175 million , for a ninthcentury manuscript to a representative of joe meador s brother , jack the same representative was soon offering another manuscript for 500 , 000 the rest of the treasure , apart from two artworks joe meador may have given friends , was stashed in assorted family safedeposit boxes getting jack meador and his sister , joan meador cook , to return what their brother had stolen has n't been easy despite a lawsuit filed by the church last summer , the meadors refused to give up the goods without a cash settlement this week the german government agreed to give them 1 million , making the meadors' total share of their brother s haul a cool 275 million the german government is hardly the first litigant to decide that it s cheaper to settle a messy case out of court , but the ransom payment sets a deplorable precedent along with the cash the meadors wrung a statement from the german government that it has no desire for the us government to take any action against the family the meadors hope that will forestall any effort by the irs to collect estate taxes and by the justice department to prosecute them for possessing stolen property or transporting it across state or international borders may the meadors hope in vain there was reason for germany to accede to their cupidity , but none at all for our government if the us takes no action , that will leave the meadors with their illgotten stash and the rest of america with evidence that honesty is a fool s game

i suggest that it is obvious to everyone as to why , said mr dorsey , who will become majority leader when the republicans take over the senate next month it has just one motivation , and it is a political motivation mr dalton said moving the date on which an income tax increase would expire to jan 1 , 1993 , from july 1 , 1992 , is a practical idea that would make the rollback conform with the calendar year income tax rates are based on calendaryear income and the current new tax became effective at the beginning of this year , six months after the other new taxes the establishment of a tax study commission is a condition gov jim florio set for supporting the addition of the sunset provision to the tax legislation he pushed through the legislature 18 months ago mr dalton said his idea to tie bar the five bills allowing a separate vote on each measure , but including language that says all of them or none of them must be approved would make the tax repeal plan less vulnerable to special interest groups it will deny the special interests the opportunity of picking off individual bills , he said in the short term , these amendments will enhance the ability of the repeal plan to stay intact as it moves through the legislative process in the long run , these amendments will improve the state s management of finances business blocked in assembly on the surface , mr dalton s amendments seem to put the senate democrats at loggerheads with their assembly counterparts even though assembly democrats have introduced bills to add a sunset provision to the entire tax package , the strongest support has been for rolling back only an increase in the sales tax in the assembly , the republicans continued to block business by boycotting voting sessions , a move that has threatened to bring an abrupt and acrimonious end to the lameduck session of the 204th legislature after the assembly fell two members short of the 41 needed for a quorum , the speaker , joseph v doria , suspended business until jan 6 , eight days before the end of the current legislature s twoyear term mr doria ordered three backtoback roll calls but with republicans caucusing at a ewing township diner and the democrats missing four of their 43 members two because of illness the frustrated speaker had to give up it is to my mind a very , very sad day in the history of new jersey , mr doria said as he looked out on a chamber with more than half of the seats empty it was the second time in as many meetings that republicans boycotted a voting session assemblyman garbed \( chuck \) haytaian , who will become the speaker when the republicans take over next month , has said his party will continue its boycott as long as the democrats are unable to muster a quorum after all the democrats have done the past two years , maybe it s time they finally give the people of this state a real christmas present , peace and quiet , mr haytaian said all they have to do is ride off into the sunset now mr doria told reporters last week that assembly rules and the state constitution empowered him to order the arrest of any member who did not show up for a vote last week and again today he expressed reluctance to take that step but declined to rule it out entirely tax repeal legislation was not among the 46 items that were to be considered in the assembly today but mr doria said the chamber missed voting on several important bills he said there was still time to complete assembly business , including a vote on tax repeal , if the assembly could achieve a quorum on jan 6 photos republican legislators boycotted yesterday s meeting of the new jersey assembly but sent aides to keep abreast of developments the democratic majority adjourned after the assembly did not get a 41member quorum don sico , executive director of assembly republican staff , sat alone senator john ewing , left , speaking with laurence s weiss , chairman of the new jersey senate appropriations committee , before the senate session yesterday \( photographs by laura pedrick for the new york times \)
it was the light that did the trick a clean , shrewdly directed radiance illuminating the face of the martyr and bathing the grieving expressions of his brother officers in a reflection of impossible holiness benjamin west picked up this piece of artfulness from the stage he tore back a patch of black cloud to expose a space of cerulean , celestial blue sky through which the sun shone a light of sacred purity that seemed to embrace the expiring hero it was a stupendous piece of drama brilliance and gloom , victory and death , saintly sacrifice and inconsolable sorrow set side by side , the sunlit sky of the imperial future banishing the grim clouds of past dissatisfactions the public adored grandstanding performances and responded to this one with rapture asked by a spectator whether the painter had correctly caught the expression of a dying man , david garrick was said to have thrown himself on the floor in the appropriate posture the gallery rang with applause on the morning when west s death of general wolfe , famous in rumor even before its exhibition , was at last exhibited , lines had formed down the street for admission to the royal academy s galleries the spectacle of so many high personages entering before the others offered some diversion the crowd saw come and go lord temple , william pitt \( now lord chatham \) , ancient and tottering on his bandaged legs and crutches he was later said to have spent much time before the painting , but to have complained about the general dejection to which the principals seemed \( not surprisingly \) to have succumbed the famous and notorious beauty georgiana , the duchess of devonshire , who had sketched wolfe herself , came and went as conspicuously as possible horace walpole offered predictably faint praise the unimaginably wealthy lord richard grosvenor attended he had bought the painting for the outrageous sum of 400 guineas , and many thought it had been commissioned for him in the first place finally the king arrived , and he had let it be known in advance that he did not want it george iii displayed a taste in painting that belied his reputation for bucolic simplicity his patronage , bestowed on the young and relatively obscure american artist five years earlier , had abruptly propelled west to celebrity and fortune west s agrippina with the ashes of germanicus at brundisium , in which a heroic procession files before the viewer on a shallow stage , was the kind of thing the king liked a history play in dignified motion , full of uplifting emotions and virtuous allusions but free of gimcrack mummery or popish obscurantism it was , in short , that thing for which the polite nation had been yearning a british history painting but when the king learned that his favorite painter was contemplating a death of general wolfe in which the figures were to be costumed in modern dress rather than the togas or chitons of the ancients , he let his dismay and displeasure be known there was another critic , whose authority had the power to do almost as much damage to west s career as the king s sir joshua reynolds , president of the royal academy , was at the height of his powers , both as a virtuoso painter of portraits and histories and as a theorist who in his work had redefined the canons of classicism reports of west s intentions to present wolfe s death in contemporary dress struck reynolds as an act of appalling vulgarity his objection was not simply the stuffy complaint that west was violating convention it was rather that by reporting naturalistically on a modern event he was robbing a history of the universal significance which its narrative ought to embody if the history were to persuade and endure , it was imperative to find an idealized , universal language in which its exalted conceptions could be represented , and not to distract the beholder with a flashy and elaborate spectacle , heavy with minute particularities of dress west s response was famously and invincibly american i began by remarking that the event intended to be commemorated took place on the 13th of september 1758 a year off ! in a region of the world unknown to the greeks and romans and at a period of time when no such nation and heroes in their costume any longer existed the subject i have to represent is the conquest of a great province of america by the british troops it is a topic that history will proudly record and the same truth that guides the pen of the historian should govern the pencil of the artist for all his formal protestations , west was not a reporter in paint he was a poetic inventor he was artful in constructing an image of himself as the unspoiled colonial intuitive , doggedly empirical , an innocent abroad since so much of polite london found the image beguiling in fact , his deviation from the conventions of academic history painting rested on more subtle grounds he had exposed a serious contradiction in its requirements both to be strictly faithful to the details to narrative and to render them poetically noble by the exercise of the imagination through the breach in these incompatible demands , west drove his mighty , painterly , coach and four the result was the death of general wolfe , his masterpiece
the commerce department said yesterday that spending by american consumers , which accounts for twothirds of the nation s economic activity , fell a sharp threetenths of a percent in october , the biggest decline since april , when spending fell fivetenths of a percent coming after two bleak assessments of consumer confidence released on monday , the decline suggested a mood of extreme caution among shoppers at the start of the crucial holiday season if that caution persists through november and december , several economists said , it could tip the economy back into decline in the fourth quarter growth of 24 percent in the third quarter was widely interpreted as a sign that the recession was ending weak christmas could linger moreover , said david wyss , the research director for dri mcgrawhill , an economic consulting firm , a weak christmas will mean it would be hard to get much action in the first quarter of 1992 , because retailers will be overstocked and orders anemic other reports released yesterday by the commerce department suggested that consumers were not buying because their income was not increasing , and that much of what they were purchasing was coming from abroad personal income grew a meager twotenths of a percent in october , the worst showing since july and the country s trade deficit rose 33 percent in the julyseptember quarter , to 2049 billion , the highest level this year buying imports may be wonderful for chinese manufacturers , but it s more bad news for us manufacturers , said walter k joelson , the chief economist for the general electric company jobless claims drop not all of the news was bad the labor department reported that the number of americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 80 , 000 in midnovember , the biggest oneweek improvement in almost a decade there were 413 , 000 people filing firsttime claims during the week that ended on nov 16 , down from 493 , 000 in the previous week because of the veterans day holiday , there was less time to file claims in the midnovember week , and some economists dismissed the decline as a fluke but others said the sharp drop indicated that the labor market was not as weak as the widespread reports of layoffs had suggested the labor market is not unwinding as dramatically as many had feared , and that is really good news for an economy that is trying to stay out of doubledip recession , said stephen roach , the chief economist at morgan stanley , the wall street investment firm orders to american factories for durable goods rose 3 percent in october after two consecutive declines , reaching 12379 billion , seasonally adjusted the upturn followed a 42 percent drop in september and a 41 percent fall in august but many economists discounted the slight rise , since it stemmed principally from a 53 percent surge in orders for military equipment these orders had fallen 492 percent in the previous month i just ignore defense business because it can swing so wildly , said mr joelson of general electric the relevant fact is that the numbers are very bad compared to a year ago , when they were not particularly good he noted that new orders in october for capital goods other than military items were down 16 percent from october 1990 in the third quarter , the orders were off 35 percent from a year earlier my personal sense is that what we have here is a continuation of stagnation , mr joelson added consumers are 'tapped out' this view was shared by several other economists , who used expressions like a sideways economy and an economy that is squeaking by to characterize the overall situation suggested by the figures released yesterday none expressed hope of a decisive upturn before spring , and several underlined the danger of a doubledip recession if consumers do not respond soon the economy is basically doing nothing because the consumer is doing nothing , said mr wyss of dri mcgrawhill he s tapped out and he s seeing no income gain moreover , it seems that what demand there is is being sucked off by imports irwin kellner , the chief economist for manufacturers hanover trust , added the economic pulse is beating , but it s very weak i'm not prepared to throw in the towel on a recovery yet , but it s a recovery that seems to be just barely alive
two months after deputy mayor bill lynch drew fire for charging personal expenses on city credit cards , the city council has pounced on the issue , holding hearings yesterday on legislation that would make the practice a crime the legislation was introduced by council speaker peter f vallone and is seen by many dinkins administration officials as a largely symbolic move intended to embarrass mayor david n dinkins and his top staff when some institutions are unable to offer real solutions to problems , they go swatting at gnats , the mayor s chief spokesman , leland t jones , said of the council they should get their own house in order but peg breen , mr vallone s chief spokeswoman , said the bill was not intended as a rebuke and not aimed at an individual she said mr vallone , a queens democrat , has said he believes the policy should be unequivocally set down in law for all city officials , including himself to counter criticism of mr lynch s charges , mr dinkins issued an executive order on oct 23 prohibiting the charging of personal expenses on the city s cards the directive came four weeks after articles in new york newsday reported that mr lynch , the mayor s closest adviser , had charged more than 5 , 000 in meals and other personal expenses to the city with american express and diners' club cards issued to him mr lynch later repaid the city before the mayor s order , there was no official policy on using the cards , and cardholders were allowed to make personal charges and later reimburse the city , karen de fries , the mayor s chief administrative assistant told the council s committee on standards and ethics yesterday council members said the directive has a loophole that gives city officials leeway to make personal charges after prohibiting the charges , the order s second part reads in the event such a card is used erroneously for a purchase or payment not connected with official city business , payment of the amount owed shall be made to the city forthwith the committee chairwoman , julia harrison of queens , said this section undermines the force of the prohibition she said a local law would leave no room for mistaken charges only five members of the dinkins staff have the cards issued as far back as 1975 , the charge cards are intended to simplify bookkeeping and avoid lengthy delays in repaying certain officials who travel frequently mayor has cards , too the mayor himself carries cards on city accounts with american express , diners' club and citibank , ms de fries said mr lynch , who is in charge of intergovernmental affairs , has city cards with diners' club and american express the other two mayoral aides with city credit cards are john bozzella , albany lobbyist for the city , and judy chesser , the city s washington lobbyist , both with diners' club cards one city commissioner , barbara j sabol , of the human resources administration , has a city american express account in addition , mr vallone and his chief of staff , joseph strasburg , both have city american express cards in 1990 , the mayor and his aides charged more than 160 , 000 on all the cards jennifer kimball , a spokeswoman for the mayor s office , said besides mr lynch s personal charges , ms kimball said , no other personal expenses appeared on the charge records during the same period , mr vallone and mr strasburg charged 438 , none of it for personal expenses , city council aides said
after sparking his new team to a worsttofirst national league pennant , terry pendleton yesterday completed his personal worsttofirst journey , winning the national league mostvaluableplayer award pendleton , who signed with the atlanta braves as a free agent last winter , edged last year s most valuable player , barry bonds of pittsburgh , by only 15 points , 274 to 259 , in the closest voting in 12 years bobby bonilla of the pirates , who finished second to bonds a year ago , was third with 191 points the outcome produced none of the fallout generated a day earlier by the american league voting , which cal ripken jr won after his oriole team finished sixth ripken s winning margin over cecil fielder , 32 points , was more than double pendleton s edge over bonds the 24person committee of the baseball writers association of america , two reporters from each league city , gave pendleton 12 firstplace votes to 10 for bonds and two thirdplace votes to 1 those slight differences made the big difference because each player received 10 votes for second three writers voted bonds fourth first place was worth 14 points , second 9 , third 8 and fourth 7 in the voting done before the postseason bonilla and brett butler of los angeles , who finished seventh , each received one firstplace vote team leader with the braves no one could find fault with pendleton as mvp because he made a major difference with atlanta , both on the field and in the clubhouse , serving as a leader for the younger members of the braves , who had never played in a pennant race the former st louis third baseman actually turned out better than general manager john schuerholz could have envisioned when he signed him last dec 3 to a fouryear , 102 million contract in 1990 , his seventh season with the cardinals , pendleton had his worst season , batting a careerlow 230 and driving in 58 runs , only 5 more than his careerlow the cardinals did not even pretend to want him back the yankees liked him , but general manager gene michael could n't induce him to even visit here to show the californian there was more to the new york area than hectic manhattan schuerholz , meanwhile , was the new general manager in atlanta , and his first priority was to improve the team s dreadful infield defense his offensive performance this year elated schuerholz pendleton won the league batting championship with a 319 average , and he also led the league in hits , multihit games and , tying will clark , total bases he hit a careerhigh 22 home runs and drove in 86 runs he demonstrated his durability , too , starting every game from june 15 through the nexttolast day of the regular season , when the braves clinched the western division championship bonds , who last year gained 23 of 24 firstplace votes , performed at a level only slightly below the effort that prompted those ballots he batted 292 \( 9 points lower \) , hit 25 home runs \( 8 fewer \) and drove in 116 runs \( 2 more \) pendleton earned a 100 , 000 bonus for winning , and johnson picked up 25 , 000 for his fifthplace finish fielder fed up with system detroit , nov 20 \( ap \) cecil fielder , runnerup in the american league mostvaluableplayer voting for the second year in a row , said he was not sure that he would accept the award if he ever won it last year , fielder hit 51 homers and drove in 132 runs for a weak detroit team , but was second to oakland s rickey henderson in the voting because henderson s team won a division title this year , with 44 homers and 133 rbi for a contending detroit team , fielder lost out to cal ripken jr of the sixthplace baltimore orioles they just contradicted themselves , fielder said today by telephone from his home in texas the folks who are voting for that award do n't understand , they do n't have a grip on what they 're doing i do n't get upset about too many things , but i'm very upset it s a joke as far as i'm concerned i'm just done with it the last two years , nobody put together years like i did if i win it , i do n't know if i 'd accept it
in 1979 , rickey henderson was a rookie outfielder for the oakland a s and rick cerone was a thirdyear catcher for toronto , and each stole his first base in the major leagues they then parted company over these last 12 seasons , no player has stolen more bases than henderson , 936 , and none has stolen fewer than cerone , 4 you 're kidding , cerone said recently from the mets' training camp in port st lucie , fla someone s gotta be worse than that no , he was assured , there is n't wow , geez , he said how many does that put me behind henderson \? nine hundred and thirtytwo , he was told i got a long way to go to catch up , said cerone with conviction , and just a little laugh gotta get a few bags this season henderson , loading up on steals every season , needs three to surpass the career basestealing record set by lou brock he will certainly do it early this season , if not in the a s opening game cerone , the mets' backup catcher , has n't stolen a base since 1986 , and has n't attempted one since 1987 \( it s been that long \? he asked \) yet envy and disappointment are apparent when cerone , usually a generous and joyous creature , speaks of the basestealing record that has eluded him cerone contends that but for circumstances beyond his control , he could be in henderson s fleet shoes he understands that on this issue he might be in a minority of one , at best cerone , 36 years old , came up with cleveland and has also played with the yankees , atlanta , milwaukee and boston , besides toronto and the mets they held me back , he said a lot of managers think that catchers ca n't run but i was like a thoroughbred who was n't given a chance i just did n't get the green light lou piniella was one of cerone s managers , the two crossing paths with the yankees in 1987 cerone was 0 for 1 in attempted steals that season so piniella , now the manager of the world series champion reds , was asked how come you did n't give cerone the green light \? cerone \? my god ! said piniella i 'll tell you , that s oh , boy ! let me think about this in the meantime , how would piniella describe cerone s running style \? nonexistent , he said looks like he s running in reverse he s exerting a lot of energy but he s not going anywhere did he remember why he gave cerone the go sign on his attempted steal that season \? i do n't remember i honestly do n't remember , said piniella maybe it was n't me maybe i got thrown out of the game and someone else sent him i do n't know he tried one steal that season , huh \? i lasted two years managing the yankees and if i had sent cerone any more than i did i probably would n't have lasted that long cerone takes a different slant if i 'd been given the opportunity , he said , i 'd be right there with rickey i 'd be going for a thousand to buttress the argument , he said that he would bet that his success rate is as good as henderson s for cerone , it is a bet better left unmade he has been nabbed 19 times in 23 attempts henderson has been caught 211 times in 1 , 147 tries cerone s percentage 174 , henderson s , 816 well , close , said cerone , but some of those i was caught in were hitandruns that got botched perhaps he has a point , maybe the percentage stuff is a little nitpicky but cerone does have great admiration for henderson he s in full speed when he starts , said cerone and what about him \? let s just say i'm not in henderson s second year , 1980 , he broke ty cobb s american league singleseason record of 96 stolen bases by pilfering 100 cerone , meanwhile , was stealing one base that season , after the one in 1979 , which made it the only time that he has ever stolen bases in consecutive seasons i was on a roll , said cerone he was also on a roll in being thrown out , four times in '79 and three in '80 he never again had more than three attempts in a season while henderson was cruising toward his 500th stolen base in 1984 , cerone stole his third on his lone attempt that season in 1986 , when henderson collected his 600th steal , cerone got his fourth funny , said cerone , but i do n't remember any of my steals , except for the last one i think i was with the red sox the record book says he was with milwaukee but i'm sure it was in fenway park , and sammy stewart was pitching he was right i took off before he even got the sign from the catcher , said cerone , and i went into second base standing up oh , man ! probably no one believed i would go he laughed when i took my lead off second i started thinking about stealing third i guess i got a little cocky , because on the very next pitch stewart picked me off but hey , said cerone , this happens to a lot of base runners , even rickey besides , sammy stewart had a great pickoff move everybody knows that photo rick cerone \( the new york times \)

although landscape has never enjoyed the respect accorded the figure , its worst setback was probably the advent of modernism modernist masters from matisse on have painted landscapes , of course , but none have specialized in the genre , and even when claude monet was returned to critical circulation , during the abstract expressionist era , it was largely as a putative ancestor for the new movement similarly , the museum of modern art s natural paradise show in the mid1970 s represented an attempt to link the sublime of abstract expressionism with that of hudson river school painting small wonder , then , that landscapists today , though they are proliferating , continue to approach the subject obliquely nor are there exceptions to be found in this year s alllandscape invitational at the new britain museum of american art the quiet show , organized by the museum s former curator , janice la motta , features contemporaries with reputations in new york city and elsewhere , all of whom interpret rather than record nature the style of gregory crane s paintings is expressionistic , but the atmosphere is surrealist , with intimations of hieronymus bosch that is to say , the sun shines , but so do cometlike portents , and there are trees and flowers that are not altogether of this world , not to mention the strange objects littered among them in one garden scene , these include a brass horn that is startling a black cat , together with a discarded glove in bob s hollow \( sculpture yard \) , they are the crosses growing among trees this is a scene bisected by a road that swoops almost to the sky on one side is the grove of trees and crosses , along with a blue river on the other is a barn with a small figure silhouetted in the doorway by the flash of a blow torch a breezy but not very fluent painter , mr crane who works large areas of color smooth and then dwells on details like plants with impasto and seems to count on mystification to help him through the rough spots guy goodwin s paintings could be based on aerial views of formal gardens , for most are mazes of dark , slabby shapes zigzagging in fields of pale green , reds , pinks and yellow the one oil is a large vertical in which the impastoed pigments are textured and , some being oilier than others , they reflect the light distractingly mr goodwin does his best work in watercolor , applying it in liquid washes but a decade or two ago , his images , whatever their medium , would have been regarded as abstractions out of franz kline and willem de kooning if joan nelson s small images of trees against blue skies seem old fashioned , it is as much a matter of her technique oil colors mixed with wax and laid smooth on panels primed with burnt sienna as her inspiration and as the curator explains in her catalogue essay , the inspiration is details excerpted from the works of assorted old masters albert pinkham ryder and claude are among those mentioned but not ralph blakelock , and it is he to whom ms nelson seems the closest in spirit , if not in style itemized leaf by leaf , one tree stands on an olivegreen plain that gives way to hills of a brighter green in the distance another is but the top of a blasted trunk standing on the right and leaning toward shrubbery on the left , all against a sky hazy with clouds but the most beautiful of these pictures , all of them devoid of figures , are the silhouette of a tree overgrown with creepers and a flat landscape receding to a bright horizon a study in sepia and creamy tones using watercolor or gouache , ellen phelan is alone in working directly from nature but not , it seems , without some editing along the way in fact , she represents a trend in or school of landscape in which light is everything , and forms are reduced to blurs of color or tone the artist uses color adequately in three works , but her forte is grays , which she lays on in immaculate washes , knowing when to sharpen an edge and when to let it fade away most of ms phelan s impressions involve stretches of calm water between land masses that are nearly black or under clouds of various grays like a good printmaker , she makes black and white convey volumes about color and atmosphere some of these works were done in norway , but all are filled with nordic melancholy it is nice to see a show in connecticut without a single mention of connecticut the artists' may not be from the state , but evidently ms la motta chose them for their merits the display of landscapes remains through march 24 at the new britain museum of american art , 56 lexington street in new britain photos freedom suite , above , by guy goodwin , over the lake early morning cloud study , top right , by ellen phelan , and the last farm , by gregory crane , at the alllandscape invitational at new britain museum of american art \( d james dee zindman fremont \)
white plains , jan 17 the westchester teacher accused of killing betty jeanne solomon talked to a private investigator a few months before the slaying to seek protection from a woman named jeanne or betty jeanne who was trying to hurt her family , the investigator testified today but according to the investigator , james a russo , when he suggested a bodyguard to the teacher , carolyn warmus , she said instead that she wanted a machine gun and silencer ms warmus , 27 years old , is charged with seconddegree murder and criminal weapons possession in the slaying of mrs solomon , 40 , of greenburgh , ny , on jan 15 , 1989 prosecutors say ms warmus , the daughter of a prosperous insurance executive , was motivated by an obsessive passion for the victim s husband , paul , a fellow teacher the defendant s lawyer says she was framed mr russo , the executive vice president of alltech investigations inc in manhattan , testified in westchester court today that ms warmus came to his offices on three occasions in the late summer and early fall of 1988 the first time , he said , she told him one of her father s jets was sabotaged in michigan and that a woman was seen in the vicinity of the hangar in the next visit , she said the same woman had struck her sister s car in washington in a hitandrun he asked her for documentation or some sort of proof , he said , but received none during their last meeting , mr russo said , ms warmus said she had seen the woman at her school in westchester i suggested bodyguards , but her answer was no , said mr russo , who appeared confident on the stand , cocking his head after each answer i pushed her to say exactly what she wanted , he continued she said a 'machine gun and silencer' it had to be small enough to conceal in the confines of a handbag i said , 'we 're not arms dealers' the prosecution s major witness in the case , yet to testify , is another private investigator , vincent parco , for whom mr russo had worked mr parco , prosecutors said in their opening statement to the jury , sold ms warmus an automatic handgun and silencer for 2 , 500 days before the murder mr russo s testimony linked the suspect s name for the first time to a potential murder weapon the private investigator also said he telephoned the midtown north police precinct in manhattan about ms warmus s request for a gun and silencer the prosecutor , assistant district attorney james a mccarty , asked mr russo to tell jurors of his contracts he has signed with television and movie producers for his story , all of which , mr mccarty emphasized , were signed after his grand jury testimony the witness said he made a total of 13 , 000 for appearing on two tabloidstyle television news programs and has a movie contract for 50 , 000 in an unrelenting crossexamination , mr lewis tried to discredit mr russo by portraying him as a slippery detective who would do anything for money mr lewis tried to draw a connection between mr russo s job , which sometimes entails going undercover and deceiving others in exchange for money , and his testimony in this case , which has benefited him financially sex or death' mr lewis asked mr russo to recount his recent work for a landlord who suspected a prostitution ring in his upper east side apartment building mr russo testified that he went undercover and payed a prostitute 400 in exchange for oral sex mr lewis asked the witness whether it was necessary to actually have sex to prove the existence of such a ring it could have been death , said mr russo , explaining that he feared what would happen if the armed guard outside the bedroom discovered his identity you mean it was sex or death , mr russo \? mr lewis asked , prompting a wave of laughter from jurors , spectators and the usually solemn judge john carey in other testimony , maria conti , the bartender who waited on ms warmus and mr solomon at the treetops restaurant in yonkers the night of the fatal shooting , testified she said that the defendant , who arrived a half hour after mr solomon , ordered champagne mr solomon was already drinking a vodka collins the two then had a meal of oysters , hamburgers , and french fries prosecutors suggested in questioning that it was a celebratory drink for ms warmus , but the defense contended that champagne was commomplace ms warmus and mr solomon have told authorities that they then had sex in her car photos james russo , a private investigator , and maria conti , a bartender , as they testified yesterday at the murder trial of carolyn warmus \( alan zale for the new york times \)
the conscience of the eye the design and social life of cities by richard sennett 266 pp new york alfred a knopf the subtitle of richard sennett s latest excursion into urbocriticism is misleading it is not the social life of cities that is at issue here the conscience of the eye is about a city new york city caught in the act of being studiously indifferent to itself the central dramatic episode uniting this loose collection of observations on the layout of roman camps , the manufacture of plate glass and the puritan denial of the beauties of the visible universe is the author s customary dinnertime walk from his greenwich village apartment to the enclave of french restaurants situated in the east 50 s en route , mr sennett s rate of speed and his attention to the passing scene vary according to the degree of social distinction between himself and those he encounters he scoots past the twitching addicts near washington square slows down a little in gramercy park to notice the solitary apartment dwellers going about their errands , one by one scurries through the district in the middle 20 s where leather fetishists buy their gear and shrinks from the censorious politeness of foreign spice merchants toward westerners in the upper 20 s making jokes or comments could it possibly be about us \? mr sennett , who is a professor of sociology and the humanities at new york university , is decently regretful of his own moral and visual indifference to the human varieties arrayed on the sidewalks before him his averted gaze , his lack of curiosity about what is problematic in the life of a drug dealer and the politeness that keeps him from intruding on the solitude of a woman in gramercy park all seem to him ethically suspect but his own response , he argues , is symptomatic of a more general retreat to the twin sanctuaries of cathedral and inner life that began with st augustine s celebration of the spiritual over the material world in the city of god ever since augustine s time \( with rare exceptions , such as the pilgrimage routes of rome dramatized and celebrated by the obelisks of pope sixtus v \) , mr sennett maintains that western cities have minimized , often by architectural means , the positive value of mingling , of encountering something alien , unsettling and potentially enlightening in their own streets the builders of the 18th century , for instance , laid out their lovely terraces of flats and shops so that people were actually funneled away from urban crowds , toward the contemplative emptiness of nature , outside town in our own age , he writes , the skyscraper affords total isolation the view through the plate glass window reduces street life to the status of a framed picture , unthreatening yet bogus sight routinely insulated from sound , and touch and other human beings in the fall of public man , mr sennett covered some of this same ground there , however , he attributed the erosion of the city s public places to industrialization and the quest for inner self embedded in the protestant ethic and while it is clear that some cities are in trouble and that american society as a whole often seems threatened by passivity and withdrawal of the sort represented by the author s stroll through manhattan , a longing for a golden age of urbanism , back before augustine , cotton mather and the robber barons mucked things up , is not liable to help the situation nor will mr sennett s vague prescriptions for design principles conducive to greater urban felicity , the most practical of which is his warning to planners to draw boundaries \( walls , freeways \) between different kinds of people as infrequently as possible if , indeed , esthetic alterations in the character of the contemporary city can awaken the conscience of the eye if what the architects of greece and rome and bath did or did not do can show us the way then it is more than a little puzzling that mr sennett should have presented his case without illustrations of any kind however skillfully articulated , word pictures lack the physical specificity of images words can , perhaps , describe the workings of the conscience but not the ways in which the tangible world assaults the eye augustine s city of god was , after all , a city of words , an intangible ideal , and so , in the end , is mr sennett s new york mr sennett calls new york city a talisman of modern culture twenty or fifty or a hundred years ago , it was new york did once embody the essence of modern life in the united states but today , modernity resides in the suburbs according to the 1990 census , the fastestgrowing cities are actually suburbs , what used to be the raw crabgrass outposts at the edges of the urban experience in places like phoenix or minneapolis nowadays , in addition to the usual complement of churches and junior highs , suburbia comes equipped with malls , industrial parks , office buildings , theaters and fine french restaurants

whether in word or line , countless poets and artists have celebrated the campagna romana , the lushly verdant volcanic plain outside rome among the legions who have tried over the years to capture its beauty have been the painters claude lorrain and camille corot , as well as the poet goethe now the american photographer joel sternfeld has turned his hand to the task of recording this storied landscape mr sternfeld recently spent a year in italy on a rome prize fellowship , and during his time there photographed extensively with a largeformat camera in the countryside around rome this strikingly beautiful show offers the results of his labors , depicting the campagna in richly colored images made with a sharply observant eye mr sternfeld is one of a number of american photographers among them stephen shore , william eggleston and john pfahl who came to prominence in the late 1970 s with color prints , made using the simplified processes that first became available in that period like many of his colleagues , mr sternfeld has long taken the landscape as his primary subject what he is best known for , though , are the deadpan but deflating touches of humor he includes in many of his pictures in one , a lovely but insipid vista of treecovered hills suddenly takes on an ominous , almost surrealist air when one notices , in the center of the frame , the tiny figure of a circus elephant collapsed from heat exhaustion on a narrow highway despite the romantic overtones of his current subject matter , mr sternfeld has lost none of his wit in his depiction of it even more than is true elsewhere in italy , the campagna includes a jumble of remnants from the country s long history , from ancient aqueducts to renaissance villas to modern office buildings many of mr sternfeld s pictures record the stylistic leaps across time that the juxtaposition of structures from such disparate eras can suggest in one picture here , blackclad housewives cluster beneath a fragment of an aqueduct , knitting and talking , while in the background rows of modern apartment blocks stretch away in the distance another , marked by the eerie light found in paintings by giorgio de chirico , shows a regallooking baldheaded man , implausibly spotlit and posing in profile like a renaissance prince , behind the fence of his lush garden in the foreground water gushes from a street fountain also included in this show are a number of works in which mr sternfeld has used his 8by10inch camera to create panoramic shots that stretch across several frames this formal device enables him to present sweeping vistas of the countryside while also setting up contrasts between the images within each piece in one such work , a crumbling fragment of an ancient wall huddles forlornly in one frame of a fourpanel piece , surrounded by the scaffoldingclad buildings of a new apartment complex occasionally , mr sternfeld s pictures engage not only the history of the campagna but of photography as well in one image of a popular lovers' lane , twin fiats lurk beneath a huge wall fragment that seems about to topple over the structure of this picture recalls a famous 1872 photograph by william bell of a similarly huge , precariously balanced rock in arizona but where bell s image is unabashedly aweinspiring , mr sternfeld undercuts the majesty of the ancient ruin in his picture by including the banal details of the lovers' cars despite the obvious affection he feels for the roman countryside and the people who live in it , mr sternfeld attempts to remain the coolly distant observer , dispassionately recording the curious and suggestive disparities to be found in his subjects but in the end , the physical beauty of the campagna captures mr sternfeld , as it has so many earlier travelers his pictures take on a rich sensuousness , and revel in the visual delights of the campagna its shifting light and vivid colors the way the sweep of the landscape will be suddenly disrupted by a ruin or a palladian farmhouse in the middle of a plowed field in several pictures here , crumbling remains of aqueducts dot the plain of the campagna like majestic galleons on the face of the ocean the light that claude made famous in his paintings thick , golden , almost palpable is to be found in these photographs as well it seems to suffuse everything , and lends an aura of nobility even to such banal subjects as cars junked on the edge of a field for all their smart modernist wit , these pictures reveal clearly the lyrical vision that underlies mr sternfeld s work the photographs of joel sternfeld remain at the pace macgill gallery , 32 east 57th street , through oct 19 photo the claudian aqueduct , rome , by joel sternfeld \( pace macgill gallery , new york \)
more than a year after the start of a fierce bidding war among foreign publishers for newspapers and magazines in eastern europe , the involvement of american media companies there remains minimal except for time warner inc , which has a partial interest in developing and operating cable systems in hungary representing 250 , 000 subscribers and is looking into developing a paytelevision movie service there , none of the big american newspaper or magazine publishers are competing for ownership of eastern europe s emerging free press on the other hand , robert maxwell of britain rupert murdoch robert hersant , who owns le figaro in france , and the springer and bertelsmann groups of germany are staking claims media up for grabs and there are plenty of claims waiting to be staked whoever is willing to take something over gets to take it over , said ruth whitney , editor in chief of glamour magazine ownership occurs not by negotiation but by anyone who steps in and fills the void but the difficulty , said pat miller , an editor at large for the american society of magazine editors , is nobody knows who owns what ms whitney and ms miller were members of a group of united states magazine editors and publishers who recently returned from a 12day trip to vienna , budapest , prague , berlin , warsaw and krakow , poland , that was sponsored by the society and the magazine publishers of america they said they were impressed by the vitality and inventiveness of journalists struggling to effect a transition from state control to independence americans are better trusted john mack carter , the editor in chief of good housekeeping and director of development at hearst magazines , said the running thread in the talks with east european journalists was their wariness of foreign investment and desire to limit foreign ownership but while many of them were uneasy about european entrepreneurs , they were more trusting of americans , mr carter found they are like heatseeking missiles , coming after greenbacks and looking to the usa , he said one american testing the waters in eastern europe is edward t giller , a former broadcaster based in altoona , pa he and two partners set up pentor communications international , an american company that has commitments in excess of 2 million in joint media ventures in poland a polish women s magazine a year ago , mr giller and his partners became majority shareholders in a venture with members of the staff of uroda , a women s magazine formerly published by interpress , a stateowned media conglomerate a monthly with a circulation of 200 , 000 , it has articles on how to earn money and how women should not be afraid to be as smart as men , profiles of successful women and features on hair , clothes and decorating the office pentor is also involved in a venture with executives of the warsaw voice , a twoyearold weekly and the only englishlanguage newspaper in poland simultaneous delivery in the united states will begin in july when the 24page tabloid , costing 3 an issue , will seek readers among executives interested in doing business in poland other pentor ventures in poland include a desperately needed market research firm , the only publication offering television and radio listings and a television production company market research is virtually nonexistent in poland as a result , publishers rarely know who their readers are as in many east european countries , magazine distribution is controlled by the stateowned postal service readers sign up and prepay for magazines at the post office , which , in turn , informs publishers how many copies it will distribute there is none of the information on age , gender , income or interests of readers that is the mainstay of american advertising pentor is also working on a distribution system that would make it more profitable for kiosks to sell the company s newspapers and magazines pointing to a spirit worthy of united states marketing executives , mr giller said his polish partners had come up with the idea of buying a new car and giving it to the kiosk owner who sells the most copies of the televisionlistings magazine in june the maxwells and murdochs have not been well received , mr giller said , and the germans are trying to get in but we have made the poles realize that our interests and theirs coincide , and they have been very responsive to us but it s very much like the old west there is no corporate structure we make the rules as we go cable venture with government another american company involved in poland is chase enterprises , a division of chase communications , based in hartford in a joint venture with the polish government , chase has begun building a cable television service in gdansk and plans eventually to operate in nine cities roger freedman , president and chief executive of chase international , said the company had invested many millions of dollars in the enterprise although the spirit of change continues to blow strongly , most publications in eastern europe are still stateowned some are now quasipublic , owned in part by government and in part by former employees for instance , heit vilaggazdasag hvg , a weekly economic and political magazine in budapest that is loosely modeled after the economist , is now onequarter staffowned the remaining shares are owned by banks and the state commerce department on the other hand , mlady svet , a weekly news magazine in prague , has been taken over and is being run by 28 members of its staff other journalists now find themselves out of work some editors and reporters worked on newsletters and other house organs for stateowned companies that have closed fund for a free press as part of united states initiatives to help build democracy in eastern europe , 5 million has been set aside for the international media fund to help countries set up independent broadcasting and a free press the fund is helping to set up american journalism centers in hungary , poland and czechoslovakia , which will be financed in part by the new york times company foundation inc , rutgers university and the university of maryland marvin stone , the fund s president , who is a former editor in chief of us news world report and former deputy director of the united states information agency , said legislation was being introduced to further the freedom of broadcasting in several of these countries , although many countries prefer a european model like britain s , under which some channels are run by the state and others by private enterprise press production obstacles the main obstacles for the press , he said , were getting newsprint , which must be imported finding printing plants and solving distribution problems national news agencies are still under the control of parliaments , and their directors are appointed by prime ministers , mr stone said in a typical example , mr stone said that in belgrade , yugoslavia , the weekly news magazine , which is modeled after time , had no idea how many magazines were sold every week by the postal service and that it suspected it was being ripped off they are not told for 45 days how many were sold , he said , and then it takes two months before they get the money that s what an arrogant monopoly means photo pat miller , left , john mack carter and ruth whitney were impressed by the vitality and inventiveness of journalists in eastern europe \( william e sauro the new york times \)
not many exhibitions in recent memory have told a more moving story than seeing through 'paradise' artists and the terezin concentration camp , at the drawing center , 35 wooster street , in lower manhattan \( through aug 2 \) the show includes about 100 works by 17 artists who , as nazi prisoners , were forced to churn out propagandistic images depicting the town of terezin in northern bohemia , where they were held , as a model jewish ghetto surreptitiously they also used the art materials supplied to them to record the actual horrors of life there , horrors that the nazis wanted to conceal from the outside world at all costs and so , joseph spier , a dutch prisoner , drew a coffeehouse , a theater , a hospital garden and other sites for a propaganda album that the nazis published his touristic images seem all the more convincing for being so matteroffact , and only the existence of alternative drawings by spier himself and also by artists like leo haas , helga weissova hoskova , fritz taussig , known as fritta , karel fleischmann and frantisek petr kien reveals just how elaborate was the nazi hoax from the czech fleischmann is a rendition of the hospital garden not as calm sanctuary but as a kind of hell overrun with the sick and dying from the bohemianborn fritta is a harrowing view of the terezin coffeehouse not packed with welldressed locals sipping their drinks , as spier depicts it , but full of dazed , sallow prisoners sitting at empty tables through a window a guard can be seen patrolling a barbedwire fence he also depicts the movie house as a hospital in which the empty numbered seats are like tombstones identifying the dead by the numbers that the nazis made them wear the nazis acted swiftly once they learned of drawings that the artists had hidden throughout the town and in a few cases smuggled to switzerland fleischmann and fritta were immediately tortured and then deported to auschwitz , where they died both captor and captive understood equally how art could mold the world s perception of reality art s particular ability to shape history is the exhibition s unspoken but overriding theme the heroism of the artists who died because they demanded that the truth be known is the show s gripping lesson their drawings are of more than documentary value many are largescale , finished and very powerful , none more so than fritta s works in an expressionistic style reminiscent of kirchner or grosz , fleischmann s feverish cityscapes and character studies , and kien s touching , fluidly composed portraits the only smiling faces to be seen in the show are kien s brisk caricatures of prisoners accompanied by images of their fantasies seeing through 'paradise' has been organized by johanna branson , michele furst and jeffrey keough for the massachusetts college of art in boston , where it was on view this spring it is accompanied by an excellent catalogue to which survivors of terezin , like leo haas , have contributed they describe a place not only of fear but also of cultural creativity made especially intense and productive by the urgency of the circumstances to make art was to affirm themselves and their places in society as civilized people art was also literally a lifeanddeath matter , and the drawings here reflect that the drawing center , under a new director , ann philbin , deserves special praise for bringing this exhibition to new york within only a couple of months , sponsors were found and a series of related films , concerts and lectures scheduled the only pity is that no new york museum had the foresight to borrow the landmark exhibition called degenerate art , put together by the los angeles county museum of art and now at the art institute of chicago , which sets seeing through 'paradise' in its full historical context the two shows also cast recent debates over censorship and the relationship between politics and art in acute perspective it is one thing to be denied a government grant it is another to be tortured and murdered , as were the artists of terezin theresienstadt , as the germans called it , was founded as a garrison in the late 18th century by the austrian emperor josef ii located about 40 miles from prague , it served from 1941 as a temporary camp for captured jews on their way to auschwitz and other points east between january 1942 and october 1944 , almost 87 , 000 people were shipped from terezin to the death camps around 4 , 000 survived the garrison had been intended to house 6 , 000 soldiers the nazis crammed more than 58 , 000 prisoners into the town more than 33 , 000 prisoners died from starvation , illness and execution yet the world believed terezin to be a benign place the nazis rounded up prominent jews , many of them artists , musicians and writers , in a scam to discredit stories of german barbarism several prisoners were commanded to produce a film extolling the virtues of terezin women were made to clean the streets with their hairbrushes in preparation for the film hungry prisoners were made to smile by having the film crew bribe them with bits of food held just out of the camera s sight one of fritta s more nightmarish drawings , film and reality , depicts the filming of an elderly man seated in front of a curtain , behind which is the skeleton of a prisoner days after the movie was completed the entire film crew was transported to auschwitz \( what remains of the film called the fuhrer gives a city to the jews will be screened at the museum of modern art on july 18 at 6 30 pm \) and when a delegation from the international red cross requested a visit to the town in 1944 , the nazis ordered the jews to help them temporarily transform their ghetto into what would appear to be a resort town delegates saw whitewashed buildings adorned with flower boxes they toured a wellstocked bakery and butcher s shop the sick and elderly were forbidden to show themselves on the streets the shipping of more than 7 , 500 prisoners to auschwitz thinned out the crowded population as mementos of their visit the delegates even received copies of spier s book of color illustrations the red

minneapolis wall to wall , someone was saying , this world series , this sevengame thriller between the twins and the braves that finally ended 10 in favor of the twins in the 10th inning of the seventh game sunday night , was the best world series he 'd ever seen wall to wall , your correspondent decided , it might have been the best sustained sporting event anyone has ever seen what was better in terms of baseball \? was it 1905 , when christy mathewson pitched three shutouts in six days as the giants beat the a s in the world series \? nah , great individual performance , but it was a onesided series was it 1924 , when old walter johnson , then 36 , came out of the bullpen for washington against the giants in the ninth inning of the seventh and and won it in the 12th , 43 \? that was a gasser , surely , but only four games were decided by one run , and only one game , the last , went into extra innings the 1991 series had five games decided by a run , and four went into extra innings oh , you say , the 1975 world series between the reds and the red sox also had five onerun games and , wait ! , the 1972 a sreds series had six \( ! \) games that ended with a onerun difference but the '75 series had only two games go into extra innings , and the '72 series had none the '91 world series , meanwhile , had four games decided in the last atbat , also unequaled what about bill mazeroski s home run in 1960 to give the pirates a lastinning , lastatbat series championship over the yankees \? great , certainly but one game most of the others in that sevengame series were duds one may ruminate on world series after world series for all 88 of them , and the conclusion in this corner is that this one stands alone in my memory , there were numerous great final series in basketball one could name several involving the celtics and the lakers , for example and there were some stupendous single events , like loyola winning the national collegiate athletic association basketball championship in overtime , or that united statessoviet union olympic hockey game in '80 and possibly the single most riveting sports event these eyes ever witnessed was the first alifrazier fight but for day after day pureandunalloyed pleasure , this series was unbeatable it had everything drama and humor , heroes and goats , great plays and blunders , brilliant and bungled strategies , the north against the south , the oldtime virtues of sky and grass in the atlantafulton county stadium versus a modern rug for a playing field and teflon for a sky in the metrodome , social issues , and a war between symbols , the brandished tomahawk versus the billowing homer hankie besides the hits , runs and errors , the braves' name and their fans' use of the tomahawk and a related chop gesture and war chant created controversy american indians said these symbols perpetuated sterotypes and demeaned their religious rites defenders of the activities said that the fans were just having a good time and meant no offense besides , they were giving the indians some good publicity that s generous of those particular folks in atlanta and environs , and revoltingly nervy but so many people were running around chopping the air with their foamrubber tomahawks and whooping and donning feathers that it made one wonder what kind of sensitivity these people possessed one homemade banner , though , hanging from the upper deck in atlanta gave , an indication it read we came we chopped we offended meanwhile , the home folks in minnesota , many of them descendants of the hardy vikings , were never seen without hankies it looked as if the whole state was suffering from the flu ah , but these were not just ordinary hankies these were the sacred homer hankies , used to wave their heroes home in the mind s eye , there will be unforgettable scenes brian harper , the twins' catcher , jumping up and down at home plate as the umpire said he did n't tag mark lemke , who scored the winning run in the 12th inning of game 4 and the look of fierce determination in the eyes of the redmustached jack morris , who at age 36 pitched 10 innings to win the championship for the twins the kind of determination seen in the eyes of frazier and ali you 've done your part , his manager , tom kelly , said to morris after the ninth we 'll get someone else in said morris i 've still got my stuff i want to stay you could n't blame him the score was 00 at that point , in game 7 of the world series , and no one wanted to leave no one did it was that kind of ball game , that kind of utterly glorious series photo bill mazeroski in 1960 \( associated press \)

san francisco , july 8 the commerce department today proposed levying stiff duties on certain computer screens imported from japan but it also proposed sparing from such penalties the screens that are most commonly used today in a closely watched dumping case that has split the american electronics industry , the agency proposed duties of 6267 percent on flat panels known as active matrix liquid crystal displays such displays are not widely used now but are expected by some industry executives to be the most common type of screen for the laptop and notebook computers of the future the dumping duties would not take effect until the international trade commission , a separate american agency , determined whether imports of the flat panels had injured or threatened to injure american industry the commission has 45 days to make that decision the commerce department s proposal could in the future raise the price of laptop and notebook computers made in the united states , some computer executives said they contended that the decision might force american companies to move production overseas for laptop and notebook computers , which are the fastestgrowing segment of the personal computer industry but the commerce department proposed levying no duties on passive matrix liquid crystal displays , the type used in most current laptop and notebook computers , meaning that today s proposal would have little immediate impact on computer prices the agency proposed levying small duties or none on two other types of flat panel displays the dumping case was brought last july by seven small american flat panel screen companies calling themselves the advanced display manufacturers of america they charged that japanese manufacturers , large companies with vast resources , were selling flat panel displays in the united states at unfairly low costs , thereby keeping the fledgling american industry from gaining the american screen manufacturers were opposed not only by the japanese screen suppliers but also by american computer companies , which are dependent on the japanese screens and do not want to see duties that raise costs the american makers , led by apple computer , compaq computer and ibm , have argued that the american screen makers cannot produce the types the computer companies need they have said that duties on japanese screens will merely raise costs for american companies without providing any extra revenue for the american flat panel display companies the commerce department s proposal appears to include good and bad news for both sides they sort of split the baby , said david p houlihan , a washington lawyer representing the toshiba corporation , one japanese supplier computer makers said the high duties on active matrix displays were a big blow because those are the screens that will increasingly be used in the future we 're deeply disappointed , said a spokesman for the international business machines corporation it has the impact of increasing the cost of computers made in the us because there is no us source of active matrix displays but the rulings on the other types of screens are good for computer makers and a blow to the american screen manufacturers the commerce department s proposal also went against the american screen makers in treating four types of flat panel displays differently we regard this as one industry and we think the commerce department made an erroneous conclusion , said paul c rosenthal , a lawyer representing the american flat panel makers however , he said the screen manufacturers were gratified by the high duties on active matrix displays , since that is the technology the japanese manufacturers are concentrating on in preliminary decisions , the commerce department and the international trade commission had considered all the screens in a single group in a preliminary ruling in february , the commerce department had proposed dumping duties of only 46 percent for the sharp corporation and lesser duties for other manufacturers on all types of flat panels the trade commission has also made a preliminary ruling that united states companies were injured , but the fact that the case is now broken up into four segments could mean that the agency s final decision will not be the same electronic transistor used active matrix liquid crystal displays use an electronic transistor to control each dot on the screen , while passive liquid crystal displays use a grid of wires the active matrix screens provide sharper pictures and the image can be changed more quickly , making such screens useful in television sets as well as in computers but active matrix screens are very expensive and notoriously difficult to manufacture two american companies involved in the suit , ois optical imaging systems of troy , mich , and the magnascreen corporation of pittsburgh , are in the active matrix display business , but they aim their products mainly at military and other specialized users other american companies have looked at entering the business but have so far balked at the 100 million or so it would cost to build a largescale plant , especially since the japanese seem so far ahead in its investigation , the commerce department found that the hosiden corporation , a japanese supplier of active matrix displays to apple , had been selling at 6267 percent less than foreign market value that duty will also be applied to other japanese manufacturers passive displays excluded the commerce department said there were no makers of passive matrix liquid crystal displays among the companies that filed the dumping case therefore , there should be no dumping duties it put duties of 702 percent on sharp and other companies that make electroluminescent displays in the case of gas plasma displays , it found that dumping duties of 032 percent in the case of toshiba and 023 percent in the case of matsushita would be too low to bother collecting most of the american makers make either electroluminescent or gas plasma displays , which american computer companies say require too much power for use in batteryrun notebook computers besides ois and magnascreen , the screen makers that filed the dumping case were planar systems inc , beaverton , ore plasmaco inc , highland , ny the cherry corporation , waukegan , ill electroplasma inc , millbury , ohio , and photonics technology , northwood , ohio
albany , may 20 when the state legislature and gov mario m cuomo shattered the record for a late budget last year , the mark of may 19 seemed as unbreakable as bob beamon s 29foot , 2 1 2inch long jump at the 1968 olympics but the state s leaders showed today that they have more in common with sergei bubka , the soviet pole vaulter who is forever topping his own world records the legislature reached deep down inside and once again cleared the pole of budget tardiness , this time 50 days after the state s fiscal year began on april 1 because the state cannot make aid payments without a budget , local governments and school districts have had to borrow billions of dollars at an estimated cost of 45 million in interest , according to mr cuomo s budget division the delay has stoked fears of a cashflow crisis in new york city and has suspended fiscal planning in municipalities around the state and how did the legislature commemorate its historic accomplishment \? by spending its eighth consecutive monday passing emergency appropriations bills to keep the state operating for another week like any modest champion , lawmakers made liberal use of understatement in reflecting on their achievement none of us are covered with glory because of this process , said assemblyman john j faso , republican of kinderhook but that did not prevent the apportionment of blame the republicans who control the majority in the state senate said it was mr cuomo s fault for proposing an unreasonably harsh budget and for being unwilling to compromise the democrats who lead the assembly voiced similar complaints and some suggested that the senate was intent on saddling mr cuomo with a new record in case the governor decided to run for president in 1992 i do n't think the governor helped much by saying that when the budget was done he was going to go out and attack the bush administration , said assemblyman alexander b grannis , democrat of manhattan for weeks , of course , the governor has been blaming legislative leaders for not breaking their habit of spending their way out of a budget impasse everybody has to go back with something , mr cuomo recently lamented it apparently is not enough go back to your constituents and say we did the right thing we had to cut and we cut would postcards help \? it is generally thought that there can be few positive side effects to a late budget but today there was this assembly officials announced they could no longer afford to send bulk mailings to constituents there s a moratorium because our bulk mail account is practically out of money , said steven a greenberg , a spokesman for assembly speaker mel miller we ca n't refill it until there s a budget the moratorium applies to members of the assembly from both houses , mr greenberg said under assembly rules , lawmakers are reimbursed for three bulk mailings to their constituents each year and are allocated an additional 2 , 700 for other bulk mail costs the freeze may provide some cheer for those not always eager to read selfpromotional mailings from their elected representatives and given the legislature s current profile , many members of the assembly may not mind having to save their mailings for happier times i think they 'd be hesitant to do mail now , said mr greenberg , because at this point there s nothing to write home about , both figuratively and literally a tax on parking tickets it often seems that the legislature will tax anything that moves now it may place a surcharge on things that stand still illegally parked cars officials in both the senate and the assembly said legislative negotiators were discussing a proposal to raise between 21 million and 25 million for the state by placing a 5 surcharge on parking tickets in the state s six largest cities new york city , buffalo , syracuse , rochester , yonkers and albany in the first year , all of the money would go to the state , said the officials , who are seeking alternatives to mr cuomo s proposal to raise the gasoline tax by 10 cents but the legislation also would allow local governments to declare an amnesty on overdue parking fines , a measure that could bring a onetime infusion of dollars to the cities under the amnesty , violators would be forgiven late fees of a fine if they paid a certain percentage of the fine itself the amount of that percentage is still being debated , the officials said after the first year , any revenues from the surcharge would be split between the state and the local government where the tickets are written , the officials said senate negotiators are holding out the proposal as a major boost for new york city but city officials are skeptical our understanding is that once people get wind of an amnesty , tickets go in glove compartments and never get paid , one city official said john t bozzella , the city s top lobbyist in albany , said , we 'd have to see numbers that show that this produces money for the city it s a tough crowd kids say the darnedest things mr cuomo took a lunchtime break from the rigors of budget negotiations today to wave the starter s flag at a race of solar and electric cars that began in albany and will finish in plymouth , mass while inspecting some of the spaceage entries , mr cuomo began interrogating members of the racing team from catomeridien high school in cato , ny , about the benefits of solar energy besides being fun for you , what good is it going to be for society \? he asked why should we do it \? as television cameras recorded the moment , marc lunkenheimer , a junior at the school , produced an answer the governor was not looking for no more gas taxes , he said photo the legislature passed emergency spending bills in albany to keep the state operating for another week assemblyman alexander b grannis , right , said , i do n't think the governor helped much by saying that when the budget was done he was going to go out and attack the bush administration \( david jennings for the new york times \)
washington , june 30 a year ago , white house aides drafted a 10page memorandum to provide president bush with a vision for a war on poverty they ran it past jack f kemp , the administration s housing secretary and antipoverty czar that s not a vision , mr kemp complained in a letter to the white house he was particularly annoyed by the document s call for two technical studies of how antipoverty programs are financed and managed in a white house already criticized for studying the problem to death , he wrote , the studies would drag on for another year meanwhile , what s going on in our neighborhoods and on the streets \? it is now a year later , and many administration officials say mr kemp s prophecy of endless study is close to coming true when the president convened a cabinet meeting this month for an antipoverty report , the discussion swirled around one unenacted and some say tepidly endorsed legislative proposal , and the same two studies that had made mr kemp cringe the meeting then adjourned , pending further study in the bush administration , the fight against poverty has been a slow go its pace illustrates the difficulties that arise when a conservative like mr kemp tries to rally a republican administration around what have historically been democratic concerns mr kemp s antipoverty platform sails under the banner of empowerment , a marketdriven strategy that seeks to give the poor more power by letting them bypass government bureaucracy arguing that such bureaucracies have ruined public housing and education , he calls for programs to help the poor buy their own homes and choose their children s schools in addition , he wants tax breaks for businesses that locate near poor neighborhoods inside the administration , officials are quick to voice their sympathies for mr kemp s plans but slow to provide the financial or political capital needed to make them a widespread reality mr kemp s antipoverty plan may even be at peak political utility in its current , unrealized form costing nothing but giving the administration an answer to those who say it lacks domestic vision seeking to help republicans mr kemp has argued that a fight against poverty is both morally right and politically profitable for the republican party but his rivals note that it would also be politically profitable for mr kemp , giving increased prominence to the former presidential contender who is likely to be one again in the future and mr kemp s critics say his oratorical onslaughts often outpace his ability to produce new proposals if you try to corner him , there s nothing more he wants to propose , said one white house aide , noting that the president has already backed mr kemp s main ideas mr kemp s admirers say the president should emulate his passion his distractors call mr kemp bombastic visibly frustrated , the secretary continues to seek a fuller commitment from mr bush , urging him , at the june 20 cabinet meeting , to put pressure on congress by appealing directly to the american people like to see 'highprofile' i do n't want to be quoted saying i'm urging him to go public , but it s no secret i 'd like to see a highprofile , antipoverty , progrowth and opportunity agenda , mr kemp said in an interview shortly after the meeting the cabinet needs to do a better job of highlighting it and so does the white house white house memorandums and copies of mr kemp s correspondence were provided , on the condition of anonymity , by someone outside his office who is dissatisfied with the administration s domestic policy asked about them this week , mr kemp worried that other officials would suspect him as the source and accuse him of disloyalty but he made few efforts to disguise his dissatisfaction i do n't think the prophecy has come true , but it s in danger of coming true if we do n't convert our legislative agenda , he said in making the transition from mr bush s presidential rival to his housing secretary , mr kemp has faced political perils as a freewheeling , highprofile congressman , he had managed to keep himself in view with pronouncements on issues from russian history to the gold standard now he is parked atop an obscure bureaucracy , with fewer opportunities to round out a presidential resume other events take stage he played virtually no role in the two biggest events of the past year a budget deal he disliked and a war that pushed him and his antipoverty plan further from public view until last september , the administration s antipoverty planning was controlled by a junior white house group called the low income opportunity board , whose cautious efforts provoked mr kemp s exasperation in may 1990 , mr kemp voiced his frustrations in a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh , who coordinates the cabinet s domestic planning it is past time for the administration to aggressively highlight a new comprehensive antipoverty agenda , mr kemp said and his agitation grew last june , when white house planners circulated their 10page memorandum , cautioning against major new intiatives and recommending two studies the administration has already been criticized in the press for studying the problem to death and throwing up its hands , mr kemp wrote to mr thornburgh in july
hialeah , fla , oct 31 mayor raul martinez , was convicted of extortion and racketeering in march after a jury found he had accepted 1 million in cash and property from land developers his replacement , julio martinez , complains that his efforts to clean up the city and pass a new budget have been thwarted because the police chief and the majority of the city council defy his orders and remain loyal to the man he replaced it s just a dispute between politicians , no different than what goes on in new york , chicago , washington or new orleans , julio martinez said this week perhaps but events took a peculiar turn earlier this month when two supporters of julio martinez found cow s tongues at their office door , another received a fish head in his mailbox , and a severed and muzzled goat s head was discovered in a police department parking lot in a city with a population that is 88 percent hispanic , mostly from workingclass cuban immigrant families , the symbolism of those acts was immediately obvious not content to resolve the battle for control of hialeah through conventional political channels , someone had resorted to santeria , an afrocaribbean religion akin to voodoo that uses animal sacrifice the dispute over who should run this city of 200 , 000 just west of miami began 18 months ago , when mayor raul martinez , first elected in 1981 , was indicted the mayor was suspended by gov bob martinez , and in accordance with the municipal charter , the city council president , julio martinez , became acting mayor none of the three martinezes are related raul martinez s situation is not all that unusual in south florida , where corruption cases involving politicians and judges have become almost routine in recent years on tuesday , mayor alex daoud of miami beach was indicted on 41 counts of racketeering , extortion , money laundering and tax evasion but hialeah , florida s fifthlargest city , has a severe image problem even by local standards englishspeaking floridians have been known to refer disparagingly to hialeah as the northernmost city in latin america , and even upperclass cubans who have settled in prosperous enclaves like coral gables tend to label anything garish or gauche as muy hialeah as cubanamericans , we should be ashamed of this circus , said rolando muhlig benitez , an elementary school teacher who is running as a reform candidate in next week s city council election cow tongues and goat heads , what sort of nonsense is that \? it makes us look ridiculous , like we 're a bunch of savages the acting mayor agrees that the city s reputation has been damaged , but says it is not his fault he blames raul martinez and the chief , rolando bolanos , who has called him a liar on local radio programs and is viewed as an ally of the suspended mayor mr bolanos said it is more than ridiculous , it is stupid for julio martinez to suggest that i am a santero , or santeria priest i do n't know of any police officer in this department who believes in santeria , he added the chief said the problems between julio martinez and me are the result not of factional politics but of his political interference in criminal investigations , hiring and transfers residents say they are irritated by the dispute because it prevents officials from focusing on the city s real problems hialeah s population has grown rapidly , and lax zoning procedures and the absence of a master city plan have combined to create urban sprawl , with hospitals and automobile repair shops popping up in the middle of residential blocks i do n't mind if the politicians fight among themselves , as politicians always do , antonio hernandez said in response to a question as he emerged from a supermarket but if city services and law enforcement suffer , and there is chaos , that is intolerable we voters are going to have to bring this to a stop voters will go to the polls here next week to elect four city council members , which may clarify the situation but gov lawton chiles has refused to remove raul martinez from office , saying a conviction is final only when the appeal process is exhausted that decision was upheld this month by the florida supreme court , creating the prospect of continued sparring between supporters of the two martinezes until the next mayoral election , scheduled for november 1993 this is just another chapter in a long and dirty soap opera , mr muhlig benitez said wearily it just keeps getting worse and worse , and i am afraid there is more to come
los angeles , feb 27 on sunset boulevard , huge billboards proclaim that goodfellas has been nominated for six academy awards and awakenings for three at home , the nearly 5 , 000 performers , technicians and executives who actually select the oscar winners have once again been besieged with promotional brochures , videocassettes and screening and party invitations , all submitted for your consideration for most of the moviegoing public , the academy awards are a onenight affair but across hollywood , a long and clamorous campaign annually sets the stage for the carefully orchestrated television ceremony drawing on everything from technology to emotional appeals , the competitors are once again pulling out all the stops in their efforts to take home a statuette when the academy of motion picture arts and sciences announces the winners on march 25 more than prestige is at stake , of course an oscar victory in a category like best picture or best actor can result in millions of dollars in additional revenues for a movie , especially overseas , and more than justifies the hundreds of thousands of dollars hollywood studios typically spend to support a movie that has won several nominations but mounting such a drive is an art of its own the trick , practitioners at publicity agencies and movie studios say , is to be persistent without being so pushy as to risk a voter backlash , and to be innovative without overlooking traditional tactics proven to work now , the video ploy the latest wrinkle in oscar campaigns is the use of videocassettes , mailed to academy members at their homes , in hopes they will watch a movie that they are unable or unwilling to see in a theater or at a screening the practice has become especially popular among smaller independent distributors who want to promote films that have had only limited public exposure , and it is credited with at least part of the success that four such movies achieved when the nominations were announced earlier this month the frenchlanguage version of cyrano de bergerac , distributed by orion classics , won five nominations miramax , a small new yorkbased company , sent out the grifters and mr and mrs bridge , movies that together won five nominations avenue films pulled the biggest upset of all when richard harris was nominated for best actor on the basis of his performance in the field , which is showing in only 30 theaters and has earned less than a million dollars at the box office though oscar winners are selected by all academy members , the nominees in each category are not directors are picked only by their fellow directors , and actors by actors so avenue films sent videocassettes of the field to the approximately 1 , 300 people who are members of the academy s actors' branch and hoped that mr harris s peers would be impressed by his strong performance aiming at the actors we ca n't spend a lot of money , the way the major studios do , but we had to find a way to keep the profile of the film up , said cary brokaw , the president of avenue films we felt early on that a best actor nomination for richard harris was our best bet , and we also hoped to secure a best supporting actor nomination for john hurt , so we targeted the actors' branch and are delighted we did anything that conveys a personal touch also helps several academy members said they were charmed to receive a letter from diane ladd , who was in fact nominated for best supporting actress for her role in wild at heart some academy members have also received invitations to oscarrelated parties , such as the one that the actor and director leonard nimoy sponsored last month for michael verhoeven , the german director whose movie the nasty girl is now one of the five contenders for the bestforeignfilm award similar events have been organized to bring mr harris , a hollywood outsider , together with academy voters the backbone of any academy award campaign , however , continues to be the advertisements taken out in trade journals like variety and the hollywood reporter since thanksgiving , the pages of both publications have been filled with hundreds of pages of elaborate color ads , often spilling over two pages and showing crucial scenes and screening dates for a movie a studio is plugging admittedly sham campaigns in the initial phase , at least , many such advertisements tout films or performances that have no realistic chance of obtaining a nomination these , studio executives admit , are purchased anyway in order to stroke the ego of an actor , director or writer more and more , agents are demanding that an obligatory oscar campaign be written into the contracts of their clients , regardless of whether a picture really deserves it or not , said a publicity executive at one studio we go along with it because this is a business built on longterm relationships , and you do n't want to jeopardize those a few hollywood veterans lament that elaborate parties or dinners seem to have fallen into disfavor , which studio executives attribute both to high costs and a lack of effectiveness a tactic that does not seem to be going out of favor is that of the special brochure , booklet or coffeetable book mailed to voters the most notable examples this year are a 144page journal of the making of dances with wolves , also available commercially for 1595 a copy , and a lush , specially embossed family album for the godfather part iii but ion pictures , a tiny independent producer , also sent out a cassette and series of mailings plugging the closer , a virtually unknown film starring danny aiello that campaign ended with a none too subtle reminder that began dear academy member as you know , now is the time to return your academy award ballot and pleaded for voter consideration for mr aiello and the movie s director , screenwriters and soundtrack composers determined or desperate \? there are a lot of special mailers , but i do n't think they are effective , said the producer irwin winkler , who won a best picture award in 1976 for rocky and is in the running this year with goodfellas they are more annoying than anything else , and all they show is that some people are so desperate they will do anything to get a vote overkill , mr winkler and other hollywood veterans said , often leads to a backlash against the movie being promoted it also incurs the disapproval of the academy , which wants to discourage the notion that oscars can be won by anything other than merit this year , as in the past , you may be importuned by advertisements , promotional gifts , dinner invitations and other lobbying tactics in an attempt to solicit your vote , the academy warned members in a recent mailing though the crude solicitations that occasionally surfaced in earlier years seem to be a thing of the past , we would ask each individual academy member to be on guard against inappropriate attempts to influence your vote , and to register your displeasure with anyone who might make such an attempt of course , nothing can be done in behalf of a movie or an actor unless the studio knows who the voters are and where they are living , which can be a daunting task the academy does not make its membership rolls public , but every studio , public relations agency and production company worth its salt goes to great lengths to maintain its own uptodate list over the years , certain studios have had persons or departments assigned to do nothing but keep up an academy list , said dale olson , who is chairman of the academy s public relations committee there is one person retired from one studio department who maintains a studio list and rents it out for 3 , 000 plus the cost of the mailing photos gerard

it takes some doing for someone other than an irishman to win the wanamaker mile at the millrose games since 1977 , eamonn coglan has won it seven times and marcus o sullivan four times , including 198890 for an instant friday night in madison square garden , the 29yearold o sullivan looked as if he would make it four straight after running more than four laps on the shoulder of noureddine morceli , he squeezed into a lead , only to see morceli respond immediately by surging over the final lap and a half and gliding through the tape in a time of 3 minutes 5350 seconds it was the secondfastest millrose mile performance ever , just a halfsecond behind coglan s winning time in 1981 o sullivan was second in 3 5517 and steve scott third in 3 5777 resembling aouita morceli is not from ireland he s from tenes , a small , seaside town of 50 , 000 people in algeria , about midway between algiers to the east and oran to the west he is also 1 of 10 children , the fifth oldest among two sisters and seven brothers of workingclass parents , and he looks a lot like said aouita , the moroccan who holds world outdoor records at five distances none of which are reasons the o sullivans of the world may worry about him over the next 10 years or so morceli is 20 years old between june and september of last year , he ran in 13 worldclass races over 1 , 500 meters and won 10 of them , including the grand prix final , with two secondplace finishes and one third he also had the fastest time of the year , 3 3260 , and by december he became the youngest ever to gain the world s top ranking at the distance back in algeria , he was named the country s sportsman of the year it has all been so dizzying , if not unexpected morceli began running seriously as a young teenager , trying to emulate his older brother , abdelrahne , a twotime african champion who ranked as high as seventh in the world at 1 , 500 meters , in 1977 to further his development , morceli enrolled at riverside community college in california , a favorite of other african runners , including julius kariuki , the 1988 olympic champion in the 3 , 000meter steeplechase from kenya kariuki helped recruit morceli several years ago good running school he told me it was a good college for middledistance runners , morceli said yesterday in an interview at a midtown hotel he had trained there before the olympics morceli enrolled in january 1989 and not long after , encountered aouita for the first time , in an indoor mile race in los angeles like many young african runners , morceli idolized aouita , but not only for his records aouita had been a friend of morceli s older brother , though at the time of the race , aouita had not made the connection after the race , which aouita won and morceli finished fifth , morceli introduced himself i told him i was the brother of his friend , morceli said he was 18 at the time he was surprised , because i was so young while they have not competed against each other since , they kept in contact , and last month , aouita invited morceli to join him for several weeks , training in mexico city it was the first time at the higher altitude for morceli we 're trying everything now , experimenting , he said i'm looking for the best possible training effortless ending so far , so good morceli looked unspent as he finished the race friday night , his first indoor event of the season pulling away from o sullivan , he seemed to run effortlessly he has tremendous power in his legs , said o sullivan , looking slightly disappointed i probably ran the best millrose of my life with two laps to go , i thought i was going to go by him but i could n't get by him , and that was the breaking point of the race it came down to a 200meter sprint , and he s not ranked no 1 in the world for nothing it is curious to note that several days before the race , o sullivan pronounced himself fit and eager , if not likely , to win the race morceli said after his victory , i'm still not in perfect shape the two will meet in another mile race friday night in the vitalis meadowlands invitational in east rutherford , nj it will definitely be a faster race , o sullivan said , a faster catandmouse game which is fine with morceli i still have more to prove , he said honor for harris for winning the men s 600meter race in a meet record time of 1 0791 , more than a full second in front of danny harris and thomas schonlebe of germany , mark everett was named the night s outstanding performer connie price extended her meet record in the women s shot put to 60 feet 9 1 4 inches , an improvement of 410 3 4 the women s mile was enjoyable for its competitive nature , as the first six runners finished within 209 seconds of each other , led by doina melinte s 4 3381 but tatyana samolenko of the soviet union , the 1988 olympic champion at 3 , 000meters , was not among them she finished 10th and last in the unsightly time of 4 4457 her friend and teammate , lilia nurodtinova , did not do much better in the 800 , finishing 6th and last
preemptive cocktails albany s legislative leaders and gov mario m cuomo engaged in handtohand political combat this spring over the state budget , an exercise that pushed budget adoption two months past its legal deadline and left everyone involved embittered and exhausted so why were they all mingling over cocktails and canapes together at the governor s mansion one day last week \? so they do n't have to go through similar brinkmanship next spring , they hope the governor has convened several bipartisan task forces to discuss big budget issues like medicaid cost containment and criminaljustice reform , even though it is more than six months before the 199293 state budget is to be adopted four of the six task forces met for the first time last wednesday , followed at the end of the day by the conviviality session at the governor s house maybe nothing will come of it , the governor said later to reporters with a small shrug but at least we 're making a sincere effort legislative leaders seemed amenable to the new approach , though none said that any agreements were reached in the first round among them there was something less than optimism that peace would break out at the height of budget time next spring it s like chicken soup , said saul weprin , a queens democrat and the chairman of the assembly s ways and means committee it certainly wo n't hurt despite the bonhomie reported by many participants , it was n't long before there was a bit of bipartisan sniping republicans , who control the state senate , complained that several of their medicaid costcutting ideas produced only glazed eyes among their democratic counterparts one idea was to institute a photoidentification system for program recipients in order to cut down on fraud we were the only ones who really brought anything to the table , said john daly , a republican state senator from the niagara falls area the democrats kept saying that we had to talk about longterm solutions , but there are plenty of things you could do right now the price of incumbency despite the recession , the price of a lot of things keeps going up take the price of holding on to a legislative seat in trenton a new study of primary campaign spending by the new jersey election law enforcement commission , a state agency , has found that incumbent lawmakers , who spent just over 1 million on their primary campaigns in 1987 , spent 16 million this year , an increase running above the rate of inflation all told , incumbents spent twice what challengers did in the primaries last year , and the disparity appears to be growing the last time that both the senate and the general assembly were up for election , in 1987 , incumbents spent 51 percent of the total amount expended last year it was 70 percent and while total primary spending by incumbents shot up 63 percent in that period , the spending by challengers actually dropped 23 percent a report by the agency on generalelection spending is scheduled to be issued later the top spender in a senate primary was thomas h paterniti , democrat of edison , who spent 198 , 000 , although he wound up losing to a challenger who spent 130 , 000 dick kamin , republican of mount olive , spent the most among assembly members , 112 , 000 , in a victorious effort even bigger numbers are expected in november , with several candidates having already received 300 , 000 in donations two months beforehand battle on the thames the thames river in eastern connecticut , which forms part of the border between the 18th and 20th state senate districts , has become a skirmish line in the fight over the state s new income tax democrats would like to change the river s political course to repay a debt district 18 is home to senator steven spellman , a democrat who provided one of the swing votes needed to pass an income tax and a budget last month after weeks of deadlock with gov lowell p weicker jr democratic party leaders , who mostly backed the governor s budget overhaul plan , want to reward mr spellman and help his reelection chances next year by changing the district lines they would move the predominantly democratic city of new london on the west bank of the thames into mr spellman s east bank district republican leaders would like to make the same change , but to settle a score district 20 , on the west bank , is home to senator lawrence j bettencourt , a republican who also voted for the income tax , to the deep consternation of his party , which stood mostly united against it mr bettencourt is vitally concerned about keeping new london in his district because he believes residents there will gain from state programs paid for by the income tax , and thank him for his tax vote in the 1992 elections in return for losing new london , mr bettencourt s district could pick up several heavily republican suburban towns that might not be as favorably disposed toward the income tax republican leaders said even before the tax vote that they would do all in their power to see that renegades like mr bettencourt were punished , and their agenda in negotiating the redistricting plan has been driven by the notion that 1992 will mark the voters' revenge on all who strayed from the state s noincometax tradition photos gov mario m cuomo lawrence j bettencourt
los angeles , june 19 a police captain and two officers under his command were acquitted today of misdemeanor vandalism and conspiracy charges stemming from a 1988 drug raid in which officers wielding axes and rams did extensive damage to four apartments soon after the verdicts were returned , the prosecutor told reporters that the case had been lost because of a code of silence within the los angeles police department and that this code had led some officers who were called as witnesses to give perjured testimony in support of the defendants asked whether he would pursue perjury charges , the prosecutor , deputy district attorney christopher a darden , said he would look into the possibility the raid , which brought perhaps the most intensely publicized case involving charges of los angeles police misconduct until the beating of rodney g king three months ago , was undertaken by more than 70 officers but led to criminal charges against only four they were capt thomas elfmont , sgt charles spicer and officer todd b parrick , all of whom a municipal court jury acquitted today , and officer charles a wilson , who in march pleaded no contest to vandalism charges and was sentenced to two years' probation 'wrong men , ' foreman says after the verdicts were announced today , the foreman and several other members of the jury said they believed that at least some of the officers who participated in the raid had committed criminal acts of vandalism but i do n't think that these are the men who did it , the foreman , isom cox , a 24yearold photocopy clerk , said of the defendants i think the wrong men were brought to trial captain elfmont , who had ordered the raid but was not present when it was carried out , said he too believed that there had been vandalism but that the wrong officers had been charged he said he thought that five to seven other officers , all of whom were at the scene , could have been brought to trial and that he had been accused because i was a captain the raid , on a pair of twoapartment buildings near the los angeles memorial coliseum that were suspected of being drug houses , occurred on aug 1 , 1988 walls were smashed , furniture and television sets destroyed , and appliances thrown out of windows the prosecution argued that captain elfmont , who then commanded the police department s southwest division , had ordered his officers to level the buldings that sergeant spicer , a supervisor at the scene , had failed to stop the destruction , and that officer parrick had been an axwielding freelancer , smashing everything in his path the raiders discovered a rifle , less than an ounce of cocaine and five ounces of marijuana thirtythree residents and passersby were detained but only five were charged , and none were ever convicted last winter the city paid more than 3 million to settle civil suits resulting from the raid
boston more than any other people on earth , americans today are free to think what they wish and say what they think we owe the breadth of that freedom in significant part to one man , a judge who was born in boston 150 years ago today oliver wendell holmes jr was an extraordinary figure in american history he was a supreme court justice who became a popular hero in his time because of his dissents on behalf of unpopular speakers anarchists , pacifists , socialists he utterly disagreed with their views but passionately believed in their right to express them he was a scholar who believed in the nobility of war he was a philosopher and a cavalier a dashing figure who loved wine and women he was appointed to the court in 1902 , when he was 61 years old he served for 30 years , and at the end he was as liberated in spirit as at the beginning above all , the story of justice holmes shows the power of rhetoric in our free system by the evocative force of his words he made the country , and eventually the court , see the true meaning of the first amendment s command that congress make no law abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press the supreme court had reduced the promise of the first amendment to virtual meaninglessness by interpreting it to allow punishment of speech that the majority of people disliked during world war i speakers who even mildly criticized official policy were jailed then , in 1919 , holmes dissented in one of those cases , abrams v united states three anarchists and a socialist had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for criticizing president wilson s military intervention in russia against the revolution holmes wrote when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths , they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market that at any rate is the theory of our constitution it is an experiment , as all life is an experiment while that experiment is part of our system i think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death holmes fought in the civil war and was wounded three times he spoke of war as inevitable and rational , and he often used military imagery when franklin roosevelt called on him in 1933 , in the depths of the depression , holmes said form your ranks and fight but he dissented when the court upheld the denial of citizenship to an immigrant , rosika schwimmer , because she would not promise to take up arms in defense of the united states holmes was 88 when he wrote if there is any principle of the constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other , it is the principle of free thought not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate i would suggest that the quakers have done their share to make the country what it is and that i had not supposed hitherto that we regretted our inability to expel them because they believe more than some of us do in the teachings of the sermon on the mount justice brandeis joined holmes in those dissents and wrote his own in other cases the force of their rhetoric and their reasoning eventually won the day today the entire court accepts their dissents as law on his 90th birthday , in 1931 , holmes gave a brief talk on the radio the riders in a race do not stop short when they reach the goal , he said there is a little finishing canter but the canter that brings you to a standstill need not be only coming to rest it cannot be while you still live for to live is to function that is all there is in living and so i end with a line from a latin poet more than 1 , 500 years ago 'death plucks my ear and says , live i am coming' the stoic message moved its listeners what almost none realized was that the latin poem quoted by holmes was a hedonistic verse entitled the syrian dancing girl its theme was eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow we die the cavalier had mocked pomposity
kuwait city , may 25 ahmed waved his hand toward a water truck that lurched to a stop next to a shoulderhigh pile of garbage , one of hundreds that line the streets of his neighborhood , jalib alshuyukh you see that tanker of water \? ahmed said we have to pay for that water for kuaitis , water is free for us , we have to pay you know why \? we are bedoons ahmed , who like other residents said he was afraid to give his last name , is a bedoon no one knows how many bedoons were here before iraq invaded kuwait last aug 2 , but estimates range from 150 , 000 to several hundred thousand they are on the margins of kuwaiti society , regarded neither as kuwaitis nor any other nationality they are officially stateless now they hover in a limbo of disquiet and resentment i was taken by the iraqis on aug 3 because i was in the kuwaiti army , ahmed said they came and got us i was in prison until i came back on march 27 now i do nothing i went to headquarters three times i asked our officers when i could come back to my job they say 'not yet' every time , they say 'not yet' in the army or the police a bedoon man s best hope was for work as a policemen or in the army now , however , the kuwaiti government is seeking to purge the country of all nonkuwaiti arabs the 300 , 000 or so palestinian residents are the largest such group , and the bedoons are second for even though many bedoons were born in kuwait and serve in its security forces , the government does not consider them to be kuwaitis in the last century , and more so in the early decades of this one , nomadic shepherds , most from iraq but indifferent to national boundaries , settled in kuwait because they were not rooted in the pursuits of the original families of kuwait fishing , trading or pearl fishing they remained apart from the society that formed the modern state these people became known as bedoons , from the arabic word for without they are not to be confused with the bedouins , the dwindling number scattered across north africa , sinai and the arabian peninsula who retain their nomadic ways garbage and war debris the bedoons are settled they became kuwait s street sweepers and garbage collectors , the menial laborers on the fringes of one of the world s most luxuriant economies they remained stateless , citizens of no country jalib alshuyukh is a slum of compact cement apartment buildings , small apartments crowded by large families , a district wallowing in months of garbage and war debris the blueuniformed street sweepers employed by waste management , the american trash removal concern , are not seen here on crumbling steps , crouched in glassstrewn lots or on abandoned automobile seats , young bedoon men gather in the late afternoon to assess their plight , discuss missing family members and wonder about the future i myself am jobless , said one , who gave his name only as mohammed my father is a soldier , a technician in the kuwait army i was born in kuwait but i cannot get a job no one here can get jobs his words evoked murmurs of agreement from a growing audience of fellow bedoons the fate of these kuwait city bedoons is not very different from that of some 5 , 000 bedoons who languish in a refugee camp of blue and orange tents in abdali , just yards from the iraqi border disavowed by kuwait most of the bedoons in abdali traveled back and forth between kuwait and iraq during the sevenmonth occupation , just as they had in earlier years they were in iraq with their flocks of sheep , their loads of rice or blankets when the ceasefire was declared in the persian gulf war , joined the tide of refugees fleeing the iraqi army s suppression of a shiite muslim rebellion and ended up in abdali a few weeks ago , there were more than 11 , 000 iraqis , mostly shiites , in a neighboring camp run by the american military but those refugees were transferred to new camps in iran and saudi arabia , leaving only the bedoons to endure the increasingly frequent sandstorms that howl across northern kuwait at this time of year although many of the bedoons in the abdali camp were born and raised in kuwait , the government here has disavowed them , refusing to allow them to reenter prince sadruddin aga khan , the special representative of the united nations secretary general , javier perez de cuellar , met recently with kuwait s crown prince and prime minister , sheik saad alabdullah alsabah , and raised the issue of the bedoons on the border according to an official traveling with the prince , sheik saad declared , the bedoons are not kuwait s problem a senior officer at the american embassy said the issue of the bedoons is raised in virtually every official conversation with the kuwaitis , but that the government shows little willingness to confront the problem the residents of jalib alshuyukh say they are equally ignored suleiman , a young man from the neighborhood , spoke with despair of his postwar life i was born here , he said my father died here he was a shepherd , from the desert i was a sergeant in the army , in engineering during the occupation , i moved from house to house because the iraqis were searching for me i changed my id and now i have no job , no work , no money the army said not to come to work he patted the side of a decrepit blue pickup truck i have this , he said i use it as a taxi and make a bit of money but if the army does n't want me , what will i do \? because so many bedoons were in the army and the police , many of them died in the first violent days of president saddam hussein s takeover but the kuwaiti government has acknowledged none of this khalid , a student at kuwait university , told his father s story my father was in the army , he said six months ago , the iraqis came and took him he is lost we do n't know anything about him we ask the government and they say nothing as for me , he said , i do n't know if i can go back to the university they have said nothing he stopped for a moment , and then asked , why are they ashamed of us \? photo bedoons exist on the margins of kuwaiti society , regarded neither as kuwaitis nor any other nationality at a camp in abdali , on the iraq border , about 5 , 000 bedoons languish , awaiting permission to reenter kuwait \( steve lehman saba \)
washington , nov 7 in a calculated move to intensify the political debate on abortion before the 1992 elections , abortion rights groups today asked the supreme court to take up a case that could decide the validity of the 1973 roe v wade decision that established the constitutional right to abortion abortion rights advocates acknowledged that calling for the supreme court to rule on a pennsylvania case decided two weeks ago risked an outright reversal , by the increasingly conservative court , of the 1973 ruling that made abortions available throughout the country but in mounting their political ploy , the organizations made clear that they were looking beyond the supreme court and trying to make abortion policies of the bush administration an issue in the 1992 election timing belongs to pennsylvania even so , the timing is up to the state of pennsylvania , which has indicated that it wants to bring the case to the supreme court , but can delay the case by waiting until late january to file its legal papers kate mershimer , a senior deputy attorney general in pennsylvania who is the leading lawyer in the case , said that everybody s considering the options and that no decision had been made about how quickly the state will file its appeal if it takes until late january , the full length of time allowed under the supreme court s rules , the justices would probably not be able to argue and decide the case in the current term , which ends in late june before asking the court for a review , ernest d preate jr , the pennsylvania attorney general , said he would file a motion with the appeals court asking it to lift an injunction that has been in place since 1989 in an effort to allow the pennsylvania law to take effect even if pennsylvania files before the end of january , there is no requirement that the nine justices hear the case or rule in 1992 the justices meet to schedule cases , and it is reasonable to presume that the five justices appointed by presidents reagan and bush might be wary of a case that would cause electionyear turmoil for a republican incumbent in the white house mr preate is a republican many analysts have suggested that a reversal of roe v wade by conservative justices appointed by president bush could damage him with some voters , including women in his own party in a petition to the court , the american civil liberties union and the planned parenthood foundation of america requested that the court take the case from pennsylvania , in which a federal appeals court on oct 21 upheld most of the state s restrictive abortion law by acting today , these groups were seeking to hasten the legal process under normal circumstances , the groups would have waited 90 days instead of two weeks to seek a supreme court review , and the court would have not had time to hear arguments in the case until next fall while upholding most of the pennsylvania law , the appeals court struck down a portion requiring women to notify their husbands before seeking an abortion it upheld provisions that call for a 24hour waiting period for women seeking abortions and a requirement that a doctor inform them about the development of the fetus and alternatives to abortion a political lightning rod lobbyists on both sides agree that the pennsylvania case is the only legal vehicle that could produce a supreme court decision on abortion before the 1992 election there are other cases in the pipeline that could provide a test of roe v wade , but none of those can reach the court next year supporters of the right to an abortion acknowledge that the justices may decide not to issue a decision on the pennsylvania case before then , but they hope to make the case into a political lightning rod by focusing attention on it even if it does not come before the election , it will still be a major issue in this election , faye wattleton , president of planned parenthood , said at a news conference here this is not whether it s better for us politically , but what is better for women we will not permit the courts to have the last word on this ever again , and we will show our strength in the polls because we simply will not go back the justices could decide to hear arguments in the case in their current term , in which case a decision would come by early july another possibility is that the court will agree within the next few months to review the case , but will not schedule arguments until october 1992 , a few weeks before the presidential election the action marked an adjustment in strategy by the abortion rights groups , who seem now to be looking to the court as a political foil rather than a source of redress this means they must frame their strategy as more of a legislative battle than a judicial one there is no other recourse , said kate michelman , executive director of the national abortion rights action league the political road is the only road left to travel to secure our right to choose the prochoice majority must make democracy work for us we must elect a prochoice president or a vetoproof congress glen a halvaneubauer , a political science instructor at furman university in greenville , sc , and who specializes in the politics of abortion , said the abortion rights groups are now risking that the court will overturn roe v wade and open the door for states to outlaw abortion while abortion rights groups may expect the court to overturn roe v wade , mr halvaneubauer asserted , this could be a rallying cry for them to say , 'this is what the court has wrought' by getting this out there now , they 're not waiting for some day of reckoning what the prochoice people are thinking here is that they need to get people mobilized again , and the best way to do that is to have all the hoopla surrounding the case build to a tremolo pitch denise neary , executive director of the pennsylvania prolife federation , said she does not expect abortion rights groups to be any more successful in mobilizing support than they were after webster v reproductive health services , the supreme court ruling in 1989 that reduced barriers to state regulation of abortion they seem to think they can scare everyone into rising up against prolife politicians , ms neary said and i do think it s going to backfire because they claimed that was what was going to happen post webster i think they ultimately know that roe v wade is doomed and they 've just decided this is the best way to raise money and raise a fuss photo abortion rights groups have asked the supreme court to take up a case that could overturn roe v wade in washington were , from left , faye wattleton , president of planned parenthood kate michelman , executive director of

errol parker drummer sob s the drummer errol parker s show at sob s on tuesday night steadfastly refused any allegiances the music , performed by a large band that included four saxophonists , a trombonist and a trumpeter , may have been jazz , for those broadminded enough to accept pop influences , nonamerican influences and general eccentricity under the title it had elements of easy listening music the saccharine soprano saxophone appeared more than once and at times the music reached a pop intensity but it was really none of these because it brings together the various elements almost surreptitiously , mr parker s odd and personal music does n't sound eclectic sitting at the front of the stage , behind a drum kit that substituted a conga drum for a snare drum and had only a few cymbals , mr parker forced himself on his melange , turning out a sound that relied heavily on the euphoria of polyphony it was as if he was making a claim that a full band blowing hard produced the best form of intimacy mr parker constructed his pieces with care , building them around his complex drum patterns his ideas took their color and timbre from the sound of wood on slack skin , giving the sound a rural , ethnic feel he layered the horns over his drums , the band members talking back and forth in solos but individual improvisations were n't the point when the band was honking and shouting over mr parker s angled rhythms , the music carried a type of communal power that is unusual in an age of professional music making
it took the biggest scandal in olympic history to force track and field authorities around the world to engage a serious campaign against athletes' use of performanceenhancing drugs once ben johnson of canada failed his drug test at the 1988 games in seoul , south korea , many countries , including the united states , expanded their testing programs , and most evidence suggests the efforts have helped diminish the problem but the increased vigilance has brought about another phenomenon , certainly unintended but unfortunate , nonetheless the infrequency of a world record in the 38 individual events that will be contested in the mobil national championships starting tomorrow on randalls island , just nine world records have been established since the olympics five in 1989 , two in 1990 and two so far this season those figures represent a sharp decline against the outdoor seasons after the two previous summer olympics , 1980 in moscow and 1984 in los angeles the years 1981 and 1982 produced world marks in 20 events and a matching world record in another in 1985 and 1986 , world records were set in 26 events and equaled in two others a closer examination of the post1988 marks would suggest an even smaller likelihood that any might emerge this week among the athletes who set world records after the 1988 olympics , just two are americans and neither is competing randy barnes , who put the shot 75 feet 10 1 4 inches on may 20 , 1990 , was suspended from competition for two years for testing positive after a meet last august roger kingdom , who lowered the 110meter record to 1292 seconds on aug 16 , 1989 , has withdrawn because of recent surgery just two of the world records since seoul have been set by women in the triple jump , an event not yet on the olympic program , and the 10 , 000kilometer walk the pole vault and men s javelin throw are the only events in which records have fallen since 1989 sergei bubka of the soviet union has twice extended the pole mark this year , and seppo raty of finland has thrown the javelin for records twice this year two other athletes set world records in the javelin last year , steve backley of britain twice and patrik boden of sweden since the games in seoul , in the 100meter sprints , an event in which johnson proved drugs could be a huge advantage , only two men have run under 10 seconds in the 100meter dash \( leroy burrell four times and raymond stewart of jamaica once \) and only two women have run under 11 seconds \( merlene ottey of jamaica three times and dawn sowell once \) carl lewis , who set the men s record of 992 seconds in 1988 , has not run faster than 1005 since then florence griffith joyner , who set the current world records at 100 \( 1049 \) and 200 \( 2134 \) the same year , has retired although there may be other rationales for the infrequency of world records since the seoul games , none seems so plausible as the increase in drug testing , which now involves outofcompetition testing in more countries than ever before the testing has definitely had an effect , said edwin moses , whose world record in the 400meter hurdles in 1983 still stands since the olympics in seoul , moses has worked closely with the athletics congress , the national governing body for track and field , and the united states olympic committee , helping them improve their testing programs only now , he said , are the programs reaching the point where they can work with maximum effectiveness officials at tac , in particular , have closed a big loophole by hiring more drug testers last year , 376 of 686 athletes , nearly 55 percent , designated for testing in the outofcompetition program were excused because they lived beyond 75 miles of the nearest available tester it s going to be much harder for people to use drugs now , moses said either they are going to have to find drugs that ca n't be detected , or they 're going to have to stop taking them the post1988 era has affected the sport in other ways , as well evelyn ashford , a worldclass sprinter since 1975 , recently suggested that future female sprinters would probably focus more on the 200 , rather than the 100 , because griffith joyner took all the fun out of the 100 meters , with such a stunning time ashford did not accuse griffith joyner of using drugs , but she contended that the mark was beyond reach for the next generation and that a record in the 200 might be more attainable the rarity of a record might also lead the public to a greater appreciation of competition , as well as the work of athlete and coach , rather than athlete and pharmacist
in cities and towns far and wide , americans took time out from their workaday lives yesterday to tune into an extraordinary civics lesson the riveting collision before the senate judiciary committee between judge clarence thomas , the supreme court nominee , and anita f hill , the oklahoma law professor who said she was sexually harassed by him for a nearly a week now , since the charges became public , they have been topic no 1 in offices and universities , in restaurants and on street corners , with many women celebrating the sudden public discussion of a heretofore private subject and many men wondering about their own conduct , present , past and future the old rules are going out , said steve traub , a student at the stanfordmedical school in palo alto , calif , who gathered with a group of friends to watch the proceedings we do n't really have new rules in place yet but at least now we 're talking about it there s plenty of disagreement among people watching and listening to the hearings about who was telling the truth and who was not , plenty of debate about whether the confusing set of facts and allegations ought to disqualify judge thomas from service on the high court , plenty of speculating and ruminating about why professor hill was there telling her story and whether the senate had handled her situation properly anguish and fury the vivid details of professor hill s account and the raw anguish of judge thomas s defense at times left spectators gasping who could have imagined just a few days ago that a quiet baptist woman would be in the senate chamber and on national television describing conversations about pubic hair or penis size \? who could have imagined a supreme court nominee alternately on the edge of tears and trembling with fury as he described the anguish he and his family have suffered \? was it possible , television viewers asked each other , that judge thomas could have done or said even half the things that professor hill accused him of without understanding that he crossed some boundary between repartee and abuse \? or alternatively , was it possible that she could have some political agenda or emotional disturbance that would lead to such carefully crafted lies \? it s still his word against hers , said floyd stevenson , a barber at the hyde park hair salon in chicago but i 'd say judge thomas has a problem because of the graphic detail she is providing which one to believe \? many people watching the hearings were struck by the impossible task of knowing for sure whom to believe when two unshakable witnesses tell diametrically opposed stories , which is often the case with sexual harassment claims that s what s so problematic about this stuff , said karen seal , a medical student at stanford , where the campus was rocked a few months back by the resignation and subsequent return of a prominent female neurosurgeon who charged she had endured 25 years of subtle and notsosubtle sexism each person sounds so believable how do human beings judge \? many viewers were saddened by the belief that professor hill and judge thomas , both individuals of good reputation and credentials , would emerge scarred from these hearings , whatever the resolution it s incredibly sad , said jill kasle , a professor of public administration at george washington university in the nation s capital , where people were so preoccupied by the hearings that lunch dates were forgotten and the streets were almost deserted at midday everybody is in an impossible position 'it s unfortunate for both' the same sentiment was heard at a ymca in greenwich , conn , where a television just off the lobby acted like a magnet for employees and patrons alike i think it s unfortunate for both sides , said beth finger , a ymca trustee they 're both very sympathetic and tragic figures many people said that the ragged and ruthless process of confirming supreme court nominees , or electing presidents , for that matter , was to blame for incalculable suffering none of us could pass the scrutiny they go through , said bill jenkins , an engineer on the stanford campus , who completed his tasks yesterday with radio headphones firmly on his head this dirty linen stuff that s one of the reasons i would not want to go into politics the process could get even dicier now , some people said in recent years , candidates for appointed or elective posts have been pilloried for sexual liaisons and drug use and now , conceivably , another moral litmus test has been added to a growing list sexual harassment is so pervasive , but nobody asked about that before , said whitney carrico , another stanford medical student many people could be held accountable for this who s going to be the next appointment \? he could be accused of the same thing captivating audiences from clarence thomas s hometown of pin point , ga , to morris , okla , where anita hill s family still lives on the farm where she grew up , and even to the supreme court itself , televisions tuned to the hearings captivated audiences the justices of the supreme court , who attended their regular closeddoor friday morning conference , missed the opening hours of the senate hearing , but the sounds of the hearing were audible in the corridors behind their conference room , emanating from the television sets and radios of their law clerks and secretaries
providence , ri , feb 9 cheered on by a record civic center crowd of 13 , 307 fans , eric murdock , the leading scorer in the big east conference pumped in 23 of his gamehigh 28 points in the second half tonight to lead providence to a 7564 victory over st john s we did n't play him any different in the second half i just think he did n't take as many shots in the first half , the st john s coach , lou carnesecca , whose redmen \( 165 over all and 75 in the big east \) have lost two games in a row , said of murdock for one thing , he s a very good driver and when he does drive he can kick the ball off to chris watts or tony turner murdock , who came into the game averaging 305 points , missed his only 3point attempt in the first half and 5 of the 6 shots he took before intermission , but came out blazing in the second half he hit 6 of 8 shots from the field , including all 5 he took from 3point range , in the second half team effort turner had 11 points and marques bragg 9 to help the friars \( 148 , 56 \) in scoring , and bragg pulled down a gamehigh 9 rebounds as providence outrebounded the redmen , 3326 in the final analysis , it was what the redmen did n't do that cost them the game malik sealy and rob werdann had 12 points apiece for st john s , but sealy socred only one field goal in each half he even misfired on what should have been a follow dunk werdann only scored 3 of his points in the second half he and sealy led st john s in rebounding with 5 apiece i do n't know if i'm doing anything wrong , but the shots are just not falling , sealy said the redmen shot 37 percent from the field for the game and an atrocious 259 percent from the floor in the first half , missing 20 of their 27 shots but they managed to stay in the game thanks to 11 providence turnovers , 4 blocked shots by werdann and 80 percent shooting from the freethrow line close at halftime providence led by only 4 points at intermission , and none of the friars had scored in double figures despite the fact that the team shot 429 percent from the floor turner led providence in the half with 7 points bragg had 6 rebounds as providence had a slight rebounding edge , 1917 werdann led all scorers at halftime with 9 points , but he had picked up his third foul with 1 minute 59 seconds to play in the half , and carnesecca was forced to sit him werdann hit three out of his five attempts from the floor and three out of four from the freethrow line , but the rest of the redmen , who are usually relied upon for scoring could n't connect sealy was 1 for 4 from the floor in the first half , billy singleton 1 for 5 and jason buchanan 1 for 6 chuck sproling missed all three of his firsthalf fieldgoal attempts from the freethrow line , sealy was 3 for 5 , singleton 2 for 2 , buchanan 2 for 2 and sproling 3 for 4 in the first half providence went to the line only eight times in the first half and made seven free throws at the start of the second half , the friars came out even hotter , running off the first 6 points on the way to a 152 spurt and a 5033 lead with 14 25 left in the game a shot by singleton was the only score for the redmen during that outburst
