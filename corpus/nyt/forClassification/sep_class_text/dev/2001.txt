baloney \( henry p \) by jon scieszka illustrated by lane smith unpaged new york viking 1599 \( ages 5 and up \) henry p baloney , a small alien with a green quiff like an offcolor tintin , has a problem he is late for school , again , and miss bugscuffle is going to give him permanent lifelong detention unless he can come up with a very good and very believable excuse baloney is up to the task , for in addition to being an inventive excuse producer , he speaks or at least peppers his speech with words from latin , finnish , swahili , polish , dutch , french , esperanto , melanesian pidgin , welsh and inuktitut , among other tongues he also transposes letters to create new words , and serves up the odd spoonerism what follows is a fantastic fabulation , in which henry loses his zimulis \( pencil , in latvian \) , heads off in a torakku \( truck , japanese \) to szkola \( school , polish \) , but ends up on a razzo \( rocket , italian \) and only narrowly escapes being zerplatzen \( splattered , german \) all over the speelplaats \( playground , dutch \) miss bugscuffle is understandably impressed baloney is the latest anarchic invention of jon scieszka and lane smith , authors of such hugely popular works as the stinky cheese man and the true story of the three little pigs adults may find the hybrid locutions of henry p baloney a tad confusing at first this reader certainly did but for children learning to read , they offer a vital discovery words do not have to be learned letter by letter , but can be deduced from context , sound and shape every word has cousins in other languages , and none is completely alien you do n't actually have to speak uqbaric to know what is going on when henry has an enormous blassa pointed at him on the planet astrosus for a new reader , there is delight and reassurance in the discovery that a story can be understood without knowing the precise meaning of every word scieszka has an ear for the sort of slapstick that every 8yearold boy adores henry knows the welsh word for noise \( twrf , of course \) , but he also mixes up the astrosus word for thank you with the word for doofbrain words are like that the message of the book \( apart from the importance of keeping a complicated whopper in mind for teachers at all times \) is that mysterious words are not frightening but fun , weirdsounding collectors' items to be stashed away or flung about or mashed into one another to turn flying saucers into sighing flossers smith s collagestyle illustrations are retrostylish and wacky enough to keep pace with the text , colorful explosions of shapes , letters and what appear to be used bus tickets the story line , however , does not quite live up to the concept , for the words used to describe baloney s odyssey through space and language are rather more interesting and unexpected than anything that actually happens to him it ends with a sotto twrf , more than a zerplatzen there is something pleasingly subversive , though , about this bugeyed linguistic space creature , who adapts the words to the excuse as he goes along parents may find the scieszkalane approach to be lightyears away from the way they were taught to read , by memory more than intuition there are whole universes of language out there , and galaxies of words in the strangest constellations to be discovered language , as henry p shows , is n't rocket science but a journey through the infinite , and anyone who says otherwise is talking baloney photo detail of an illustration by lane smith from baloney \( henry p \)
government scientists said yesterday that they had found no evidence that any people had had allergic reactions to the genetically modified starlink corn the findings could dispel public concern that the corn , which spread through the nation s food supply even though it was never approved for human consumption , represents a threat to public health the results , announced by the centers for disease control and prevention , could also clear the way for the environmental protection agency to permit small amounts of the corn to be present in food without leading to recalls , something that would greatly relieve the farmers , grain processors and food companies the cdc and the food and drug administration tested the blood of 17 people who had reported suffering allergic reactions ranging from upset stomachs to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock after eating products they thought contained starlink corn the agencies looked to see if the blood contained antibodies to the protein in the corn that was considered the possible allergen no such antibodies were found , an indication that none of the people had had immune reactions to the corn protein we do not have any positive results whatsoever , said carol s rubin , a research scientist at the national center for environmental health at the cdc still , the report prepared by the centers says that there is some possibility that people could be allergic without having antibodies in their blood starlink contains a bacterial gene that permits the corn to produce a protein that kills the corn borer , a major pest but that protein , known as cry9c , has some characteristics of an allergen , mainly that it is not digested easily in the stomach because of those concerns , the corn was approved for use as animal feed but not for human consumption but it leaked into the human food supply , causing huge recalls of taco shells and other products , hurting american grain exports , forcing grain elevators and food companies to test incoming shipments of corn , and raising new concerns about the possible health effects of genetically engineered foods now , the biotechnology industry , which said all along that there was little threat to public health from the corn , may breathe a bit easier we are pleased , but not the slightest bit surprised , said l val giddings , vice president for food and agriculture of the biotechnology industry organization , a trade group critics of genetically modified food said the testing was insufficient these tests are not proof that starlink corn is safe for human consumption , said matt rand , a spokesman for genetically engineered food alert , a coalition of environmental groups this is not a thorough investigation he said the government did not test the hundreds of people who complained to food companies about reactions instead of to the fda he also said it appeared that the test might have been performed using cry9c made by bacteria , which might be different from the protein made in the corn dr rubin said she could not comment on the specifics of the antibody test because it was designed by the fda an fda spokeswoman said her agency would not comment dr marc e rothenberg , the section chief for allergy and immunology at children s hospital in cincinnati and an adviser to the epa on this issue , said that antibody tests were more likely to report false positives than false negatives just because a person has antibodies to a protein does not mean she suffered an allergic reaction , he said but if there are no antibodies , he said , there is only a tiny chance that the person had an allergic reaction the results of the blood tests will be used by the epa to decide whether to permit small amounts of starlink in human food aventis cropscience , the company that developed starlink , has asked the agency to permit such a small presence for four years , so the food industry would be spared the costs and disruptions of testing and food recalls the epa has scheduled a meeting of its scientific advisory panel for next month to discuss the issues aventis , which declined to comment on the results announced yesterday , has asserted that since most of the starlink grown has been collected by the company and the government , there is so little in the food supply that it would not cause any public health problems even if cry9c were found to be an allergen the cdc and the fda reviewed the cases of 51 people who had told the agency about allergic reactions they thought were connected to starlink of those , 28 people were considered to have had some sort of allergic reaction , while the rest were judged to have had some other health problem
as the classical music season gets under way , performers have been reconsidering their programs , trying to find meaningful , moving and soulhealing ways to respond to the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon but the program announced last spring by les violons du roy , a moderninstrument chamber orchestra , and la chapelle de qu bec , a choir , for their saturday evening concert at alice tully hall needed no tweaking the first half of the concert was devoted to haydn s lord nelson mass , a work composed during the napoleonic wars and originally called missa in angustiis , mass in time of stress after the intermission the ensembles performed the mozart requiem the concert had been tangentially touched by the disaster , having been part of the qu bec new york 2001 series , which was largely scuttled after the attack , and also part of lincoln center s great performers series , which lost the rachmaninoff concerts that were to have opened its season in his opening remarks bernard labadie , the artistic director of both ensembles , said that if he had been asked to assemble a program specifically for the occasion , it would have been the one at hand , with its balancing elements of fear and hope , death and comfort and like many other performers this week mr labadie asked for a moment of silence before the music began when it did , it was with an intensity that seemed tied to the moment the lord nelson mass demands that intensity of course , but performers in calmer times have often forgotten that and have let the martial and somewhat questioning spirit of the work s opening bars slip behind a veil of classical courtliness there was none of that here the kyrie rang out in all its complexity , the power of its trumpets and timpani opening offset by its stark dissonances and the dark hues of its minorkey motifs the taut playing of the orchestra s strings heightened the sense of tension , and the nicely polished choral singing provided the other necessary element , the sense of mankind petitioning for divine mercy all of this of course allows the undercurrent of hope in this mass to shine all the more brightly a few bars into the exuberant credo , the dark clouds of the kyrie were largely dispelled , and in the sanctus the punctuating bursts of brass and percussion were powerless to counter the sheer serenity of haydn s choral setting mr labadie had the benefit of fine soloists karina gauvin brought a bright , illuminating soprano to her solo lines throughout the work , which were offset nicely by marienicole lemieux s darker contralto timbre john tessier brought a lyrical lilt to the tenor lines , and nathan berg , the baritone , sang with a good measure of clarity and power the soloists , orchestra and choir were equally effective and affecting in mr labadie s brisk , passionate reading of the mozart requiem mr labadie used robert levin s superb completion of mozart s final , unfinished score , a version that corrects certain infelicities of the timehonored sussmayr edition , adds some music that sussmayr left out and sounds both fresh and persuasively mozartean on another occasion a listener might have dwelled on the musicological niceties of this version , but on saturday it was the music s emotional sweep that carried the moment photo john tessier , center , and nathan berg , conducted by bernard labadie \( stephanie berger for the new york times \)
the census bureau each fall goes through a ritual that is as americana as the world series a press conference is convened , and senior officials , illustrating their numbers with colorful charts , disclose to the nation the latest income data none gets more attention than the poverty level a family of four that falls below 17 , 062 in annual income falls into poverty , the bureau declared last september federal aid programs indexed to the poverty line head start , food stamps and children s health insurance , among others are then doled out accordingly , which is a lot of power for a statistic that is out of touch with reality in public opinion polls , most americans say that poverty begins north of an annual income of 20 , 000 for a family of four not even the census bureau believes its poverty numbers since 1995 the bureau has been developing a new measure , one pegged more closely to the actual cost of getting by a progress report is due in july , but building the new income and expenditure procedures and testing them take time , census bureau officials say a final proposal is not likely to reach the white house for approval in president bush s current term not that he minds his predecessor did n't whenever the question of the poverty data came up informally , said robert b reich , who was president bill clinton s first secretary of labor , the consensus was not to change the standard for fear the poverty rate would look worse although the present poverty figures , as mr reich put it , are almost meaningless defining poverty is not easy even if the census bureau s new measure calculates necessary expenditures more accurately than the current formula , the new approach , like the current one , still uses income as the single criterion for judging who is poor that leaves out neighborhoods , for instance is a ghetto family impoverished because of its crimeridden surroundings and poor schools , although the family has enough income to rise above the official poverty threshold \? and there is the issue of responsibility should the family of a hardworking fulltime employee earning the minimum wage be blamed for poverty because the minimum no longer lifts the worker s income above the poverty level , as it did in the 1960 s and early 70 s \? poverty is really the lack of freedom to have or to do basic things that you value , said amartya sen , the nobel laureate in economics by that definition , a ghetto family that wants to move to an adequate neighborhood but cannot afford to do so or is prevented by discrimination from doing so is impoverished or try this definition from benjamin i page and james r simmons , political scientists at northwestern university and the university of wisconsin , oshkosh , respectively , and the authors of what government can do \( university of chicago press \) a person deprived of things that everyone around him has is likely to suffer a sense of inadequacy , a loss of dignity and selfrespect that brings state of mind into the mix , introducing all kinds of judgments that few people agree on for all their concern about living standards , americans have left the definition of poverty to politicians , who have defined it narrowly income levels have been the only criterion since 1965 , when president lyndon b johnson adopted the present poverty formula the latest figures show that 118 percent of the population lived in poverty in 1999 , the lowest percentage in 20 years the formula is not merely a statistical statement , however it carries a particular viewpoint as well , about who is responsible for poverty government , society or the individual you neutralize poverty by keeping the focus on the characteristics of poor people rather than on the economy , politics and society more broadly construed , writes alice o'connor , a historian at the university of california in santa barbara and the author of the recently published poverty knowledge \( princeton university press \) for lawrence katz , a harvard economist , and william julius wilson , a sociologist at harvard , ghetto neighborhoods reinforce poverty and contribute to it but dismantling ghettos and integrating neighborhoods , a hugely complicated endeavor , has not been high on the agenda of any administration in 20 years nor has the minimum wage adjusted for inflation , it has declined from more than 6 an hour in the 1960 s to 525 today rather than a single poverty measure , what you really want is to develop multiple measures of deprivation and look at them on a regular basis , said rebecca blank , dean of the university of michigan s school of public policy for example , you might have a level of neighborhood crime that is some threshold level of acceptability , and then you determine how many people live in neighborhoods where the crime rate is above the acceptable level that is certainly not the current approach the present system is based on a minimally nutritious food budget devised decades ago by the department of agriculture the food budget is multiplied by three because back in the 1950 s and 60 s food was considered onethird of an average family s outlays
jakarta , indonesia , june 1 this wednesday marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of sukarno , the founding president of indonesia after months of political intrigue involving the current president , abdurrahman wahid , people here are desperate for a chance to change the subject indonesia is celebrating the birthday on june 6 with an outpouring of festivals , conferences and commemorations tens of thousands of people are expected to make a pilgrimage to blitar , the town on java s eastern end where sukarno , a hero of indonesian nationalism , was buried in 1970 a local newspaper , kompas , has published an 80page section dedicated to the milestone the articles range from a scholarly discussion of sukarno s economic legacy to profiles of his various wives sukarno s rehabilitation has been under way since his successor , suharto , was toppled in 1998 but it has gathered force as indonesia has slipped into yet another crisis parliament voted on may 30 to start proceedings to try to remove mr wahid from office he is scrambling to save his job the coincidence in timing is amazing , said daniel dhakidae , a commentator at kompas it s almost like the ghost of sukarno has come back to say , 'hey you guys , what are you doing \? ' mr dhakidae concedes that there is a good bit of revisionism in the heroic portrayal of sukarno he was no democrat , and he set the stage for three decades of authoritarian rule under president suharto for all his foibles , mr wahid has been indonesia s first freely elected president supporters of mr wahid rallied this week in jakarta to protest what they say is a witch hunt against their leader members of the sukarno front , a youth group with about 4 , 000 members , marched next to them the front says sukarno s teachings provide the only road map out of chaos we want to resuscitate the idealism and nationalism of indonesia , said zulkilfi manurung , 41 , the group s leader , who wore a black bandanna emblazoned with the words bung karno , or brother sukarno the contrast between sukarno and mr wahid could not be starker one was a dashing and impulsive soldier who wore fashionable sunglasses and claimed john f kennedy as a friend the other is a mystical muslim cleric who is nearly blind and so incapacitated by strokes that he cannot walk without help mr wahid s frailties mirror those of his country after three years of chronic upheaval , indonesia is exhausted a dispirited shadow of the place that once helped lead the asian economic miracle there is a yearning for firm leadership , said juwono sudarsono , who has served as a cabinet minister under every president since sukarno for many young indonesians , including my son , who is in his early 20 s , sukarno symbolizes a sense of nationhood that is missing today a rebel leader who was jailed repeatedly by the colonial dutch , sukarno founded modern indonesia in 1945 it was not until 1949 , after four years of fierce fighting led by sukarno , that the netherlands finally relinquished its claim to the archipelago sukarno ruled for 17 tempestuous years until 1966 , when he was ousted by general suharto , another ambitious military officer for all his glory , sukarno would be little more than a historical touchstone today , except that his daughter , megawati sukarnoputri , 54 , is almost certain to succeed mr wahid as president people are studying sukarno for clues as to what kind of leader his daughter would make certainly , nobody has used the symbolism of sukarno more shrewdly mrs megawati , an enigmatic former housewife who does little in her political role and says even less , has risen to become indonesia s preeminent political figure and vice president by portraying herself as her father s heir the people rallied behind megawati s party because she is the daughter of sukarno , said permadi , a legislator who like many indonesians uses only one name but her party has little relation to sukarno organizationally or ideologically they just put his picture on every poster and tshirt mr permadi , a zealous devotee of sukarno , frowns at this coopting of the great leader s image his office is a shrine to the former president , with paintings and photos on every wall on his calling card , he lists his occupation as the extension of the tongue of sukarno it is a title that mr permadi , a man steeped in javanese mysticism , takes quite literally in addition to mystics and nationalists , sukarno has kept the loyalty of a dwindling cadre of former advisers , some of whom fought alongside him against the dutch these aging retainers gather to swap memories about sukarno s fervent patriotism , his busy love life and his defiance of the west aside from her commitment to the unity of indonesia , these people say , mrs megawati has none of those traits in a thousand years , there will only be one sukarno , said jusuf ronodipuro , the founding president s former press secretary there s no comparison between him and megawati , no similarity at all , except that she is his daughter that might be a good thing the last years of sukarno s rule were calamitous for indonesia , as he abridged civil liberties , skirmished with the military and the communist party and pursued an economic policy built on little more than thumbing his nose at the west he left the country in a shambles , because of his incessant struggle to unify the country and because of his battles against the us and britain , said thee kian wee , an economic historian by the time he was effectively pushed aside by suharto in january 1966 after an attempted coup , sukarno was an isolated , bitter man in that respect , at least , he is quite like his embattled successor , mr wahid
a confidential bush administration review has recommended that the united states not accept a draft agreement to enforce the treaty banning germ weapons , according to american officials the recommendations appear certain to distress allies , who back the draft accord and are concerned that the new administration is concentrating too much on new military programs and not enough on treaties and nonproliferation after six years of negotiations , diplomats in geneva have produced the draft agreement , known as a protocol , which would establish measures to monitor the ban on biological weapons a 1972 treaty , which 143 nations have ratified , prohibits the development , production and possession of biological weapons but the treaty has always lacked a means of verifying compliance united states support for the protocol is critical to the effort to give the treaty teeth the clinton administration cast the new protocol as an important tool to stem the spread of biological weapons and international negotiators in geneva have been rushing to complete it by november but the new bush administration has taken a far more skeptical approach in a unanimous review , its interagency team concluded that the current version of the protocol would be inefficient in stopping cheating , and that all its deficiencies could not be remedied by the negotiating deadline the review says that the protocol would not be of much value in catching potential proliferators , a senior american official said the white house has yet to formally endorse the review s conclusions , but since all the relevant agencies agreed to it , the white house is considered virtually certain to go along the real issue is what steps to adopt in light of the recommendations , and how to proceed diplomatically although the review strongly objects to the current version of the protocol , it does not rule out fresh attempts to address monitoring and the review is also emerging as a sensitive diplomatic problem president bush heads to europe next month , and his administration has already been under fire for steering too unilateralist a course on foreign policy , by backing away from the kyoto accords on global warming and , to a lesser extent , the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty so the white house is eager to avoid a new split tibor toth , the hungarian diplomat who has overseen the effort to negotiate the protocol , will fly to washington this week to try to change the bush administration s mind , american officials said different constituencies seem to see different flaws , which indicates it is a pretty good compromise , mr toth said in a telephone interview if it still needs to be fixed , we have the time barriers have been raised to nuclear and chemical proliferation if the world community fails to agree on a protocol to strengthen the ban on biological weapons after six years of talks , it will send a very unfortunate message the first step to ban germ weapons was taken when president richard m nixon and other world leaders signed the treaty in 1972 , at the dawn of arms control but the agreement had no means of enforcing compliance that became an enormous concern after president boris n yeltsin conceded in 1992 that the soviet union had violated the accord by maintaining a longstanding biologicalweapons program after the treaty went into force then evidence was acquired after the persian gulf war confirming that iraq also had germ weapons , heightening fears over biological warfare most of the dozen or so countries that are believed to have biological weapons programs like iran , iraq , libya and north korea are members of the 1972 treaty so a decade ago , during the administration of mr bush s father , the united states and other nations began studying what could be done to monitor the treaty six years ago , they began talks on a new protocol there have been many obstacles china , which has little experience with formal armscontrol treaties , is reluctant to allow onsite inspections pakistan is concerned that inspectors searching for germ weapons might investigate its nuclear weapons sites and in the negotiations iran has been trying to weaken controls on the export of biological equipment and materials , saying they hurt its civilian economies the united states , for its part , has had conflicting motivations on one hand , it has worked to limit the scope of visits by foreign inspectors in order to protect american pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies , which dominate the worldwide industry and are concerned with protecting their trade secrets and at the behest of the pentagon , the government tried to limit inspections of american biodefense installations , which develop vaccines and protective equipment and analyze the germ warfare threat as a result , the united states has not been as tough on verification as most of its allies and yet washington also hoped that the protocol would discourage cheating under the 210page protocol , parties agree to make known their vaccine production facilities , the largest biodefense installations and facilities that do genetic engineering or aerosol studies with germ agents that are most likely to be used in weapons but it would not require a declaration of all types of facilities that could be used to make weapons , including food and beverage plants and some pharmaceutical plants
after receiving final approval late friday , work began today on a power plant 30 miles south of here , beginning a new generation of power plant construction in a state whose demand for electricity is rising fast plants were built in new york at a great pace in the postwar years , but new construction came to a halt in the mid1970 s since then , only two major plants have been built , both upstate , and none in the last decade but increasing demand and deregulation of the power markets are expected to produce a boom in construction no fewer than 21 proposals to build plants or expand existing ones are before the state on friday night , the army corps of engineers , whose approval is needed for projects in wetlands , issued the final permit required for construction of the plant , a 500 million , 1 , 080megawatt power station in athens , near the hudson river the owner is pge national energy group , a sister corporation to pacific gas electric , the giant california utility that recently filed for bankruptcy protection , but those problems are not expected to interfere with the new york project william f quinn , vice president for development of the company , said he hoped to have the gasfired plant running by the summer of 2003 but that will do little to avert shortages in the area of the state where they are most likely new york city and long island because there are limited transmission lines for sending power into the metropolitan region from elsewhere among the projects making their way through the approval process are proposals for plants or plant expansions in queens and brooklyn and suffolk and rockland counties the approval of the athens plant ends a long and sometimes bitter struggle in which each player the power companies , the state regulators and the environmental groups felt its way haltingly through a process that was new to all of them pge filed its first paperwork in an effort to win state approval for the project in september 1997 , but approvals from the state and the army corps took longer than expected the state issued environmental permits last june , and the pataki administration , eager to get new plants built , has since accelerated the process this has been an awful lot longer than we had anticipated it would take , but we 're happy to be here now , and we 're excited about beginning the process of constructing the project , mr quinn said we 're not going to waste any time getting started environmentalists and hudson valley groups lobbied successfully to impose the most stringent standards on the plant , and to mitigate its effect on views along the river from the beginning , pge proposed to use a relatively new natural gas technology called combinedcycle turbines , which produces a tiny fraction of the air pollution that comes from older plants the company also wanted to draw about five million gallons of water a day from the river for cooling although that is far below the hundreds of millions of gallons a day used by older plants , environmentalists protested that it was still too much fish are drawn in along with the water , and at some plants they die by the millions in the end , the pataki administration required pge to use what is known as dry cooling , a more expensive method that has rarely been mandated , and never before in new york as a result , the plant will take in just 185 , 000 gallons of water daily we 're pleased that our intervention and advocacy resulted in the state mandate for dry cooling at this plant , said ned sullivan , executive director of scenic hudson , one of the groups that pushed hard for that requirement

moscow , dec 4 joe mach talks russian oil in an oklahoma accent after 30 years in the oil industry , most recently spent roaming across europe and africa , mr mach \( pronounced mack \) last year joined yukos , russia s secondlargest oil producer , as vice president for production and exploration his motivation , he said , is straightforward , even if his comparison seems a little fractured it s the same reason bonnie and clyde robbed banks , he said , sipping coffee from a plastic yellow cup in his spartan fifthfloor downtown moscow office this is where the oil is indeed , for anyone interested in oil , yukos is now the right place to be its fastgrowing output is driving a steadily rising flow of russian oil at a time when the organization of the petroleum exporting countries , wrestling with a glut , is seeking to curb world oil production and prop up falling prices yukos is not letting opec stand in its way like several other russian oil companies , it has attracted western production experts to help it realize its ambitions to become a major international oil company , planning to increase output by 2005 by about a third , to 16 million barrels a day that would exceed alaskan production , and is equal to about 8 percent of america s current oil needs all this helps explain why moscow has so far been reluctant to reduce exports by more than a token amount after rejecting calls to cut output by several hundred thousand barrels a day , russian government officials and executives from several private oil companies , including yukos , are to meet here on wednesday to discuss whether to go along with opec s demand for a reduction of russian exports by 100 , 000 to 150 , 000 barrels a day but even if the government persuades the companies to support the cutback , setting in motion a larger reduction of as much as 15 million barrels a day from the opec nations , russia s growing capacity to produce oil is bound to create further headaches for opec in the years ahead behind russia s renewed strength in the world energy market is a turnaround at yukos and other companies assembled from chunks of the giant soviet oil industry yukos itself was in a state of collapse when its current owner , mikhail khodorkovsky , took it over in 1995 soviet planners , bent on getting as much oil out of the ground as fast as possible , had shown little regard for the longterm consequences of their techniques new fields were pumped full of water to increase their output more quickly and fields were heavily drilled , often to their detriment the whole system was built around an incorrect philosophy , said jeffrey b karfunkle , an american who directs strategic and capital planning at tyumen oil , russia s no 4 producer they had a limited set of tools they got good at drilling wells the soviet attitude was 'let s go drill more meters ! ' people got orders of lenin for that but when the soviet union collapsed in 1991 , disrupting lines of supply and financing , having so many wells backfired existing fields had been pumped too rapidly indeed , by the late 1980 s , there were few resources for major new exploration or development the oncemighty soviet oil industry shrank by more than a third chaos soon engulfed the industry as the government lost control , managers of oil companies still all owned by the state began doing business on the side carpetbagging oil traders made fortunes persuading companies to sell oil on the cheap , which they turned around and sold for vast profits at the world commodity price the whole system was coming apart , said thomas hendricks , an american from new mexico , formerly at exxon , who now works as tyumen s adviser for drilling no one paid for anything the companies were being gobbled up the confusion continued into the mid1990 s , when the russian government began to privatize the oil companies the politically connected mr khodorkovsky , now 38 , snapped up relatively young fields for a fraction of their value mr khodorkovsky , a former banker who does not look like a corporate oil executive in his trademark leather jacket and jeans , threatened outside shareholders with dilution of their equity during a reorganization in 1998 but more recently , he has surprised many by throwing himself fully into the oil business around that time prices collapsed , and owners like mr khodorkovsky finally began to take an interest in production , not just trading yukos enlisted help from the western oil services giant schlumberger to improve production in effect , all the oil companies at that time , almost all , were hedge funds , not oil companies , eugene shvidler , president of sibneft , another large producer , said now everybody yukos , tyumen , ourselves are much more involved with the companies themselves , with the mechanics of how they work , not just with cash flow enter mr mach a former schlumberger executive , he trained about 1 , 000 yukos employees in production enhancement pumping more oil for less money and installed 500 new computers with software for the task i jumped on that enhancement like a chicken on a june bug , mr mach , 53 , said the result was powerful and immediate an 11 percent rise for yukos in oil output in 2000 from the previous year none of that , mr mach said , was through new drilling the company simply changed the way it repaired wells , fixing the best first it also developed new ways of fracturing a procedure in which liquid is forced into the rock to increase oil flow most industry experts say engineering and well choice are more important than new equipment in increasing output for yukos , much remains ahead the company owns the northern section of the vast siberian priobskoye field , a reservoir with 34 billion barrels of oil , about the size of prudhoe bay in alaska the field , now in its early stages of development , is producing 150 , 000 barrels a day in five years , that is expected to rise to several hundred thousand barrels , mr mach said not all russian companies are as eager as yukos to increase output lukoil , the biggest producer , raised its output last year by only 1 percent the company has focused on buying refineries and other assets outside russia it has the largest reserves in the country , but it also has the highest production costs , according to the united financial group , a moscowbased investment bank despite the allure of big untapped fields , foreign companies have been wary about entering russia the lack of set tax rules for multibilliondollar projects has discouraged many from doing business here instead , russian companies have brought in service companies like schlumberger , which has grown to a staff of about 2 , 000 employees in russia from fewer than 500 before 1998 , and have poached executives from their ranks still , russia has changed a lot from the days when owning an oil company was a license to steal and with several producers determined to expand , americans like mr mach are increasingly in demand in the next 50 years there are three areas that will be players deepwater , the middle east and western siberia , mr mach said , gesturing to yukos s production maps that paper one office wall it s an oily basin ,

london , nov 21 usinor of france breathed new life today into its faltering 276 billion bid to acquire two european rivals and become the world s largest steel maker by sweetening the takeover terms and winning approval for the merger from european union regulators in brussels according to french press reports , the new terms would give shareholders in the two acquired companies , aceralia of spain and arbed of luxembourg , a greater share of the combined company 46 percent instead of 435 percent to reflect their greater profitability compared with usinor a spokesman for aceralia said the two smaller companies had accepted new terms , but none of the three companies would confirm the specifics in the press reports the details of the merger have been under negotiation since february over that time , aceralia and arbed held their own in an increasingly glutted market for the steel used in cars , appliances and other goods , while usinor s business lost some ground the two smaller companies were more profitable , said yasuhiro yamaguchi , a londonbased steel analyst with ubs warburg , and so their cash flow was going to subsidize the french operations so they have been negotiating for a larger portion the merger is the latest in a line of consolidations in the industry , most notably two in 1999 that combined british and dutch steel companies to form corus and that put together thyssen and krupp of germany , all aimed at cutting costs through economies of scale and new efficiencies usinor s plan would create a company two to three times the size of competitors like corus or nippon steel , with annual earnings around 30 billion and the capacity to make 51 million tons of steel annually it foresees some 769 million euros \( 679 million \) in cost savings but with steel prices at their lowest in over a decade and demand slowing even as producers expand their output , steel makers will generally continue to face pressures to consolidate and cut costs mr yamaguchi said that the reason why steel companies are merging is the scissors effect , in which steel makers are caught between the suppliers of raw materials like iron ore and the industrial consumers of steel both of whom have more power in price negotiations than the steel makers at the same time , he said , steel makers are making about 20 percent more steel than the market can absorb the european commission approved usinor s proposed threeway merger today after a fourmonth antitrust inquiry the approval depends on usinor s going ahead with commitments to sell galvanized steel plants in france , spain , luxembourg , belgium , italy and portugal without those sales , the commission said , the merged group would choke competition through its ability to unilaterally determine prices and control the different steel distribution sectors the competition commissioner for the european union , mario monti , said those problems were solved when the companies agreed to make disposals that is why the merger can go ahead the renegotiation of the merger terms does not affect the approval , mr monti said trading in all three companies' shares was suspended at their request today , as all three boards met to approve the deal a formal announcement of approval is expected early thursday

the truth may be stranger than fiction , but turning it into a book did not come easily to john westermann it took more than a decade for the former freeport police officer who scribbled details from murder scenes and crime busts in his patrol car to get exit wounds \( soho press , 1990 \) published another decade passed and four more novels were sold before his loosely threaded , bawdy and sometimes funny tale of badges , women and the boys in blue in a thinly disguised south shore town called belmont the name a cross between elmont and bellmore , but really freeport made it to the silver screen i came home from a murder one night in about my fifth year of police work in freeport , recalled mr westermann , 48 , of strongs neck i was so overwhelmed by the scene , both visually and the setup of the crime , the guys who wound up doing it , how we caught them , i just felt i had to write about it mr westermann collected vignettes , recorded tawdry antics and spunout episodes around orin boyd , a harddrinking cop transferred to the lucky 13th precinct , the banana republic of nassau county , the gulag policia but he had no idea about structure , pace or point of view the book went nowhere once i decided i wanted to be a storyteller , i went back to school and learned how to tell a story and learned how to write , mr westermann said i read all the books in the library on how to do it , wrote draft after draft after lousy draft until they got better his second police procedural , high crimes , quickly sold the publisher wanted whatever else he had exit wounds came out of the drawer the expletivestocked caper of rank corruption in the most violent , racially divided precinct on the island was recently made into an action feature film starring steven seagal and dmx , the grammynominated rapper whose real name is earl simmons , this morethan 35million ode to miscreant behavior by the producer joel silver \( lethal weapon , die hard \) debuts nationwide on friday but in the film , the corrupt suburban precinct mr westermann detailed as the clapboard slum on the south shore of nassau county was relocated off the island mr westermann has always called home it s a long island story set in detroit , filmed in toronto and calgary , he said in the book , boyd , the main character based on several of the fellows mr westermann worked with in freeport , battles alcoholism and a failing marriage in the movie , he s a rageaholic instead of being sent to the fictional camp cope , a dryingout camp for police officers upstate , he goes to therapy and joins a rage management class dmx plays a dotcom billionaire who the police think is a drug dealer the character is a far cry from the excon wino batman in the original story the plot of the book is basically the same as the plot of the movie except they are not anything alike , mr westermann said , recalling the day warner brothers studio sent a screenwriter to check out freeport he pats me on the back and says 'they 're not coming here it s just not menacing enough for the story long island is a little too nice for this , ' mr westermann said after 21 years on the force , mr westermann retired five years ago now he can squeak by writing , he said , though it helped that his more than 300 , 000 movie fee came in , enabling him to buy a sprawling ranch house near setauket twice divorced with a 22yearold daughter , jessica , and 12yearold son , jake , mr westermann has n't yet given up the red chrysler lebaron convertible with 110 , 000 miles perhaps if the option to make a film out of high crimes ever cashes in , he said mr westermann grew up in a welltodo family in huntington station he attended trinity college , played football and lacrosse but neglected to go to class after three years , he ranked 312 out of 314 in his class , and his parents refused to pay any longer mr westermann dropped out and enrolled in the nassau county police academy i wanted to be a cowboy , he said i was friends with a lot of cops it felt like they were having a ball they gave you a gun they gassed up a car it sounded great mr westermann said his writing was influenced by joseph wambaugh and andrew vachss at mr westermann s first book party , held in his brother david s law office in garden city , the author nelson demille , who worked down the hall , wandered in the two struck up a friendship later , mr demille provided mr westermann with the research for honor farm , a sequel to exit wounds , about a mansionturned prison for corrupt police officers set on the north shore on the force , mr westermann did street and car patrols and sometimes was assigned plainclothes duty though he was on the list to be promoted to sergeant three times in a row , he never made it i was a loudmouth democrat in freeport , he said do you think they were going to make me a sergeant \?

men , of course , dominated the interior design field in the late 19th century , a circumstance that made the talented and versatile candace wheeler \( 18271923 \) even more of a standout although of rural background and modest education , she became a textile designer of sophisticated taste , joining in partnership with louis comfort tiffany to create luxurious settings for the privileged \( including the house of her friend mark twain in hartford \) she was a dynamic dogooder as well , promoting the idea of art and design as paying careers for women rather than as hobbies in 1877 she founded the new york society of decorative art to help american women get training in the applied arts , and a year later she established the new york exchange for women s work \( still going \) , where women could sell homemade products like baked goods and linens she broke with tiffany in 1883 to start her own company , staffed entirely by women it produced inventive , distinctively american textiles , from highend handembroidered silks to very affordable printed cotton denims , using innovative techniques at every stage of the manufacturing process married to a supportive \( and welltodo \) husband , mother of four children and an amateur flower painter , wheeler also wrote influential books on decorating but by the time she died in the early 1920 s , her achievements were all but forgotten in 1928 the metropolitan museum of art was given a group of her fabrics then about 50 years old , in the light of 20 s modernism they were regarded as hopelessly out of date and the museum s own decorative arts focus was on the colonial and federal eras nothing exhibited had been made after 1825 the textile gifts were dutifully squirreled away , but not until two generations later were curators able to appreciate again the elegant simplicity of her style now the met has mounted the first major retrospective of her work , candace wheeler the art and enterprise of american design , 18751900 it includes more than 100 objects , luxury goods and plainer stuff textiles , wallpaper , drawings , paintings and photographs of interiors and furniture organized by amelia peck , associate curator in the department of decorative arts , and carol irish , research assistant in the department , it gives an illuminating look at the american style of design achieved by wheeler and her associates , and the benefits her efforts brought to other women one of its most beautiful exhibits , however , was not done by wheeler but served as her inspiration it is a magnificently embroidered screen in three panels , showing a pair of peacocks , adapted from a motif by the english artist walter crane the screen was made at the royal school of needlework , set up in london in 1875 by aristocratic ladies to revive decorative needlework and provide employment for educated gentlewomen down on their luck seeing the screen in 1876 at the centennial international exhibition in philadelphia , wheeler was taken not only by its beauty , but also by the idea of a business run by women for women s benefit it inspired her plan for the new york society of decorative art , which she described in a letter to her niece as a means of providing for the army of helpless women of ny who were ashamed to beg and untrained to work meanwhile , in partnership with tiffany , whom she had met serving on the society s committees , wheeler had a hand in the decoration of some of new york s most lavish interiors while he came up with overall concepts and created furniture and stained glass , she handled textiles for the fifth avenue mansion of the pharmaceutical manufacturer george kemp , wheeler combined appliqu and silk embroidery in a wall panel of coppercolored velvet depicting the bough of an orange tree for the veterans' room of the seventh regiment armory \( still extant , although the textiles have been lost \) she provided hangings and draperies of silverembroidered plush and japanese brocade worked with appliqu s of velvet for the madison square theater she and her staff produced a stage curtain hailed as one of the first fruits of a distinctly american school of needlework it depicted a pool of water surrounded by trees , wild flowers and meadow grasses , accomplished with daring methods of appliqu all of these triumphs are shown in photographs , prints or sketches but there are plenty of live examples of wheeler s work , particularly that done by associated artists , the company she started in 1883 at its peak , it employed as many as 60 women , and its primary designers , besides wheeler herself , included her daughter , dora wheeler , who specialized in needlework tapestries of women from mythology and literature in 1883 dora did 11 tapestries for the fifth avenue mansion of cornelius vanderbilt whitney none have survived her only extant tapestry is the striking penelope unraveling her work at night , a subtle orchestration of ivory , green and brown shown here in fragile condition more spectacular examples of art needlework by the firm include one of the few surviving panels designed by wheeler in an appliqu technique , a rich , lustrous design of intertwining tulips past their prime in sage green and pink silk velvet on a silvery ground it shows the strong naturalism that pervaded her work and her ability to take design into the realm of art a looser example probably wheeler s of the firm s work is a textile panel with motifs of chinesestyle clouds and chrysanthemums scattered across a silk canvas ground the pink clouds are stitched in a technique patented by wheeler that facilitated tapestry and pictorial effects gold and bronzecolored threads were used in a different stitch for the chrysanthemums but of no less interest are the fabrics wheeler made for the mass market , including a wonderful swimmingcarp pattern adapted from japanese motifs printed on both cotton denim and silk in a variety of colors , using an inexpensive dying method called discharge printing , it shows fish swimming in linear eddies of water and spray it is a rare theme for wheeler , who preferred floral motifs a related theme , carried out in a silkcotton fabric and also printed by the discharge method , is a fabric called nets and bubbles , depicting floating white fishnets on a dark ground durable enough for modest country cottages , it was meant for families on a tight budget but its use was widespread a pillow covered with the fabric appears in a 1905 photograph of wheeler s client mark twain , at home playing cards with his wife besides its appealing marriage of design with fine art , the show pays tribute to a real american role model , of woman as entrepreneur candace wheeler the art

providence , ri , march 19 the editor of the student newspaper at brown university says he knew a tempest was headed his way and rose to open the door for it a few weeks ago , the editor , brooks king , read about a campaign by david horowitz , a conservative author in los angeles , to place an advertisement in college newspapers denouncing calls for reparations to black americans for slavery in the fullpage ad , mr horowitz argues that blacks do not deserve redress because white christians ended slavery , and that rather than getting compensation , black americans owe the country for the freedom and prosperity they enjoy mr king says he concluded that the ad intended to offend sensibilities at liberal campuses , exposing what mr horowitz and other conservatives describe as the intolerance of political correctness and he decided that because this was part of an important national debate , he would take up the challenge but i did n't expect this , the lanky , bespectacled junior said last week , student protesters removed stacks of the brown daily herald from its stands on campus in running the ad , mr king became only the latest college editor in recent weeks to find himself entangled in a racially tinged controversy prompted by mr horowitz at the university of california at berkeley , the daily californian ran the ad , but , under pressure from protesters , issued a frontpage apology regretting having become an inadvertent vehicle for bigotry and at the university of wisconsin , julie bosman was confronted by 100 students demanding her resignation after the paper she edits , the badger herald , also ran the ad in a telephone interview , mr horowitz said that university campuses suffered from a prevailing liberal orthodoxy that treats conservative views , and those who expound them , like toxic waste fit for burying or burning , but not for engaging in dialogue colleges should be stimulating discussions of these issues , not encouraging political rallies on behalf of one side of the issues , he said , and called the protesting students campus fascists mr horowitz said he noticed that campuses were holding conferences on reparations throughout black history month , but none were debating the question so much as presuming reparations were a good idea leon botstein , president of bard college in new york , said that mr horowitz was clearly on a campaign of provocation but that colleges were easy prey contrary to their image as arenas of intellectual debate , he said , colleges tolerate dissent poorly we say we believe in dissent but we actually do not practice it well , mr botstein said , especially in matters of race , what he called the central question of life in america at brown , the protesters , many representing minority groups , formed human chains at scattered sites and demanded the paper pay its own form of reparations by donating the 725 it earned from the advertisement to the third world student coalition , and giving them a free page of advertising space to refute mr horowitz the paper refused the demands but expanded space for opinion articles in today s issue the group s ire was directed at first at decision to run the advertisement , transforming the clash here and on most other campuses mr horowitz has approached into a debate not over reparations , but over the limits of expression this is not an issue of free speech , said kohei ishihara , a junior whom the protesters designated their spokesman this is about profits the herald profited from the deliberate distortion of history papers at most of the 47 universities approached , including harvard , columbia and the university of virginia , declined the advertisement from mr horowitz , who also publishes heterodoxy , a bimonthly paper lampooning political correctness at the university of wisconsin s madison campus , the badger herald printed the advertisement , and stacks of the paper were taken from distribution racks and trashed in the aftermath , ms bosman , the badger herald editor , wrote a column for the wall street journal , defending mr horowitz s right to buy the ad rather than rebut mr horowitz s arguments , the protesters simply tried to drown out his message with namecalling directed at the herald , she wrote daniel hernandez , the editor of the daily californian , was chastened by the experience in a letter from the editor , mr hernandez vowed to play a tougher role defining what is tasteful , appropriate , bigoted or detrimental to his paper s readership , a step he acknowledged now raises a whole slew of questions and concerns based on the ethics of journalism and publishing a former editor of ramparts magazine , a leftist publication of the vietnam era , mr horowitz turned away from his leftist roots after sending a friend to work for the black panther party the friend was murdered , and mr horowitz s investigations led him to say that she had been executed for asking too many questions he dissociated himself from the panthers , branding the organization as a political front for drug dealing and other criminal activities mr horowitz said that like mr king , he was surprised by the force of the reaction to his ad did i think some leftists would lift them from the boxes \? yes , i did , he said but he said he was taken aback by the level of outrage focused on the papers that ran the ad , and on him for placing it these black students come in and say , 'this hurts our feelings , ' he said come on , an argument hurts your feelings \? fight back here at brown , some students said they were deeply upset by mr horowitz s seeming effort to minimize the moral crime of slavery for us , it s not about playing a political game , said sharon luk , a senior who donned black to join the human chain of protesters we do n't have the money to play that game for us , no , for me , it s that we cannot sit down while blatant lies are being spread about us or our brothers and sisters who 've watched their history be erased over and over , ms luk said overlooked in much of the uproar over the newspaper s publication of the advertisement is the deeper national debate on reparations over slavery , which could have found fertile ground for discussion on this campus just over the connecticut border , the aetna life insurance company and the hartford courant newspaper have in recent years acknowledged their historic profits from the slave trade aetna insured slaves , while the courant ran advertisements seeking the return of runaway slaves recent scholarship has focused on the importance of slavery to the old new england fortunes the university itself is named for a known slave trader , john brown stanley fish , dean of arts and sciences at the university of illinois at chicago , said the controversy reminded him of one over ads bought in campus papers by holocaust deniers he said student editors were confused if they believed they had an obligation to print any advertisements regardless of content mr botstein of bard said there was another common misperception anybody who tells you once upon a time you could say anything you want

trenton , oct 16 the second debate between the candidates for governor resolved none of new jersey s most vexing issues , like taxes , auto insurance or gun control but one thing seemed perfectly clear when it was over tonight bret d schundler does not think much of his democratic opponent , james e mcgreevey for half an hour , the two men jousted on the radio over their mayoral records , the financing of public education , the tolls on the garden state parkway and whether to build a new sports arena in newark then came the ultimate softball question from a listener calling in i just moved here from illinois , said craig from eatontown what i would really like to hear is what you guys like about each other mr mcgreevey , who precedes every barb with respectfully , responded first that s easy , he said i like bret schundler i think mr schundler is a hard worker i respect the passion of his views i mean , clearly he has strong passion for his views and he brings that to the table and again , i respect , i had the pleasure of working with him on the new jersey conference of mayors and i believe he is a decent person then it was mr schundler s turn and the faint praise quickly turned damning as he seized on what some have called mr mcgreevey s robotic campaign style i think jim is very disciplined , he said i think he memorizes extremely well mr schundler laughed , then added i think he works hard he gets around the state he knows exactly how he wants to say things and he says them just the way he wants to now i actually do n't do all those , mr schundler went on , his thoughts turning inward i get around the state , i think i am extremely disciplined , but i do n't memorize as well , and i do typically think about policy , and try to figure out how to express it to people so they understand the way things really are out there but that does n't always sell as well you know , it s not as prepackaged what can i say \? when mr schundler s time was up , the moderator , eric scott , scolded him , that does n't sound very complimentary to me from there , things got ugly mr mr mcgreevey and mr schundler often shouted over each other , as if in a contest to see who could speak the longest without taking a breath after mr mcgreevey said that a statistic mr schundler had cited was gibberish , mr schundler became dismissive of him double talk , he said what a hypocrite , he said mr mcgreevey was lying , flatout , mr schundler told the audience when mr mcgreevey said he wanted to cut government so that we live within our means and not raise taxes , mr schundler retorted just amazing , jim i mean , this guy has raised every tax he has ever seen mr mcgreevey , meanwhile , repeatedly accused mr schundler of lying without quite saying so stick to the facts , and please be truthful , he said in one exchange it was a striking contrast to the beginning of the debate , on new jersey 1015fm , when the two men actually talked substance and politely took their turns mr mcgreevey repeatedly zeroed in on mr schundler s plan to shift 585 million in state education financing from the public to private schools , to make use of what he says are thousands of empty seats in private and parochial schools , rather than build new classrooms what mr schundler wants to do , respectfully , is to take 600 million out of the system , he said and whether it s the nonpartisan office of legislative services they said it s actually going to cost the state money , because somebody has to replace that 600 million , that it s going to weaken public education , and every major think tank said it for his part , mr schundler railed against mr mcgreevey as a tax hiker when mr mcgreevey said he would not be able to remove the parkway tolls in nine months , as mr schundler has promised to do , mr schuldler said what you 're basically saying there is , you 're not willing to get the tolls down i think it s ridiculous you do n't want to give a single dollar back the reason you do n't support this is because you want to keep on taking in more money you 've talked about a constitutional convention to increase sales and income taxes you increased property taxes in woodbridge you voted for every florio tax increase you voted against the republican tax cuts you 're never willing to give tax relief to people but in the the last few exchanges , mr mcgreevey pummeled mr schundler on abortion rights mr schundler said that he would oppose abortion even in the cases of rape and incest , mr mcgreevey said mr schundler said he would end all funding for health care services for women through planned parenthood he said he would only support prolife judges to the new jersey supreme court and when mr schundler finally rose to his own defense , saying he merely opposed a litmus test for judicial appointees , mr mcgreevey could be heard over him my point simply is this , he said that this is a woman s decision , this is a woman s choice it s not mr schundler s choice , it s not my choice it s not the state of new jersey s choice photo james e mcgreevey , left , and bret d schundler , during a radio debate last night \( associated press \)
washington , sept 15 president bush was sitting in a secondgrade classroom in sarasota , fla , on tuesday morning , his eyes and his smile fixed on 7yearolds showing off their reading skills but his mind was clearly fixed on the news he had heard just moments before a passenger jet had crashed into one of the world trade center towers at 9 05 am , the white house chief of staff , andrew h card jr , stepped into the classroom and whispered into the president s right ear , a second plane hit the other tower , and america s under attack the president blanched but he stayed put , occasionally arching his eyebrows at the children really good readers , whew , he said this must be sixth grade minutes later , 900 miles to the north , a squad of secret service agents burst into the west wing office of vice president dick cheney , grabbing his arms , his shoulders and his belt they literally propelled him out of his office , one witness said the agents all but carried mr cheney down to the white house s deepest sanctum , the presidential emergency operations center , a tubelike structure designed to withstand a nuclear blast another hijacked plane was bearing down on washington , the agents said , and the white house was almost certainly its target in the course of the next four days , george w bush was transformed into a president at the helm of a white house , and a nation , in crisis on monday night , he was laughing over dinner with his brother jeb at a seaside florida resort , posing for pictures with the restaurant staff and dodging questions from reporters about looming battles over the vanishing budget surplus by this morning , with downtown washington locked down by the military , he was conducting a war council at camp david and demanding that countries around the world , starting with the arab world , declare whether they were allies in the war on terrorism as he rode marine one from andrews air force base to the white house on tuesday evening , mr bush watched the smoke billowing from the jagged gash in the pentagon and seemed to recognize how profoundly his young presidency had been transformed the mightiest building in the world is on the floor , he told an aide riding with him that s the 21stcentury war you just witnessed 4mile run , then disbelief president bush awoke around 6 am on tuesday at the colony , a tennis resort in longboat key , fla eager to start his day with exercise , he took his motorcade to a nearby golf course and ran hard for four and a half miles he returned to his hotel for a shower and his daily intelligence briefings , which apparently included reference to heightened threats of terrorism then he took the 20minute ride to the emma e booker elementary school , the second event in two days staged to galvanize support for an education bill languishing in congress he arrived just before 9 right before the event , karl rove , one of his most trusted aides , whispered news of what appeared to be a chilling accident , a plane crash into the upper floors of the north tower of the world trade center mr bush was briefed by phone by condoleezza rice , his national security adviser , calling from the white house he decided to go ahead with the short school event but as beepers lit up with the news , reporters and a few of mr bush s senior staff members slipped across the schoolyard to watch the disaster unfold in a classroom where the television networks had set up their equipment and monitors they had just assembled when the second plane , united airlines flight 175 , slammed into the south tower a minute later , mr card whispered the news in the president s ear it was a surreal moment , mr card recalled late this week it was immediately obvious that it was neither an accident nor a coincidence mr bush has not said why he lingered in the room for another six minutes , but it was a testament to either his calm or his acting ability but at 9 12 , he abruptly retreated , speaking to mr cheney and new york officials hurriedly mr bush wrote a statement on a yellow pad with a black felttip pen at 9 30 , he appeared in a large media room , where charts about the education budget had been whisked away with children , teachers and florida republicans jammed into the room , he faced the cameras , noticeably shaken today we had a national tragedy , he said two airplanes have crashed into the world trade center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country then , lapsing into some informal language , he vowed to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act terrorism against our nation will not stand he said he was returning to washington immediately but as he spoke , panic had spread in the white house mr cheney was swept into the presidential emergency operations center , along with his wife and ms rice and other senior staff members they were told , administration officials say , that american airlines flight 77 was bearing down on the white house bomb squads were already racing through the upper floors of the old executive office building , screaming , get out , get out , this is real !
for weeks officials from leading charities have been meeting privately to create a single unified database of the victims of sept 11 and their families , a longsought goal promoted as an antidote to the red tape and disarray that have bogged down relief efforts they have grappled , sometimes heatedly , with delicate questions of privacy and procedure that will ultimately influence how hundreds of millions of dollars are distributed to thousands of families but so far , their discussions have not included any of the people who will be most affected by the database the victims' families despite requests from families to have a voice in the creation of the database that could speed up payments and perhaps solve inequities , the charities have chosen to exclude victims' representatives from the committee that has overseen the project charity officials said their decision was a matter of practical expediency , and suggested that victims' families may play a role at a later date joshua gotbaum , chief executive of the 340million sept 11 fund , said charities were leery enough about sharing victim information the family jewels in a central database , let alone inviting victims' families into the decisionmaking process it was a controversial judgment , i would admit , mr gotbaum said , but it was a judgment that was made solely to get speed but victims' relatives said that their participation could bolster the credibility of the database project , which will be publicly detailed for the first time at a news conference scheduled for today some family members contended that their input could help the charities avoid further mistakes , or , at the very least , blunt the growing perception among families that charities have too often been out of touch with their needs those of us in this situation look at the world with completely different lenses than anyone else , said bonnie mceneaney , the widow of eamon mceneaney , a cantor fitzgerald executive , and herself a senior executive for a financial services company they should have victim representation , absolutely the idea of the database is to create onestop shopping for families who need help rather than having to apply to the 200 or more charities that have raised more than 15 billion in donations , families would submit requests to a single place the database and charities in turn would use the same database to identify people who need assistance access to the data will be limited to protect confidentiality , but those who control the database will be in a position to identify gaps in aid and ensure that aid is distributed in an evenhanded manner many policies about confidentiality , equity and access have been devised by the committee of charity officials without input from families msgr kevin sullivan , executive director of catholic charities of the archdiocese of new york and the chairman of the committee working on the database , said yesterday that as the database project evolved , victims and their families would indeed have a voice in the process i want to make sure they get the best possible way to be heard , he said at a news conference today , monsignor sullivan is expected to announce the formation of a new nonprofit agency to oversee the database and coordinate the charity efforts called the 9 11 united services group , the agency is expected to have a 21member board of directors and a chief executive , robert j hurst , vice chairman of the goldman sachs group it will also have employees who will operate the database and assist in lining up case managers for victims monsignor sullivan , who is to be the chairman of the board , said that the board might well include one or more victim representatives , although he said he had yet to contact any victims' groups another possibility , he said , was the formation of a victims' advisory committee that could assist the board on policy i can assure you , he said , that the intention will be to include them as this moves along but for some victims and their families , the promise of future participation is of limited comfort the reality of organizations is that major decisions are much harder to reverse after the fact , several family members contended , and not being included from the outset has deepened their mistrust of charities eliot l spitzer , the attorney general of new york , who first suggested a database , has likened the process of working with charities to herding cats he said yesterday that the families' frustrations were valid and that he could not justify the charities' decision to exclude victims' representatives in the discussions about the database to date victims should be a part of those discussions , he said such is the skepticism toward charity officials that hundreds of families have already demanded not to be included in the database at all i 've opted out , said liz mclaughlin , another cantor fitzgerald widow , who has testified before congress on how hard it is to obtain aid you need people there who have firsthand experience , she said but the problem is that the charities , they consider it their money the exclusion of the families from the process contrasts with the access they have been granted by another central player in the relief effort , kenneth r feinberg , the special master of the federal victims' compensation fund , which is expected to grant billions of dollars to families of those killed or injured mr feinberg has met repeatedly with victims' groups to solicit their views on how the fund should operate the charities' database is still far from complete so far , it consists of information on victims collected by the salvation army , the american red cross and safe horizon , three of the largest charities working with victims the trouble is that none of the agencies collected data in the same way the result is a database with about 75 , 000 separate records , even though there are perhaps fewer than 30 , 000 individual victims , including those who lost jobs it could take weeks to eliminate the duplication , and months more to collect similar data from hundreds of other charities mr spitzer , the attorney general , said the data problems could have been minimized if the charities had shared information immediately that s exactly why this should have been done sooner , he said
the minnesota mining and manufacturing company , reacting to the slowing economy with a preemptive strike , said yesterday that it would cut 7 percent of its work force , or about 5 , 000 jobs in this uncertain environment , we are focused on the things that we can control , w james mcnerney jr , 3m s chief executive , told analysts yesterday the cuts are not desperation moves although 3m s united states sales have slowed , its international sales remain strong and its firstquarter earnings , although below its target of doubledigit earnings growth , were exactly what analysts had predicted many analysts say the job cuts are as much a reflection of mr mcnerney s impatience with 3m s somewhat leisurely culture as it is a reaction to slowing sales in a word , mcnerney is bringing speed , said mark r gulley , an analyst with banc of america securities the job cuts are just the most visible change that mr mcnerney has made since he became the first outsider to run 3m in the company s 98 years mr mcnerney , who spent most of his career at the general electric company , was one of the runnersup to succeed the ge chairman , john f welch jr when 3m , which is based in st paul , announced in december that it had hired mr mcnerney , its shares shot up , as its investors bet that mr mcnerney would apply ge s muchvaunted productivity programs to the more leisurely paced 3m he has not disappointed them in february , about 100 of 3m s top executives were trained in six sigma , the highly complex statistical qualitycontrol system that has saved ge billions of dollars so far this year , 3m has embarked on 35 six sigma projects , and 100 more are already scheduled mr mcnerney has also promised investors that he will cut procurement costs by 2 percent this year , in good part by consolidating suppliers and moving more of 3m s procurement onto the web he has already saved 16 million a year by reducing the types of packages the businesses use firstquarter results seemed to reflect some of the belttightening although high energy costs and the strong dollar took a toll of 11 cents a share on 3m s earnings last quarter , the company still earned 116 a share excluding extraordinary charges that was up 3 cents a share from the first quarter of last year , which also had charges net income was 453 million , or 113 a share , compared with 487 million , or 121 a share , in the period of 2000 sales were up 23 percent , to 417 billion shares of 3m rose 380 yesterday , to 11630 investors remember how badly 3m got hit after the overseas economy turned down in late 1997 , and they expect that 3m is reacting more quickly now , said charles l hill , director of research at thomson financial first call the job cuts , about half of which will take place in the united states , will be spread out over the next 12 months , and are expected to eventually save 300 million annually the company will take a 600 million charge over the next few quarters , in large part to account for the job cuts although none of 3m s business units will remain unscathed , headcount reductions will be more significant in those businesses and geographies that face the greatest longterm economic challenges , mr mcnerney said many analysts interpreted that to mean that the cuts will be particularly deep in 3m s industrial and transportation businesses , which sell heavily to automotive and other industries that are hardest hit by the slowing united states economy down the road , analysts expect sweeping job cuts in 3m s international management ranks 3m is among a minority of manufacturers that still use a country management system in addition to business unit chiefs in st paul , 3m also has regional executives responsible for product sales in specific countries but mr gulley of banc of america said that was likely to change i expect they 'll dismantle their whole structure of country managers , and really run all of their businesses globally , he said not all of 3m s businesses need immediate tinkering its health care businesses continue to grow and , even though many telecommunications companies are suffering low sales and sharply reduced earnings , 3m is doing well in that industry as well , in good part because many of its products are essential for upgrading copper wire networks still , the company has been hard hit by rising energy costs , and price increases in many of its other raw materials most analysts assume it is a question of when , not if , 3m s international sales start to founder before , 3m never had the flexibility to deal with slowdowns , said jonathan rosenzweig , who follows 3m for salomon smith barney now mcnerney is aligning the cost structure to a weaker economy , and that is going to position the company well when the recovery comes
officials in new york , florida and nevada reported new incidents or information involving anthrax yesterday , heightening concerns nationwide but demonstrating no links among the cases in new york , investigators announced that they had located the source of the anthrax that sickened one , and perhaps two , nbc employees at rockefeller center a letter mailed to the television network from trenton on sept 18 that finding meant a sharp turn for an investigation that until yesterday had been focused on a separate set of three letters , all postmarked from st petersburg , fla , and sent to nbc , to the new york times and to the st petersburg times tests on those letters have been negative , leading health officials in new york to all but dismiss the possibility that they posed a health threat we 're very confident that at this point we 're ruling it out , new york city s health commissioner , dr neal l cohen , said at an afternoon news conference with mayor rudolph w giuliani and officials from the federal government and nbc in nevada , gov kenny guinn and other state officials said that tests had shown that pictures contained in a letter sent from malaysia to a microsoft office in reno were contaminated with anthrax several people at the office may have come into contact with the letter , but no one has tested positive for exposure , officials said page b2 in florida , five more employees at american media tested positive for anthrax exposure three employees of the boca raton publishing company had previously tested positive , including one who died page b3 the new york times reported yesterday that both letters sent to nbc , from trenton and st petersburg , were turned over to the fbi on sept 26 but barry w mawn , the assistant director in charge of the fbi s new york office , said yesterday that the bureau did not learn of the trenton letter until friday , when investigators went to the network s studios at 30 rockefeller plaza following confirmation that an assistant to the nbc anchor tom brokaw had tested positive for anthrax they picked it up and turned it over to health officials who tested it and confirmed the presence of anthrax now we have identified the missing link , so to speak , the actual cause of the anthrax that created this whole situation , said nbc s chairman , robert wright so we are no longer dealing with an unknown time , date and place and that is very important several people handled the trenton letter when it was first received at nbc , perhaps as early as sept 19 , including mr brokaw s assistant , erin m o'connor , and the woman who opened it , a clerical employee whom network and health officials would not identify that woman , they said , has had a fever , a rash and swollen lymph nodes , symptoms consistent with anthrax exposure , and is being treated with antibiotics officials are awaiting results on a definitive exposure test , which should be available within the next day or two health officials said that like ms o'connor , the woman was thought to have been exposed through her skin , not as a result of inhaling anthrax spores , and was expected to fully recover officials at nbc have not been able to say definitively when the woman first opened the trenton letter in the offices of nbc nightly news on the third floor of 30 rockefeller plaza , only that it was between sept 19 and sept 25 the letter arrived in a white envelope with no return address the president of nbc news , neal shapiro , said that when the clerical employee opened it , a brown granular substance fell out the woman brushed much of the sandlike material into a trash can near her desk , he said , and the letter was eventually placed in another envelope and added to a stash of hate mail that the company collects and occasionally forwards to authorities it is unclear when ms o'connor came into contact with the trenton letter , or if she was initially told of the substance that had fallen from the envelope other than a small group of people who handled that letter , estimated at no more than half a dozen , health officials said yesterday that there appeared to be very little risk to other nbc employees and that they thought there was no remaining danger of infection at the building to ensure that no else has been exposed or infected , more than 400 nbc employees who had visited the nbc nightly news offices around the time the letters were received have been tested , but the results of those tests were not yet available yesterday , nbc employees continued to line up at the network s offices to get the tests , which now are being recommended for anyone who may have been in the area between sept 19 and sept 25 last night , nbc news broadcast its evening news from the today show studio across the street from 30 rockefeller plaza , as employees were still being kept away from the nbc nightly news offices the public health risks associated with that building right now are minimum , and pretty close to negligible , said stephen m ostroff , chief epidemiologist at the federal centers for disease control and prevention so people who work in that building , spend time in that building , should go about their business health officials were awaiting a final round of tests on the letter sent to the new york times , which was received friday morning by judith miller , a reporter who covers bioterrorism after opening that letter , which had been sent from st petersburg , a white powder dusted ms miller s face , hands and sweater but dr cohen said he was very confident that these final tests would also come back negative , meaning that none of the letters sent from st petersburg are contaminated since the first case of anthrax was confirmed in florida earlier this month , dozens of reports of other possible cases have spawned investigations many reports , though , turned out to be false yesterday , passengers who had flown from chicago were temporarily detained aboard their united airlines jet after landing in san jose when a passenger reported that a man had stood up in midflight and released a powdery substance from an envelope fire department personnel boarded the plane , took the man off , stripped him of his clothing , washed him down with detergent and dressed him in a hazardous materials suit that prevents vapors from passing out of it the substance turned out to be confetti that spilled out of a greeting card a suspicious powder at a post office in parker , colo , turned out to be pudding mix as reports of anthrax findings continued to spread , tommy g thompson , the secretary for health and human services , convened a conference call yesterday with federal health leaders and public health directors around the country one person who participated , michael t osterholm , director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota , described it as an informationsharing update call , and said while such calls have occurred in the past , this is the first time he can remember that a cabinet official participated the real number of letters with anthrax could continue we do n't know how long that will happen , he said the bigger risk right now to the system are the hoax letters in terms of just choking the system up work has already started in new jersey to try to determine the source of the anthrax sent to nbc but an fbi official there said that the trenton postmark means that the letter could have come from a wide section of central new jersey , since there is a regional postal center in trenton there are over 100 different collection boxes or post offices it could have come from , said sandra carroll , an fbi spokeswoman photo members of an fbi team wore biohazard gear yesterday at the florida building where anthrax was found \( luis m alvarez associated press \)
newark , dec 21 councilman cory booker failed to advance a campaign reform measure in the newark city council this week that would have sharply limited contributions by those doing business with the city but the defeat of the measure , a favorite of common cause , the government watchdog group , may paradoxically turn out to be a victory for mr booker , 32 , the firstterm councilman who is currently weighing a run for mayor next may fellow council members as well as mayor sharpe james , who is expected to seek reelection to a fifth term have used surrogates , speaking off the record , to criticize mr booker for presenting himself as the reform candidate and branding the rest of them as beholden to local contractors for campaign contributions the larger truth , said one supporter of mr james , is that mr booker , a rhodes scholar and yale law school graduate , already has access to deeppocket contributors like barbra streisand , the walmart heirs and national political action committees , and was thus backing a bill that would hurt everyone s fundraising but his own an anonymous leaflet circulating here this week said , he wants to cap the amount of money local businesses give to local officials while begging all over the world and taking money from investors who want to take over newark the leaflet included a list of some of mr booker s wealthy contributors from as far away as aspen , colo , and as close as new york city for his part , mr booker conceded that he did have greater access than many in newark to wealthy contributors outside the city but he insisted that mr james , with the power of his long incumbency , was just as able to attract farflung donors the truth is that if i run i will have about 2 million and sharpe james will have about 4 million , said mr booker , who said that he was strongly leaning toward running and that he intended to announce his intentions next month the difference is that none of my money will be from people doing business with the city the measure mr booker introduced only to have it tabled was a model piece of legislation circulated around the state by common cause and already passed in at least one municipality hamilton township in mercer county harry pozycki , the state chairman of common cause , which is enlisting residents in communities around the state to press for such legislation , said that it would limit to 300 the maximum annual campaign contribution to any one municipal candidate by anyone with a city contract for services from legal to accounting to consulting such contractors would be limited to an aggregate of 2 , 500 in annual campaign contributions to city officeholders anyone contributing higher amounts would be effectively barred from competing for city contracts unless they first proved that they had asked for and received the return of their contribution from the local official the measure was tabled at the thursday night meeting of the newark city council and could not go into effect in time to apply to the upcoming municipal elections , mr booker said mr pozycki and patrick green , a local resident who was enlisted in the effort to press for the changes , said that they would continue to attend the meetings until they succeeded in getting discussion and debate going on some reforms mr booker said that he was no newcomer to campaign reform efforts and had unsuccessfully pressed for things like spending caps and public financing of campaigns in his last three years on the council he said he found it humorous that many council members and supporters of mr james were politicizing the measure as well as other reforms , since they would hurt him , too , if they were in effect if i challenge the mayor and win , it turns out that i have shot myself in the foot for 2006 , said mr booker the people close to me and some of my contributors think that i am crazy for backing this photo councilman cory booker was the main force behind a failed measure to reform campaign laws in newark \( emile wamsteker for the new york times \)

or does he set out to make changes that would give the astros a better chance to go beyond the first round \? the astros have never won a postseason series not this year , not the three consecutive years before last year , not further back in their history , in 1986 or 1981 or 1980 they have won only 2 of 14 division series games , and their overall postseason record is 822 their act grows tired after awhile , although not many teams have played in the postseason four of the last five years the failures gnaw at hunsicker not that he was anticipating another postseason failure , but hunsicker candidly addressed the problem a few days before the astros began their series with atlanta in a perfect world i think i know what would make us better , he said it s not a deal where i can add one piece and make us better i might add one piece with the intent of making two more moves , but if i ca n't make those moves , i might have made us worse because of the piece i might have replaced he offered an example using moises alou , the team s productive outfielder , who can be a free agent in a few weeks say we do n't resign alou , hunsicker said that would take a major run producer out of the lineup we go out and put a prototype center fielder out there speed , steals bases , good defense well , if i ca n't add another power bat somewhere to replace alou , i think we 've actually hurt ourselves it gets a little tricky looking at what the astros have accomplished , hunsicker added we have found a combination that puts us among the best teams in our league on a rather consistent basis , barring key injuries we know that we found a combination that works and at least makes us a contender the question is to try to get a team that can get to the next level , which is the elite level do you stick your neck out there and take some major pieces out of this lineup and gamble or do you stick with what you have \? do you want to be a b student and be pretty confident you can be a b student year in and year out , or do you want to go for that a and maybe wind up being a c or d student \? it s kind of like that the astros presented a paradox this year they were the league s secondbest hitting and runproducing team , but they all too often plunged into periods where they did not hit or score their lateseason difficulties that carried into the playoffs highlighted that shortcoming the better righthanded pitchers shut us down with regularity , hunsicker said , continuing to speak with unusual candor for a general manager the lefthanded pitchers , the softtossers , give us trouble , too we have so many aggressive bigswing , powerswing type guys that we almost seem to be vulnerable to that type of pitcher because some of these guys hit the ball so hard bagwell , alou , castilla they hit into a lot of double plays he cited a game in which san francisco batters hit some slow infield grounders and scored some runs as a result we do n't get many of those , hunsicker said we do n't seem to score any cheap runs you look back at '98 , '99 we had three 30stolen base guys on the team this year we had none biggio is probably as important as any single guy because he sets the tone , and when he s not hitting it seems like our offense is much different craig biggio did not hit in the braves' sweep of the division series but then neither did most of the other batters in the houston lineup alou and lance berkman also had only two hits in 12 atbats , and the astros collectively batted 200 , scoring six runs in the three games loyalty goes only so far there s something to be said for consistency , but sometimes it can get a guy in trouble tom hicks , the texas rangers owner , fired his general manager , doug melvin , last week after melvin had held the job for seven years among other reasons he gave , hicks said that melvin had been too loyal to certain people , suggesting that by staying with those employees melvin had failed to perform as well as he otherwise might have two years ago , when the milwaukee brewers were looking for a general manager , they were interested in melvin but were unable to gain permission to talk to him because melvin opted not to pursue the job hicks , he explained , had treated him well and he felt he should be loyal to him on the other hand , it apparently pays to be unemployed if a person wants to become a general manager unemployment worked for dan o 'dowd two years ago , and now it has worked for dan evans
most music fans congregating in napster s chat rooms yesterday afternoon were seeking an answer to a simple question as anongirl put it succinctly how long do we have \? \? \? besides setting off a stampede to download free music before it is too late , yesterday s decision by a threejudge panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals in san francisco that napster should be prohibited from enabling the swapping of copyrighted music appeared to hand a significant victory to the recording industry in its crusade against internet piracy but the secondmostasked question among napster users yesterday may indicate that major record labels that sued napster for copyright infringement have a longer way to go to win in the court of public opinion jeffoboy15 s query , does anyone know of any other programs for music transfer \? was echoed , and answered , by many others the answer is that there are several , although none provide the wide range of music or the ease of use of napster much of the debate over napster has centered on whether consumers have a fair use right under copyright law to share music that they already own with whomever they saw fit whether it be one friend or napster s 58 million users the court ruled yesterday that napster users were infringing copyrights in its decision , the court said napster would be required to remove any copyrighted material that it was informed was being being traded through its service and officials at the recording industry association of america , the trade group that sued napster on behalf of the major record companies , talked of new technologies that would make it possible to identify the copyrighted songs stored on the computers of the individuals who make them available for other napster users to download and listen to but the extraordinary napster phenomenon has been fueled only in part by the technology that made it possible it is also based in the antipathy many users express toward the music industry and the sense that the cost of compact discs is far too high hey , napster is stealing songs , one participant in the alternative napster chat room wrote yesterday afternoon you must admit if there was no napster , you would pay for cd s another responded , no , i 'd just burn my friends' cd s the music industry is getting too much cash from kids to burn a cd is to transfer computer files onto a compact disc aware of the sentiments of the napster users , some legal scholars who disagreed with parts of the ninth circuit s decision said the ruling would ultimately work against the recording industry my view is that the riaa loses the battle and loses the war , because they become the bad guys , said lawrence lessig , an expert on internet law at stanford university with every song they tell napster to remove , the political resistance to this extreme view of copyright law will grow stronger napster , with backing from the bertelsmann music group , plans to make a subscription service available in the fall several legal experts said the court decision yesterday would probably encourage a settlement between napster and other major record labels , which might enable napster to offer more music by subscription in the meantime , however , napster users may have to find other alternatives and judging from their online comments , few seemed inclined to return to the record store the leading possible substitutes , like gnutella and freenet , are considerably harder to use but they are also harder to police , because unlike napster they do not maintain a central index of users that share music files the developers of those programs said they did not see how the court ruling could be applied to them this is going to make life difficult for a lot of musicswapping fans out there , said gene kan , a developer of gnutella but maybe the larger concern should be that there s no aboveground alternative for napster users , in the sense that the music industry has not come forward with their own version of napster to allow people to swap files on line , which is something they obviously want to do of the major record labels , only bertelsmann has sought to build a feebased musicsharing service by teaming with napster many napster users have said they are willing to pay a small fee to use the new service , if it works as the current version does to provide access to much of the world s music but few have expressed an abiding loyalty to napster as it goes mainstream and , perhaps unfortunately for the music industry , the ability to share digital music files in the mp3 format has acquired a certain subversive cachet that may be hard to shake if napster does shut down , there are more sites out there , obsidian tempest , 24 , a security guard and disc jockey in ontario wrote in an email message to a reporter and they may get a few , but they ca n't stop all of them wes feltz , 16 , of pittsburgh , wrote in an email message they 'll never stop mp3 s they 'll always exist i can upload mp3 s on my web site right now if i want to mr feltz , for one , is not worried about finding a napster alternative he said he had enough cd s to listen to for now , because over the six months that he has been using napster he has burned almost 70 separate discs
the exchange happened at the end of deion sanders s feature about the tampa bay buccaneers on sunday on cbs s the nfl today sanders , the newest member of the program , was talking to warren sapp , the unplugged defensive tackle you said all your jobs are on the line , sanders said , referring to comments sapp had made about the doordie nature of this season all ours , sapp said , getting into a kind of harmony with sanders everybody , sanders said everybody , sapp said that s from the top , sanders said everybody , sapp said mine included to quarterback brad johnson , sanders said , do you have a deep threat \? johnson said he did , but sanders bluntly replied i played against this team last year i do n't know if a deep threat is there to wide receiver keyshawn johnson , he questioned why , with 31 receptions , he had no touchdowns the defense , i guess , has done a good job of keeping me out , johnson said , to which sanders answered , you 've got to get some paint on your pants that feature was not 60 minutes or the type of straightforward and meaty report that lesley visser does but it displayed sanders s inquisitiveness , rapport with players and evangelical tone it underscored sanders s impact on the program in a temporary , getacquainted role he will become a fulltime new york studio denizen next season and deion being deion , he will get more attention than those who have been employed longer and have been doing good work i'm just trying to get the truth out of these guys , he said yesterday i knew what questions i did n't want to field when i was a player , the ones i prayed they did n't ask me , and those are the questions i want to ask now to get the answers he wants , sanders is counting on being someone current players can relate to they know i'm not going to hurt them , he said charlie bloom , who produces the sanders features , said sanders was amassing more than enough information to be credible i have n't been taken aback by the feeling that he has a lot to learn , bloom said what he picked up immediately is the need to break down the fourth wall he understands when to turn to the camera to use it as a punctuation point he s comfortable with the camera and with his wardrobe for those interested , he wore a 10button brick tattersall suit to interview players , and a brilliant gold , singlebreasted sanders cuff suit , with a shawl collar and a cuff on the bottom of the jacket , to the studio set , said david corbitt , sanders s tailor corbitt has made nearly 600 suits for sanders , including a new one exclusively for sanders s new job people want to see what you 're adorned with , sanders said george allen remembered george allen has largely been forgotten he was one of the great nfl coaches with the los angeles rams and the washington redskins during the 1960 s and 70 s his obsession with winning is the subject of the fascinating george allen winning is living , losing is dying \( tonight on espn at 7 eastern \) a corny , milkdrinking man who used plays suggested by the coachinchief richard m nixon , allen thought of only football even sleeping was an imposition , said his daughter , jennifer , who was left out of the pigskin chatter her father engaged in with her three brothers he did n't know how to talk to me i really yearned to be close to him , to be one of the boys in this hourlong nfl films production , allen s focus on winning is captured in a story told by roman gabriel , the former los angeles rams quarterback one day , as he was eating a roast beef sandwich , allen said that roast beef is a loser all the winners are out there , alive , walking around , eating hay no opinion given if any incident during the rams' 3414 thrashing of the jets on sunday required an analyst s strong opinion , it was the rams' onside kick after they extended their lead to 317 but fox s troy aikman and daryl johnston offered none dick stockton opened the door , saying of the st louis head coach , mike martz must be looking for a bcs ranking aikman said only , i 'll be interested to hear mike martz s thoughts stockton should have pressed to learn how they would have felt had martz done the same thing to their cowboys team
it was hard to tell what , exactly , was going on within the green , flashing static shown on cnn last tuesday the images were said to be an exclusive look at bombs dropping on kabul , captured by a videophone in the newsrooms of cnn s competitors , there were titters the pixelated cnn screen was compared to an etchasketch , a rorschach drawing and an aquarium \( was that a guppy that just swam by \? asked one competing executive another said he possibly saw the face of the lord \) cnn attributed the jokes to envy it was the american network with the closest camera position to the afghan capital true , its executives said , the network had little to show from the front but at least it had something it could call its own for cnn , there is nothing more important right now crass as it may sound , the network needs the victory during the last year , cnn s competitors most notably the fox news channel stole its thunder as it lost market share , mind share and direction its glory days in the persian gulf war had become a distant memory , and members of its staff , cut by 400 people just a few months ago , walked with heads hung low now , the network is going all out to regain its reputation as the world news leader , sharply elbowing rivals where it has to , cutting any deal that may give it some overseas exclusivity , and moving to expand its international operations not only is its pride on the line so is its global superiority there is intense pressure to win the story and be no 1 with it , said a cnn domestic correspondent the feeling is , if we ca n't dominate during a time like this , when can we \? cnn is veering back to its roots , a sharp reversal it was only a little over a month ago that proposals to cut back cnn s international news operation were floating around the network s executive suites , people with access to its internal discussions said the old guard was on the defensive the network was planning to deemphasize news of washington and foreign capitals and add more coverage of culture , hollywood , technology and science to go with the times under new management , it began phasing out its oldline news anchors , replacing them with new ones possessing a lighter touch , like aaron brown and paula zahn but rocked by the attacks on sept 11 , cnn saw an immediate chance for redemption its longtime news executives , cringing at a future filled with heavy coverage of shark attacks and congressional sex scandals , saw an opportunity for redirection or a reredirection and took it , executives there said given the circumstances , the new management heartily approved of a return to form walter isaacson , the former managing editor of time magazine who became chairman of cnn just two months before the attacks , solemnly declared , we lost our focus , and vowed to never resort to ratings gimmicks again and so the new leadership hired to bring the network some hollywoodstyle flash and personality badly needed when news is slow is now clinging to the hardnews holdovers from the last cnn administration , who were probably on their way out the door before the crisis but even as it reports on the overseas conflict , cnn has lost some of its homecourt advantage , and it is fighting to keep it it is facing a media world that has changed drastically since the gulf war , when it was the only 24hour news channel available throughout the world and held practically the entire cable news audience its most fierce rival , the fox news channel , also sees opportunity in the conflict , most notably an invitation to battle cnn on a new front , internationally it has begun to create an international news presence where it had none for example , by hiring a cnn correspondent who was stationed in afghanistan after sept 11 without a contract it has at the same time made itself available to dozens of new cable and satellite systems worldwide , for free though it has a long , long way to go , fox news channel executives clearly hope that it can become for its parent company , the news corporation , what cnn is for aol time warner a global news brand with an international reach \( and ad sales power \) and though cnn has reasserted its dominance over rivals in the domestic ratings , fox news channel has been able to nip at its heels since sept 11 recently even beating it one night in prime time when the flow of new information dies down even when that flow is heavy , it has been nearly impossible for cnn to capture the gripping sorts of images of war that made it a perpetual player in movies about international intrigue , watched by villains and heroes alike despite aggressive attempts , cnn has not yet had a breakthrough comparable to its moment in baghdad in 1991 , when it was for some time the only television news network with clear camera shots of the city during united states bombing raids msnbc , fox news and the three broadcast networks have been able to essentially match it in images from afghanistan and in this war , it is not the wellknown cnn war correspondent , christiane amanpour , now reporting from islamabad , pakistan , who is getting all of the gossipy media attention , but ashleigh banfield of msnbc , also stationed there this is not for her reporting , but for cutting and dyeing her hair to appear less feminine and avoid the hostility of those muslims who do not approve of working women executives at cnn are aware of the new realities but they said they will define winning in different terms we 're not going to pitch a shutout , but we 're still going to come out on top , said one
the justice department filed lawsuits yesterday against three promoters of what the government contends are taxevasion schemes that have cost it millions of dollars in taxes , including more than 400 , 000 of erroneous refunds , and helped others stop paying taxes the lawsuits , filed in federal courts in atlanta tampa , fla and harrisburg , pa , are the first serious attempt by the government to thwart a tax evasion movement that has flourished over the last four years while the internal revenue service has paid little attention hundreds of web sites promote tax evasion , and some of the promoters have grown wealthy charging for seminars that teach taxevasion techniques while the irs has done little until now to stop the promoters , it has pursued several customers of these schemes , some of whom have gone to prison eileen j o'connor , the assistant attorney general in charge of the justice department s tax division , said that the three promoters have preyed on uninformed taxpayers , convinced them to pay exorbitant fees for erroneous advice and sold them a theory that has been rejected as frivolous by every judge who has examined it the three named in the lawsuits are thurston bell of hanover , pa david bosset of spring hill , fla and harold e hearn of atlanta the lawsuit also seeks an injunction prohibiting them from promoting their offerings or preparing tax returns and requiring them to disclose the identities of their clients so that the irs can examine their tax returns mr bell said yesterday that the lawsuit was part of a government effort to suppress my first amendment freespeech rights and to maintain a government scheme to extract taxes illegally mr bell asserts at his web sites \( www nite org and www taxgate com \) that most us citizens have never been actually subject to the income tax but that the uninformed and naked claims of employers , major news organizations and the irs have tricked people into believing that their income is subject to tax mr bell charged as much as 1 , 000 to write a letter , 65 for advice and 3 , 500 to become a senior fellow of his national institute for taxation education , the lawsuit said mr bell declined comment on these figures mr hearn , a tax preparer and financial adviser in atlanta , could not be contacted yesterday mr bosset , owner of bosset partners marketing in clearwater , fla , declined to comment the suit filed in florida said that mr bosset , charging fees of up to 5 , 000 , prepared amended tax returns reporting zero income among his clients were james and amy callihan of myrtle beach , sc , whose 1997 tax return reported 687 , 844 of income and a tax of 255 , 519 , the lawsuit said the callihan s did not respond to a message left with a person at their home yesterday another client , penny shipp of melrose , fla , said mr bosset was so persuasive that despite her experience as a tax preparer for h r block , she came for a while to believe that the tax laws were a hoax but after paying mr bosset and an associate 11 , 300 , and making no progress in her dispute with the irs over her 1994 through 1996 income tax returns , mrs shipp said , i do n't believe it now two years ago , mr bosset received a 21 , 916 refund of taxes he had withheld from paychecks of his employees he used copies of the refund check to market his skills the refund was issued by mistake , the lawsuit said the lawsuit quotes mr bosset as stating in a television interview that he returned the withheld taxes to his employees , but also telling the st petersburg times that he did not return the money to his former workers three former employees of mr bosset , in interviews last april , said the withheld taxes were never returned to them mr bosset has been lauded as a hero by leaders of a m lange of selfstyled patriot groups that joined together last february as the tax honesty movement in recent weeks , this movement has started to call itself operation enduring patriotism and asserted that the war in afghanistan enhanced the importance of their efforts to convince americans that the irs is a criminal organization with no legal authority to collect taxes the movement has grown so bold that some of its leaders have publicly dared the government to prosecute them none have been charged criminally the three promoters who were sued yesterday all market versions of what is known as the 861 position , which contends that the section of the tax code with that number restricts the income tax laws to a small number of americans , primarily those employed by foreignowned businesses every court that has heard this argument has dismissed it , but its adherents remain undeterred , contending as mr bell did yesterday that the issue was not presented properly , that the cases had procedural flaws or that the judges were incompetent or corrupt

east rutherford , nj , june 7 martin brodeur dropped his black duffel bag on the wooden podium in the dressing room , but instead it clunked onto his right foot he had been shrugging off questions about possible injuries to explain , in part , an unimpressive fourgoal night brodeur laughed , joking that he was not sure how dropping the bag would affect him saturday in game 7 of the stanley cup finals in denver as usual , he was lighthearted , but still understood the gravity of the situation the devils put themselves in by losing game 6 , 40 , tonight it s disappointing , when you miss a chance to win , you yourself put yourself in jeopardy of not winning at all , brodeur said we put ourselves in position where we have two cracks at it , so if we miss the opportunity , hopefully we can take advantage of it the next time there is no other time brodeur stopped 14 of 18 shots , and denied that a shot he took to the blocker pad from his teammate colin white in practice this morning had any effect on his play nothing serious , he said no , no i was fine he said he absorbed a hard shot to his right hip by defenseman rob blake in the second period and he was knocked on his shoulder on a 2on1 break later , but brodeur offered few excuses or much in the way of an apology , either they just got a few fortunate bounces , a few that found the net and went in , the devils captain scott stevens said marty will bounce back in the beginning , brodeur had little to do but stay back in goal and admire his teammates' crisp passes and their ferocious assault on patrick roy while roy was turning aside 12 shots , nine from three power plays , brodeur stopped the only three shots the avalanche had taken in the first 18 minutes two seconds later , the avalanche had a 10 lead , the first step to survival , and the momentum whiplashed back to colorado defenseman adam foote had scored just three goals during the regular season but he scored his third goal of the playoffs when he pounced on a turnover from scott gomez , carried just past the blue line and blasted a slap shot i lost it a little bit and it went off my pad , brodeur said simply with that , it seemed the game slipped from the devils at 6 minutes 59 seconds of the first period , gomez had a goal disallowed when it was ruled he kicked the puck into the net after the devils failed on the power plays , they lost their urgency all the power plays we missed early in the game made us break a rhythm about playing a hardnosed game , brodeur said they were n't getting great chances , but from there , they got some bounces and controlled the game at the 2 26 mark in the second period , the avs were on a power play with bobby holik in the penalty box for roughing foote fed martin skoula , who wristed the puck from just inside the blue line , and ville nieminen tipped it in past brodeur it looked like it was going wide , but he tipped it and it went through my legs , brodeur said it s a hard situation , when you get behind the eightball and you try to recover and you make more mistakes and that s what happened brodeur had suffered his worst night since game 1 , the 50 drubbing even in that game , he stopped 25 of 30 shots brodeur at times looked uncomfortable tonight after he let in the second goal , brodeur made an easy save and the crowd cheered in mock admiration you ca n't blame him , ken daneyko said we did n't get any goals to help him out brodeur had little chance on the third goal when chris drury rendered an artistic splicing and dicing of two defenders , colin white and brian rafalski the fourth goal came with less than seven minutes remaining in the game , the final ignominy alex tanguay rifled a slap shot two inches to the left of brodeur s glove brodeur was a splitsecond too late to make a stab , but the game had already been decided during a a series in which only one goalie has played a nearperfect game opposite the other , round 6 went unanimously to roy he earned his record 19th career playoff shutout , and his recordtying fourth of these playoffs brodeur also has posted four shutouts this postseason , but none in the finals brodeur earned his first star of the game of this postseason in game 5 , when he turned aside 22 of 23 shots tonight , however , he blanched in comparison to roy , his mentor every time one team gets momentum , it looks like with the matchup it s always one team going at one time and not both , but i'm sure that will change for game 7 , we 'll both be fighting hard , brodeur said photo ray bourque of the avalanche leaping over a sprawling martin brodeur , who gave up four goals on 18 shots \( vincent laforet the new york times \)
tehran , nov 8 no issue is more central in iran these days than the officially nonexistent relations with the united states how the islamic state should handle ties with washington , which were severed in 1979 after militants attacked the american embassy and took its diplomats hostage , is a topic that divides hardliners from reformers , and seemingly president mohammad khatami , who left for america today , from the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei the ayatollah has firmly rejected the idea of a dialogue with the united states , saying those who even suggest it should be removed from their positions the hardline judiciary went beyond its constitutional role and set up a body that was supposed to ensure that no official would pursue relations with the united states but reformers have ignored this injunction and insisted that it is in iran s national interest to talk to washington mr khatami , elected twice with sizable majorities , lately has been sounding more conciliatory toward washington he conferred with ayatollah khamenei , who is formally in charge of foreign policy , before he left , with the official irna news agency saying only that the supreme leader offered guidance at the onset of america s war against afghanistan whose sunni muslim taliban rulers have long been foes of iran s shiite muslim leaders iran agreed to assist american pilots if they were downed on iranian soil iran s representative to the united nations , mohammad hadi nejadhosseinian , met with several senators in washington in an effort aimed at mending relations further , several moderate legislators in iran came out publicly in favor of improving relations behzad nabavi , a prominent member of parliament who in the past has expressed antiamerican sentiments , said his reformist party , known as the second of khordad front , wants normal relations with all countries except israel normalizing ties with america does not contradict our values of 22 years ago when the embassy was seized the conditions of today require different policies , he said in an interview another reformist member of parliament , jamileh kadivar , noted that iran has to juggle two seemingly contradictory goals on the one hand , it wants to stymie any threat from afghanistan , a state that it almost waged war against in 1998 over the killing of 10 diplomats and a journalist by the taliban , but on the other , it wants to preserve its standing as a leading islamic country by remaining loyal to a muslim nation while it is being attacked our difficulty is that because of iran s geopolitical position we have to adopt policies that would serve our national interests in the region , and as an islamic country we have to stand by the religious values we raised ourselves , ms kadivar said during a seminar sponsored by the foreign ministry in tehran thus , iran has tried to maintain a policy of active neutrality , so that it would not appear that iran is supporting either america or the taliban iran is still on america s terrorist list , she noted , and indeed many iranians are concerned that if the nation does not play its cards right , the war might come to include iran officials here say that none of the 22 most wanted terrorists named by the bush administration reside in iran imad fayez mughniyah , one of the driving forces behind hezbollah , who is wanted by the united states , holds iranian citizenship , but the authorities here say he has left the country for now , however , both iran and the united states are emphasizing their common interests , with their officials meeting quietly in an eightnation group that gathers in geneva iran has for years supplied weapons to washington s new friends , the northern alliance rebels in afghanistan , and long appealed to the outside world to help restore peace and stability to iran s eastern neighbor two decades of instability and civil war in afghanistan have cost iran 15 billion , officials said this week , as it copes with two million refugees and increased drug trafficking on friday , president khatami will speak at the united nations as part of what is being billed as a dialogue among civilizations before his departure , the president said he would suggest to the general assembly that , instead of forming a coalition for war , the world s nations should work together for peace and justice iran and the us will have to resolve their differences one day , said issa saharkhiz , the publisher of aftab monthly they can do that now that the issue of afghanistan has provided the opportunity for dialogue iran improved its relations with saudi arabia , egypt , and even iraq with which it fought an eightyear war so the united states cannot be exempt
in the bible , good and bad fortune frequently occur in sevenyear cycles on long island , apparently , so do the blueback herring and the enormous striped bass that feed on them it had been 6 years 362 days since my last successful attempt to fish bass during the herring run this time , as then , it started with a breathless phone call from the east end guide paul dixon that first call , dec 7 , 1994 , was a prelude to a day at montauk , where we each caught 20 or so bass of more than 32 inches , all on a fly in the intervening years i have returned to montauk , but some years the herring were not there or the weather was too brutal and had driven the bass south by the time the bluebacks arrived , or the winds piled up the seas too high for small pleasure craft result seven lean years this year , the water temperature remained unseasonably high and , with the exception of one thumper of a nor'easter in midoctober , there were no big storms to disrupt the bait and drive the gamefish away around thanksgiving , anglers from the point down to shinnecock canal were trading stories of 25fish days while the surfcasters were able to reach the fish , high winds and heavy seas kept most of the boats and flyrodders off the water until two weeks ago that is when dixon called i hung up and speeddialed my fishing partner , josh feigenbaum , who begged off too many things to move around , he said five minutes later he called back what am i thinking of \? i just blew everything off at 8 o'clock the next morning , we met dixon at shinnecock we moved out of the quiet waters of shinnecock and into the ocean where a falling tide and an east wind created a molarrattling chop we ran for 40 minutes through the cold , gray morning in the distance , the cloud bank ended on a shimmering vista of white sand , green sea , blue sky , wheeling formations of gannets and , most telling , what seemed like every pickup truck in the hamptons and a line of surfcasters in front of them we eased up on the action it was not autumn , when the bass are so concentrated they writhe in a mass and knock the sides of the boat this was more like an artillery fusillade as , here and there , the surface exploded with fleeing herring and , right behind them , openmouthed bass the size of german shepherds we cast wham ! paul hooked up wham ! i felt a jolt wham ! josh completed the tripleheader within five minutes we had each landed and released fish of more than 25 pounds none of us had caught fish that big in the preceding six months but it did not end there in the next hour we caught another two dozen fish , which included the biggest bass i have ever taken by paul s estimate it was 45 inches , 35 pounds i returned to new york with a sore back from the pounding sea , sore arms from fighting big fish and blistered hands from line burn as the fish ran i took my striper , the only one i kept this year , over to danube restaurant , where my friend , the chef mario lohninger , prepared it , wrapped and crisped in prosciutto on a bed of cabbage braised in white wine assisted by a sublime montrachet , it proved to be the balm to ease my aches and further lift my exhilarated soul of course , by next morning , i needed another fix but i was deskbound for the next few days so i lived vicariously through phone calls frank crescitelli and dino torino , two guides on busman s holiday were into herring and bass off coney island brendan mccarthy was catching them off breezy jim levison and james kang hit them at montauk and shagwong from the point to the battery , a 100mile convoy of stripers and herring was eating its way south when mccarthy called last tuesday , i jumped at the chance to join him there were few boats left in the water at gateway marina most people had hung it up for the year we sped past sheepshead bay , cut through the rip at breezy point and turned east nothing doing and not much visibility the swells built from the east in brendan s light flats skiff i felt every wave east of riis park gannets flashed white as they described wide circles and then dived , hitting the water like cannonballs the bass came up i discovered that you could fish these big stripers like albacore look for the swirl , get your fly right on it and let it sit there leave it a few seconds , then twitch , and mr bass will usually oblige these bass were only a shade smaller than the hamptons fish but big nonetheless for two hours we caught fish in the blessedly warm december sun the wry but ardent mccarthy broke into a smile that appeared to start at his toes and end at his baseball hat i could not imagine better fly fishing for this greatest gamefish of our northern ocean photo the long island guide paul dixon with a striped bass off shinnecock for a change , good weather coincided with the herring run this year \( joshua feigenbaum \)
new and collected poems 19312001 by czeslaw milosz 776 pp new york the ecco press harpercollins publishers 45 toward the end of this hardysized collection , and after more than 70 years of writing , czeslaw milosz wants to make a clean breast of things at the beginning of the last book included in the collection , a book that is in his own words a closing of accounts , he places his title poem , this it is in the form of a direct address to the reader , though it is the poet pretending to break through all his strategies of art \( itself a strategy \) in order to confront a truth if i could at last tell you what is in me , if i could shout people ! i have lied by pretending it was not there , it was there , day and night this poet whose late work has been such a celebration of the beauty of this world now recants and i confess my ecstatic praise of being might just have been exercises in the high style underneath was this , which i do not attempt to name and now he attempts to describe the unnamable this which is like the thoughts of a homeless man walking in an alien city in freezing weather and like the moment when a trackeddown jew glimpses the heavy helmets of the german police approaching this which signifies knocking against a stone wall and knowing that the wall will not yield to any imploration milosz has stated repeatedly in his poems his belief in the power of language to rescue from the void all he has seen and all the people he has known in a long life but beneath this belief , it now appears , was the deeper belief that none of this was possible because of the inadequacy of language to capture reality , though he maintains this always has to be the poet s goal as he says a few pages later in prayer , another poem of direct address , but this time to god now you are closing down my five senses , slowly , and i am an old man lying in darkness delivered to that thing which has oppressed me so that i always ran forward , composing poems so terror and fear of failure were his engine one has to put these lines against a poem written at the start of his old age , in his early 70 s , when the erotic imagination could still open a world for him , to see how far milosz has traveled in this phase of his life the garden of earthly delights begins in the july sun they were leading me to the prado , straight to the room where the garden of earthly delights had been prepared for me so that i run to its waters and immerse myself in them and recognize myself the twentieth century is drawing to its close i will be immured in it like a fly in amber i was old but my nostrils craved new scents and through my five senses i received a share in the earth of those who led me , our sisters and lovers how lightly they walk ! their hips in trousers , not in trailing dresses , their feet in sandals , not on cothurni , their hair not clasped by a tortoiseshell buckle yet constantly the same , renewed by the moon , luna , in a chorus that keeps praising lady venus their hands touched my hands and they marched , gracious , as if in the early morning at the outset of the world this concentration on the self and a personal story is a far cry from the public image of the poet who was awarded the nobel prize in 1980 he was then singled out as the leading poet of the group in poland that entered literature under the schooling of two tyrannies the nazi and the soviet \( a group that famously included zbigniew herbert and wislawa szymborska \) they produced poetry so steeped in the terror of the 20th century as to make much of the poetry then being written in the west seem trivial \( recently the new yorker concluded its special issue on the destruction of the world trade center with a poem by adam zagajewski try to praise the mutilated world as if america were entering the nightmare of history for the first time and only a polish poet could show us the way \) milosz began his career in 1931 , writing pantheistic verses in a kind of international surrealist style then in vogue , a fusion of polish poetry with french but he was only 25 when he wrote encounter , the first poem in which we recognize his voice we were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn a red wing rose in the darkness and suddenly a hare ran across the road one of us pointed to it with his hand that was long ago today neither of them is alive not the hare , nor the man who made the gesture o my love , where are they , where are they going the flash of a hand , streak of movement , rustle of pebbles i ask not out of sorrow , but in wonder in 1939 this world changed for milosz , along with his earlier notions of poetry as he observes in his charles eliot norton lectures of 198182 \( the witness of poetry \) , what occurred in poland was an encounter of a european poet with the hell of the 20th century , not hell s first circle , but a much deeper one in that environment , he goes on , people s attitude toward the language also changes it recovers its simplest function and is again an instrument serving a purpose no one doubts that the language must name reality , which exists objectively , massive , tangible , and terrifying in its concreteness
palm springs , calif , dec 5 they are getting ready to wire up the palm trees in this desert resort , putting electronic eyes 247 on the main business street on the other side of the country , virginia beach has decided to install outdoor cameras on its main boardwalk the cameras will scan the faces of people at random , crosschecking them with faces of criminals stored in a computer database before sept 11 , the idea that americans would submit to roundtheclock electronic surveillance on streets and public walkways seemed remote only six months ago , after tampa , fla , became the first city in the country to install face recognition cameras for routine surveillance , it set off loud protests people wearing groucho marx glasses to defy the cameras joined conservative social critics in decrying a new era of optical omniscience but now some people who once thought surveillance cameras were inconsistent with the values of an open society have tentatively embraced them i was really struggling with this , said mayor meyera oberndorf of virginia beach but people are feeling so unsettled since 9 11 that they wanted this they kept saying , 'how can you deny us a tool that will keep us safe \? ' here in palm springs , the desert oasis that draws tourists and snowbirds , about half the people who contacted the city during its surveillance camera debate opposed their installation now the opposition has all but disappeared , said david h ready , the city manager i think we now think of it less like big brother and more like a little friend , mr ready said since the terrorist attacks , i have n't heard a peep of opposition but some elected officials and people in law enforcement caution that surveillance cameras have not proved effective in catching fugitives or terrorists and that they raise a host of unresolved legal questions i do n't think people realize how much this is going to change our lives , said reba mcclanan , the only virginia beach city council member who voted against installing cameras while everyone wants to do something after the sept 11 attacks , my concern is that in the rush to do something , we have created something we may ultimately regret in tampa , a system that scans up to 100 faces a minute looking for fugitives or other wanted individuals has not enabled the police to make a single arrest the idea of putting these systems up on main street , usa , is not only bad policy , it s bad law enforcement , said kevin watson , a spokesman for the law enforcement alliance of america , which represents about 65 , 000 active and retired police officers , and crime victims here you have a tool that takes police officers out of the community and makes them look like a pawn of big brother there are two general types of surveillance systems one is face recognition technology used in tampa and soon to be installed in virginia beach which scans faces for 80 different unique aspects and then matches them to a database of stored images shortly after the attacks , howard safir , the former police commissioner of new york , recommended the installation of 100 such cameras in times square the other method is more common , a closedcircuit television system that can continuously monitor certain areas , storing video images for a given period of time , depending on prevailing legal standards more than two million of these cameras are installed in the united states , according to the security industry association , though most of them are in enclosed spaces such as malls , airports and parking garages most recently , boulder city , nev , a suburb of las vegas has made plans to install surveillance cameras looking at parks and intersections the leading company in promoting face recognition cameras , the visionics corporation of jersey city , will provide the technology for virginia beach it also supplies recognition software to tampa and to cities in england , where surveillance cameras are widely used the company promotes its system as one that protects privacy of law abiding citizens if a person is not in the database of wanted individuals , the facial image is not stored this is not a national id card , said dr joseph atick , the founder and chairman of visionics this is a tool what is does is add a set of eyes , which you can use to enhance human intelligence gathering since sept 11 , the company s stock price has tripled we have a lot of orders , mr atick said questions about whose faces will be stored in the database , and who will have access to those images , have not been settled by courts or governments in virginia beach , public sentiment turned in favor of the system after reports circulated that at least two of the 19 hijackers from the world trade center and pentagon attacks had spent time in the area but it is unclear how much good such a system would do even though some of the hijackers were on a federal bureau of investigation watch list , none of their images were part of the database of 30 , 000 or so images stored in tampa s system virginia beach would not automatically get the watch list , either the data can be obtained only with the permission of the fbi virginia beach is just a case of nonsense , said mr watson of the law enforcement alliance here they are acting out of fear , taking a system that has n't caught a single person and would not have picked up those terrorists in tampa , detective bill todd , who oversees the face recognition cameras , said the city was discussing whether to enter people from the fbi watch list into its database most of the people currently in the system are fugitives or are wanted for misdemeanor warrants , he said the system backfired earlier this year when the police were demonstrating it to reporters one image of a man was photographed and reprinted in a magazine a woman in texas who saw the image claimed the man in the picture was wanted for crimes she called the tampa police , who questioned the man , a construction worker it was the wrong person , the police said the system is pretty accurate , but it s not 100 percent accurate , detective todd said as in virginia beach , palm springs is a relatively low crime area but starting early next year , cameras will line palm canyon drive , a promenade with a minor walk of fame \( monty hall and trini lopez are among those whose names are embedded in the sidewalk \) i do n't really consider downtown palm springs or any streetscape to be a private area , said chris mills , a new city council member who just defeated an incumbent who opposed the cameras i view this as a mall , and any mall in america these days has a lot of cameras on palm canyon drive , most merchants supported the cameras as well the way i look at it is , if you 're a criminal , you got something to worry about , but if you 're you or me , what difference does it make \? said stuart peterson , who runs a jewelry shop on palm canyon it s not like it s going to be used to pick up somebody walking down the street with another guy s wife but ron oden , one of two council members on the fivemember body to oppose cameras , said having a roaming eye on the street opened the city to random spying i just do n't think it s in the government s best interest to be watching everyday people , mr oden said photos officer d j kent monitored the virginia beach boardwalk with a video observation unit , which soon will be have the capacity for face recognition \( gary c knapp for the new york times \) ron oden , a councilman in palm springs , calif , said , i just do

toronto , sept 10 an elephant was standing at the corner of bloor street and avenue road a few days ago , near the epicenter of the toronto international film festival , while an announcer beside a banner tried to whip up interest in the animal planet cable television channel among the crowds of festivalgoers and journalists just across the street , in the festival s headquarters at the park hyatt hotel , the throngs were beginning to gather , some with the festival s ubiquitous credentials strung around their necks , others gaping , without credentials , hoping for a glimpse of a star just across the street , at the four seasons , the celebrity hotel of choice , the crowd was even thicker it has been an unusually warm and humid festival week here , and the sidewalks and corridors of the crowded hotels have been thick with people in longsleeved shirts who looked as if they wished they had packed more carefully maybe it was the warm weather , maybe it was a mix of films that seemed less dependent on hollywood studio power than in previous festivals , but the circus atmosphere that is always at least a part of any major film festival seemed to be coming to the fore on saturday night , a whoop of delight arose as glenn close emerged from a car and made her way into the lobby of the four seasons at the same moment , around the corner , about 50 people were gathered around one of the windows of the hotel bar staring in , as if at holiday decorations in a department store , at jason biggs having a drink with friends also at the same moment , and just across the street , the movie critic roger ebert was seated in a corner of the park hyatt s restaurant in the glare of television lights , interviewing christina ricci the story that was being passed around most among festival participants involved the first public screening on friday night of a movie called thirteen conversations about the one thing at the ornate , 1 , 400seat elgin theater , one of the festival s prime locales in the middle of the film a woman in the audience had a seizure and collapsed seated just across the aisle from her was a startled matthew mcconaughey , one of the film s stars people began running up and down the aisles is there a doctor in the house \? someone shouted stop the film ! shouted another mr mcconaughey began to perform mouthtomouth resuscitation on the stricken woman the house lights were turned up slightly , but the film continued to play eventually mr mcconaughey and another man helped lead the woman out festival officials later said she was taken to a hospital , treated and released i have to tell you , it was very surreal , said tom ortenberg , president of lions gate entertainment , who was in the audience with many other top distribution executives looking at the film , which had no north american distributor going into the festival , as a possible purchase the toronto gathering , now in its 26th year , has become one of the premier north american festivals and probably the most important in mixing film acquisition activity with the celebrityrich unveiling of fall films the big movie here last year , ang lee s crouching tiger , hidden dragon , went on to become not only a huge box office success for sony pictures classics but also a major oscar winner and the year before , it was dreamworks' american beauty , which swept the oscars this year , possibly because most of the most apparent oscar candidates are coming out too late in the year to be ready in time for toronto , there seems to be less awards frenzy but it is being made up for in what many say is a large number of potentially promising films without distributors that have teams of acquisitions executives in a very energetic mood i think the mood is very good , said michael barker , copresident of sony pictures classics one of the reasons is that there are a lot of new companies that are here for the first time but another thing is that there are a lot of exhibitors here from north america the movie theater chains are coming out of their recent bankruptcy phase they 're looking to the future again , and that s a good thing hopes have been raised before , of acquisition frenzies and unseen gems , only to be dashed and that could happen here again but early in the festival , which runs through saturday , the mood was much more upbeat and energetic than it has been during recent festivals here and elsewhere on paper there are always so many films that show such promise , and inevitably so many of them disappoint , said mark urman , longtime copresident of lions gate , who left this company this year to help head up a new , independent company called thinkfilm this year i have on my list 45 potentially interesting films that we may want to acquire that s a good list if i end up with two or three of them , i 'll be happy more than 2 , 500 films were submitted to the festival this year , of which 326 made the final cut 249 features and 77 shorts more than threequarters of which have come into the festival without a distributor

brussels , dec 6 the creation of a european unionwide arrest warrant was set back today at a meeting of justice officials when italy balked at a list of 32 crimes agreed to by the other 14 member nations , including terrorism , hijacking , child abuse , fraud and corruption in the aftermath of the attacks of sept 11 , justice ministers were ordered by their heads of state to have the warrant in place by dec 31 explaining his country s objection , italy s justice minister , roberto castelli , said , ministers defended to the very end a list containing crimes which have nothing to do with terrorism , such as car stealing mr castelli denied suggestions that italy s stance was aimed at protecting prime minister silvio berlusconi s business interests mr berlusconi has been tried for fraud and tax evasion but has never been convicted he contends that he has been victimized by politically motivated magistrates in italy for the european union warrant , italy prefers a list of six crimes that carry life sentences , said angela eagle , a junior justice minister from britain these do not include fraud or corruption italy s refusal to budge was not explained well , ms eagle said , adding that there was widespread frustration about italy s intransigence this is very unpleasant for us , said a german junior minister , hansjoerg geiger we have international obligations the justice ministers did succeed in agreeing on a definition of terrorism , and agreed to standardize penalties across the european union at least 15 years in prison as a maximum sentence for being a leader of a terrorist group , and a minimum of eight years for anyone threatening to conduct terrorist acts or assisting terrorists the definition applies to groups or individuals committing or threatening to commit certain acts , including murder , kidnapping and hijacking , with the clear intent of intimidating a population or destabilizing a country s political or economic structures meanwhile , the union signed an agreement with the united states on exchanging information about terrorism and serious crime this agreement includes only socalled technical information and not personal details secretary of state colin l powell , who attended the signing ceremony to underscore the agreement s importance , welcomed it , but urged greater cooperation europol , the fledgling european police agency , already cooperates with the federal bureau of investigation on the grounds that the attacks in new york and washington on sept 11 are seen as a lifethreatening situation the justice ministers also approved the creation of a body of magistrates from around europe , to be called eurojust the intent is to coordinate national efforts and emulate the countries with the best methods for tackling international crime secretary powell said united states authorities were already working with eurojust , which has been meeting unofficially since june we coordinate and cooperate on around 180 cases , said michelle coninsx , a belgian public prosecutor who has chaired the unofficial meetings ms coninsx expressed disappointment at the justice ministers' failure to reach an agreement on the arrest warrant all along in operations work and in our meetings we 've been confronted by the lack of extradition proceedings for nationals in other eu countries , she said the crossborder warrant would add speed , clarity and certainty to the process of capturing such criminals or terrorists , she said belgian s justice minister , marc verwilghen , who presided over today s meeting , said he hoped italy might come around to the view accepted by the 14 other members of the union i asked mr castelli to sleep on it , mr verwilghen said but none of the ministers held out much hope of winning italy over before next week s meeting of heads of state in laeken , near brussels it looks like we 'll have to wait for laeken , ms coninsx said

sag harbor the auto insurance industry and traffic engineers are singing the praises of the roundabout , a smallscale variation of the old trafficcircle concept that is growing in popularity across the country the new york state department of transportation , which in may completed long island s first roundabout in the east end village of north haven , is thinking of replacing several troublesome intersections on long island with the smallscale , onelane rotaries , which are designed to slow traffic and reduce accidents but provide better traffic flow and intersection capacity than a traffic light there would have been two long island roundabouts in operation by this summer if the dot had had its way the other was to have replaced the notorious fiveway intersection at the foot of main street and long wharf in sag harbor , just down state route 114 and across a bridge from north haven traffic sometimes is tied up there as pedestrians , cyclists and drivers checkmate one another the two roundabouts were part of an overall traffic calming project for route 114 developed by the dot and a bivillage community task force after the bridge was rebuilt last year the task force , formed in 1997 , unanimously backed the roundabout concept , but at the 11th hour last summer the sag harbor village board balked , refusing to sign an agreement that would have allowed the work there to proceed traffic engineers say the roundabout , an import from europe , is different from the old and disfavored traffic circle , the most notorious local example of which is on route 58 in riverhead it is smaller , usually with only one lane of travel incoming drivers must yield to traffic in the circle and approach lanes are angled so there are no 90degree points of intersection the insurance institute for highway safety says accidents have been sharply reduced at intersections that have been replaced by roundabouts there are about 300 in the united states , all built within the last few years the north haven roundabout has won widespread praise since it opened in may i think it s a resounding success , judging from all the comments i 've heard , mayor robert reiser of north haven said last week it really works frequent fender benders , especially in summer , used to be the rule at the intersection , which was formerly a fourway stop with a blinking light this summer there has n't been one , the mayor said by eliminating the need for left turns across lanes of oncoming traffic traffic in the circle always exits to the right the roundabout appears to be taming a former trouble spot but in sag harbor , nobody seems convinced meetings on the issue have been punctuated by heated condemnations of the proposal the roundabout was the dumbest plan i had ever seen in 40 years of working with state agencies , a village trustee , jonathan morse , said last week it would have been too small for trucks , he said , and it would have required a plethora of explanatory signs it would n't have worked right , he added , because the flow of traffic into the intersection is not balanced , with the heaviest favoring route 114 , and because of heavy pedestrian traffic the main problem , he said , is aesthetically it interjects into a little old east end village a traffic feature that belongs in a suburban area his own plan for the intersection includes four traffic lights there are none there now mr morse said the roundabout was developed and approved by a task force that did not truly represent the village its members are the usual suspects and dogooders , he said and that did not communicate with the village board the task force s five sag harbor members were appointed by the village board , however roundabout was already a dirty word in sag harbor the village board tried its own roundabout experiment in 1998 at the southern entryway to the village , using traffic cones and pavement markings only , not the raised central island the state uses residents found the markings confusing , and the intersection is once again governed by a stoplight for the last year , it appeared that the latest sag harbor roundabout proposal was also a dead issue but this summer , following a change in the village administration , the option appears to be back on the table , not because any sag harbor official admits to favoring it but because the village wants to salvage the rest of the 3 million in trafficcalming improvements on route 114 that the roundabout was only one part of the state is willing to perform the work , which includes bike lanes , leftturn lanes , raised medians and dividers , only if sag harbor agrees to the roundabout or comes up with an alternative that would work as well , according to eileen peters , spokeswoman for the dot s regional office in hauppauge that intersection is the linchpin of the whole project , said ms peters , adding that something has to be done about its problems and that traffic engineers were very disappointed when the village refused to sign an agreement last year we do n't think any alternative can beat the roundabout , she said , but we 'll listen to any proposals we told the village get a professional to do a plan , not something sketched on the back of a cocktail napkin state officials say the roundabout will be able to handle large trucks and buses and that it will accommodate sag harbor s pedestrian traffic safely in north haven , mayor reiser said he 'd seen an 18wheeler negotiate his village s roundabout , which is similar in size to the one proposed for sag harbor he agreed with mr morse , however , that sag harbor s heavy foot traffic people strolling between bustling main street , the shops and restaurants on long wharf and a small beach at its base might make a roundabout there problematic mayor lauren fortmiller , asked about the sag harbor roundabout , seemed to regard it as a hot potato , saying there was no such thing , only a plan to improve traffic conditions on route 114 she referred questions to deputy mayor cecil broderick , whom she appointed to oversee transportation issues dr broderick , a retired physician , said traffic conditions in downtown sag harbor were unbearable he was favorably impressed , he added , by the various studies and reports collected by the task force endorsing the roundabout , but the decision is not up to me if the numbers can be put before the current village trustees , i'm sure they 'll make the right decision the village board , which is hiring a professional traffic consultant as it reconsiders the problem of its downtown intersection , will hold a public meeting in village hall on thursday at which it will take statements on the issue from the public assemblyman fred w thiele jr , who was village attorney under the previous administration but quit in a dispute that partly involved the roundabout , was a strong proponent of the proposal now he says he will support any alternative that would reduce congestion and improve safety at the intersection but to this day , it s very hard for me to understand why the village balked at the roundabout plan , he said in maryland and vermont , there was a tremendous hue and cry when roundabouts were first discussed , just because they are different and nobody wants to be the guinea pig then they get built and everybody loves them hank decillia of north haven , a task force proponent of the roundabout , doubts sag harbor will make the leap of faith if i were a betting man , he said , i 'd say we 'll end up with traffic lights photos north haven has the island s first roundabout , top , while one is being considered for sag harbor , at the foot of main street and long wharf , left , where traffic congestion is the norm \(

when the bidding concluded at the william doyle galleries in manhattan yesterday , it was n't oil paintings or duck prints that had been snatched up by the bidders the prizes were items as mundane and minute as an open package of emery boards and a smeared makeup towel that once belonged to the actress colleen dewhurst and a copy of the script of dr strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb that had belonged to george c scott , whom dewhurst married and divorced twice dewhurst died in 1991 at 67 much of the memorabilia she left behind scripts , photographs , awards , letters was auctioned yesterday at doyle in a sale that brought a total of 23 , 764 among the items selling for the highest prices were three of dewhurst s yearbooks \( one from whitefish bay high school in wisconsin , 1940 two from milwaukee downer college , 1943 and 1944 \) the lot went for 600 , having been estimated at 100 to 200 in addition , a group of 11 books with inscriptions to dewhurst from authors like elizabeth ashley and john houseman along with eight volumes from dewhurst s library and four plays she signed went for 800 , well above the estimate of 300 to 500 but in general the sale seemed to generate little heat it was sparsely attended , with about a dozen people in the room , only four serious bidders there and none on the telephone eight of the 67 lots did not sell at all many sold for well below their estimated prices even the script for strangelove , which featured scott as gen buck turgidson , expected to go for 4 , 000 to 6 , 000 , went for much less 2 , 000 and a script for the hustler , in which scott , who died in 1999 , gave an oscarnominated performance as a successful gambler who coaches paul newman , went for 1 , 000 , having been estimated at 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 by contrast , earlier in the day , in a sale that also included books and autographs , a signed note to the photographer alfred eisenstaedt from marilyn monroe , sent in june 1953 , went for 3 , 000 , the high estimated sale price a similar sale of james cagney memorabilia last year brought 480 , 671 , though it included several major properties like a bentley automobile jerry patterson , the director of doyle s book department , who organized the sale , said he believed that the items from dewhurst and scott brought lower prices because they were largely actors of the stage , not the screen the collectors really are more hollywoodoriented than they are the legitimate theater , mr patterson said scott and dewhurst were very highly esteemed in the profession , and he did make some movies but they were not the romantic ones nevertheless , mr patterson said he was pleased with the sale we sold just about everything , he said all the significant things most of the lots that sold went to the same people one of them was leonardo demartino , 64 , a manhattan florist and former actor , who said he used to play in the broadway softball league with the two actors and liked them both they were very lovely people , he said mr demartino said he was excited to get for 750 the lot that included memorabilia from dewhurst s performance as josie in eugene o'neill s moon for the misbegotten it was estimated at 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 the lot included a 265page script stamped with dewhurst s name for the 1975 television version , eight rehearsal photographs from the 1973 broadway production , a playbill signed by dewhurst and a certificate she received notifying her that she had been nominated for an emmy award harvey tucker and james cummings , two manhattan dealers who bought many of the items at the sale , said they were surprised by the low prices it was very curious , mr tucker said most items went for way below what i expected the dealers said they planned to sell the scripts they bought mostly to universities at a profit the auction included telegrams from the likes of jos quintero and edgar guest , costume sketches and a passport among the items that did not sell were dewhurst s two certificates of appointment as president of the actors' equity association , the actors' union , her identification card as president and 11 scripts for television shows that featured her , including the love boat in 1984 photo a photograph of colleen dewhurst in the play martha was among items auctioned yesterday \( fred r conrad the new york times \)
the hawk watchers were sitting on folding chairs in the bright sun from their perch on the top of hook mountain in upper nyack , ny , they had a 360degree view , up and down the hudson river and to ridges east and west it was a slow morning by 9 30 carol weiss had recorded a kestrel , two harriers and two sharpshinned hawks it was n't always this slow , she pointed out in fact , this should have been a good day , since it was warm and just after a storm not that it was going to approach the big day that was sept 15 , at the height of the southward migration of broadwinged hawks , when a vast flock of the birds , called a kettle , passed by the mountain the sky was thick with hawks for a good 45 minutes , she said about two dozen people gazed through binoculars at 9 , 000 broad wings \( 9 , 087 to be precise , although i do n't know how you could be that precise \) , with 17 bald eagles keeping them company the next day there were 3 , 000 birds but broadwinged hawks are unusual in that they migrate in such large groups on oct 2 , when i was on the mountain , none of the watchers expected such numbers there were three regulars who had fetched chairs from a cache in the nearby woods maintained by the hook mountain hawk watch , a semiformal collection of volunteers that keeps track of migrating raptors ms weiss was the keeper of the records that day still , even with low expectations , the morning was slow , and the attention of the watchers started to wander to other birds swifts , a purple finch , warblers , a redbellied woodpecker ah , ms weiss said , a yellowbellied sapsucker that s a good bird the day before , she said , was even slower only seven hawks were sighted all day fortunately , the pace picked up around 10 30 a sharpshinned hawk \( all identifications are courtesy of the hawkwatchers \) flew across the mountain not more than 20 feet overhead it passed too quickly for me to get a good glimpse a few more were spotted in the distance , including a peregrine falcon over the river and then a hawk flew by , not immediately overhead , but close enough to fill the view in my binoculars the sunlight caught its reddish underbelly , and the feathers practically glowed the detailed markings on wings , head and tail were all clear and bright as it glided on the wind steve walter , another hawk watcher , who maintains the web site of the hawk migration association of north america , told me it was an immature harrier september and october are the big months for hawk migration the birds seen on the eastern seaboard are following one of several flyways south from the northern united states and canada to wintering grounds in the southern united states , mexico and other warm spots different species fly at different times the broadwinged hawks flew in september , sharpshinned hawks are in the air now and , of course , some hawks do n't migrate but the ones that do all follow paths where the weather produces updrafts so that they can soar and not spend their whole time beating their wings hawk watchers find spots somewhere along these paths , bring their binoculars and count some groups keep track of their own numbers , most also funnel them to the hawk migration association either way the counts are analyzed to see what can be learned of the ups and downs of hawk populations pete dunne , director of the new jersey audubon society s cape may bird observatory and the author of two books on birds of prey , said that so far this year , the numbers of migrating hawks at cape may are down , but that no conclusions can be drawn because the counts are for only one spot over the years , he said , counts have shown that hawk numbers go up and down for many reasons one clear trend in recent years has been the steady increase in the number of bald eagles an opposite trend has been a decline in kestrels , perhaps because of loss of habitat hawk watching has its limits , however the birds are usually far away binoculars are necessary and when you see a hawk on the wing , you may be tempted to get a closer look i left hook mountain at noon and drove about an hour and a half north , against the path of migration , to the hudson valley raptor center in stanfordville , ny by the time i left hook mountain , ms weiss had counted 39 birds the raptor center , with only three fulltime staff members \( two paid \) , depends heavily on volunteers and contributions it is , however , physically sprawling it covers 91 acres and keeps its birds in large airy enclosures , with long flight cages there are 130 birds at the center now , 100 of which are permanent residents about 100 injured birds pass through the center each year , and about 60 percent of them are released back into the wild , said dona tracy , the center s director of those remaining , ms tracy said , some do n't make it , some stay at the center , and some go to other breeding or education projects in one space a dozen redtailed hawks , the most common bird ms tracy sees , were in various states of health most were hit by cars when they were trying to catch a meal scurrying near a road in other enclosures owls , ospreys , eagles and other birds , some in transit , some permanent residents , were visible
the first week of the bush administration began with continuing evidence that the new team is never , ever , under any circumstances going to utter those healing words al gore got more votes look , george bush won 30 states , said mary matalin , the newly retreaded white house adviser she neglected to note that about half of them are uninhabited we are also having some consistency issues john ashcroft is plowing his way toward confirmation by promising not to follow through on anything he s advocated in the last 50 years on the day after the inauguration , mr bush s chief of staff said the new administration would review fda approval of the morning after ru486 pill these are the regulations he told america he would not try to revoke i believe the words were i do n't think a president can do that that was during one of those debates in which mr gore kept stretching the truth the new administration was dispiriting enough without help from bill clinton , whose tenure ended with 176 lastminute pardons and sentence commutations , some of which reeked like dead mice in the baseboard there is really no feelgood side to commuting the sentence of a drugmoney launderer , or pardoning a bunch of politically connected whitecollar criminals worst of all , you had marc rich , the billionaire who was indicted in 1983 for more than 50 counts of wire fraud , racketeering , tax evasion and trading with the enemy ever since then , the aptly named mr rich has been living large in tiny switzerland , resisting extradition and sending signals that he was willing to cough up any amount of money to make the case go away as long as he was assured he would not have to spend a single day in prison every us attorney since then has told him he had to come back first , and then we would talk , said morris weinberg , a florida attorney who was a prosecutor for the us attorney s office in new york at the time that mr rich was indicted in a press conference at a chappaqua deli on sunday , mr clinton claimed that he had given considerable thought to the rich pardon , although apparently none of it involved asking the opinion of the us attorney s office in manhattan , where prosecutors have been in shell shock since they heard about the deal after the fact having said there were very good reasons to pardon mr rich , mr clinton quickly passed the dead mice on , suggesting that reporters get the details from jack quinn , al gore s former chief of staff , who is now working as mr rich s attorney but since mr quinn was not in the deli in chappaqua , nobody got to hear his excellent arguments mr rich s exwife , a democratic fundraiser , was also unavailable for comment robert fink , another one of mr rich s lawyers , made a number of points yesterday about the regulatory nature of the charges but none of them dealt with the fact that his client was unwilling to defend his conduct before an american judge he did n't hide , said mr fink he was in europe when the indictment came out he did n't voluntarily come back , that s true one of the worst things about mr clinton s lastminute beneficence to unsympathetic but wealthy lawbreakers was that it cast a cloud over all the other things he did rather abruptly in his last weeks in office , many of them involving desirable new rules for environmental protection or health care mr bush is reviewing all those executive actions , when he s not busy preparing to try to ram through an agenda that most people voted against in the election the senate minority leader , tom daschle , is stuck arguing on behalf of the purity of mr clinton s motives on sunday he urged the new administration to go easy in the name of bipartisan amity sooner or later the democrats are going to find some issue where that tactic works
the sale of the world trade center lease was supposed to be a smooth , welloiled process instead , it has turned into a twisting , fastpaced ordeal whose outcome is still uncertain the port authority had planned to announce last wednesday that it was selling the lease for the world trade center for 325 billion to vornado realty trust , a deal that would have been the largest involving a single piece of real estate instead , the negotiations have turned into a longrunning ordeal after several aborted efforts to issue a statement announcing the sale , lewis m eisenberg , the chairman of the port authority , imposed a news blackout now the outcome of the sale is far from certain , as is exactly who will take over the vast office complex it was clear on wednesday morning that vornado was suddenly out , either because the company tried to change the terms of the deal at the last minute or because there was a simple misunderstanding the withdrawal cleared the way for the no 2 bidder , silverstein properties , to reenter the picture but hours later , vornado was back in and despite another vornado withdrawal on thursday morning , the company was back at the negotiating table yesterday , when another frantic round of talks began the port authority has set a monday deadline for completing the deal but no one knows whether the agency will have a contract with vornado i'm so gunshy about vornado now , i do n't know what to think , said one port authority commissioner none of us are happy about what s been going on but we 're talking about a 325 billion deal and a 100 million down payment steven roth , the chairman of vornado , declined to discuss the world trade center yesterday perhaps it is not surprising that the deal for the 106millionsquarefoot complex with the 110story twin towers should go through so many twists and turns after all , mr roth is known as a relentless , difficult and shrewd executive with whom almost no one enjoys bargaining everybody knows that steve is a very tough negotiator , said jonathan litt , the senior real estate analyst at salomon smith barney this only reinforces that reputation many real estate executives expressed doubt privately that mr roth would complete the deal after the authority chose his company as the winning bidder on feb 22 under the deal s terms , vornado would lease the trade center for 99 years for 325 billion as a safeguard , the authority said that if vornado did not sign within 20 days , it would immediately begin negotiations with silverstein , whose team had bid about 322 billion both vornado and the authority labored around the clock on a contract but shortly before the 20day deadline expired on wednesday , vornado told the authority it wanted to change an element of the contract , long agreed upon , by reducing the lease to 39 years with options to renew , according to real estate executives and several agency commissioners involved in the discussions vornado , they said , insisted that it would gain a tax advantage from the change , and that it would also be more lucrative for the port authority , which would still get a total down payment of 700 million but the authority viewed the change as an attempt by vornado to seek a lastminute concession that had not been offered to any other bidder on wednesday morning , the port authority board concluded that it was unable to sign a contract and therefore would open a 14day negotiation period with larry silverstein , the president of silverstein properties , who immediately pulled together his partners and lawyers it is unclear whether mr silverstein , who did not return calls requesting comment , was told that his talks with the authority were exclusive later that day , mr eisenberg charles a gargano , the vice chairman of the authority and tim ryan , a managing partner at j p morgan chase and an adviser to the authority on the deal , all received calls from mr roth , who said that vornado had not withdrawn and still wanted very much to do the deal , even if the lease was for 99 years , according to the real estate executives and the commissioners as a show of good faith , mr roth , the executives said , agreed to put up 100 million immediately and tighten up some of the rental terms the talks resumed but on thursday morning , mr roth called the authority to say that he could not get the vornado board to agree to the deal on such short notice , so he was withdrawing the authority was stunned some port authority executives said they were glad to be rid of mr roth and his shenanigans others criticized the staff for putting mr roth in an untenable situation some top officials at the authority tried to resume talks with mr roth , who ultimately agreed
hlabisa , south africa it is just past 7 on a tuesday morning , and the nurses at hlabisa hospital are praying for deliverance the stronger patients straighten their ailing bodies and chime in on wobbly legs the bedridden croon through cracked lips we are children of god , sing the nurses , clinging to their tattered hymnals in the dingy , overcrowded ward we believe in the lord what we have in our hearts , heaven has put there patient no 8007 , a skeletal man drowning in his blue pajamas , turns his back as the voices rise and fall , he dangles his bony legs off his metal cot and blinks for the last time none of the nurses notice him die there are 78 patients and only 65 beds in the male wards on this day and not nearly enough official eyes nearly half of the hospital s nursing posts are vacant , the shift is changing , the sick are groaning and breakfast carts are clattering with metal bowls of porridge the dead man is 40 , tall and wasted , with a scraggly black beard in another time , he might have been a healthy man , a gold miner , a schoolteacher or a minister looking forward to grandchildren and gray hair but today about 80 percent of the men here in the ward are hiv positive , doctors say he is just the latest casualty of the epidemic there are so many deaths , says sipho myeza , the head nurse on duty , who shakes his head sheepishly when a visitor points out patient no 8007 it is an ordinary morning at hlabisa hospital , with the first call to heaven and the next to the morgue over the last 10 years , the number of patients admitted annually here has nearly doubled as aids has swept through kwazulu natal province , where the hiv infection rate in adults is the highest in south africa as the epidemic swamps this rural staterun hospital , it is transforming how the institution functions , how its employees live , even what they believe some changes are painfully obvious the soaring number of admissions and deaths , the shortages of staff and beds , the general erosion of care as nurses and doctors struggle to conduct routine checks and tests the other shifts , if less quantifiable , are equally profound none of the infected patients here have access to the lifesaving aids drugs available in the west so the agonizing duty of caring for incurables has left workers questioning their faith in medicine , their role as caretakers , the future of a community where parents can no longer assume that their children will live beyond 35 these days , dinah ntombilezi , a nurse , gives most of her trust not to doctors but to a flamboyant preacher who claims to cure aids with prayer go to god s plan church and he will pray for you , she tells a group of astonished women waiting outside a local clinic he can do what we cannot ellen dube , one of two aids counselors , swallows stress pills and migraine pills so she will have enough strength to tell yet another young woman that she has hiv , the human immunodeficiency virus , which causes aids these children , i look at them , and i think , 'will my children one day be in this same problem \?

madrid by way of introduction , everyone seems to agree that the young spanish actor sergi l pez is a thoroughly nice guy in person , he is informal , funny , selfdeprecating , bemused by his recent success and on screen , he plays droll and sympathetic characters of a kind the french call reassuring in his latest movie , dominik moll s with a friend like harry , he again plays a nice guy , albeit one with a flaw he is also a killer more surprisingly , given the strong spanish accent that laces his french , mr l pez is a rising star of french cinema he earned plaudits in manuel poirier s western and fr d ric fonteyne s affair of love and now with a friend like harry has won him both a european film award and a c sar , the french oscar , for best actor in 2000 at 35 , though , mr l pez continues to live in spain with his partner and two children people here know me as the fellow who has made it in france , mr l pez said in an interview in a madrid hotel during a break in shooting his latest movie , this time in spanish few have seen my films i 've been in 10 spanish films , but none has been a hit still , being an outsider in france has served him well with a friend like harry , which opens on friday in new york , drew two million filmgoers when it was released in france last fall its french title , harry , un ami qui vous veut du bien , or literally , harry , a friend who wishes you well , also hints at some of the mystery surrounding mr l pez s harry , a jovial and wealthy spaniard who unexpectedly reenters the life of his old school friend , michel \( laurent lucas \) who exactly is harry \? why is he so nice \? what is he up to \? the movie opens with michel , his wife claire \( mathilde seigner \) and their three noisy preteenage daughters driving to the south of france in an old car for their summer vacation when michel bumps into harry in the restroom of a roadside cafe michel cannot remember harry , but harry comes alive with memories of michel s teenage writing efforts surely michel is now a successful writer sadly , no he teaches french to foreigners because the ennui of daily life job , family and parents leaves him neither time nor peace to write for harry , however , every problem has a solution accompanied by his cuddly girlfriend , prune \( sophie guillemin \) , harry offers to drive claire and the children in his airconditioned mercedesbenz over dinner at michel s rundown vacation home , harry excitedly recalls michel s writing talent , even reciting one of his early poems published in a school magazine he just cannot believe that michel is not writing it is his duty , harry ominously concludes , to remove the obstacles to michel s creativity starting with his meddling parents mr moll , who won the bestdirector c sar for with a friend like harry , said he had had trouble with mr l pez s accent when he thought of casting him as michel , but then he realized that the spaniard would make a more interesting and enigmatic harry it was very important that harry be somebody very likable and sympathetic , and i knew sergi had that quality because i had only seen him playing nice guys , said mr moll , who as a german is another expatriate working in the french movie industry but when he did a screen test , he also did the darker side well he had the perfect combination of the sincerity i was looking for and this potential madness mr l pez joked that he so liked the screenplay that he would have accepted any role , including one of the daughters , but he felt right playing harry i do n't think a bad guy has to have a grim face , he said harry is very simp tico , but he does n't show himself he has one hand behind his back , and you do n't know if he is holding a flower or a knife mr l pez himself seems far less complicated , taking the occasional downs and the recent ups in his career with identical equanimity i think the important thing for him is always to enjoy what he s doing , mr moll said of him growing up in vilanova i la geltr , 30 miles south of barcelona , mr lopez became an actor almost by accident arriving home late one night , he calmed his angry father by announcing that he had finally decided on an acting career so , at 18 , he went to drama school in barcelona , but he grew bored instead , he and a pal sought out a vilanova neighbor and trained actor , toni alv , who threw them into the adventure of improvisation six months later , they had prepared a twoman show that they toured around catalonia for the next four years then , in 1990 , mr l pez took his savings and signed on at the cole jacques lecoq , a small but respected theater school in paris his dream was still the stage indeed , when a rookie french movie director needed a spanish actor for a role , mr l pez was only minimally interested he had never been much of a movie buff , thanks in part to the mediocre fare available in vilanova , and above all he did not want to miss any classes at the cole but he accepted the role , and in the event it was not much of a disruption shooting chronologically , the director , mr poirier , made the first 20 minutes , then ran out of money a year later , the movie , antonio s girlfriend , was finally completed , and a grateful mr poirier vowed to include mr l pez in all his future films thus , having resumed his touring theater life in spain , mr l pez made films only for mr poirier then , in 1997 , their fifth movie , western , won the prix du jury at the cannes film festival and suddenly mr l pez was in demand for me , there was before 'western' and after 'western , ' mr l pez recalled but i knew nothing about the movie industry i still do n't when i was invited to appear opposite nathalie baye , i did n't know who she was i was invited to meet bertrand blier , and i had to call poirier to discover he was a major director but it gave me a distance that was useful since i did n't know the directors , i just read the scripts ms baye , who was named best actress by the 1999 venice film festival for her role in an affair of love , said she was charmed by mr l pez s childlike candor , both on and off camera someone once said that an actress is more than a woman and an actor is less than a man , she said sergi is above all a man before being an actor , which is rare among actors and that gives him remarkable authenticity there are actors who are actors all the time what seduced me about sergi is that in life he is not an actor his life , though , is certainly now devoted to acting including minor roles , he has already appeared in 10 french and 10 spanish films after he finishes shooting solo m a \( only mine \) in madrid this month , he has a major role in mr poirier s seventh film , and he will make his first trip to the united states in the fall to shoot a movie in which he will play a gay man in the 1960 s after that , he wants to return to theater , to develop a oneman show , which he would perform between movies yet he still has to pinch himself to be persuaded that everything is real only four years ago , we found ourselves in cannes with 'western , ' he said cannes \? i 'd only seen it on tv i did n't even feel i was making movies then 'an affair of love' wins a prize in venice then we 're back in cannes for 'harry' then i get nominated for a c sar and i win the prize it s too much after the c sar , i got a letter from the french culture minister , catherine tasca a fine letter , you know the way they speak congratulating me on being the best french actor of the year he lit a cigarette and looked genuinely puzzled she knows i'm not french , he said i 'd prefer to think she was being ironic photos nathalie baye and sergi l pez in an affair of love \( 2000 \) \( fine line

rostovondon , russia it was late last march 26 that a russian army colonel , yuri d budanov , and three soldiers left an encampment outside chechnya s capital , grozny , and pointed their armored personnel carrier south into the village of tangi , then east on to a lane at the first house on that road no 7 , three rooms of plaster and brick belonging to vissa kungayev the four stopped they broke out ak47 s , entered , seized 18yearold elza kungayeva , and bound her in a blanket then they took her to colonel budanov s quarters and there , as music blared above her cries , colonel budanov pummeled elza kungayeva s face , cut off her clothes with a knife and , finally , pushed her onto his cot and strangled her in the trial of colonel budanov , unfolding nearly a year later , none of the events above are in dispute what remains very much in dispute not just in the courtroom , but on the streets and in military circles is whether he did anything worth punishing the trial of colonel budanov , which resumes on tuesday , is a rorschach test of russian justice and society , a grisly image whose meaning depends entirely on who is viewing it democrats see a test of whether a nation blind to stalin s mass slaughter can stubbornly continue to see no evil in chechnya nationalists see another plot by foreigners to humble russia and impose their moral code the great sea of ordinary russians , used to taking their cue from authority , wavers in a new poll by the public opinion foundation , a respected moscow survey firm , half of those asked said colonel budanov should be set free immediately only 19 percent disagreed the rest were unsure it is with these people that the outcome of the budanov trial innocent or guilty , fair or rigged will resonate it s very important , this trial it is important that this person if he s indeed responsible for this that he be punished , aleksandr gelman , a playwright and social critic , said in an interview it has a huge meaning if it does n't happen in fact , he added , it is this trial that will show how far we have come since the soviet days , when the verdict was simply decided by the party and relayed to judges to announce it s difficult , he said i do n't envy the judges most dispassionate experts argue that the russian military routinely commits crimes against chechen civilians with little fear of punishment human rights watch , the international watchdog group , says it has documented thousands of cases , from massacres in three towns last winter to kidnapping , looting , torture and rape , to the disappearance of at least 100 chechens last seen being seized by russian troops russian officials just as routinely dismiss such accusations as overwrought or plain wrong as of december , military prosecutors had brought just 35 cases , 11 of them minor , against russian soldiers for crimes against chechen civilians the budanov case is the exception beefy and burrcut at 37 , colonel budanov is the highestranking officer to be accused of a crime against a chechen civilian more than that , he is a rising military star twice decorated , twice promoted early , commander of more than 100 tanks in the army s 160th regiment , a fixture of the war from its september 1999 beginning the kremlin itself expressed outrage at ms kungayeva s killing last march , even dispatching officers to attend her funeral the chief of the military s general staff denounced colonel budanov as scum but in the year since , attitudes have shifted an initial accusation of rape , documented by an autopsy , has vanished three soldiers who assisted in ms kungayeva s abduction and burial now key witnesses for the prosecution were pardoned in a general amnesty given soldiers last april the formal charges read in court when the trial opened early this month incorporate colonel budanov s explanation of ms kungayeva s death that he believed her a rebel sniper who had killed soldiers in his regiment two months earlier , and that he killed her in an uncontrollable fit of revenge colonel budanov s lawyer , anatoly mukhin , said his client admitted strangling ms kungayeva , but in a state of sickness which did not allow a person to recognize the character of his actions and control them there s a word for it combat fatigue , he said do n't portray him as a maniac and murderer who seeks blood he came to chechnya to perform his duty and his military oath lies , says the woman s father , vissa kungayev he was coming to me because he had seen my daughter , he said in a telephone interview from ingushetia , where his family lives in a refugee camp he noticed her before there is a school of thought reflected in some newspapers , among some politicians , on rostov streets and on internet chat lines that colonel budanov is the true victim in this case , set up somehow by chechen conspirators , persecuted for doing his duty or handed to western critics to silence sermonizing on human rights valentina i shchedrina , 62 , held a banner aloft demanding colonel budanov s freedom as she stood among maybe 75 protesters outside the courthouse her soninlaw and daughter are serving in chechnya , she said this is why i'm here but i do n't pin any hopes on a just decision of this court on the day he seized ms kungayeva from her home , colonel budanov had been drinking celebrating his own daughter s second birthday
albany , oct 10 once each year , state officials and a throng of firefighters gather here at a gleaming slab of polished granite , a short stroll from the state capitol , to unveil the names of all the new york firefighters who died in the line of duty the previous year tuesday was that day the death toll for the year 2000 frederick l brain , kenneth kerr , charles e h lauber jr , keith purcell and bernard d scannell five dead across an entire state , over an entire year the speakers and many in the crowd of about 300 found it hard to give those five their due , compelled to look past this year s event to what they know will be a very different ceremony next year the event took place under the pall of sept 11 it was too much to think about , yet all anyone could think about james a burns , the state fire administrator , had trouble expressing his thoughts at the prospect of gathering again next year to add the names of 343 firefighters lost in the attack on the world trade center i just ca n't i ca n't i mean , we never imagined as gov george e pataki said during the ceremony , words do n't come easily , and words alone seem inadequate the new york state fallen firefighters memorial was installed in 1998 , with a bronze of two firefighters carrying a wounded comrade , and behind it , the wall , to bear the name of every new york firefighter who died in the line of duty it honors those who made what is supposed to be an increasingly rare sacrifice , in a profession that technique , equipment and building methods had made safer with each generation each year , as fire departments scour their old records , more names from the distant past are chiseled into the stone so far , there are 1 , 875 names the wall is angled back to catch the sun , so that on a brilliant morning like this one , it shines it has room for well over 3 , 000 names when the memorial was dedicated , officials confidently predicted that it would suffice at least through the end of the 21st century that was one of the many assumptions that sept 11 wiped away , with more firefighters killed on a single day , in a single place , than statewide in the previous 20 years no one dares talk of only five dead , but last year was a good year over the last generation , a normal year was 10 to 20 none of the five died the kinds of horrific deaths associated with fighting fires no burns , no severe smoke inhalation , no falling buildings three suffered heart failure brought on in part by heavy exertion two during fires , one after one had a heart attack on his way to a fire one fell off a fire truck firefighters used to dare hope for a year with no new names to add we can still hope that , said the rev joseph salerno , chaplain of the utica fire department it s harder , but we have to remind ourselves one firefighter from pennsylvania explained at the ceremony that the number of firefighters killed at the trade center was double the entire force for his hometown no disrespect , but i think we 'd trade for a year like last year right about now , he said last year seems like a long , long time ago but we need to remember those guys , too
another political fundraiser took place monday night at the plaza hotel in manhattan , this one for the special friends of queens , whose fondness for the borough does not necessarily extend to visiting it the bar was stocked , the ravioli stuffed and the pianist in the corner played someday my prince will come the 1 , 000aplate event even included one of those staged photo opportunities council speaker peter f vallone , queens resident and democratic mayoral candidate , to the right city comptroller alan g hevesi , queens resident and democratic mayoral candidate , to the left and thomas j manton smack in the middle , arms outstretched and face creased with a smile as forced as those of his two companions these days mr manton , the longtime chairman of the queens democratic party , is often betwixt and between , and not just because he eventually has to endorse one native son over another in the mayor s race for the first time in anyone s memory , the borough presidency and all 14 city council seats in queens are up for grabs , creating the dynamics for an elbowthrowing scrum of party regulars trying to win the endorsement of a courtly man who disapproves of internal strife the democratic party of mr manton dominates queens it is thought by many to be the most disciplined political organization in the city , one that almost always avoids the untidiness of primaries this year , though , the city s new term limits law has encouraged five democrats to vie for the borough presidency in several areas , as many as eight democrats will compete for a city council seat many candidates like to think they have a special in with mr manton that will distinguish them from the rabble this is going to be the biggest shift in the history of the borough , said james chapin , a political analyst with expertise in queen politics who is now writing for united press international he added , if there s any theme , it might be that democracy comes to queens but mr manton knows that with a nod or shake of his leonine head of gray hair , he can still grant or dash the political aspirations of that young upstart in woodside , that faithful journeyman in queens village , and , perhaps , that longtime acquaintance with sights set on gracie mansion you 're going to have to say to people who have been your allies , 'it s not your day , ' he said that s disturbing sometimes sometimes if someone does n't get that ring , they may never be able to come around again he said he knew that he could not remain uncommitted for much longer at some point he will have to announce his choice for mayor , his choice for borough president , his choices for the council for now , though , mr manton is listening , smiling , opening his arms , but stopping just short of an embrace it s my strategy , he said , smiling again i call it constructive malingering that reference may work on more than one level mr manton , 68 , is an oldstyle irish catholic leader in an ethnic party mix of a borough after experiencing the largest population growth of any of the city s five boroughs in the 1990 s , queens now has 22 million people among the tens of thousands of asians , eastern europeans and indians who have recently moved in , few would understand mr manton s frequent references to irish counties , or his use of the gaelic word for good health he knows that he may be the last of his kind but he also knows how to survive in a way that leaves his suit freshly pressed and his hair barely mussed he knows never to stand between a dog and a lamppost , mr chapin said the reason he has tended not to get in trouble is that he does n't hold a grudge in that way he s smarter than a lot of other politicians mr manton s ascension from obscure city council member to power broker came under circumstances that can safely be called atypical , if not bizarre he became a congressman in 1984 when geraldine a ferraro made history by vacating her seat to run unsuccessfully for vice president and he became the queens party leader in 1986 when donald r manes , the longtime borough president and party leader , stabbed himself in the heart in 1986 , just as a protracted investigation into municipal corruption was closing in for all the storied harmony of the democratic organization in queens , mr manes s death resurrected the lifeanddeath struggle for control of the party and the jobs in borough hall between irish and jewish factions john sabini , now a city council member , was the interregnum leader for several months while the two sides hashed it out he personally had no shot at a permanent appointment , he said , because the leaders objected to my antipatronage platform it all came down to which side would win over the bloc of black democrats the crucial interviews were held one night in a political club in far rockaway morton povman , a city council member and the jewish faction s candidate , was questioned first , and then mr manton a couple of hours later , mr manton received the congratulatory call
san francisco , feb 16 pacific gas and electric has long been a company that californians love to hate in the 1940 s , activists protested the utility s monopolizing of san francisco s electrical supply in the 1980 s , hundreds were arrested at the company s diablo canyon nuclear plant , trying to block preliminary testing just this week , erin brockovich , a hollywood blockbuster that paints the utility as a 1990 s corporate villain , was nominated for five oscars but nothing has done more to sully the utility s image than this winter s energy crisis in california and the debate over who should pay the billions that pge , as everyone here calls the company , owes its power suppliers critics say that pacific gas and electric took full advantage of the state s deregulated market for electricity a market it helped design by funneling 469 billion from the utility to its parent company , the pge corporation , and stockholders since 1997 a recent stateordered audit concluded that the utility s executives knew the state faced an energy squeeze but did little to prepare for it pge has said it hired bankruptcy lawyers last august but that month , the company also said top executives were selling shares of the parent company s stock none of this has raised the utility s esteem in its customers eyes they are just another corrupt company that wants nothing but to protect its own interests , said judd fischer , a banker , as he smoked a cigarette outside the leopard , a bar in downtown san francisco , one recent chilly afternoon california politicians , in the habit of following pge s lead after collecting a century s worth of campaign contributions , now are competing to score points at the company s expense after weeks of maneuvering , gov gray davis and democratic legislators offered a plan today to save pacific gas and electric and its los angelesarea counterpart , southern california edison , from bankruptcy the proposal , which republicans oppose , includes a new charge on consumers' bills to help recover the nearly 13 billion that the state s utilities owe their power suppliers governor davis also wants big concessions , including control of the utilities' transmission networks , in exchange for what he calls a buyout , not a bailout the companies will have no undue influence in this situation , john burton , democrat of san francisco and president pro tem of the state senate , said in fact , they will have less than due influence people are angry the loss of control can only be disorienting for pacific gas and electric , whose executives declined repeated requests for comment regarding last week s proposal from the governor , the utility said it was not seeking a bailout , but instead wanted wholesale costs passed on to consumers in the 1980 s , wags printed bumper stickers that read , welcome to california owned and operated by pge built by pge , at least in the 1920 s , the company helped harness the power of the tuolumne river in the hetch hetchy valley to light northern and central california after world war ii , pacific gas and electric embarked on one of the largest construction programs by a power company at the time , fueling one boom after another as agriculture in california made way for the military industry , the hightechnology explosion and the state s growth into the world s sixthbiggest economy pge was one of the ways california came to know itself , said the historian kevin starr , the california state librarian the people who ran the local utilities which flowed into pge were the establishment of these regions as a result , he said pge became society it was ground zero of the california establishment that was true particularly in san francisco where , in 1854 , executives from the san francisco gas company , which was later merged into pge , gathered at a banquet at the oriental hotel to celebrate the lighting of the state s first gas lights , according to a company history then , too , the revelers suffered a blackout but at the hands of a prankster , not the deregulatory nightmare and supply shortages that have bedeviled california this winter the party also established the utility s custom of courting politicians , with city council members and san francisco s mayor toasting the new gaslight era last year alone , the pge corporation and its affiliates poured 134 million into the coffers of california politicians those who have squared off against pacific gas and electric say that its executives actively work their connections in every aspect of political life nettie hoge , executive director of the utility reform network , a consumer group based here , recalled the battle in 1998 over proposition 9 , a measure that could have reduced consumer rates by as much as 18 percent , a state study later showed one day when she was tracking the effort to get the issue on the state ballot , ms hoge said , she got a call from daniel d richard jr , a senior pge executive in detail , she said , he described the counties in which she did not have enough signatures it was creepy , ms hoge said dan was following us county by county i always had this sense he was monitoring everything
pendleton , ore the workday begins on a patch of black asphalt ringed by razorwire fence this is where more than 200 inmates of the eastern oregon correctional institution line up at 7 45 on weekdays they are clad in blue jeans and inspected like cattle by men with pistols and crew cuts and gray uniforms their names are called out , their bodies frisked fifty of them march into a yellow concrete factory building the size of a hangar and punch a time clock inside , they are no longer on the inside inside , they are the hired hands of john borchert i hope you enjoy your stay , he tells them at the door mr borchert is the general manager of the array corporation , a private company with 2 million in annual revenue that employs inmates primarily to make garments the factory churns out 50 , 000 pieces of clothing a year , most of them jeans and work shirts half are bought by the state to clothe prisoners the rest are sold in retail stores under the brand prison blues and using the slogan , made on the inside to be worn on the outside mr borchert and his floor managers , tom wise and nick hiatt , walk around the bright 40 , 000squarefoot factory as they would in any plant there are no guards , even though workers are serving time for the entire range of felonies , from stabbing friends to raping children to burning down houses many even wield razor knives and electric drills we try to run it as much like a business as possible , mr borchert , 39 , said above the din of sewing machines that s important for the mental environment of the workers it becomes an escape for them i guess escape is a bad word it becomes a release for them but mr borchert and his colleagues do have to approach many standard management issues like staff motivation and training new hires from an unusual perspective after all , they are supervising what is arguably the least traditional work force in america it is also one of the fastest growing about 85 , 000 of this country s 13 million inmates in federal and state prisons hold a job , including 3 , 500 in a federal program where they make products for private companies for interstate sale that is up from 1 , 000 five years ago oregon is a leader in the trend , as a result of a 1994 law that requires all ablebodied prisoners to put in a 40hour week eighty percent now do , one of the highest rates in the nation after starting prison blues , the state contracted the program in 1997 to array , a subsidiary of yoshida s inc , a company in portland that has 75 million in annual sales from products like teriyaki sauce , golf bags and snowboards for the managers of prison blues , overseeing felons has a builtin advantage they are incredibly motivated no matter that the work is menial and the pay paltry \( the state allows them to keep only a fifth of the average 680 an hour that they make , with the rest going to taxes , victim restitution and other expenses \) the program has a waiting list of 200 , and employees are even eager to work holidays these jobs mean a lot to them , mr borchert said you 'll get guys who can be fairly emotional about whether or not they 're able to do the job usually guys in an american company would n't express a lot of emotion about whether or not they can sew one inmate who had failed at several jobs last year almost cried when a manager told him he was not working out , mr borchert said he was tearyeyed he said 'please , i 'll do anything i 'll work in the warehouse , i 'll do whatever i just ca n't sew' we wrote him a letter wishing him well in future assignments i still see that person a couple times a week he pleads with me for his job back no surprise there sewing clothes beats the dreariness and danger of prison life , and making 136 an hour is better than earning nothing the workers learn skills they can use on the outside and for many , the factory floor offers a more personal reward they treat you like people here , said robert staunton , 37 , a convicted kidnapper who had never held down a job some corrections officers treat you all right , but a lot of them think you 're doing something wrong these guys do n't think that way they 're more business types , so it s like being on the street again mr staunton says he has saved 4 , 000 and sends money to his two children workers also spend their savings on new shoes , toiletries and tuition they are paid by the piece the more they make , the more they earn , although a federal law requires array to pay at least the prevailing wage and if the percentage of defects falls below the industry average of 3 percent , the workers are given credit to buy prison blues products even the smallest of incentives , ones that would be taken for granted on the outside , can be surprisingly effective in the first quarter of 2000 , when the percentage of defects first fell below the industry average , mr borchert bought pizza for the entire floor many workers had not tasted a slice in five years they loved it , mr wise said not long after that happened , there was an issue that came up where several pairs of jeans were put together wrong , and some guys actually spent time on their breaks correcting these just so the percentage would n't rise

catskill , ny to get a glimpse of the artistic vision that gripped thomas cole when he climbed down into a cavern under a waterfall here 175 years ago , people can go to the wadsworth atheneum in hartford , where his painting of kaaterskill falls hangs today or they can simply take a walk in new york city s central park , which was deliberately designed to mimic the art of the hudson river school that cole launched from this place tiring of that , they might stroll to the nearby art galleries on madison avenue that owe their roots to the 19thcentury bull market in landscape imagery that made new york the nation s first art capital going for a drive instead \? the blue ridge parkway in virginia was built in the 1930 s to offer just the kind of landscape perspectives that cole and his followers turned into formula foreground , middle ground , distance feel like just sitting around on the front porch \? even here , scholars say , the old ideas still resonate front porches on american homes were first popularized about the time that hudson river school art was at its peak of popularity before the civil war porches were considered perfect perches for looking at the landscape the impact went everywhere , said hal k rothman , a professor of history at the university of nevada at las vegas , who edits the the journal , environmental history if kids put posters on their walls in those days , it would have been hudson river school art cole certainly did not invent the idea that a relationship with nature was important america s debate over wilderness what it meant and how people should relate to it is at least as old as the first encampments of the puritans in new england but the specific vocabulary and mechanics of the relationship between humans and the wild that he and other artists and writers perfected between about 1820 and 1875 is still very much a part of modern life some elements of the pattern are fuzzy as cracked and begrimed with age as any old painting landscape architects might know , for example , that walking down central park s promenade to bethesda terrace at the rowboat lake was designed to deliver three traditional landscape art perspectives formal , pastoral and picturesque in sequential order most people would n't even care other threads of cole s tapestry , especially the elements of spirituality in nature , are as vibrant as ever , in issues like ecology and global warming over the last decade , ordinary people and experts in fields ranging from theology to evolutionary biology have found common ground to argue that a deeper human connection to the earth a page that seems taken directly from the hudson river sketchbook should be the foundation for protecting it but there was also an element of pure chance in the unfolding of the hudson river school new york city , in cole s time , was mainly a commercial center , just beginning to boom as new transportation routes opened to the midwest what happened after cole is that the national vision , as the art historian angela miller called it , came to be associated permanently , as it turned out with a city that had mostly before that been about moneygrubbing the news media capital in america was christened with a paintbrush there was a convergence of different factors writers , artists , patrons , wealth , people who collected art and then the art itself was marketed by new york institutions , said dr miller , an associate professor of art history and american studies at washington university in st louis other cities that might have claimed the artleadership mantle , specifically boston and philadelphia , as each had beautiful regions nearby notably new hampshire s white mountains north of boston and the delaware river valley outside philadelphia but new york had the hudson valley , which had already attained an aura of grandeur , and it had cole and the acolytes who came after him , and that made all the difference the catskills , where cole first made his name , was also only a few hours north by steamboat an accessible outward bound kind of experience for the rising victorianera middle classes the lingering mystery of the artist s eye what cole really saw when he gazed out from the cavern of the kaaterskill remains unsolved but people still search judy a abbott , a 55yearold artist from lake hill , ny , has hiked to the falls more than two dozen times with her paints and easel over the last year working on a single painting she said she has perhaps a dozen more trips each timed to catch the light falling on the falls just so before the piece is done there s something very compelling , she said of the view , which still stops her in her tracks the water seems to come out of the sky it gives you a feeling of being a very small part of something very magnificent mixing preservation and profit the mostly unspoken assumption behind the rise of american landscape painting was that nature supposedly so wild and untamed could be framed and composed by artists for consumption and purchase wilderness became a commodity , however hightoned the rhetoric about its edifying qualities

the enemy and the ally president s address president bush tried to cast the war against osama bin laden and the taliban in the broadest global context as he told the united nations that every member country was a potential target of terrorism and that the responsibility for fighting to stop it was binding on every nation with a place in this chamber mr bush s speech , his first to the general assembly , opened two days of intense diplomacy to enlist more support for his war against terrorism a1 defining terrorism a reflection of the degree to which sept 11 now dominates the agenda of

country and the other in the west a1 chemical weapons the united states has identified sites in afghanistan that are suspected of being involved in osama bin laden s efforts to acquire and produce

arab newspapers and television has been that the united states has moved arrogantly , blindly , even callously into conflict in a country that it does not understand , and that the consequences could be worse than if the americans had left well enough alone b5 the message makers four women karen p hughes , the white house communications director victoria clarke , chief pentagon spokeswoman

los angeles , march 1 negotiations broke down today between the writers guild of america and representatives of the major studios and television networks , inching the industry closer to the prospect of a longdreaded strike that could effectively shut down hollywood this morning , representatives of the alliance of motion picture and television producers presented to guild negotiators a response to an offer that the guild had presented to them earlier in the week , but it fell far short of the union s demands , officials from both sides said the talks were suspended and guild officials said they needed to break the news blackout that the negotiations have been under for the last six weeks to consult with their members before proceeding both sides worked very hard to bridge the gap , but the gap is just too big at this point , said nick counter , chief negotiator for the producers john wells , the guild s president , said the main issue hobbling the talks was money specifically , the amount of money writers will be paid in residuals for subsequent use of their work beyond an initial theatrical run or television broadcast the producers said their threeyear proposal today amounted to a 30 million increase over three years , but the guild said this was deceptive as it included a 3 percent rise in the basic minimums guaranteed to writers on various types of projects when the residuals are looked at separately , mr wells said , the producers' offer was about 3 million , far less than the 18 million to 19 million the guild was demanding we are basically in agreement on the numbers and how to figure the numbers , mr wells said the issue is how big those numbers are and there is going to have to be more money on the table for us to come back to negotiations for almost a year , hollywood has been fearing that a dual strike this summer by the 11 , 000 writers , whose contract expires at midnight may 1 , and the 135 , 000 members of the screen actors guild and the american federation of television and radio artists , whose contract expires at midnight june 30 , would shut down production on virtually all movies and television programs for months now , the studios have rushed to finish as many films as possible before the strike deadlines the previous strike by the writers guild , in 1988 , lasted for five months both sides today tried to characterize the breakdown as temporary these are not final offers on the table , said john mclean , the guild s executive director what we have here today is just a cessation of the initial negotiations but coming after six weeks of closeddoor talks , during which a sense of optimism had begun to creep through hollywood , today s breakdown is certain to heighten prospects of a summer of strikes talks have not yet opened between the actors and producers writers guild officials said they intended to undertake a series of meetings next week with members from around the country , to explain the competing packages and get feedback for the inevitable resumption of talks both sides agreed that it was the dispute over residuals that caused the talks to fail the guild said the producers' package included a freeze on network primetime residuals , no increases on basic cable and videocassette residuals and only very small increases in other areas , like sales to foreign markets most onerous to the writers was a provision calling for what the guild characterized as rollbacks in residuals for the first television rerun , the first rerun in syndication and the first two reruns on basic cable the producers declined to give details of their offer for the various types of residuals , saying that the offer had to be viewed as a whole focusing on cutbacks in one area overlooks the overall net gains , they said producers said the offer they made to the writers today remained on the table and they were willing to resume talks at any time we are happy to stay at the negotiating table as long as it takes to make a deal , said barry meyer , chairman and chief executive of the warner brothers unit of aol time warner and one of the principal negotiators for the producers another disputed area , beyond residuals , is the socalled creative rights issues a package of complaints by writers who felt they have not been treated as equal partners in the filmmaking process the writers had wanted cutbacks in the use of the film by credit often given to directors and provisions guaranteeing them access to the sets of the films they wrote and invitations to the premiere and marketing events though some progress was made in these areas , guild officials said , none were in the most contentious areas the producers did agree to a demand that they invite writers to premieres , the guild said , but offered little other progress jeffrey katzenberg , a dreamworks studio chief who was one of the lead negotiators on creative rights , said he felt an agreement in that area could have been forged with one or two more meetings we are hoping this will be a brief breaking off of negotiations rather than a collapse of negotiations , mr katzenberg said nevertheless , producers warned the guild against putting the industry into a prolonged period of uncertainty , saying that television schedules for the fall needed to be put in place soon and that there would inevitably be a rise in reality programs , news broadcasts and other shows that did not require guild writers
washington , jan 24 president bill clinton never used to refer to representative george miller , a rather bulky democrat from california , as big george but there is a new tenant in the oval office these days , and president bush has brought with him his own signature style that means nicknames , even for a liberal democrat like mr miller it means levity it means bipartisan backslapping and texasstyle folksiness representative j c watts jr , republican of oklahoma , got a taste of the bush lighthearted treatment in an oval office meeting this week he liked it we 're so serious around this town , sometimes it s like we 've been sucking lemons , mr watts said when senator edward m kennedy visited the white house on monday , mr bush showed him that he was using his brother s presidential desk a kennedy aide said he appreciated the gesture , and other lawmakers have been similarly charmed it remains to be seen how long the honeymoon will last as people get to know him and meet him , they will be pleasantly surprised , mr miller said i 've only dealt with him on education and on that subject i found him very well informed and very engaged on other subject matters , we 'll see how it goes during the presidential campaign , mr bush struck many democrats as a policy lightweight who only mouthed phrases that his advisers had drafted for him he was a conservative in compassionate clothing , many in the opposing party complained , a grown man who still acted as if he went home every day to the delta kappa epsilon fraternity house but now , whether democrats like it or not , he is the 43rd president of the united states and the dozens of lawmakers who have paraded up the white house driveway this week for smallgroup meetings with mr bush are beginning to get a taste of his legendary charm hey , big george , mr bush said to mr miller when the congressman joined other lawmakers in austin before the inauguration to discuss educational policy mr miller returned to the white house this week and learned that the nickname had stuck mr bush now refers to representative fred upton , a michigan republican , as freddy boy other such monikers are sure to follow the guest list of those invited to the white house about 60 people as of today and 80 by week s end was carefully drafted by the washingtonwise aides the new president has hired coordinating the outreach with capitol hill is nicholas calio , a former lobbyist now running the white house congressional liaison office andrew h card jr , the president s chief of staff , and vice president dick cheney , a former congressman himself , have also played major roles , as has karl rove , the president s senior adviser mr cheney , mr card and mr calio were senior officials in the administration of mr bush s father describing the new president s approach , aides said today that mr bush intended to reach beyond his party and beyond the conservative democrats known for bucking their leaders on particular issues , aides said the administration would court members like mr miller , who may disagree with much of the bush agenda but backs him on educational standards the president knows that his friends one day can be opponents the next , mr calio said those who support him on education might not support him on another issue mr bush used his folksiness as governor to win over texas lawmakers and he wooed american voters with it as a presidential candidate this week , he has begun to apply it to the men and women who hold the fate of his legislative agenda in their hands i hope people are now beginning to realize that when i said the executive branch is willing to work with the legislative branch to do what s right for the country , it s not hollow words , it s what i believe we need to do , mr bush told reporters today as he began his sixth smallgroup meeting of the week with senators and representatives mr bush may lack mr clinton s ability to wax philosophical about the minutiae of virtually any policy but the new president shares mr clinton s talent for working a room of course , it is nothing new for new presidents to stroke congressional egos lyndon b johnson and gerald r ford , two congressional graduates who made it to the white house , engaged in their own unique versions of it and mr bush s father , a former member of congress himself , used to call lawmakers by their first names and insist that they call him george this week , lawmakers said they found a president who clearly cared deeply about the issue of education and had studied it when someone brought up the term disaggregation in one session , mr bush picked up on it himself and seemed to know that it meant separating test scores by different groups of students even those who fought to keep mr bush from setting up shop in the oval office were praising his style this week i guess i'm too old to be charmed , but he was certainly very charming , said jody powell , who was president jimmy carter s press secretary he was certainly down to earth and conversational capitol hill watchers noticed that none of the democrats invited on the first official day of business were house or senate leaders the white house seemed to be sending a message that it would be willing to work around the democratic power structure if it chose to dig in its heels joining mr bush on monday were democratic elders and former officeholders , people like mr powell , who served in the more cordial washington of decades past on tuesday , mr bush extended invitations to some of the democratic moderates most likely to bolt their party on the issues he cares most about he was very charming , gracious and polite , said one of them , representative gary a condit of california but it takes substance to get people on board mr condit said were was plenty of levity in the cabinet room as he and other moderates bantered with mr bush but he said the lighthearted meeting was also light on the policy specifics that tend to divide it was only today that mr bush got around to inviting senator tom daschle , the minority leader , and representative richard a gephardt , the minority leader , to sit around a table in the west wing and talk they were joined by senator trent lott , the majority leader , and other republican leaders , who had already been in earlier in the week at the urging of representative david e bonior of michigan , the fiercely partisan minority whip , the conversation turned to the need for electoral changes , a delicate topic for a president who won office only after lengthy court battles and controversy over balloting in florida but mr bush , instead of turning prickly , agreed it was an issue worth addressing bush watchers are not absolutely convinced that the seeming harmony will last and that new president s overtures will translate into legislative achievements will it be a magic bullet that will clear all controversy on every venture \? not likely , said bruce buchanan , government professor at the university of texas at austin might it work from time to time to smooth the way \? quite possibly photo president bush met yesterday with congressional leaders facing the camera from left were tom daschle , trent lott , mr bush , j dennis hastert and richard a gephardt \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
ruling in favor of the new york state police , a federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit in which three former state troopers alleged that they were the victims of discrimination when they were fired for misconduct in 1993 the three troopers , all hispanic men , were fired after a fight with local police officers in mount vernon , ny , in december 1992 while the troopers were off duty the fight began at a topless bar where the troopers had been drinking the troopers , william aguirre and michael petry of troop t in albany and miguel a valle jr of troop k in poughkeepsie , were fired in june 1993 after being found guilty of misconduct during internal state police administrative hearings in 1994 , the troopers sued , contending that their punishment was more severe than that of five other troopers , all white , who had been found guilty of misconduct in separate incidents and punished , but not fired on thursday , judge deborah a batts of united states district court in manhattan ruled that the troopers' case was without merit in her decision , judge batts cited many instances in which the three troopers had been cited for misconduct before the incident in mount vernon the judge also ruled that the three troopers had engaged in misconduct more serious than that of the five white troopers cited in the lawsuit in her decision , judge batts wrote , none of the white officers engaged in a violent altercation with local uniformed police in a public place were alleged to have directed obscene , sexist or foul language to other local uniformed police threatened the misuse of power against local police nor engaged in violent , tumultuous or combative behavior in a police station house while each of the white officers noted above may have brought discredit to the new york state police , judge batts added , none of them created a comparable level of friction between state troopers and a local police department a lawyer for one trooper said he disagreed with the decision we obviously felt that we had a viable case , said robert j valli jr who represented mr valle we felt that there was certainly discrimination occurring in the state police it s unfortunate that judge batts did n't see it that way mr valle died in the mid1990 s , but his estate continued the lawsuit mr valli said an appeal was unlikely according to findings of fact in earlier legal proceedings that were recounted by judge batts , the three troopers attended a party on dec 12 , 1992 , with other state police officers , then left for sue s rendezvous , a topless bar in mount vernon where they spent much of the night drinking an employee at the bar noticed that one of the offduty troopers had a concealed weapon a uniformed mount vernon police officer responded to a call from two offduty mount vernon detectives who were also at the bar that night when the uniformed officer approached the offduty troopers and asked mr valle to step outside , a fight broke out the hostilities continued at mount vernon police headquarters , where the troopers cursed the local officers and engaged in further aggressive and antagonistic behavior according to judge batts s decision at one point , mr petry threatened to take revenge on the mount vernon officers if he spotted them on state highways at another point , mr aguirre grabbed a mount vernon police sergeant by the arm and made obscene remarks to her
east rutherford , nj , april 24 the nickname mad dog was hung on john madden while he was growing up in governmentfunded housing projects in suburban toronto like most children in his north york neighborhood , madden dreamed of playing for the maple leafs what madden , the devils' secondyear forward , and his friends lacked in new equipment , they made do with imagination on friday afternoons after school , they would go scavenging in an adjoining neighborhood in search of abandoned furniture , picking and refashioning cushions into goalie pads for pickup hockey games none of us could afford to play net , said madden , whose father , john , was a truck driver and whose mother , lily , held two jobs , driving a school bus and working in a convenience store our parents had enough trouble getting us a pair of skates it was in ball hockey games that madden , who turns 27 on may 4 , earned the moniker to reflect his intense desire to succeed my buddies began to call me that when i was a kid because i worked so hard , madden said recently i was n't the most talented guy or the biggest guy but rather than be bothered by me the entire game , they chose me first it just kind of stuck with me madden , whose parents are divorced , bounced through five high schools before graduating i ran with the wrong crowd at times , he said my mom was worried she thought that maybe living in the country with my father , i could n't get in trouble on thursday , mad dog madden will try to cause problems for the maple leafs in game 1 of their eastern conference semifinal series at continental arena he compares his style of play to guerrilla warfare i just think it goes hand in hand , madden said with a shrug referring to his nickname devils coach larry robinson has no problems with madden s selfimage he is a little like a bull terrier in there , he said madden attended the university of michigan and played for red berenson , a hockey hall of famer madden cared more about playing hockey than studying , which concerned berenson , who had a lengthy nhl career madden left ann arbor one semester short of earning his degree in sports management madden , however , said he wanted to become a college coach after he retired madden , who was surprised when he was not drafted as an 18yearold , went on to have an outstanding college career , setting an ncaa record for shorthanded goals \( 23 \) as a junior , the 5foot11 , 172pound madden and the wolverines won the national championship in 1994 as a senior , he was firstteam allcentral collegiate athletic association and a west allamerican madden , who now plays at 195 , left michigan in anger after hearing some advice from berenson i did n't want to see john madden become a career minor leaguer , berenson said recently in a telephone interview i think he holds it against me that i advised him to hold a r sum together , just in case he did n't make it i told him there were no guarantees in hockey , so have a plan if you do n't make it where you want to go berenson said he gave all of his players the same advice but when madden found out that his teammate brendan morrison , a high draft pick by the devils and the hobey baker award winner their senior season , had not been given the same advice , madden and berenson had a falling out four years later berenson is still seeking to repair the relationship when you see him , tell him , 'your coach is not mad at you , ' berenson said every time i read something about him , it s almost like , 'i 'll show michigan' it s always like he s showing someone lou lamoriello , the devils' president and general manager , noticed madden while he was scouting morrison , whom the devils picked as the 39th pick over all in the 1993 draft the devils signed madden as a free agent in 1997 what john has is a character and a quality about him that he competes against himself , whether he uses a , b or c to motivate him , lamoriello said every time i went to see brendan , i came back liking john the way he played , his huge enthusiasm for the game i liked his intensity you could see it on his face , the way he did things madden had an outstanding rookie season he scored 16 goals , led the league in shorthanded goals with six and was an integral part of the devils' stanley cup drive this season madden improved his goal total to 23 , all of them coming either at even strength or on the penalty kill when he s got a growl on his face , or a snarl , it usually means he s getting himself ready to play , robinson said and when madden , whose face resembles a young james cagney , does something he does not like , he talks to himself or , rather , barks at himself , berates himself , chides himself in a team atmosphere , to be successful , you need different personalities , lamoriello said and he s the type of player you have to have on your team bobby holik , who centered a line with madden on his left and randy mckay on his right for most of the firstround victory over carolina , described madden as intense that s what gives him the edge , holik said every one of us needs a certain edge to perform he ca n't relax or dillydally he would n't be as effective if he did madden s job for the next couple of weeks will be to hound the maple leafs madden said today that he was looking forward to the matchup and to playing in front of his friends and family again madden earned leaguewide recognition last spring during the eastern conference semifinal series against the maple leafs madden scored the gamewinning goal in a pivotal game 5 and added an emptynet score in toronto in the decisive game 6 there are things left for madden , who signed a fouryear , 7 million contract during the offseason , to prove he would like a chance on the power play \( robinson says madden has carved a niche for himself on the penalty kill \) i really want to prove to myself that i can be one of the top twoway players in the league , said madden , who covets the selke award as the league s top defensive forward but what i really do n't want is to have the people who believed in me look dumb after taking a chance on me four years ago and then there is the little matter of what to do after the nhl they do n't know it yet , but i want to coach at the university of connecticut when my career s done , said madden , who has a home there he pondered what berenson had told him when he left school i guess i'm still making plans , madden said , allowing a small smile creep across his face photo a lean start made john madden hunger for success \( chang w lee the new york times \)
michael r bloomberg said yesterday that the reason he resigned from four private social and sports clubs in recent months was that he had been unable to persuade them to embrace greater diversity in membership i have urged the membership committees of the clubs to consider as many different applicants as they possibly can and to take an active stance in trying to make sure that they get as good a group of people as they can , but a diverse group of people , mr bloomberg said at a news conference in midtown manhattan he added , those clubs have a right to do what they want , but if i ca n't change them , and i choose to resign , then i have chosen to go elsewheres during a twomonth period beginning in april , his campaign aides have said , mr bloomberg submitted letters of resignation to four expensive clubs in manhattan and westchester county the harmonie club , the brook club , the racquet and tennis club and the century country club mr bloomberg s opponent in the republican primary , herman badillo , questioned mr bloomberg s reasons for leaving the organizations , saying his departure resembled mr bloomberg s decision last year to quit the democratic party because of the crowded democratic field in the mayoral race i guess his conscience needed a lot of revision in order to meet the test of this campaign , mr badillo said it is amazing that he did n't discover that he should n't belong to these clubs until he decided to run for mayor mr badillo also said that mr bloomberg s explanation for leaving the clubs seemed to run counter to his recent comment about discrimination mr bloomberg said last thursday during a campaign appearance on the upper west side that there is very little discrimination in the northeast region of the country , a comment mr bloomberg has repeated and defended since then he is a guy who says he does n't believe there is discrimination in new york city , and at the same time he belongs to these clubs that apparently do not accept blacks or latinos , mr badillo said at the news conference yesterday , mr bloomberg said he was not concerned that it might seem that he quit the clubs only because he was preparing to run for public office i try to do what is right , mr bloomberg said i have argued for a long time that you only make progress by going in and trying to change it i am a change agent and not a critic officials at three of the four clubs would not comment yesterday on mr bloomberg s remarks at the fourth , the harmonie club , an assistant manager said that none of the club s 1 , 200 members were black but that black guests frequently visited the club the assistant manager , david ariyaratana , who said he has worked at the harmonie for 31 years , said the club had formerly excluded women as members but never discriminated on the basis of race he said he was not aware of anything mr bloomberg had done to influence the policies of the membership committee
washington , oct 11 the fbi issued a warning this afternoon that there could be new terror attacks in the united states or abroad in the next several days the stark and urgent alert , based on new intelligence information , gave no information about the gravity or nature of the threat and did not indicate where or how an attack might occur certain information , while not specific as to target , gives the government reason to believe that there may be additional terrorist attacks within the united states and against us interests overseas over the next several days , the federal bureau of investigation said in recent days , senior counterintelligence officials have told the white house and congress in classified briefings that osama bin laden s terror network , al qaeda , presented a continuing threat fully capable of renewed attacks in the united states or overseas in the public statement today , the law enforcement agency said , the fbi has again alerted all local law enforcement to be on the highest alert , and we call on all people to immediately notify the fbi and local law enforcement of any unusual or suspicious activity the statement provided no additional information but a senior government official said the decision to issue the warning was made after the cia received information on wednesday about a planned attack the information came from a foreign source whom the agency had determined from experience to be credible the information has not been confirmed by other sources , and it did not include specifics about what would happen or where in the current environment , the official added , no one in the government was prepared to do anything but take it seriously since sept 11 , the fbi and the justice department have repeatedly warned of new terrorist attacks attorney general john ashcroft said two weeks ago that another attack was likely today s warning was the first , however , in which either agency had issued a warning of an attack within a specific period in this case , several days on tuesday a top aide to mr bin laden , sleiman abougheith , threatened more violence against americans , in a videotape delivered to a qatarbased television network tonight , president bush said at a news conference that the alert was justified and based on a general threat to the country i have urged our fellow americans to go about their lives , to fly on airplanes , to travel , to go to work , mr bush said but i also want to encourage them by telling them their government s on full alert and that alert put out today from the justice department was such an action senior law enforcement officials said the heightened threat assessment , given to the white house and congress in recent days , was based on intelligence gleaned from electronic eavesdropping , as well as evidence accumulated over the last week by the fbi , cia and foreign security agencies the information includes evidence of additional al qaeda cells in the united states and overseas that were unknown before the sept 11 attacks the officials said they believed that the hundreds of arrests of al qaeda followers in the united states and abroad had disrupted some plans for other attacks , but also ratcheted up concern that more al qaeda cells might continue to operate undetected documents made public in alexandria , va today revealed that on wednesday , a federal grand jury indicted a 32yearold saudi , khalid aldraibi , who was arrested on sept 11 near dulles international airport in washington the authorities said mr aldraibi had been driving a car with a flat tire and carrying flight manuals and several drivers licenses he was charged with lying in his visa application , and with claiming to the fbi that he was an american citizen federal investigators have been unsettled by the discovery that others identified as islamic militants took flighttraining courses in the united states and investigated cropdusting aircraft for purposes that remain unclear american law enforcement officials said the existence of al qaeda groups overseas suggested not only a threat abroad but also a threat in the united states , because of the investigators' determination that the hijackings were largely planned in germany and other european countries the investigation conducted around the world since sept 11 has resulted in a fundamentally altered conception among senior officials of what al qaeda is , how it operates and who guides its followers to commit terrorist acts the group was once thought of as a dangerous , but largely undisciplined , band of aggrieved islamic militants whose links to osama bin laden were mainly spiritual but senior counterterrorism officials said their investigation had produced a starkly different picture one senior investigator said the evidence assembled since sept 11 suggested that al qaeda had some characteristics comparable to a drug cartel or mafia family like members of crime organizations , al qaeda operatives rely on a secretive central hierarchy for money , manpower and managerial expertise in the case of the sept 11 attacks , investigators have uncovered evidence of a core group by reconstructing the movements of each of the 19 hijackers , concentrating on a few like mohamed atta , a central figure in the plot we keep getting a better picture of where the money is coming from and a better picture of who s in charge , one senior official said we keep trying to tie people back to ones we do n't know , but we have n't been able to take it all the way back yet witnesses and documents had placed mr atta , during the planning phase for the attacks , in germany , spain and the czech republic and possibly in afghanistan , where he had meetings with al qaeda lieutenants who appeared to have supplied him with financial support , logistical support , advice on false identity documents and personnel one senior law enforcement official said the government had not known much about al qaeda until after the east africa embassy bombings in 1998 their knowledge grew with painstaking slowness over the years , though it began to accelerate in october 2000 , after the attack on the navy destroyer cole since the sept 11 attacks , officials said , more than 500 arab immigrants had been arrested or detained , most on immigration charges that could result in their deportation but not in criminal charges mr aldraibi , the indicted saudi man , is accused of having made false statements to obtain an american visa last january from the united states embassy in riyadh , saudi arabia according to the indictment , mr aldraibi lied when he claimed in his visa application that he was coming to the united states for one month to visit his brother mr aldraibi s lawyer , drewry b hutcheson jr , acknowledged in an interview that mr aldraibi had no brother in the united states mr hutcheson said that mr aldraibi had insisted consistently that he had no connection with the sept 11 attacks and that he knew none of the 19 hijackers
for all but the grieving , the rescuers , the reporters at the scene , there s the sense of having been marginalized this past week people have been getting back to work , cautiously , and that is true in book publishing as elsewhere but nonetheless there s the feeling of cessation , abeyance , except for those publishers and literary agents who by circumstance had work at the ready that was precisely of the moment i received several books on afghanistan and islam yesterday from publishers , for instance it was a week in which it was nearly impossible to talk about books but books are the purveyors of information as well as literature , and it seems to me that the quicker publishing returns to normalcy the faster the agents start to balance their genuine distress for what has been lost with their solicitousness for what s happening to their authors' books the better it will be peter osnos , the publisher of publicaffairs , put it this way we are people who provide information , whose books are supposed to help , teach , comfort , and people who feel sheepish now in publishing should remind themselves that this is what we are meant to do i am thinking about this because tomorrow night the association of authors' representatives , the preeminent agents' group , with about 350 members , will celebrate its 10th anniversary at the hip and snappy w hotel at union square a case can be made that it s one thing to get back to work at this time , and quite another to party , but donald maass , president of the group , said , yes , we thought about canceling but decided that it would be better to go ahead , that it was best in this situation , since publishing is one of the most important things done in a free society , and we ca n't be cowed the dance as symbol well , why not \? publishing is a community , and in that populace the agent is the caretaker of the writer one agent told me that she received calls from every client they were genuinely concerned about my wellbeing she said once they knew i was all right , they wanted assurance that the person who takes care of them was n't weeping under her desk friendships abound between writers and agents and editors , and i was really touched by the calls every agent i spoke to had a similar experience , and despite their clich d reputation for rapaciousness , few were doing business as usual perhaps the most interesting thing about agenting is that it has n't actually changed that much in the 10 years since the organization was created \( there are at least as many agents who are n't members of the association \) agents are the betwixt of publishing they want this or that , and publishers say yes or no so an update of their thinking is a fairly good indicator of where publishing is at any moment between 1991 and 2001 there have not been a lot of new revenue streams for writers esther newberg , a leading agent and not a member of the association , said that perhaps one the more striking occurrences was one that did n't occur the revolution that has n't happened , ebooks , she said we all overreacted to them unlike movie agenting , which has roiled and bubbled , book agenting has been somewhat resistant to change , some would say , although it is true that agents are more crucial to their clients than ever before for one thing , the pinballing of editors from publishing house to publishing house means that the agent is often the only constant in the writer s professional life and the conglomeration of publishing means that there may be fewer customers who can write the checks that buy the writer s work it should be noted that there s a similar trend to merge in agenting , and there are perhaps fewer independent entrepreneurial startups now than in the past obviously there have been some changes in the last 10 years meredith g bernstein said that her fellow agents will now do more developing of projects , have ideas for a book s subject , not just sit back and wait for writers to come up with the ideas for their next book jean naggar , a former association president , added , we 've always been activists , but even more so now , putting together as many elements as possible , marketing , getting blurb quotes robert gottlieb , head of the trident media group , goes even further he sees the agent as both agent and manager as much as we are a literary agency , he said , we are also our authors' business manager , and we look after their intellectual property and we help our clients market their work we are franchise building none of this is particularly great for young writers , who will find it harder to get representation from agents so busy theresa park , a young agent at sanford j greenburger associates , said that more than ever , we can no longer take on clients indiscriminately we need to be more selective i spoke to several other young agents this week , and like nearly everyone else in their business , they were not quite ready for business yet generally , agents are holding back on submissions for instance , amy williams , at international creative management , said , unless a client has something that relates to an issue of the crisis , directly relates to what s going on , i feel more comfortable laying back a bit right now jay mandel at the william morris agency was a bit more personal i have to pace my way back into a normal work life , he said as much as i can i 'd like to focus on things that have nothing to do with the recent events then he added , every agent in town has some sort of submission out there he feels largely uncomfortable about right now but ms williams , mr mandel and ms park see their jobs as going beyond the traditional agent role of simply making the deal there s no entrance exam to becoming an agent anyone can put up a shingle what attracts people to it are the love of books and writers and the knowledge that if you have the right property to sell on any given day , any given agent , even the youngest , could strike it rich , could even make the biggest sale in the history of publishing from the oldest and most experienced to the youngest and newest , no matter how publishing has changed , there s that sense of excitement and adventure in the belief that the very next writer coming around the corner headed toward your office might be the next john grisham or j k rowling

according to his son , taylor practiced the process of oil painting as his most central form of inner meditation this approach caused him constantly and obsessively to rework each canvas , creating dense surfaces through which multiple layers of mysterious imagery may be glimpsed thus the painting was not an end in itself , but evidence of a process leading to spiritual insight many of the canvases seem to glow with radiant energy pure colors , squeezed directly from the tubes , animate forms that coalesce from multiple fragments one is reminded of alfonso ossorio s fusion of painterly opulence with symbolic content , but here the symbolism is more abstract , more oblique everything seems to be in flux , as if the artist deliberately left the images indistinct and ambiguous the paintings themselves are very beautiful , with the sensuous appeal unique to sculptural pigment but even those who are primarily attracted to the works' tangible delights will sense a deeper intent some feature iconic and totemic shapes such as mir or pollock might have imagined , but with a calmer , more balanced feeling some are ominous , with suggestions of human and animal presences struggling to emerge , while others joyously celebrate transcendence of the material realm 'winners 2001' smithtown township arts council , mills pond house , 660 rte 25a , st james through sept 30 \( 631 \) 8626575 four simultaneous oneperson exhibitions highlight work by the top prize winners of the arts council s most recent juried fine art and photography shows sue contessa , who took first place in fine art , is showing gridstructured paintings that straddle the dividing line between reason and emotion strictly organized according to formalist precepts , the boxlike compositions are overlaid with subtle layers of color and texture using acrylic paint , a medium not noted for its sensual appeal , ms contessa builds up surprisingly lively amalgams that she calls marked voids the series shows that , like jasper johns , she can invest basic image components with visual and tactile complexity the fine art runnerup , susan classen sullivan , makes sculptural installations that refer to passing time and disembodied experience they are more conceptual than concrete , although they pay homage to surrealism s carnality ceramic representations of body parts are the raw material for meditations on the cyclic nature of existence , as in then , now when , with its invitation to examine closely the maternal essence , and this little piggy went to market , an array of animated toes delicately dipping into a foot bath at the viewer s behest the firstplace winner in photography , paul cary goldberg , is showing oversize still lifes that emphasize the rich colors and appealing textures of pottery , old wood and plant forms foiled against an infinite depth of shadow , a wellworn cherry table top and an old pine crate support ripe fruit , flowers , seed pods and vessels that seem suspended in moments of maximum equilibrium mr goldberg s arrangements are sometimes too strictly colorcoordinated , but most of them are just flat out gorgeous in sepiatoned fantasy portraits , joy goldkind s costumed characters play roles that are at once strictly defined and elusive with soft focus , slow shutter speeds and multiple exposures , ms goldkind , the photography runnerup , deliberately confuses illusion and reality in a successful effort to suggest fictional narratives for her alluring actresses photos the red space , by charles w taylor , part of an exhibition at gallery rood in eastport the bayberry bush , by william merritt chase , gives impetus to works in an show at the parrish museum \( noel rowe \) lilacs , by paul cary goldberg , at an exhibition in st james
washington , oct 5 mike mansfield , who served as senate majority leader longer than anyone else and was instrumental in the 1960 s and 1970 s in the enactment of legislation on civil rights , social policy and foreign affairs that changed the course of the country , died today at walter reed army medical center he was 98 mr mansfield lived in washington and went to his office at goldman sachs group almost every weekday until last week , when he went into the hospital , said his assistant , barbara hickey a democrat from montana , mr mansfield was in the house of representatives for 10 years and in the senate for 24 , 16 of them as majority leader he left the senate in 1977 , ready to retire to montana but he was quickly named ambassador to japan , and he held that post for 10 years , also longer than anyone else in congress , where bombast and pomposity are common , mr mansfield was unusually modest and selfeffacing he s the most decent man i 've ever met in public life , said former senator hugh d scott jr of pennsylvania , who was the republican minority leader when mr mansfield retired as majority leader in japan , where he served both democratic and republican presidents , mr mansfield was a revered figure he did not hesitate to tell the japanese when he thought american patience was running out but he also spoke out when he thought americans had criticized japan unfairly a few days after his 95th birthday , in march 1998 , mr mansfield expressed in an interview his philosophy of moderation and accommodation , which characterized his career as a politician and as an envoy differences can be bridged , solutions can be found , concessions can be made , he said it s much better to take an inch than to take nothing at all i do n't believe that winning is everything , though it s very desirable i do n't think there s anything wrong in losing if you do it the right way at the time of the interview , mr mansfield was vigorous and informed , with a straight back , a quick step and a strong voice the week after his 95th birthday , he inaugurated a lecture series on leadership sponsored by the senate republican leader , trent lott of mississippi mr mansfield s distaste for partisan warfare often frustrated his more aggressive democratic colleagues in the senate , and his brand of leadership sometimes seemed ineffective compared with the strongarm style of his predecessor as majority leader , lyndon b johnson but after president john f kennedy was assassinated and vice president johnson became president , mr mansfield guided the senate toward passage of a spate of civil rights , health , education and antipoverty legislation that johnson called the great society his leadership was essential in the passage of the civil rights act of 1964 , which outlawed discrimination in all public accommodations , and the voting rights act of 1965 , which made possible the widespread participation of southern blacks in state and federal elections ross k baker , a political scientist at rutgers university , calls this period one of the golden ages of the us senate senator mansfield s legacy , professor baker said , is that he sapped the influence of the inner club of a few powerful senators and allowed the modern senate of equals to emerge the current senate majority leader , tom daschle of south dakota , said today , the senate never had a finer leader mr mansfield had strong personal views on many subjects , and he never hesitated to express them , even when he was at odds with presidents and many of his democratic colleagues this was especially true in the war in vietnam he supported the increasing united states involvement in vietnam in 1961 and 1962 , but became an implacable critic of the american position after the assassination of president ngo dinh diem of south vietnam in november 1963 year after year , he backed legislation to withdraw troops and stop the bombing in 1973 , he was a principal architect of the war powers act , which was designed to check the president s ability to commit american troops abroad without the consent of congress mr mansfield often said he was proudest of the central role he played in winning congressional approval of legislation that led , in 1971 , to ratification of the 26th amendment , which gave 18yearolds the right to vote throughout it all , he was remarkably taciturn , his statements often limited to yep , nope , maybe or ca n't say in the 1998 interview , mr mansfield said he worried about the political polarization that had developed in the country generally and in the senate especially i 've always felt , he said , that the true strength of the senate lay in the center , not on the right and not on the left , but with those people who could see both sides and were not so convicted of their own assumptions that they would n't listen to the other side less than a year after he retired from the senate , mr mansfield , at 74 , was named by president jimmy carter to be ambassador to japan in 1981 , when ronald reagan became president , mr mansfield began packing his belongings in the interview , he described what happened next
crime stories and other writings by dashiell hammett library of america , 35 some mystery lovers prefer raymond chandler , others dashiell hammett for the benighted latter , this chunky volume , a sequel to the omnibus of hammett s novels published by the library of america in 1999 , will serve as the stuff dreams are made on crime stories and other writings contains 24 stories and novellas , all but a few originally published in black mask , the incubator of hardboiled detective fiction invented by h l mencken and george jean nathan , though neither man cared to be publicly identified with so trashy a publication they did it for money , not love hammett s tales of detection are hard , spare and often surprisingly stiff , but his prose loosened up over time , and by 1929 he was capable of beginning fly paper with a sixword paragraph rich in laconic evocation it was a wandering daughter job still , most of his stories smell of the pulp they were originally printed on , and it is n't hard to see why he told his editor at knopf , i do n't think i want to do anything with them the best of hammett , such as it was , went into his novels one wonders , then , why the library of america chose to give the deluxe treatment to these faded exercises in what mencken called homicidal fiction some are fun , but none are classic , no matter how you define the word terry teachout
new york city transit puts a lot of faith in paperwork at times , it seems to have missed the whole computer revolution , or at least mistrusted it in fact , in a dusty file room in downtown brooklyn , there are boxes containing minutebyminute records of the daily movements of your subway line , going several back years all handwritten , on paper but in the weeks since sept 11 , weeks that have generated enough paperwork to wrap every subway car like a christmas gift , there are three pieces of paper that have survived consignment to the oblivion of a cardboard file box instead , they have been copied and copied again and passed around like soviet samizdat they were written by a 55yearold man named john b mcmahon , who works as a superintendent over several stations in manhattan the pages are dated and stamped , and start like any transit memo , heavy on military accuracy and acronyms , like fo for field office while at my office at 42nd street and 6th avenue at approximately 0900 hours , it begins , the fo notified me but as the memo continues , recounting mr mcmahon s journey on sept 11 from his office to the area around the world trade center , it quickly becomes apparent that it is something other than official correspondence it is the soliloquy of a man trying to figure out what happened to him that day in essence , it is a letter from mr mcmahon to himself that morning , he rushed downtown to get into the cortlandt street station on the n and r line to make sure that no passengers or transit employees remained inside the station when he found none , he went back up onto the street and , as debris began to rain down from the fires in the towers above him , he took refuge under a glass awning in front of the millenium hilton hotel at 9 58 am , he looked up he saw what appeared to be a ring of smoke form around the south tower except , he wrote , that this ring was coming downward there was a truck parked next to him , in front of a loading bay at cortlandt and church streets , and he dived between the truck and a rolldown door , grabbing onto the bottom of a wall instantly , he wrote there was an upward , vacuumtype of air movement , followed by a swoosh' of air and then nothing not a sound , but pitchdarkness with a powderlike substance covering every inch of the area it also filled my eyes , ears , face and mouth he struggled to breathe he scooped ash and dust from his mouth but as soon as he did , his mouth would fill up again he felt other people around him , and he remembers hearing himself and the others count off , signifying that they were still alive then , he wrote , the strangest thing happened while i was facing this wall , i turned my head slightly to the left because i saw two lights that were too big to be flashlights and there were no automobiles around although i thought i was losing my battle to breathe , i was comforted by the lights , which gave me a sense of peace we yelled , 'help , ' and joined hands , walking toward the lights the more we walked , the lighter it became , until finally i saw images of cars and people but as he emerged from the cloud of ash , he wrote , he looked around him and realized that he was not holding anyone s hand he was alone he has no idea what happened to the other people he still has no idea what the lights were , and no idea how he found his way out of the debris i'm a catholic , mr mcmahon said yesterday but i only go about once every five years i do n't know what that was that day i do n't know how to explain it somebody got me out , he said mr mcmahon wrote the memo to his boss on a yellow legal pad at the end of that week , sitting in his backyard in westbury on long island when his fianc e read it , she cried i wrote it , he said , because i had to get it off my chest the day it happened , as mr mcmahon recounted in the memo , he wandered until he came upon new york university downtown hospital , where nurses pulled him inside and checked his vital signs he rinsed out his mouth and took a shower then he had his fianc e buy him some new clothes at macy s so he could , as he wrote , finish out my day performing my duties he is taking some time off now , struggling with hearing loss and problems with his right eye , which was injured by the dust more than those ailments , he said , he is struggling with his own mind when i tell my psychiatrist , i know it all sounds crazy to him , but that s the way it happened , he says mr mcmahon s memo ends like thousands of others on a line by itself are the words for your information photo john b mcmahon s dramatic account of sept 11 , told in a memo to transit superiors , has been copied and passed among colleagues \( kevin p coughlin for the new york times \)

phoenix , nov 2 the day before the world series began , curt schilling dismissed the notion that the yankees were some supernaturally special team when you use the words mystique and aura , schilling , the arizona pitcher , said , those are dancers in a nightclub those are not things we concern ourselves with on the ball field after watching the yankees win two games in 25 hours after being one out away from losing each game , schilling was asked again what he thought about mystique and aura i did n't know they 'd make an appearance at yankee stadium , he said whatever it is that propels the yankees to these types of victories pure talent , opportunism or otherworldly elements they have , in the last six years , become the best team in baseball history maybe it would be wise to wait until the yankees won the series with a victory saturday night or sunday night , but even if they were to lose both games , the reputation they have forged would not be tarnished greatly the yankees have simply gone beyond other teams , including their ancestors , who won five and four world series in a row those teams became world series champions by winning four postseason games in each of their four championship seasons in the previous five years , the yankees have won 11 games they have beaten three teams , not just one they have gone an astounding 4412 in those games to learn the difference in the degree of difficulty , ask the atlanta braves despite a sportsrecord 10 straight division titles , the braves navigated the rocky shoals of the playoffs only once the other nine times the braves fell in one of the first two rounds before the world series or in the series itself in the last six years , the yankees have lost only one of 15 postseason series they are one victory from making that one of 16 it is a mindboggling record even more remarkable has been the way the yankees have won many of the games the last two at yankee stadium are only the latest example down by two runs with two outs in the ninth inning in each instance , the yankees struck with stunning swiftness and prevented the diamondbacks from flying home without the need of a plane we were one out away two times in a row , so we were two outs away from being world champs , arizona s mark grace said asked if the diamondbacks allowed themselves to think how easily they could have already won the world series , luis gonzalez said well , sure we were talking about it earlier but it did n't happen that s not the scenario that the movie script has writ out for us albie lopez , the losing pitcher in game 5 , has seen the yankees during the regular season as a pitcher for cleveland and tampa bay he said the yankees' victories in the last two games were surprising you 're very surprised because you 're not expecting something out of the ordinary , especially in the postseason , he said when something like that happens , it s out of the ordinary the yankees , however , have made winning ordinary they have become the masters of the onerun victory they won games 3 , 4 and 5 by one run each the first three of their four victories over the mets in last year s series were by a run each when they rallied in 1996 from a twogamestonone deficit , they beat the braves in games 6 and 7 by a run each are the yankees good enough to score just enough runs to win \? there s a reason why they 're fourtime world champions in the past five years , schilling said when they had to make plays and score runs , they did that s why we 're at where we 're at right now playing the yankees , grace said , has been educational having played these rascals , you realize why they 're so good in the american league , he said as the diamondbacks' general manager , joe garagiola jr has a different perspective from his players , but he sees the same attributes individually and as a team , he said , they have a belief that you never give away any outs , that until the other guys put 27 outs on the board , you 're still playing mystique , aura , tradition , ghosts , whatever you want to call it , it s a group of good players who i'm guessing do n't have to be told or reminded that you ca n't run the clock out in this game as long as there are still some lights on the scoreboard , you can win any game the yankees , garagiola added , do n't give up an atbat or do anything with indifference there s an intensity first to last , he said do you have to play perfectly to beat the yankees \? no do you have to be opportunistic \? yes the last couple of games we were n't sufficiently opportunistic we had opportunities to score more runs , but we did n't if you do n't , these guys are right there waiting for you the diamondbacks were happy to be leaving yankee stadium early this morning if i see this place again , it will be too soon this place is a tough place to win , grace said gonzalez said , they did some magical things here the last two nights they were happy to be going home and to have randy johnson pitching in game 6 i would look for another close game , grace said , and hopefully we can get that 27th out the diamondbacks have to hope that the yankees did n't invite mystique and aura to fly their charter here today photo yankees manager joe torre , at a news conference in phoenix , has presided over the franchise s latest amazing run in the world series \( agence francepresse \) \( pg s3 \) fans at yankee stadium for game 5 projected their winner well before a scott brosius homer \( barton silverman the new york times \) \( pg a1 \)
the new york metropolitan economy , so strong for so long , is finally beginning to show signs of strain from the national slowdown in new jersey , almost 7 , 000 jobs were lost in april , and the state s unemployment rate jumped to 42 percent from 38 percent the month before , according to data released yesterday in rockland county , ny , shoppers have cut back spending so much that the county fears a 10 million shortfall in sales tax collections and in new york city , hotel rooms are increasingly empty , and a rising number of workers are filing for unemployment insurance benefits surveys in the region show that optimism is waning among consumers and business executives none of this suggests that the economic sky is falling , but people in the new york area have more reason to worry we are now officially part of the national economic slowdown , said james w hughes , the dean of the bloustein school of planning and public policy at rutgers university a month ago , we were certainly impacted , but not fully embraced by the slowdown until now , the slowdown has been concentrated in areas with a lot of manufacturing unemployment has surged in michigan and illinois , for example in the new york city area , factories are scarce , which helps explain why unemployment here has not been rising april jobs data for new york state and new york city will not be released until tomorrow , and some economists think signs of a slowdown in employment may not show that soon but the weakness of new jersey s april results has made others more cautious about the outlook for new york we 've had two months of job declines on the national level , which means we might get a surprise in new york , said thomas j spitznas , an economist in mount vernon , ny we 're kind of at a critical point here more than half the 6 , 900 job losses in new jersey were in manufacturing , which dropped by 3 , 800 , the new jersey department of labor said construction jobs also fell by 1 , 900 but employment in the service sector also declined , by about 1 , 100 services a category that includes everything from store clerks to stockbrokers have been the strong point in the local economy until now in what may be a warning sign for new york city and its major industry , employment at brokerage firms fell by 500 that may not sound like much , but jobs at securities firms in new jersey have been rising steadily since late 1994 , as wall street moved clerical and other jobs to jersey city faced with a sullen stock market and reluctant corporate clients , investment companies like merrill lynch , morgan stanley and goldman sachs have announced big layoffs until now , however , the effects have not really shown up in the jobs data while some economists think that the weakness in manufacturing is spreading to services in general , others , like marc m goloven of j p morgan chase company , say most of what look like job losses in the service sector have been suffered by temporary workers who have been placed at manufacturing firms in new jersey in april , personnel suppliers accounted for 1 , 500 job losses new jersey officials preferred to emphasize the positive yesterday , noting that despite the 04 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate , new jersey s 42 percent jobless level remains below the national average of 45 percent the new jersey economy continues to perform well despite this upswing in the unemployment rate , said mark boyd , the state labor commissioner in fact , the meaning of much economic data remains murky , even to economists some are alarmed by the steep rise in weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance in new york , which are up by about 25 percent this year others say such claims have not proved to be useful indicators in new york city similarly , the new york state comptroller s office reports that collections of sales tax fell by 56 percent in april , compared with the previous year but analysts there are not sure if the decline comes from consumers keeping their wallets in their pockets , or from things like the elimination of the tax on clothing that costs less than 110 but in rockland county , government officials are convinced that the county s shortfall is caused by cautious consumers , said c scott vanderhoef , the county executive sales taxes , which account for more than 70 percent of the county s budget , have been rising by about 9 percent a year , mr vanderhoef said but though the county only budgeted a 65 percent rise this year , he added , collections are falling far short of that some businesspeople sense that the good times may have rolled away bob maguire , a secondgeneration car dealer in bordentown , nj , said his customers were increasingly interested in buying used cars rather than the more expensive new chevrolets and saturns he sells they realize they would like a new car , but a latemodel used car will meet their budgets , said mr maguire , who is president of the national automobile dealers association are his customers worried about their financial futures \? no , i do n't see worry , mr maguire said but people are not as expansive in outlook as they once were they 're not talking about going on a cruise or buying a new house
bangi , afghanistan , nov 18 foreign soldiers fighting for the taliban have begun killing their afghan taliban comrades in a desperate effort to hang on to the encircled city of kunduz , refugees and northern alliance soldiers here say foreign taliban soldiers , who have gathered in kunduz for what appears to be a last stand , have gunned down more than 400 afghan taliban soldiers trying to defect to the northern alliance , the refugees and the alliance soldiers said the 400 were killed in mass shootings late last week , refugees said , and were prompted in part by the defection of a local taliban commander to the northern alliance according to the reports , arab and pakistani soldiers with the taliban have also begun shooting young civilian men of the uzbek and tajik ethnic groups suspected of trying to escape to territory controlled by the northern alliance the foreigners came into the village and shot all the men , said muhammadullah , a 21yearold man who crossed into northern alliance territory today i saw this with my own eyes refugees fleeing kunduz , which has been surrounded by northern alliance forces since last week , said foreign taliban soldiers had executed more than 30 uzbeks and tajiks in incidents last week the reports , which are trickling in as refugees cross the front lines from kunduz , are sketchy and often secondhand , but they are largely consistent about the date , location and circumstances of the alleged attacks in the chaos of the fighting , none of the accounts could be confirmed even if the taliban carried out some of the killings , it is unclear whether the killers were foreign or afghan mr muhammadullah said he had seen foreign taliban soldiers gun down 25 men in his village , mullahkarim , on friday before they fired , he said , they were speaking a language i did not understand gen daoud khan , the commander of the northern alliance forces here , said today that his men had received nearly identical reports the general s account essentially matched the reports from the refugees , although general khan estimated that the number of afghan taliban killed by foreign fighters was about 125 , not more than 400 the taliban is breaking apart , general khan said in an interview at his headquarters in taliqan , about 30 miles from kunduz they are killing each other the arabs and pakistanis have decided that the afghans are not pure enough for them , and so they are killing them the allegations of mass killings follow reports that thousands of foreign taliban soldiers have seized control of kunduz from local taliban authorities refugees fleeing the city said the foreign fighters were occupying the major military and government posts in the city and had grown so distrustful of local taliban soldiers that they had blocked their access to many buildings and areas , including the front lines the refugees said the foreign fighters , whom they described as pakistanis , arabs , chinese and chechens , were vowing in speeches to fight to the death the foreigners often travel with translators , the refugees said , and have beaten and arrested hundreds of kunduz residents in the last week northern alliance commanders estimate that 20 , 000 taliban troops , about a third of them foreigners , are trapped in kunduz pentagon officials say the number of taliban troops in kunduz is probably closer to 3 , 000 either estimate would make the garrison in kunduz one of the largest concentrations of taliban fighters left in afghanistan the northern alliance says it has blocked every escape route the reports of the killings coincided with an intensifying campaign to encircle kunduz on the ground and bomb it from the air american b52 s and fighterbombers pummeled targets today in their heaviest strikes yet northern alliance fighters began inching forward , capturing the abandoned hamlet of amirabad just inside the no man s land between the lines as they prepare to mount an offensive on kunduz , northern alliance leaders are trying to persuade local taliban commanders in kunduz to defect so far , one has agreed to change sides it is the taliban s fear of more such defectors that appears to have prompted them to kill their own troops in the first of the reported killings , foreign taliban soldiers gunned down as many as 300 local taliban who were preparing to defect , several refugees said who arrived here today the refugees and the northern alliance leaders said the killings had occurred before sunrise on friday in the village of alchin , a frontline hamlet about three miles north of kunduz according to the accounts , the slain troops belonged to a commander named nizamuddin , a pashtun from kandahar an overwhelming majority of the taliban troops are pashtuns , so a defection by commander of that ethnic group with his men could provoke particular anger among hardline taliban leaders the refugees and northern alliance leaders said the foreign taliban fired a rocketpropelled grenade at a truck carrying fleeing afghan taliban as it neared the front line then , the refugees said , the foreign taliban sprayed the remaining group with machinegun fire although the refugees said the number killed totaled about 300 , northern alliance officials put the number at about 70 lal muhammad , 36 , an uzbek refugee , said he was preparing to sleep on the floor of a restaurant in kunduz on saturday night when a group of villagers from alchin arrived to tell the story they told us that the foreigners surrounded the locals and killed them , mr muhammad said the foreigners are terrified that the local taliban will defect to the northern alliance foreign taliban soldiers also killed dozens of afghan taliban soldiers on friday at the village of musazai near the kunduz airport , refugees and northern alliance soldiers said refugees fleeing kunduz said foreign taliban soldiers had gunned down 125 afghan taliban soldiers who had been stopped on their way to the front lines the foreign taliban soldiers seem to have decided that the local taliban were trying to defect when they tried to stop them , a fight began and the foreign taliban opened fire , the refugees said the reported killings at musazai occurred just after the northern alliance announced the defection of mirza muhammad nasri , a prominent taliban commander refugees and northern alliance officials say mr nasri s soninlaw , noor aga , was the commander of those killed at musazai abdul satar , 20 , who crossed the front lines today , said he was in the musazai neighborhood the day of the reported killings , and he said he had seen men carrying bodies away in trucks they told me the punjabis killed them , mr satar said , referring to people who come from a province of pakistan refugees also reported that foreign taliban soldiers had recently carried out two mass shootings of uzbek and tajik civilians in the village of mullahkarim , foreign taliban soldiers are said to have executed 25 tajik men on friday , when foreign taliban soldiers feared that the men were going to sneak across the front lines to fight for the other side mr muhammadullah said he could hear the attackers speaking in unfamiliar languages before they fired on the villagers everyone in the village is afraid of the foreigners , he said they all want to embrace the northern alliance another reported mass shooting unfolded at the village of actosh when foreign taliban soldiers allegedly gunned down seven young uzbek men suspected of preparing to fight for the northern alliance nasir muhammad , an uzbek who fled kunduz today , said he had heard the story from his brotherinlaw , abdullah , who lives in the village mr muhammad said he had left kunduz to save himself and his family from the carnage he thought was still coming the foreign fighters are afraid of the locals , mr muhammad said they know the people hate them photos northern alliance soldiers , left , followed the path of american

the decision last week by the us supreme court to stay out of yonkers s 20year desegregation battle turned out to be a victory for the national association for the advancement of colored people , a disappointment for the city s mayor and another confusing twist for parents of the city s 26 , 000 students the high court let stand a ruling that would encourage yonkers to favor minorities over others applying for affordable housing the city s mayor john spencer had favored a raceneutral approach i'm perplexed , he said i'm being told to go forth and judge people on the color of their skin none of this had any bearing , officially , on the fate of the other half of the naacp s lawsuit against yonkers , a muchanticipated settlement between the civil rights group and the city on how to improve the school performance of minority students but the mayor s reaction to the housing question showed just how tangled and emotionally fraught the entire matter has become it s all a part of the same case , but they 're two separate issues , he said in both instances our wishes are for the federal government to pack up and get the hell out of here because they 've failed since 1985 , the federal government has been overseeing a courtordered desegregation of yonkers s public housing and schools results have been uneven at best mayor spencer said he was still optimistic about soon coming to agreement with the naacp on ways to improve the schools educators are waiting anxiously when the parties settle the schools will get 40 million from the city and state , the first installment of a series of payments , money that is essential to pay teachers and staff through the year obviously , it behooves the naacp to get in the same mood of settlement , the mayor said then the children , maybe for the first time since 1986 , will start getting a good education joseph m pastore jr , a courtappointed monitor of the federal suit , appears to be of the same mind he said the major issues had already been resolved and that now only subtleties and nuances remained all sides will meet on dec 19 before judge leonard b sand at the federal courthouse in manhattan to discuss the housing portion of the case , but education issues will not be left out , mr pastore said if an agreement is reached the public could be invited to comment on it as early as january 2002 objectively , a person of reason would say this is easy and we should be able to resolve this , mr pastore said but there s so much baggage from the past when you 've been involved in this for 20 years there s some withdrawal anxiety it s tough to say 'there s a safety net it s time to let go'
as the diplomatic climate has decayed between washington and beijing in recent months , china has singled out one group of americans for particularly harsh treatment a lengthening list of chineseborn americans have been detained by china s state security ministry one of them has recently been charged with spying for taiwan , exposing him to a potentially lengthy prison term the reasons behind the detentions and charges are not clear none of these americans have been prominent critics of the chinese government , and prosecutions of american citizens by chinese security agencies have been rare since the korean war what is certain , however , is that the treatment of these americans risks further damaging relations and raises new doubts about whether beijing should be awarded the 2008 summer olympics most of the detained americans are scholars , but business people have also been held six american citizens have been detained for varying periods since last fall , along with a number of others holding permanent residency status in the united states among those still detained are dr gao zhan , a sociologist associated with american university in washington , and dr li shaomin , an american citizen who teaches marketing at the city university of hong kong both have been held since february this month , dr li was charged with espionage dr gao , a permanent resident of the united states , is accused of leaking state secrets and is being held incommunicado liu yaping , a businessman who lives in connecticut as a permanent resident , was arrested in inner mongolia in march he is also being held incommunicado and is reported to be suffering from severe health problems the state department has repeatedly called for fair legal treatment of all detained americans individual members of congress , like senator joseph lieberman of connecticut , have also spoken out on behalf of detained constituents china has complied with treaty requirements guaranteeing detained united states citizens regular access to american consular officials it has granted no such access to dr gao and other permanent residents since the days of pingpong diplomacy three decades ago , understanding between america and china has benefited from scholarly and business contacts in which chineseamericans have played a significant role if beijing s leaders are sincere in their expressed desire for continued good relations with washington , they will call a halt to this campaign of intimidation
kissidougou , guinea , feb 20 this country s border runs straight and true through the forest before dipping sharply inside sierra leone south of here that spit of land , known by the lovely name of parrot s beak , has become the focus of a widening war in west africa and home to what united nations officials describe as the world s worst refugee crisis parrot s beak begins where the borders of guinea , sierra leone and liberia intersect , as do conflicts in the three countries it has become the haven for as many as 140 , 000 refugees who have been pushed there by fighting in sierra leone and liberia recently , as fighting has spilled over the border into guinea , the atmosphere has grown less than welcoming for foreigners in a small country that already holds hundreds of thousands of people displaced by war and is wary of its region s contagious conflicts here the local guineans are angry with us , the guinean military is harassing us and the sierra leonean rebels are not too far away , said the rev aiah nyamia senessie , a refugee from sierra leone , in the massakoundou refugee camp , a few miles from here but if we get back to sierra leone , away from the rebelcontrolled areas , we can take care of ourselves many of the refugees have already gone to governmentcontrolled areas in sierra leone , traveling by boat after making their way to this country s capital , conakry but like mr senessie , a 45yearold protestant pastor , tens of thousands have settled in the camp at massakoundou , where the population has tripled to 30 , 000 walking through the camp of green and white tarpaulin tents , mr senessie said he had led his congregation through the forest for six days to arrive here the citizens were not kind to us , he said when the villagers saw us , they said we were rebels , so they gave us the wrong roads when we finally reached here , we were ambushed by soldiers who thought we were rebels two women even gave birth prematurely from the shock , even in the presence of children who were not mature enough to see such sights at the center of the region s instability , say western diplomats and united nations officials , stands one man , president charles taylor of liberia , who has been accused of stoking the conflicts to satisfy a rapacious appetite for the substance that has fueled other wars around africa diamonds a recent united nations report charges that liberia has used its place as the center for arms and diamond trafficking in the region to stir up the war in sierra leone president taylor is actively involved in fueling the violence in sierra leone , the report said as it detailed the links between him and sierra leone s rebels , who control some of that country s richest diamond mining areas the war in sierra leone is one of africa s cruelest , in which the rebel forces of the revolutionary united front have specialized in chopping off the arms of civilians , a gruesome tactic that has already been witnessed here the united nations security council is now considering sanctions against liberia for its support of the rebels and for its flouting of an embargo on arms imports west african nations have asked for a delay of at least two months in carrying out any sanctions to give mr taylor a chance to change his behavior by , for instance , cooperating in solving the refugee crisis under intense pressure to stop meddling in sierra leone , where a united nations peacekeeping force nearly collapsed last may , mr taylor , many believe , has now turned to guinea as a sanctuary for the sierra leone rebels , who have crossed the border here and attacked villages and diamond mining areas , continuing a pattern well established inside their own country for a decade last month , the president of guinea , lansana cont , accused mr taylor , as well as burkina faso s president , blaise compaor , of being behind the current conflict in guinea for the exploitation of guinea s wealth they have no other objective but exploitation , mr cont said in a national address although mr cont s government is itself repressive , it has earned the support of foreign powers , including the united states , in this conflict in a meeting this month with ruud lubbers , the united nations high commissioner for refugees , mr taylor pledged to establish a safe corridor through liberia for the refugees we now have a mechanism for measuring his compliance , mr lubbers said in an interview later in the coming three months , if we see more access to safe passage , stability in the region , no other attacks and incidents , he 'll get part of the credit if not , he 'll get blamed for it , too after the meeting , mr taylor denied that he was behind the current conflict in guinea there are no liberian soldiers fighting inside guinea , he said , none whatsoever we have had continued invasions from guinea few people in west africa believe his denials all the problems in west africa are from charles taylor , said eleanor mbriwa , 31 , a refugee who , like many in the massakoundou camp , is from sierra leone s kono district , the diamond center under rebel control you must tell him to cool down his temper here in town , the local guineans want the refugees out of their region , but shared their views on mr taylor
victor green s pride and wallet may have been dented , but he is still a jet green has been the jets' starting strong safety since early in the 1995 season , and last year he set career highs of 6 interceptions and 4 fumble recoveries over the years , only five jets kyle clifton , mo lewis , greg buttle , lance mehl and marty lyons have made more career tackles than green s 854 but two weeks ago , the jets signed damien robinson , a freeagent free safety from the tampa bay buccaneers , to a fiveyear , 10 million contract , and the addition of another highpaid safety seemed to put green s job in peril despite green s fine 2000 season , the jets , struggling to get under the national football league s salary cap , wanted him to take a pay cut green balked , then finally gave in general manager terry bradway said yesterday that green s contract situation had been resolved as bradway put it , victor did a good thing for the football team green was believed to have agreed to play for 1 million this season , a 50 percent pay cut , with a 2 million bonus if he is on the roster next march 1 bradway said talks were continuing with jumbo elliott , the 36yearold offensive tackle , who is in his 14th year last season , elliott played in 11 games , none as a starter he has said he is not sure if he wants to keep playing we expect jumbo to be here , bradway said he s under contract and he wants to play there is no problem he s been excused from minicamp because of family business we like what he brings to the football team we have to sit down with him and discuss his role bradway said he was talking to other veterans about redoing contracts because , he said , we still need to get under the cap to sign our draft picks he would not say how many veterans were involved or who they were , but he also said , it should n't be difficult bradway spoke after a preview of the jets' highlight video of the 2000 season , down to the wire jay cross , the team s new president , was also there and said discussions among the jets , new york state and new york city about a new manhattan stadium for the team were on hold we 're all gathering information , cross said i think the next step , and i ca n't say when it will occur , is to have the three of us put together a package it s not easy to define our proposal is to expand the jacob javits center north and south , doubling the size to accommodate nfl football and an olympic stadium
they are americans who feel dutybound by islam to obey american laws but some of them say that if their country called them to war against a muslim army , they might refuse to fight they cannot be shaken from the conviction that america is intrinsically antimuslim yet they see it as the one place where muslims are free to be themselves to be young and muslim in the united states today , to hear students at al noor school in brooklyn tell it , is to be both outsider and insider , to revel in both roles but see neither as the ideal it is to be consumed by causes abroad and removed from politics at home , to feel righteous and also confused , to alternate between gratitude and resentment toward the world outside their classrooms as any parent knows , this is the paradoxical planet inhabited by many teenagers , whether they are muslim or not but in a country wounded by terrorists and preparing for war , young muslim americans are finding that real life has raised especially acute questions for them about competing values of allegiance and faith we have a burden on us , said andira abudayeh , who is 16 and attends al noor we 're muslims , and we feel like other muslims around the world do and we 're americans in extended conversations last week , high school students at al noor spoke of their empathy for the young muslims around the world who profess hatred for america and americans , saying the hostility is an outgrowth of american support for israel they said they did not believe that the hatred extended to them muslims are all one , said fariah amin , who is also 16 they kind of think of us as just living in america the students complained that the united states threw its weight around too much in the world , but that it also was not active enough in support of what they called freedomseeking muslims in chechnya and the true muslims who oppose the rulers of saudi arabia and egypt is n't it ironic that the interests of america are always against what muslims want \? said fami fozi , a 17yearold student who said he would rather go to jail than fight in the united states army against muslims the students also said the koran , which muslims consider the literal word of god , provides a perfect blueprint for their lives their ideal society would follow islamic law and make no separation between religion and state in the meantime , they said , they want to become doctors and lawyers and teachers in the united states even though the american government uses taxes to finance things that are unislamic licensing the sale of alcoholic beverages , for example they said muslims here should pay taxes and accept the judgments of secular american courts if you want to survive in freedom , i guess you just have to pay taxes to get the benefits from america , said ahmad odetalla , 14 you know you 're not going to be the one who buys alcohol so as long as you stay away from what is forbidden in religion , i guess we have to pay taxes the students at al noor may not be a scientific sampling of muslim american youth but their comments are similar to those posted by muslim americans on the numerous internet chat rooms and message boards about islam , and their outlook is similar in some ways to that of other newcomers immigrants and their children often feel the strain between the adopted and the native culture their political interests may focus on the topics and debates in their homeland in the case of these al noor students , they are children of immigrants from places like pakistan , egypt , the occupied palestinian territories and yemen , which have been preoccupied for years by the efforts of islamic fundamentalist movements to gain power through violence or the ballot box still , some of their comments reflect what they have been reading and exposed to in the united states , where some muslim clerics say openly what is said underground in muslim countries that the united states is to blame for the ills of the muslim world through its support of more secular muslim rulers some of the students , for example , said they would support any leader who they decided was fighting for islam among those who do not fit that definition , they said , are the rulers of just about every arab and muslim country mr fozi , for instance , said that he would support any leader he determined to be an observant muslim who is fighting for an islamic cause , and that he would do so even if it meant abandoning the united states i would support him with my life , he said how would he know who is a true muslim \? i use my understanding of islam and see what the person is doing , mr fozi said several of the young men said they could fight against a muslim if they were convinced that the muslim had committed a crime they all said they were not convinced that osama bin laden or any muslim , for that matter was behind the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon , attacks that they condemned as violating all precepts of islam it comes down to the proof , said mazen kased , 17 if you prove a muslim did it , that s a different story another 17yearold student , ammar arif , agreed if you prove it s osama bin laden and i was in the army , i would go to fight , he said that s my duty to my country and my religion as well the students at al noor are reluctant to accept that the terror attacks were carried out by anyone of their religion they draw on their deeply felt belief that americans are biased against islam and muslims and that muslims are victims of a prejudiced news media like many muslim americans , they said they believed that nonmuslims did not understand them and their choices these are also children whose parents made a conscious decision by sending them to a private islamic school to shield them , at least during the school day , from the secularism of their adopted american culture girls at al noor must wear a loosefitting robe and a tightfitting scarf to cover their hair and necks except for the youngest children , boys and girls are separated during the school day they feel their separateness keenly since sept 11 , rumors have raced through the school that muslims have been shot and beaten in brooklyn , and that it is not safe to walk the streets because of revenge attacks by americans against muslims they believe the rumors which have not proven true because they said it fits with their experience of seeing negative images of islam in films and articles that they find disrespectful of islam a lot of newspapers write negative things , and we get so upset , said mona widdi , 16 but few students said they thought that newspapers should be forbidden to write things about islam , the prophet muhammad or the koran , topics that writers in most of the muslim world stay away from out of fear of offending muslim clerics america does have freedom of speech , and it s one of the basic things , miss amin said i was taught about it since kindergarten you ca n't tell someone that they ca n't write that but if they ca n't prove it , they should n't put it in the paper as some kind of hatred against us none of the students said they had experienced any harassment since sept 11 their school has received offers of guidance counselors from local hospitals , visits of support from state education officials , offers of interfaith exchanges from nearby catholic schools and a constant stream of calls offering assistance from political figures in brooklyn the principal , nidal abuasi , acknowledged that the students' assumption of a backlash might be misplaced maybe , he said , after recounting the number of calls from the neighborhood expressing good will , we are too paranoid photos fami fozi , left , would refuse to fight a muslim country is n't it ironic that the interests of america are always against what muslims want \? he said mazen kased is not convinced that muslims led the terrorist attacks from left , fariah amin , salam said and andira abudayeh , are juniors at al noor school , a private islamic academy in brooklyn \( photographs by andrea mohin the new york times \) \( pg b9 \)

white plains it was a quiet race to begin with andrew j spano , a popular incumbent with support from democrats and conservatives alike , seemed immune to the challenge by lawrence i horowitz , a political newcomer with little financial wherewithal and even less name recognition still , at the start of the westchester county executive s race , local issues concerning schools , affordable housing , traffic jams and airport curfews were raised and discussed then sept 11 struck and in a reversal of the familiar adage , all politics became global westchester residents suddenly wanted to know more about osama bin laden than about county tax cuts the campaigns of both mr spano , the democratic candidate , and mr horowitz , the republican , came to a halt postsept 11 , there has been no interest in the race none , mr horowitz , a lawyer from chappaqua , said the local paper has stopped writing about it i 've left messages for the league of women voters to see if they will schedule a debate they had n't even called me back it has been particularly hard to raise money and particularly hard to campaign this year because of the events of sept 11 mr spano agreed that this has been an odd campaign year now instead of doing my job and campaigning , i'm doing my job and concentrating on security stuff and campaigning , said mr spano , noting that he has had regular conversations with officials from the federal bureau of investigation and with the new homeland security office we 've got to look out for the power plant , the water quality , the airport and we 've been getting anthrax complaints then you get a call about the campaign you handle it because it s your job , but it s an annoyance now still , some observers say the distractions and the suspension of campaigning will have little impact on a race that neither party ever saw as much of a contest the county executive was a favorite to begin with , said anthony a cupaiuolo , professor of public administration at pace university he cut taxes he maintained a level of county services things are going well in the county a month s blackout in the campaign only makes it more difficult for his opponent to get out whatever message he wanted to get out , but i personally do n't think it would have made any difference in who is going to win it might impact turnout negatively , but that s it things are now gearing up in the final weeks of the campaign the league of women voters will hold a debate for candidates in all countywide races on thursday at 2 pm at pace graduate center on martine avenue in white plains news 12 westchester will also sponsor a debate between the candidates for county executive tomorrow at 7 pm the candidates say they are back on the campaign trail now with visits to train stations , fundraisers , candidate forums and parades mr horowitz , 50 , has not held public office before he lost a bid for newcastle town justice five years ago , and some speculate that by taking up the race for county executive mr horowitz hopes the republican party will back him for a more winnable race , like a judgeship but mr horowitz said he is a viable candidate in this race he meets commuters at metronorth stations and tells them that he favors a federal nofly zone around the indian point nuclearpower plant , that he wants to develop a stronger ethics code for county government and that he wants to reduce energy costs to county residents he said he has raised about 45 , 000 for his campaign mr spano , 65 , who is seeking his second fouryear term , previously served as county clerk he has raised about 13 million and said he planned to spend the money on television , radio and print ads , even though the race does not appear to be close the spano campaign wants voters to know that during his tenure mr spano acquired 2 , 500 acres of park land , reduced county taxes and tried to combat the digital divide by providing computers to needy students and the westchester library system we 're running a full campaign now , said dierdra gray , mr spano s cocampaign manager it s not as intense and hopefully candidates are kind but , hey , it s almost election day photos county executive andrew j spano , above , campaigns in white plains lawrence i horowitz , his opponent , takes his campaign to chappaqua \( photographs by george m gutierrez for the new york times \)
and with their game at yankee stadium last night , the minnesota twins and the yankees said adieu to each other for the season guess which team was delighted with that farewell \? the twins won the game with a 10inning , 54 decision , took the series two games to one and captured the season series four games to two , the first time they have won a season series from the yankees since 1992 the victory also gave the twins a 239 season record , the best ever for their first 32 games the hardest job that tom kelly , the dean of major league managers , seems to have with this astoundingly surprising team is making sure people on the periphery of the twins keep their start in perspective kelly , for example , was asked after the latest conquest of the yankees if there was any moral to be drawn from the 4of6 outcome i do n't know if there s any moral , he said i'm not smart enough for fairy tales the yankees are a formidable team to play and we enjoy playing them i wish we could come back here it would be good to play them later on in meaningful games in yankee stadium in the middle of the summer the twins wo n't be back in the middle of the summer if they play here again , it will have to be in the american league playoffs in october october \? did someone say october \? i do n't want to put the cart before the horse too much , the cautious kelly said we have n't run into them clevelands yet i 'd like to come back , i think i said , in the middle of the summer you know , i do n't get way out there on those limbs but if the twins were invited back in october \? i 'd gladly come , he said , the level of his voice rising i 'd be the first one off the bus , off the train , off the subway i 'd be the first one but we 're not going to get out there on that limb we got a ways to go before that whether it s july or october , kelly believes a second visit to new york would benefit his young team he s not interested in showing them the sights necessarily or taking them , at 100 a pop , to see the producers on broadway it would certainly help us to play this kind of game in this park more often , he said i think it would make the players better but there will be no july visit because none is scheduled that s my complaint about the schedule , kelly said i think it hurts my team , or any younger team , to not go to boston twice , not go to new york twice i think the environment is important to a young club we 're going to miss going to the big apple and boston twice under the scheduling format in effect from 1977 through last season , the yankees and the twins had two home series with each other the switch to an unbalanced schedule this year has reduced the number of games teams play outside their division and increased the number of games they play against division rivals i do n't care for it personally , kelly said if it s better for the game , ok maybe the yankees do n't want us coming in to yankee stadium twice maybe they 'd rather have boston eight , nine times but people in minnesota would like to see bernie williams and knobby and o'neill and mussina come to their town a couple times perhaps it s fortunate that the yankees do n't play at the metrodome again this season when they visited last week , some members of the normally respectful crowd made chuck knoblauch an object of derision , showering his leftfield area with such impromptu weapons as coins and bottles i'm sort of glad they do n't come to our park again after the embarrassing situation we had last time , said denny hocking , one of the more veteran members of the twins i hope that we do n't have to go through that again but to not come back here and play three more games in this park is a travesty it s great coming here the fans are tremendous it s baseball at its finest you know what you 're going to get on the field you know what you 're going to get in the stands the yankees did not figure on what they got on the field from the twins the past 11 days , but hocking figures the twins were fortunate to play the yankees at this point in the season everybody knows bernie s struggling , hocking , the ultimate utility player , said everybody knows jeter s not in midseason form i have n't seen david justice swing the bat like this in quite some time we 're fortunate , in fact , that we 're not getting these guys when they 're hot it could be a whole different story when these guys are hot maybe not playing them anymore this season will be a blessing in disguise october is another story hopefully , we 'll see them again in october , said catcher a j pierzynski , who doubled in the 10th inning against mariano rivera and scored the winning run on joe oliver s passed ball of course , it would be more fun this is a great place to play the atmosphere is just unbelievable the fans are so into the game they 're chanting guys names and giving guys curtain calls it s fun to watch it s fun to be a part of for some reason , the series was n't much fun for the yankees photo minnesota manager tom kelly does n't like the new schedule \( associated press \)
washington , oct 4 president bush announced today that the united states would try to deliver 320 million in food and medical supplies to help afghanistan s population survive the approaching winter the announcement appeared aimed at winning over the afghan people even as mr bush tries to undermine the taliban government and perhaps deal it a military blow for harboring osama bin laden hours later mr bush s national security adviser , condoleezza rice , promised a much broader american effort to contribute to the reconstruction of afghanistan once the taliban was replaced by a government that did not repress its people while american officials have stopped short of declaring the overthrow of the taliban an explicit goal of the administration , the president told a cheering crowd of state department employees today that the food aid is our way of saying that while we firmly and strongly oppose the taliban regime , we are friends of the afghan people he spoke as a senior american diplomat , richard haass , spent about an hour with afghanistan s exiled king , mohammad zahir shah , on the outskirts of rome officials would not comment on the meeting , but it represented the highestlevel american contact with the 86yearold deposed monarch , who may lead an alternative government if the taliban falls even as he announced the dispatch of relief supplies to suffering afghans , mr bush said that he would have no compassion for terrorists he added , nor will we have any compassion for any state that sponsors them some of the food will be delivered by air drops inside afghanistan , defense secretary donald h rumsfeld told reporters in cairo today there is no doubt in my mind that the military will conduct air drops , he said mr rumsfeld told reporters on his plane he had seen satellite photos of thousands of refugees crossing afghanistan it is a heartbreaking thing to see , he said in washington , rear adm craig quigley , the pentagon spokesman , said that aircraft carrying food to be dropped over the rugged territory would likely have escort planes that could fire on antiaircraft emplacements he raised the notion that some of the military action in afghanistan may come in the cause of getting food into the country generally speaking , we know the taliban have antiair capabilities , he said it s not at all clear what the specific capability of their systems is a senior military officer said that the air force could begin relief air drops within 24 to 48 hours , once ordered american c17 cargo jets could carry specially designed crates , designed to break up as they fall , dispersing smaller individually wrapped meals , the officer said while it is easier to drop food and other humanitarian goods in larger containers from lower altitudes , military commanders worry that they do not yet know how sophisticated the taliban s air defenses are and thus would only conduct highlevel drops if any for now in london , the british prime minister , tony blair , also stressed the need to minimize the suffering of the approximately 23 million people living in afghanistan i believe the humanitarian coalition to help the people of afghanistan to be as vital as any military action itself , he told parliament today the air drops would provide only a small portion of the food and medical aid that the administration plans to get into afghanistan by a variety of methods the operation will include thousands of mules that are already trekking over the mountain paths from tajikistan , c130 aircraft operated by the united nations world food program that may land on afghan airstrips not controlled by taliban forces and commercial trucks which will drive in from pakistan and iran the food will come in white plastic bags emblazoned with the american flag and gift of the united states inscribed on them in local languages the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the international committee of the red cross , the two main agencies being financed by the administration , received permission last week from the iranian government to conduct a crossborder operation , officials said mr blair told parliament that the first flight of relief supplies , including tents donated by the british government , arrived in iran on wednesday other aid would go to afghan refugees in pakistan , where two million refugees are crammed into camps , and to refugees in iran , where there are 15 million refugees from afghanistan , most of them in border areas but the emphasis will be on delivering aid directly to afghanistan , where famine conditions have existed since earlier this year mr bush spoke today of helping the poor souls in afghanistan , where the population suffers from the highest infant mortality rate in the world air drops are notoriously inefficient for getting food into the hands of those who need it the food often scatters on impact on the ground , and frequently ends up in the wrong hands but administration officials said there were psychological benefits to dropping bags of food , because under the harsh rule of the taliban and four years of drought conditions have become steadily more bleak the administrator of the united states agency for international development , andrew natsios , asserted that the taliban was remarkably unpopular and suggested that the sudden infusion of supplies from the united states would make them even more unpopular mr natsios , who before joining the bush administration organized relief efforts for some of the toughest places in africa , including somalia and sudan , scoffed at the idea that the taliban could benefit from american largess it s not a government , he said they do n't have civil administrators in contrast , he said , the international aid organizations employed talented afghan medics and other workers who were experienced from decades of distributing aid in afghanistan western aid workers who left afghanistan after sept 11 paid their local staff three or four months' salary before departing and these people were ready to receive and distribute the food , mr natsios said some of the food would be sold to merchants who would truck it into afghanistan for sale in markets to the remnants of the afghan middle class , he said mr bush is using the food donations to underscore his argument that he is not waging war on islam , only on terrorism this is not a war between our world and their world , he said it s a war to save the world and people now understand that mr bush also met in the oval office with vicente fox , the president of mexico , who came under some fire at home for saying relatively little after the sept 11 attacks today he promised mr bush that we are a friend , we are neighbors , we are partners , and we want to make very clear that this means commitment all the way , and that we will keep our commitments but he said nothing about making any military contributions , and mr bush has asked for none in coming months , though , mr bush s crackdown on terrorism could well interfere with his earlier plans to open the border to more mexican immigration , and to work out a guest worker program that might legalize the status of some illegal mexican immigrants here congress was suspicious of those plans before sept 11 now , the sentiment is turning toward tightening canadian and mexican border crossings , rather than opening them photo president bush and secretary of state colin l powell outside the white house yesterday after meeting with state department

walter szeezil has driven two days from st petersburg , fla , with his golden retriever , thunder he discovered recently that the dog had bone cancer , and his veterinarian had offered little hope bill and diane buckley have driven 300 miles from their home in new hampshire with their irish setter , elvis , for a checkup they make the trips to the smith ridge veterinary center in vista , where dr martin goldstein specializes in holistic veterinary techniques the doctor , who likes to be referred to as dr marty , uses unorthodox methods , including herbal supplements , acupuncture , ozone treatment and cryogenic surgery , and he specializes in hopeless cases , particularly those involving cancer dr goldstein , who graduated from cornell veterinary school , estimated that he has seen more than 100 , 000 cases since he began his practice in 1974 he has treated chevy chase s golden retriever for bone cancer , and has worked with pets belonging to george carlin , garry shandling and michael keaton dr goldstein s 1999 book , the nature of animal healing , which outlines his philosophies and practices , has sold about 50 , 000 copies , he said i'm definitely a household word out there , said dr goldstein , who does not specialize in humility the doctor s holistic philosophy which he developed with his brother \( also a veterinarian \) in the mid1970 s after trying it on himself entails healing the entire body , not treating a specific ailment if you are a mechanic , and the car is producing black smoke , you want to fix the engine , not the tailpipe , he explained he focuses on balancing metabolic levels and takes blood tests from most patients we take blood from anything that moves , dr goldstein said from the blood tests , the doctor establishes the pet s nutritional needs for the last six months he has sold a powder that includes all a pet s needed supplements the irish setter , elvis , for example , has been given a powder containing poly mva , a nutritional supplement that affects the replication of cancer cells adrenal , which reduces stress and inflammation liver glandular , vitamin a and vitamin c cellular forte , a rice bran derivative that enhances immunity and astragalus 10 , a chinese immunesupportive herbal combination the supplements cost from 20 to 160 a month , but the doctor argues that clients save money in the long run because their pets are healthier i think we made the right choice by bringing elvis here , said mrs buckley , who was first wary of making the visit to dr goldstein s practice his quality of life has improved since day 1 other techniques used at smith ridge include acupuncture , to relieve muscle and joint pain ozone treatment , in which oxygen is injected into the animal s body to help spur the development of healthy cells and cryogenic surgery , in which things like warts or tumors are frozen , then recognized by the body as foreign and expelled dr goldstein also discourages giving pets traditional pet food , which he claims is responsible for high cancer rates he sells his own food , consisting of choppedup chicken or beef and raw vegetables , which is frozen and shipped to pet owners another cancer culprit , he said , is the overadministration of vaccines , which introduce harmful toxins and diseases into the body he rarely recommends their use his methods have brought some impressive turnarounds , and he is quick to show scrapbooks of animals that have come back from the edge of death yet he has his critics in the profession when we first started practicing it was mostly ridicule , snide remarks , dr goldstein said 'the goldsteins have lost their minds , ' things like that veterinarians i would consider friends turned against us because we became 'crazy' when he began practicing acupuncture on pets in the mid70 s , he remembers , it was like i was practicing voodoo the doubts continue several colleagues criticize him for the lack of scientific backing for his techniques he has succeeded very well in his area , said dr gregory k ogilvie , head of medical oncology at the veterinary teaching hospital at colorado state university however , if you actually look if there is any documented proof of what he does works , there is none local doctors have criticized dr goldstein s reliance on untested products , and some have been offended by his attacks on conventional practices dr goldstein responds that he lacks the time and the money to scientifically test his approach , but that the results speak for themselves he said he was negotiating with the university of pennsylvania veterinary school to document his future cases scientifically , but dr allen schoen , adjunct professor of veterinary medicine at tufts university who owns a practice in sherman , conn , said , he s been saying that for years now nonetheless , dr goldstein remains enthusiastic about his techniques , and about holistic \( also known as alternative and integrative \) veterinary medicine in general people are starting to come around , he said , pointing to the popularity of his practice , to a positive review of his book in the journal of the american veterinary medical association and to the fact that many veterinarians around the country are starting to adopt alternative methods more than half of veterinarian schools in the united states teach some form of alternative medicine , dr schoen said , and the american holistic veterinary medical association , the leading organization for such practices , lists well over 500 veterinarians as members all this fuss over animal health may lead one to wonder if pets deserve such royal treatment there s no question for dr goldstein i think pets are better than humans , he said , in a tone that was only a little sarcastic they represent for us a level of unrequited love dr goldstein s practice , which has 24 employees , is growing the old office was just replaced by a new one down the road , which consists of three buildings with more than 2 , 900 square feet of space , with plans to link the buildings with covered walkways the doctor said he works so much that he rarely gets more than four hours of sleep a night , and because of the practice s popularity , he said he has to turn away more than 90 pets a month because of limited time and resources , he said , he now has time only for the most serious cases would you ask bill gates to fix your computer \? he said photos elvis , an irish setter , held by his owner , bill buckley , with diane buckley watching , is being treated by dr martin goldstein , who specializes in holistic veterinary techniques the buckleys drove 300 miles from their home in new hampshire to vista for dr goldstein to treat elvis \( photographs by janet

paris , march 13 western european countries have chosen to deal with footandmouth disease largely by slaughter and cremation during rare outbreaks rather than by inoculating animals against it , as have many other countries , including some in eastern europe most of the time , western europe , like the united states , remains disease free by monitoring imports of animals and meat products none are allowed from countries that cannot be certified as disease free the disadvantage of inoculations is that standard antibody tests cannot distinguish between the antibodies created in a diseased animal and antibodies created in an inoculated one newer tests can , but they have not been widely distributed under the authorized approach for an outbreak in western europe in the last decade , all infected animals and others that might have come in contact with them must be killed and their carcasses burned , veterinary officials say in a europewide outbreak , the slaughter would run into hundreds of thousands of animals already more than 200 , 000 have been killed in britain and france the alternative is that europe s herds of cattle , sheep and pigs tens of millions of animals would become useless commercially the disease kills young animals and causes adult ones to lose their appetites , drop weight , give less milk and abort spontaneously it is considered unlikely that consumers would buy the meat , even if it is declared safe some british scientists have argued that killing huge numbers of animals is senseless because between 80 and 95 percent will survive the disease some argue for returning to the pre1991 practice in some places in europe of inoculating herds around quarantined ones asked about this , jean glavany , france s agriculture minister , said recently that french farming was so fragile that we cannot take the risk of exposing it to an extra epidemic the measures taken , he said , may seem draconian , but they follow the principle of prevention vaccinations , he said , are a last step we sadly have n't excluded , but we 're not there yet
in 480 bc , near salamis off the coast of greece , an armada of perhaps a thousand persian ships attacked some 300 greek vessels this was , as the military historian and classicist victor davis hanson writes in this provocative book , one of the most deadly battles in the entire history of naval warfare lured by a brilliant greek strategy through the narrow straits , and rammed by greek ships , hundreds of persian vessels were sunk more than 40 , 000 persian soldiers were drowned or killed but mr hanson , who teaches at california state university in fresno , says this battle is more than just a textbook example of warfare herodotus pointed out that many of the persian fighters were mercenaries or slaves any soldierly hesitation was typically punished by beheading free citizens , herodotus argued , made better warriors more motivated and more flexible the greeks were fighting , as aeschylus pointed out , for their freedom the persians , out of fear or greed for mr hanson , these differences were not only evident at salamis mr hanson also examines nine battles extending over 2 , 500 years , including the defeat of the romans by hannibal in 216 bc the battle between christians and muslems at lepanto in 1571 the massacre of the british by the zulus in 1879 and the confusion of the 1968 tet offensive of the vietnam war in his view , the distinctive characteristics of western culture ran through each of these battles western armies tended to rely on warriors who were not mercenaries but free citizens with something personal at stake the mixture of discipline and autonomy led to a particular style of engagement unlike the persians , the aztecs , the zulus , the ottomans and the japanese , who brutally enforced absolute obedience , western fighters have been relatively free to react to shifting events this flexibility helped determine the american victory in the bloody battles against japan at midway in world war ii , mr hanson says it also permitted debate before , during and after battles , debate that has given western accounts of military history extraordinary variety and authority in addition , individualism and innovation , partly spurred by economies freer than those of opponents , led to the invention of weapons that have been adopted by every major military force in the world in many of these battles , of course , western culture could also contribute to its own defeat hannibal and his motley army took advantage of what mr hanson characterizes as western assault strategy to kill 50 , 000 roman soldiers in 216 bc in vietnam , the tet offensive was widely considered a western defeat \( a mistaken judgment , in mr hanson s view \) , partly because american planners completely ignored the tenets of the entire western military heritage the western tradition of dissent , he suggests , also overwhelmed that heritage but mr hanson asserts that in the west , defeats have not been final they have led to introspective revision rome rose again the experience of vietnam led to decades of analysis in his interpretation , mr hanson combines two visions of the west that have themselves been at war during the last 30 years the celebration of the west for its democratic vision of human liberty , and the condemnation of the west for militarism and imperialism the tendency is to see these positions as incompatible mr hanson argues that the reverse is true they are inseparable democratic ideals have led to greater military power adherence to structures of constitutional government , capitalism , freedom of religious and political association , free speech and intellectual tolerance , he says , has produced a soldier who can kill like none other on the planet these characteristics have made war between western countries among the bloodiest , but have also led to the triumph of the west in making this argument , mr hanson joins a group of scholars who do not explain western dominance as a result of modern imperialism jared diamond \( in guns , germs , and steel \) sees geography and environment as the primary influences on the development of western technology and power david s landes \( in the wealth and poverty of nations \) argues that differences in cultural values and social organization made the difference mr hanson disagrees with mr diamond but amplifies mr landes s argument , suggesting that culture , however admirable , creates a very deadly reality in the outcomes of war the west , he writes , possesses a weighty and sometimes ominous heritage in which its manner of war ideally serves , rather than buries , our civilization military historians will have to analyze mr hanson s accounts indeed , not everything is convincing in his generalizations mr hanson also does not successfully address the nature of modern guerilla warfare , the nature of islamic triumphs , the wide variations among western nations or the ways in which western strategic style grows out of western culture but after sept 11 , other issues come to mind while reading the book even applying mr hanson s interpretation , the culture of western warfare is being tested against a very different kind of opponent certainly , western individualism and improvisation could remain important his view of western military technique could arguably be found in october s swift frontal assaults of air power on specific targets and disagreements about strategy among the leaders of the war hidden or forbidden in many other societies have already become the subject of public debate yet given the international reach of the enemy , its networked cells , the absence of a traditional battlefield and the resilience of terrorist passions , that military heritage may be challenged both the defense department and the rand corporation have already called for a structural revision of the military by creating decentralized networks better prepared for new forms of battle it may be that in this case not only will western culture influence styles of war , but styles of war will also begin to transform western culture carnage and culture landmark battles in the rise of western power by victor davis

budapest when communism expired in hungary a dozen years ago , the art world eyed the changes with mixed feelings on the one hand , a more open society was going to eliminate bureaucratic controls and nurture a dialogue with the west on the other , it would enable the market to throw art into the hands of profithungry dealers and newrich collectors the situation has turned out to be more complicated , of course , but strong , independent art institutions are still a rarity and old habits die hard art museums are a good indication of how far the country has come the museum is the yardstick against which cultural achievement is measured these days and with buzzwords like cultural tourism and bilbao effect calling them to action , many central and eastern european cities have entered the museumbuilding race vienna s justopened 125 million arts complex , the museumsquartier , contains no fewer than three museums devoted to visual art trophy institutions are sprouting everywhere , from jean nouvel s kunsthaus in lucerne , switzerland , to the functionalist exhibition palace of the center for modern and contemporary art in prague , not to mention berlin s many new and revived museums hungary , a frontrunner for acceptance into the european union , does not wish to be left behind two art museums are currently in the works for budapest but in a fastchanging country that s still learning to sort out public and private interests , the new projects present an emblematic mix of noble ideals and slippery realities playing by the rules is hard to do , especially where the rules are up for grabs in the scrappy industrial neighborhood of ujpest , a privately financed museum of contemporary art is set to open in late september it is the brainchild of lajos kovats , a 48yearold art dealer and collector two years ago , mr kovats convinced marton winkler , an americanhungarian leather merchant and fellow art collector , to donate two buildings in his 19thcentury tannery complex to the project together the men are loaning 150 works from their private holdings to the venture and have sunk 700 , 000 into renovations they 're calling it the meocontemporary art collection \( meo stands for quality control department in hungarian , but its nostalgically ironic edge is lost in the translation \) where leather was once treated with steam rising from giant vats of boiling water , multimedia exhibitions will soon receive paying visitors a third and smaller structure , a sleek minimalist entry hall designed by istvan benyei of the inarchi architecture studio , will be clad in hightech luminescent panels mr kovats plans to adopt western models of museum management at the 30 , 000squarefoot facility flexible opening hours a skeleton staff instead of the usual clusters of idle gallery attendants volunteer adjuncts educational and membership programs and the naming of rooms after private donors he will also buy and sell inventory as the need arises this wo n't be another state morgue of a museum , he promised the saatchi approach appeals to me , he said , referring to the british advertising magnate and supercollector charles saatchi , who likewise buys and sells young artists' work in bulk and operates his own kunsthallestyle art showcase , the saatchi gallery , in london like his role model , mr kovats is not afraid to blur the lines between commerce and curatorship inside the entry hall , a few steps from the museum s shop and cafe , he has taken the unusual step of installing a branch of his blitz gallery , where works made by some of the artists exhibited in the museum will be presented for sale conveniently , mr kovats represents them as their dealer on the art market mr kovats and his colleagues are not worried by the potential conflict of interest right now , in hungary , nobody cares , said barnabas bencsik , the 37yearold curator charged with organizing the collection and playing host to traveling international exhibits that consideration does n't enter into the thinking here karoly szaloky , who until recently served as managing director on the project and who also owns three budapest galleries , said if this crazy man is willing to spend his own money on a museum , you must give him a break for moving his gallery in there it s a forgivable sin perhaps but the amalgamation of museum and art gallery might create an all too powerful center of gravity within the budapest art world in this nascent phase of the art market s development , it sends a confusing message about what makes the selling of art different from its validation in museumlike settings mr kovats is free to run his private institution as he likes , of course but complicating matters further is the issue of public financing although the collection is not registered as an art museum under hungary s public collection laws \( mr kovats found the regulations including a ban on the sale of works from the collection far too restrictive \) , its managers will nevertheless lobby the government for operating support , claiming that this nonprofit institution provides an educational service are they trying to have it both ways \? mr kovats is pragmatic look , we do n't have people in this country yet who are willing to say , 'take this money and build a museum' in his view , this transitional moment calls for compromise

' jones said yesterday from philadelphia , on a joint call with walton walton , as if spitting out pits , said , he s a gunning guard jones said he thought he was a shooter when i first met him so bill sets his record for most field goals in the ncaa final , but they were all layups wooden never let him two feet from the basket , and he came to the pros and said he had to shoot it was the ugliest thing he said , 'give me the ball , ' and it went 'clank' they developed a friendship on a trail blazer team riven by infighting steve jones saved my life , walton said i came in as the highestpaid player in team sports and the quality of my life went down because of the selfishness and greediness from players interested only in their own publicity it just blew me away steve jones taught me how to be a professional unfortunately , as steve and coach wooden are so quick to point out , i'm the slowest learner they ever saw after a year as portland teammates , jones retired to call games for the blazers , and walton led the team the next season to the nba championship but walton was still afflicted with a severe stutter , which did not prevent jones from interviewing him he was my worst interview , jones said steve would ask a question , answer it , ask another , answer it , then say , 'thanks for the time , bill , ' walton said he was still stuck on 'the , ' jones said usually , they are at philosophical war one raises a point , the other tries to squash it walton frequently \( and eagerly \) saws off the very limb he is balanced on , easing jones s work a hard foul by the bucks' darvin ham on wednesday led to this exchange breen was that one close to a flagrant foul \? walton no , he had his chest on him arguably , it was n't even a foul breen now you 're losing your credibility jones credibility is something bill s never been concerned with when walton , jones and their designated referee \( breen , tom hammond , or in the past , greg gumbel \) click , they embody how a threeman crew should work if the middleman does n't understand us , it s not going to work , jones said he has to understand that steve is always wrong , walton added when i do n't do a game with steve , i put a picture of him with that big afro and beard from the 70 s and that dazed and confused look next to me during game 5 , they debated the logic of philadelphia s allen iverson hoisting shots willynilly , ending the night at 5 for 27 jones remember , bill , it s not how many shots you take , it s how many you make so somebody has to make shots for philadelphia walton i could n't disagree with you more it s about how many you take they continued their colloquy yesterday , as walton said steve argues that if you make 5 of 6 shots , it s more effective than taking 100 and making 6 it comes down to how many shots you jack up none of this backing up and waiting to shoot that was heresy to jones , a former shooting guard , whose brother , nick , played for golden state you need guys to make shots or ervin johnson will shoot all the time , he said what kind of a coach lets guys shoot all the time \? walton read from the game s stat sheet a missed shot for allen iverson is the same as a basket for the sixers , he said , referring to the sixers' strong rebounding he takes 27 shots and makes 5 , yet he has a better game than glenn robinson or sam cassell , who went 7 for 18 jones said if he 'd said that in the fourth quarter , there would have been a violent disagreement al stunk up the joint , but his team courteously bailed him out game 6 tonight \( or if there is a game 7 on sunday \) could be the finale for the team of jones and walton , if walton replaces doug collins as the lead nba analyst if so , they will have to feud by long distance , which evidently will not reduce the affection between them i love him , walton said i tell him that on a daily basis jones said , he s definitely burned some brain cells

for a man who takes pride in ducking celebrity , the architect james stewart polshek has become awfully famous lately he drew attention in 1999 and 2000 with the opening of the halls of the rose center for earth and space , the imposing orbinacube he designed for the american museum of natural history and his name has been coming up ever since , most notably last month with the unveiling of his site design for the william jefferson clinton presidential center , mr clinton s new library in little rock , ark and that s not all from the redesign of the brooklyn museum of art s main entrance to the new theater now being built beneath carnegie hall , from the rescue of symphony space on broadway at 95th street to scandinavia house , the sleek shrine to nordic culture on park avenue , the polshek partnership , made up of mr polshek and six partners , has tackled a series of important projects that have caught the public s eye earlier this month , two of mr polshek s recently completed buildings , the queens borough public library branch in flushing and the new york times printing plant in college point , queens , were among the 30 winners of national awards given by the american institute of architects such fame makes mr polshek , 70 , mildly uncomfortable and slightly amused he is not an overly modest man , but in an interview at his greenwich village office , he said he was taught by his father , a politically progressive businessman from akron , ohio , to avoid attracting too much attention i had it drummed into me from an early age that personalizing everything was not a good thing , he said besides , i do n't think that kind of commoditydriven system makes for the most productive architecture as mr polshek sees it , his work has been more unknown than underappreciated , a reaction that has never particularly bothered him it is perverse , in a way , to be doing something that is very public and have nothing known of the personality , he said but all that changed since the rose thing the rose center gave mr polshek the one element missing from his portfolio a critical hit in the middle of manhattan , where it could not fail to attract publicity he has designed several other new york buildings , including washington court in greenwich village 500 park avenue , the tower addition to the former pepsicola building at 59th street and the small seamen s church institute in the south street seaport historic district , but none with the star quality of the rose center mr polshek , dean of the columbia university school of architecture , planning and preservation from 1972 to 1987 , had a solid reputation among his peers , but their praise was sometimes faint critics described him as overly cautious , a stick in the mud rather than a groundbreaker , whose buildings veered to the conventional , even the cliched mr polshek , whose work falls into the category of baseline modern , said herbert muschamp , the architecture critic of the new york times , never had the flamboyance of a frank o gehry or a richard meier but with his recent projects , he has emerged as the tortoise winning a race with the hares jim polshek is an architect whose work actually gets better , said michael sorkin , an architect and director of the graduate program in urban design at city university of new york having finally sloughed off the dreary postmodern vibe , his office is now producing crisp , modernist work that looks great , refined and elegant qualities we all like to think of as quintessentially new yorkish it was the city s new planetarium , begun as a doodle on a paper napkin six years ago , that sent mr polshek s reputation into a new orbit jim was able to achieve a spectacular design while creating architecture in the service of science and in the service of education , said ellen v futter , president of the american museum of natural history sometimes it takes a single project for all the stars to line up properly , she said , and i think this was that project for jim polshek mr polshek s selection in 1999 as the architect for the clinton presidential library was another triumph in a race in which his firm was considered the dark horse we came up from the depths , mr polshek said cheerfully he credits his personal rapport with mr clinton \( he said he would never design a library for a republican president \) and a 24footlong analytical drawing that , with text and photographs , set the proposed building in the context of mr clinton s little rock the complex drawing , a type of tool that mr polshek has used for other presentations , included pictures of the clintons' dog and cat , covers of books by the president s favorite authors and a photograph of a rundown liquor store across the river from the future library , which mr clinton recognized immediately when the selection was announced , there were rumblings from architecture critics that mr clinton had made what one called a safe choice mr polshek bristles at the charge the building is not very gentle at all , he said it is a box sitting 40 feet up in the air placed on a platform , the building will have a twostory veranda wrapped around three sides
kinshasa , congo , jan 28 when congo s new president , joseph kabila , delivered his much anticipated first address to the nation on state television last friday , he seldom raised his eyes from the 17page speech on the desk before him still , mr kabila , 29 , who is not fluent in congo s official language , french , tripped over certain words , whose meaning he did not seem to grasp the lighting and camera angle changed several times , suggesting that cuts were stitched together in the 30minute videotaped speech he was reading like a robot , said dr jeanbaptiste sondji , who was health minister under the slain president , laurent kabila , until he was fired for criticizing the government you could sense the strong hand of those who really hold power since president kabila was gunned down in his office on jan 16 and replaced by his politically inexperienced son , the control over the capital here and the entire country seems to have slipped further into the hands of those real powers congo s neighbors and a hardline inner circle that surrounded the late president and now surrounds his son unless joseph kabila , who arrives in washington on thursday to meet secretary of state colin l powell , somehow asserts authority over his handlers and can negotiate with the rebels who have already captured half of this country , the twoandahalfyear war here will continue in a stalemate at the moment , no outside power angola , zimbabwe and namibia on the side of mr kabila and uganda and rwanda behind several rebel groups seems to have the military might or political will to destroy the others and tip the scales of the war in the absence of peace , none of the five outside armies in congo is likely to leave on its own , so as not to jeopardize its security , pride and interests in congo s diamonds , gold , timber and coffee we can say without hesitation that the war suits a lot of people , here and outside kinshasa , said mabi mulumba , an economist at the university of kinshasa and a former prime minister under mobutu sese seko , the dictator who ruled this country for 32 years for most congolese , the stalemate is a nightmare that continues the effective partition of their country an exhaustive report on the war in the democratic republic of congo , often called the drc , by the international crisis group , an independent research organization , raised the central question should the drc remain a single state \? the report asks and given its current occupied , exploited and fragmented condition can it \? it was mr mobutu himself who predicted that zaire would cease to exist after him the prediction turned out to be true in many ways since he was driven from power in 1997 , the country has not only changed names , but in many ways it also ceased to exist as an independent nation although the congolese rebel groups fighting mr kabila nominally control the country s north and east , the ugandan and rwandan commanders call the shots in the governmentheld territory , the late kabila always tried to maximize his wiggle room despite his dependence on his allies as power now shifts uncertainly to his son a political unknown the presence of foreign powers here in kinshasa is expected to grow in recent days , zimbabwe and angola have reportedly sent more than 6 , 000 fresh troops to the congo , and the soldiers patrolling both the state funeral and the inauguration in the capital were mostly from zimbabwe and angola at the funeral , joseph kabila sat with president robert mugabe of zimbabwe on his left few were surprised to see the seat to his right , the most important diplomatically and symbolically , given to president jos eduardo dos santos of angola , widely regarded as the real powerholder in kinshasa angola , which saved the late kabila in august 1998 when the rwandan and ugandanbacked rebels appeared close to seizing kinshasa , had grown impatient with the president , perceived as the main obstacle to negotiating an end to the war , military and political officials here said many here believe that the angolans encouraged the assassination , or did nothing to stop it more than anything , angola wants a stable and loyal government in kinshasa that will back it in its own 25year civil war against the unita rebel force or at least a government here that does not support unita , as mr mobutu did the angolans are the protectors of power they have their hands everywhere , a congolese colonel said in kinshasa they are waiting to see if joseph kabila governs in their interests if not , he will disappear like his father it is not clear , though , whether the other foreign powers with a presence in the congo want peace rwanda will not leave until it feels secure that is , until it can achieve the practically impossible task of defeating or disarming the ethnic hutu extremists who carried out the genocide against at least half a million rwandan tutsi in 1994 and who have sought refuge in congo uganda , in the midst of a presidential campaign , is unlikely to leave without evidence that the war and the lives it cost bought some concrete benefit in zimbabwe , president mugabe faces growing opposition to his involvement here but the war has greatly enriched top officers in his military , who have had access to congo s diamonds rwanda and uganda are largely believed to be paying for their war through diamonds , coffee and gold and many individual commanders , along with their congolese counterparts , are also getting rich on the broader international stage , congo had become isolated under laurent kabila now , his son , by traveling abroad so soon after his inauguration , seems intent on reconnecting his country to more distant powers , particularly washington , which counts rwanda and uganda among its closest african allies but it is not certain that the tight circle of hardliners that had surrounded the new president are themselves interested in peace even under laurent kabila , they were said to regard peace and the consequent need for political openness and , ultimately , elections as a certain loss of their power it is too soon to tell whether joseph kabila will retain that circle his televised address contained few hints of change yet he has shown some signs of breaking away from the hardliners , according to a highranking military official one day last week , the justice minister , mwenze kongolo , one of the most powerful men under the slain president , visited joseph kabila at the presidential palace and was told to wait in his own office until the new president summoned him , the official said but he insisted he wanted to see the president , he said the president then sent back a handwritten note with only one word 'no' photo president joseph kabila of congo met with president jacques chirac in paris yesterday on his way to washington on his first official trip \( agence francepresse \)
greensboro , nc , march 18 one is perhaps the most revered coach in college basketball the other is the embattled coach at one of the most revered programs in the game mike krzyzewski speaks in measured tones about getting his duke players to believe in something bigger than themselves steve lavin slips into an amused staccato delivery when asked what it is like to be the ucla coach a gigantic dartboard a big pi ata that s going to get whacked a punching bag krzyzewski s players are clearly in awe of their coach and his two national titles and eight appearances in the final four of the national collegiate athletic association men s basketball tournament this is march , and march is coach s time , duke s shane battier said lavin s bunch admires the way that the coach handled a difficult season it began with a 44 start and looked lost when ucla officials were the first to flirt with the suddenly available rick pitino , but now is extended at least until thursday that is when the bruins , seeded fourth , will meet the topseeded blue devils in the semifinals of the east regional in philadelphia he very seldom talks about the adversity he faces , ucla point guard earl watson said of lavin the most amazing thing is his resiliency we follow his lead and fight back each team reflects its coach s personality the blue devils \( 314 \) , led by two splendid talents , battier and jason williams , are fluid and methodical over 40 minutes , they will shoot 3pointers , slash inside , fast break , slow it down in essence , explore their opponents to find a weakness to exploit the bruins \( 238 \) play only two ways at warp speed on defense and at a crawl when they get the ball , as their two tournament games have demonstrated they held hofstra to 48 points and utah state to 50 as it missed 21 consecutive shots watson sets the tempo for an insideoutside offense that revolves around the 6foot11 center dan gadzuric and the 67 jump shooter jason kapono people always think of ucla as kind of a runandgun , upanddown , west coaststyle basketball team , lavin said pivot , pass , jack 'first team to 100' style of play we are better when we 're deliberate and play on the halfcourt this is an oldtime , throwback , bluecollar team we 're tough the bruins had to be after their slow start and the midseason overtures that the athletic director , pete dalis , made to pitino after pitino resigned as the coach of the boston celtics and the bruins lost two consecutive home games lavin lobbied publicly to keep his job he had , after all , taken the bruins to the regional final once and the round of 16 two times in his first four seasons his players made it clear they wanted him to stay , and several coaches including krzyzewski expressed their support because we coach and play under 11 national championship banners , because of the standard of excellence john wooden set at ucla , there s always going to be drama , lavin , 36 , said but none of that affects how i coach our team on a daily basis i try not to take myself very seriously you have to see the theater of the absurd and insanity of it all lavin survived , and pitino now looks as if he will be the next coach at louisville but lavin s team tried him several times this season on feb 1 , the bruins were blown out by 29 points by california only to rebound two days later to defeat stanford , then ranked no 1 , on the cardinal s home floor on march 10 , ucla lost its regularseason finale , to washington , the lastplace team in the pacific10 conference lavin says that may have been the wakeup call his team needed before the tournament ever since , bruins practices have been about defense we know we can score , watson said , but now we know we have to play defense can ucla stop the blue devils \? or will lavin once more become a punching bag for the bruins faithful eager for a national title \? their quickness , athleticism , pressure defense and maturity is why they 're a no 1 seed and probably favored to win the tournament , lavin said of the blue devils but i like our kids still , the coach is sticking with the guys who stuck with him if i'm going to struggle , this is a group i want to struggle with , lavin said their maturity , character , togetherness makes it incredible this is the first full wave of kids who came in with me as a head coach this team is a group of old souls photo earl watson runs the bruins' offense , but he knows defense is their key to winning \( reuters \)
princeton it s just after dawn on lake carnegie the mist coming up from the water only enhances the beauty of the multicolored leaves from the trees that surround it several united states olympic rowers are speeding around under the critical eye of their coach , mike teti but then mr teti notices a shell going just a bit slower in the distance and shifts his glance there goes superman s mother , said mr teti , a sparkle in his eye she is the real star here she s an inspiration to us all barbara johnson is , indeed , superman s mother , her eldest son , christopher reeve , having played the caped hero in the movies but there is no doubt that mrs johnson is something super herself today the 69yearold mother of four is scheduled to make her final appearance in the veterans' division of the head of the charles , in cambridge , mass , the premier regatta of the fall rowing season she plans to return , but this is the last year she qualifies in that division mrs johnson , who took up rowing at a mere youthful 57 , won the veterans' division ages 60 through 69 of the head of the charles two years ago and last year followed that up with a thirdplace finish she does n't expect victory this year , but just going out there for the threemile race is what qualifies her for mr teti s accolades though she is quite streamlined these days she cuts and trim katherine hepburn figure mrs johnson has struggled with her health at age 6 , she contracted a form of tuberculosis that was apparently touched off by childhood bronchial asthma though she recovered from the tuberculosis , the asthma stayed so virulent that when she was 10 , her parents sent her from their connecticut home to a boarding school in tucson , ariz they only allowed me to do archery , where i could just stand up and shoot arrows , mrs johnson said as she adjusted her sunglasses on the dock of the princeton university boathouse , where the morning mist rose to greet a brilliant autumn sun over lake carnegie they did n't want me to do anything strenuous but the asthma did not stop her from leading a relatively normal suburban life she went to vassar college for two years , married and had the first of her four sons , christopher , when she was 20 she moved to princeton , divorced and remarried , and raised her boys watching them all become jocks they were all into ice hockey , and i went to a lot of little league games , too , she said i really liked doing all of that but it was n't a personal inspiration oh , i did walking and camping and biking and hiking , but i was never inspired by them to become an athlete as her children grew and left home , mrs johnson carved out a career writing for town topics , a local princeton weekly newspaper , and making many friends in town one of them , an older woman , invited her to her house on the lake one day she said , 'come see my boats , ' and i did n't resist , mrs johnson said the woman , despite having a heart murmur , rowed nearly every day something clicked inside me having had the asthma , i wondered if it would be for me but i had had some good times sailing and canoeing , so i thought i would try it i guess i became addicted by that summer , she had joined the carnegie lake racing association , a local rowing club , and started racing on its eightwoman team it was exhilarating to be part of a team , but i worried that i could be an impediment , she said her concern was that she would have an asthma attack , not be able to row and pull down the whole team so she gravitated to singles and found the nearly yearround communing with nature and her own body fascinating i loved the discovery of the logic of rowing to be the most interesting thing , she said the first movement is with the legs , which have the longest and strongest muscles then it goes to the back , which are the next longest and strongest and finally it moves to the arms then coordinating all three , that s what is wonderful and to come out to a place like this and see the sun coming up over the mist and pass through the leaves and feel the glide of the boat , she continued it is just therapeutic mrs johnson plays down her victory two years ago at the head of the charles , saying that a strong competitor , eve green of westport , conn , had forgotten to register for the race ms green beat her last year and is entered again for today s race but head of the charles has not been her only win over the years i guess i have a whole lot of medals and things in my basement , but that is n't why i do it , she said i'm really not that competitive , except perhaps with myself , she said competing with an aging body and her asthma would be enough but two years ago , she fell off her bicycle and broke her pelvis she had a bout with mononucleosis in the spring \( it s pretty funny , she said that s supposed to be a teenage disease \) and now she is taking medication for degenerated discs in her neck but like chris says , 'mom , do n't give up you 've got to continue , ' said mrs johnson , who makes regular visits to connecticut to visit her eldest son , who was paralyzed from a riding accident six years ago and is now heavily involved in promoting stemcell medical research one granddaughter , julia , is on the dartmouth rowing team and , to her grandmother s delight , helped win a race on lake carnegie against princeton last season julia s twin , sebastian , is a junior national sailing champ she has two other grandchildren in ivy league schools , though none , to her disappointment , at princeton mrs johnson said she went to rowing clinics to perfect her technique i had this problem i had to correct sending up this spray of water on my starboard oar , she said you always knew i was coming i guess i am a bit of a slow learner the carnegie lake rowing association has a history of superior rowers stuyve pell won head of the charles as a men s veteran five times loretta mccarthy is less than a second short of the world s record in the lightweight 50to59 age group several others have competed in big meets though mrs johnson does n't expect much this year because of her recent injuries , she s already planning for next year i 'll be a senior veteran then , the 70 and older group , she said , getting back in her shell for another few miles of rowing before breakfast i say i do n't look at times , but i must be lying , because i know the only two women there now are n't as fast as i am and she is plenty fast , at least for her family i remember when i won head of the charles , my son kevin , who was a good lacrosse player , decided to bike alongside for the three miles , she said we got done and he came up to me , puffing , and said , 'mom , that was soooooo long' now that was

bits of famous poems , original poems , snatches of verse pinned alongside photos of the victims in the weeks since the terrorist attacks , people have been consoling themselves and one another with poetry in an almost unprecedented way almost immediately after the event , improvised memorials often conceived around poems sprang up all over the city , in store windows , at bus stops , in washington square park , brooklyn heights and elsewhere and poems flew through cyberspace across the country in emails from friend to friend on the day of the disaster , someone sent a copy of shelley s ozymandias to a circle of friends and suggested that if the world trade center were ever to be rebuilt , it should bear a plaque with the inscription my name is ozymandias , king of kings look on my works , ye mighty , and despair ! copies of auden s september 1 , 1939 , written after germany invaded poland , were everywhere the unmentionable odour of death , auden wrote , offends the september night at union square park , which had one of the biggest memorials , an americanindian poem was pinned on the wire fence in the dawn i gathered cedarboughs sweet , sweet was their odor they were wet with tears the sweetness will not leave my hands another mourner put up lines from yeats all the words that i utter , and all the words that i write , must spread out their wings untiring , and never rest in their flight , till they come where your sad , sad heart is three days after the attack , at a memorial service for the victims at the 92nd street y , david yezzi , director of the unterberg poetry center , read lines by the israeli poet yehuda amichai this is the end of the landscape among blocks of concrete and rusting iron there s a fig tree with heavy fruit but even kids do n't come around to pick it the poet laureate of the united states , billy collins , said that since sept 11 he had been inundated with poems from friends poems by yeats , by the chilean poet pablo neruda , by the polish poet wislawa szymborska all writers , he noted , from countries that have known war we , as innocents , as americans , have never been invaded , mr collins said we have n't produced a poetry that has much authority in this area with all of the neglect of poetry and the hand wringing about how other media have bulldozed poets , mr collins said , in times of crisis it s interesting that people do n't turn to the novel or say , 'we should all go out to a movie , ' or , 'ballet would help us' it s always poetry what we want to hear is a human voice speaking directly in our ear mr collins compared the status of the poet in contemporary life to that of the goalie in hockey the goalie in hockey stands apart from others , marginalized , he said when all the skating and sliding around on the ice begins to fail us , the goalie is the poet for 10 years mr collins has been running a poetry program at the katonah public library in westchester county on the sunday after the disaster , stephen dunn , the poet , was the featured speaker we had well over 100 people , mr collins said normally 40 or 30 would be a respectable audience mr dunn began by reading one of his poems called to a terrorist for the historical ache , the ache passed down which finds its circumstances and becomes the present ache , i offer this poem without hope , knowing there s nothing , not even revenge , which alleviates a life like yours but after that initial poem , mr dunn announced that from then on he was going to read only love poems i am astounded by the various kisses we 're capable of , he read , from his poem each from different heights and reading love poems aloud in the midst of sorrow seemed just the right thing to do , mr collins said i felt after the reading that he had provided a small counterweight to put on the other side of the dreadfully lopsided scale , he said it was a tiny weight in the other direction , the beginning of moving back to equilibrium the poet robert pinsky , who is a former poet laureate of the united states , said he had also been showered with poems from friends , as well as by requests from various publications for poems in keeping with the general mood of mourning on the newshour with jim lehrer right after the tragedy , mr pinsky , who is a regular presence on the program , read marianne moore s what are years \? , a poem that has been passed frequently from person to person through email in recent weeks what is our innocence , what is our guilt \? all are naked , none is safe poetry has an intimacy because it is in the reader s voice , in one person s breath , mr pinsky said , echoing mr collins we are in a culture of spectacle with poetry , you say it aloud yourself , in your own voice in ancient societies and even today in oral cultures , poetry has had a public function , as the repository of stories , genealogies , moral ideas and collective emotion but in recent history , the job of the poet has become more and more marginalized , said bob holman , a poet who has been involved in the spoken word movement , an effort to take poetry down from its pedestal the poet has become the player of words , he said , engaging mostly in highlevel language games but changes are occurring , said mr holman , ever hopeful , as our culture listens to language artistically and poetry becomes more democratized and participatory he quoted from a poem by william carlos williams it is difficult to get the news from poems yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there i think we are fulfilling william carlos williams s poem , mr holman said we are finding the news in poetry poets' views of the human predicament here are some selections from poems that have been circulating among people in the past few weeks human beings suffer , they torture one another , they get hurt and get hard no poem or play or song can fully right a wrong inflicted and endured excerpt from the cure at troy \( 1991 \) by seamus heaney \( farrar , straus giroux \) i met a traveller from an antique land who said 'two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert near them , on the sand , half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown , and wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command , tell that its sculptor well those passions read which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things , the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed and on the pedestal these words appear my name is ozymandias , king of kings look on my works , ye mighty , and despair !

kacvtv is a lonely public broadcasting outpost for culture , civic affairs and education in the texas panhandle based in amarillo , its transmitters and relay stations send television programming to 26 , 000 square miles of sparsely populated plains dotted with oil fields and cattle ranches when its general manager , joyce herring , describes the station , you can almost see tumbleweeds rolling past its front door and hear the wind whistling through the steel beams of its oldfashioned tv antenna we serve a very , very large geographical area , she said recently there are very many more cows here than there are people many people within kacv s reach have fullservice cable , with channels like comedy central , the e ! network and tnt and they have the bignetwork affiliates that show popular entertainment programs by night cbs s survivor and abc s who wants to be a millionaire and soap operas and talk shows by day but when it comes to the lessexciting televised exploration of local affairs like zoning policy and energy , and the illumination of the area s arts institutions , kacvtv is the only gusher in the field that spout may soon be tapped out federal guidelines require all public tv stations to expand from traditional analog to modern digital transmission by may 2003 or face going dark and ms herring is struggling to raise the 45 million the transition will require , with little help from the federal government and none from the state public television stations around the country face similar challenges about onethird of the 347 member stations of the public broadcasting system , its officials estimate , are at risk america is accustomed to hardluck tales from public television it has heard them since the system s inception in the late 1960 s , when stations were straining to get up and running it heard them in the 1980 s , when conservative politicians cut financing significantly it heard them again in the 1990 s , when newt gingrich , the conservative speaker of the house , vowed to do away with the government s support for public television altogether indeed , dire warnings about public television s future have become a mantra of the pledge drives at nearly all pbs stations but this time , the threat is being taken with greater seriousness even as it drafts ambitious plans for its digital future , pbs says it is facing its biggest challenge yet and money to convert its more isolated stations is just one of many new needs even the bigger stations , which are better financed , may have to fight to be seen as a whole , the public broadcasting system is competing in a more complicated media industry even many stations that do make the digital conversion intact will have little negotiating power , compared with the likes of disney and viacom many stations fear that they could be marginalized with insufficient space on a vastly expanded television dial , drowned out by a flood of commercial cable channels and as television enters the age of interactive programming , some pbs officials fear that the system will be vulnerable to commercial forces as it tries to take advantage of the new technology public television executives are meeting these tough realities with mixed emotions in the mid1990 s , when the fcc ordered all broadcasters to convert to digital transmission so the analog spectrum they were using could be sold off robert t coonrod , the chief executive of the system s financing arm , the corporation for public broadcasting , welcomed the charge technology has finally caught up with our mission , he said pbs officials spoke dreamily of an age in which people watching american masters could click a button on their remote controls to view additional onscreen information about featured performers , where children watching sesame street could communicate directly with big bird using a remotecontrol keyboard they all but salivated over huge increases in bandwidth that would let their stations transmit either one highdefinition television programming stream or several standardquality channels with interactive features now , as such possibilities near reality , the good news is the bad news , mr coonrod said there is great opportunity here , he added , yet some people could lose service what changed \? for one thing , mr coonrod said , his organization was counting on far more in federal aid for the digital conversion than it has received the public television system needs nearly 17 billion for the upgrade , officials said , but has so far raised less than half of that it was hoping for 771 million in federal money so far , it has secured about 60 million all told , pbs estimates that with federal and state government subsidies and money raised in capital fund campaigns , its stations have accrued 400 million to 500 million for the conversion as of this month , 28 pbs stations , including weta in washington , kqed in san francisco and kopb in portland , ore , have gone digital
in sunlight , in a beautiful garden by kathleen cambor 258 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 23 two years ago , tom wolfe used the phrygian stoic philosopher epictetus as the muse for his second novel , a man in full now , in her own second novel , kathleen cambor takes a similar tack , drawing all the epigraphs for the chapters in in sunlight , in a beautiful garden from the writings of marcus aurelius could we be witnessing the evolution of a new subspecies of literary fiction \? if so , i 'd like to propose a label for it sto lit i 'd also like to include annie proulx and penelope fitzgerald in its front ranks proulx for her fiction s if you ca n't fix it you 've got to stand it philosophy and fitzgerald for her wry , oblique , sentimentfree stance toward human foible and tragedy cambor is n't as accomplished a writer as wolfe , proulx or fitzgerald , but her affinity with them can be seen in the diligent measure she takes of ordinary lives and fatedealt rigors the late19thcentury world she portrays in this novel is one in which early death \( of parents , of children \) is a painful but accepted commonplace , injury and fatal accidents on the job are regular occurrences , and strict regulation of powerful feelings both at home and in any respectable social milieu is not merely recommended but mandatory between the lines , cambor seems to suggest that the attitudes depicted here deserve fresh consideration as we move into the 21st century , for if at their worst they entail a passive condoning of a dubious status quo , they can at their best inspire a heroic acceptance of unavoidably tough times cambor s setting is johnstown , pa , where the notorious flood on memorial day , 1889 , destroyed the city and killed 2 , 209 people while the disaster itself occupies less than 10 pages , the threat of it hovers over the whole of in sunlight , in a beautiful garden not only because we know what will happen but also because the catastrophe had human as well as natural causes a poorly maintained earthen dam , upstream from johnstown , was to blame , and the wealthy resort that was responsible for that dam s maintenance , the south fork hunting and fishing club , had on its roster some of the major players in american industry henry clay frick , andrew mellon and andrew carnegie prominent citizens of johnstown including daniel morrell , head of the cambria iron company knew of the dam s poor condition and attempted to persuade the club to make improvements , but to no avail years passed , morrell died and the problems with the dam were halfforgotten certainly the citizens of johnstown assumed that those with the power to do so had remedied the situation then came the heavy rains of memorial day , and the deluge from these historical facts , cambor has concocted an upstream , downstream drama of class conflict , enhanced by a somberly lyrical style , compact characterizations and a sense of shattering events seen in long perspective her epigraph taken from maeterlinck s play pelleas et melisande forewarns us that we 're in for something a little more complicated than crusading social fiction i have been watching you you were there , unconcerned perhaps , but with the strange distraught air of someone forever expecting a great misfortune , in sunlight , in a beautiful garden although the book s tone is more elegiac than condemnatory , it s clear whom cambor sees as the villains of the piece the men who founded the club , built its picturesque cabins , stocked and fished its reservoir , but had no interest in the safety or the structure of the dam it was as if no people lived below it , no world existed in the mountains but the one they were creating however , cambor does n't simply turn these men into scapegoats instead , she brings them cannily to life , whether she s evoking a mama sboy carnegie , putting off marriage until his 50 s mellon , moving precisely and inevitably through the illness of his fiancee and unable to see beyond his grief after her death or frick , perhaps the only 30yearold in recent fiction to be pleased at the thought of going bald because it makes him seem older and established as for the potential flood victims \( all fictional creations \) , they too are equipped with complicating personal histories in johnstown , one family holds center stage frank fallon is a civil war veteran , working at the cambria iron company his wife , julia , is a chicago doctor s daughter who came to johnstown with her father after he was embroiled in a malpractice scandal their son , daniel , survivor of a diphtheria epidemic that killed two of his siblings , is the family s best hope for improving their modest circumstances the fallon household is rife with good intentions , tampeddown resentments and inner conflicts , all of which find voice when the local librarian , grace mcintyre \( on the run from her own new england past \) , begins serving as confidante , in turn , to daniel , julia and frank it helps that grace finds something a little odd , a little funny , in everything it does n't help that frank and grace find themselves attracted to each other
after two nights in a san juan , pr , federal jail , the rev al sharpton and three of new york s most prominent puerto rican politicians were flown home yesterday , to accommodations provided by the federal bureau of prisons the vieques four , as one of their lawyers now calls them , arrived at the metropolitan detention center in brooklyn after an early morning flight from san juan , where they were jailed on wednesday for their role in a demonstration on may 1 near a navy bombing range in vieques lawyers representing the four , all of whom are democrats , asked the united states court of appeals for the first circuit in boston late yesterday to release them immediately while the court considers a request to overturn their convictions on misdemeanor trespassing charges the appeal says that the sentences 90 days for mr sharpton and 40 days each for city councilman adolfo carri n jr , state assemblyman jos rivera and roberto ramirez , the bronx democratic leader are excessive they also assert that they were denied the right to a fair trial , as they were not able to use lawyers of their choice or given adequate time to prepare their case , the appeal says there were conflicting predictions on how long it might take for the court to act on the request for their release , with two new york lawyers saying it would not be until tuesday , at the earliest , and one in boston saying it could happen at any time none of them are threats of flight , or a risk of danger , all of them are responsible , said charles j ogletree jr , a harvard university law school professor representing mr sharpton this is an act of civil disobedience , an ultimate expression of their first amendment principles and not criminal conduct or a criminal intent the jail sentences evoked anger and surprise among the politicians' supporters in new york this week even gov george e pataki , a republican , on thursday called the penalties far more severe than were necessary in puerto rico , there were growing signs of opposition to the tougher penalties now being imposed on vieques demonstrators the four new york politicians were among 43 protesters who were given jail terms of 30 days to four months for entering camp garc a beginning late last month to protest the navy s continued use of the island for bombing exercises last year , 480 demonstrators got small fines or no jail time beyond what they had served when first arrested lawyers defending the protesters are interpreting the federal judge s stiffer sentences as a message to stop the demonstrations but to some puerto rican residents , it doubles the insult the navy has continued its bombing exercises and now people opposed to them are being jailed by a united states court system among those jailed are four university of puerto rico students facing 45day sentences who have requested socalled incompletes in their classes since they have missed their final course work the leader of the puerto rican independence party , rub n berr os , meanwhile , was sentenced to a fourmonth term the rallies started in 1999 after a civilian was killed and four others injured by two offtarget navy bombs but as each week passes and more are jailed , the protests are taking on an even more nationalistic tone as a puerto rican , it bothers me , luisa renta , 42 , a lab technician from humacao , said yesterday it does not seem right to put a puerto rican in jail when they are fighting for a puerto rican cause some island residents yesterday defended the tougher sentences , saying that protesters should have realized that if they broke the law , they could end up in jail what do they expect \? said rolando garc a , an engineering professor at the university of puerto rico but the outcry may only intensify , with those still to be tried including two senators in the puerto rican state government and a mayor , as well as the actor edward james olmos and robi draco rosa , the musician and cowriter of the puerto rican superhit livin' la vida loca vieques residents are to vote on a referendum in november on whether the navy should be allowed to continue bombing exercises it is not known when , if at all , the drills will occur again before then , although it could be as soon as next month for mr sharpton and his fellow politicians now jailed in brooklyn , lockdown comes at 11 pm , lights out at midnight and wakeup at 6 am during the day , they may walk around the 2 , 300inmate detention center , talking to other inmates or taking part in recreational , religious or educational activities , said traci billingsley , a spokeswoman for the bureau of prisons they are housed , according to one of their lawyers , in a single cell , and may have visitors once during the week and on weekends yesterday evening , their family members , lawyers and fernando ferrer , the bronx borough president , visited them but requests by reporters were declined by the bureau of prisons their families are relieved at the move close to home , which ms billingsley said was standard practice but the lawyers said the families would not be satisfied until the men were released they are a bit tired , but they are in good spirits , said sanford a rubenstein , one of mr sharpton s lawyers they believe they are on the side of all that is just and right , and that gives them strength
the drug ecstasy , long a fixture of manhattan s club scene , is gaining favor with westchester teenagers , and county officials have begun a campaign to warn the public of its dangers county executive andrew j spano recently sent letters to 640 , 000 households with teenagers , warning , more and more of our youth are possessing the drug , taking the drug , selling the drug and either getting sick or being arrested as a result prosecutions involving ecstasy have increased sharply , said district attorney jeanine pirro , rising to 80 last year from virtually none in 1998 since 1999 , the police have seized more than 25 , 000 tablets worth more than 500 , 000 it s disturbing because unlike heroin or cocaine , a lot of the customer base is between 16 and 25 , ms pirro said somehow this drug has been sensationalized where young people think , 'oh , this is something i should try , ' without realizing this is not only a serious crime but a serious drug ms pirro said that in the county , the police have seen ecstasy users becoming suppliers what young people need to realize is that you can face up to seven years in prison for selling one pill , she said ecstasy , whose scientific name is methylenedioxymethamphetamine \( mdma \) , produces feelings of euphoria and emotional wellbeing and gives the user enormous stamina usually sold in pill form , it ranges in price from about 7 to 30 a pill because ecstasy lowers inhibitions and social awkwardness , it has fast become the drug of choice for teenagers , say those who counsel local youth student assistance services in tarrytown , which provides drug and alcohol counseling in public schools in the county , reported that last year , 582 of the 2 , 040 substance abusers in their programs admitted to using the drug these figures do n't reflect the total usage , said andrea fallick , assistant director for schoolbased programs for the agency teenagers' use of the drug in westchester mirrors national trends , ms fallick said in a national survey of 45 , 200 students , the proportion of eighthgrade students reporting any use of ecstasy rose to 31 percent in 2000 from 17 percent in 1999 among 10th graders , the use of ecstasy rose to 54 percent from 44 percent , and among 12th graders to 82 percent from 56 percent ecstasy , she said , is used by more american teenagers today than cocaine in westchester , teenagers are getting the drug at clubs in manhattan or at house parties , ms pirro said she said teen nights at clubs , when alcohol is not served , are often big nights for ecstasy sales ms pirro s office has also prosecuted runners , people who travel to manhattan or the bronx to buy the drug and return to westchester to sell it last year , six teenagers were arrested and charged with selling ecstasy on and around the byram hills high school campus in armonk you can rest assured that these drugs are being used in many , many of the high schools in this county , ms pirro said the fact that byram hills has been identified does not exclude other high schools as having a problem high school counselors agree we are seeing ecstasy all over the county and we are very concerned , ms fallick said kids really do n't appreciate the dangers what happens when you take ecstasy is , because it feels so good , it takes away what we call good paranoia they no longer have that in terms of judging who they can really trust and what s safe , because they love everybody and we all know not everyone is lovable ms fallick said that high school counselors have had reports of rapes , sexual abuse and other victimization involving the use of ecstasy the risks of the drug , she said , are multiple teenagers who buy the drug cannot be sure what they are actually getting and ecstasy has dangerous side effects according to the national institute on drug abuse , ecstasy shares the properties of hallucinogenic and stimulant drugs shortterm effects include increased heart rate , blood pressure and body temperature an evening of strenuous activity on ecstasy , like dancing all night , can lead to dehydration , hypertension and heart and kidney failure the concern is that ecstasy does feel so good that kids do n't really appreciate the dangers , ms fallick said it does n't matter how bright they are or what good kids they are , this drug puts them at risk
with the fiveyear statute of limitations about to run out on some counts , a federal grand jury has returned indictments against 13 saudis and one lebanese in the 1996 terrorist truck bombing that killed 19 american airmen and injured nearly 400 others at the khobar towers residential complex in saudi arabia although not all the suspects are in custody in saudi arabia and none are yet in the united states , a measure of judicial accountability now seems likely for this crime no iranians have yet been formally charged , even though the grand jury found that those who carried out the attack were inspired , supported and directed by elements of the iranian government attorney general john ashcroft said that not enough hard evidence had yet been assembled to prevail in court he should press forward there is no statute of limitations on murder although bringing charges against past or present tehran officials is sure to irritate iran s reformminded elected leaders , there can be no diplomatic justification for not pursuing iranian suspects limited cooperation from the saudis hampered the investigation americans were allowed to observe saudi interrogations of key suspects , but could not directly participate understandably , the saudis preferred to curb the foreign and domestic political ramifications of the case they feared that if american investigators proved an iranian connection , tehran might retaliate against saudi arabia yet as the main beneficiaries of the american military protection the airmen were there to provide , saudi authorities should have been braver and more helpful the indicted saudis are said to belong to an organization called saudi hezbollah , believed to be sponsored and aided by iranian intelligence agencies the elements of iran s government linked to terrorism are those controlled by its conservative religious leadership , under tehran s supreme leader , the ayatollah ali khamenei , not by the elected government of president mohammad khatami iranian politics are now delicately balanced between mr khatami s reformers and his clerical rivals , and indictments could provoke an antiamerican backlash yet better relations between the united states and iran cannot be built on excusing acts of terrorism against american servicemen if a provable case can be assembled against iranian intelligence officials in the khobar bombing , washington should seek further indictments

one by one , they were called down from their rooms at the home for the mentally ill in queens and ushered into an ambulette over five days in january 1998 , they were taken to a small hospital nearby , 24 men in all once there , they were shepherded into the emergency room , many listless and disheveled , some so bewildered that they began to wander off before being stopped by nurses or guards there was a 72yearold schizophrenic who had been in institutions nearly all his life and could barely dress himself another was a man who spent most of his time at the home staring off , a grimace etching his face and there was one man who was more alert but who had long been terrified of hospitals each man had been persuaded back at the home to sign forms consenting to surgery for an enlarged prostate , even though the condition had not been conclusively diagnosed , few seemed to understand what they had signed and none had received proper urological examinations , a state health inquiry concluded later eventually , the residents of the leben home for adults in elmhurst some barely middleaged , one nearly 80 were put under general anesthesia for an hourlong operation to shave tissue from their prostates in most cases , they were operated on at parkway hospital in forest hills by a urologist who had never met them and did not adequately review their medical records , the inquiry showed it was , health officials charged , the use of assemblyline techniques to massproduce surgery , a series of procedures that generated tens of thousands of dollars in medicaid and medicare fees for the hospital and at least one doctor the account of the operations is emerging only now in the wake of a lawsuit brought against the home this month on behalf of the 24 residents and the state s recent decision to revoke the medical license of one urologist who arranged the surgeries and to suspend the license of another who performed them both doctors have defended their conduct , as has leben home , which was fined 5 , 000 for not properly supervising the 24 men and for other violations leben home , a forprofit facility with about 360 mentally ill residents , remains open , despite a decadesold history of unsanitary conditions , state sanctions and even macabre incidents in 1993 , for example , a decomposed body was found to have been wedged behind a basement freezer for a year even amid the longstanding troubles at the home , though , the surgeries stand out , according to a review of case records and interviews with state officials and residents' relatives four men were never examined by a urologist before undergoing the operations , including the 72yearold schizophrenic , identified in the case as patient 10 , according to testimony before the surgeries , leben home did not contact relatives or guardians of the men , or their primary care doctors , even though it had previously done so for matters as minor as a dental visit , officials said six of the men suffered complications from the surgery , including severe incontinence to this day , most have no idea what happened to them a sister of patient 10 said he could not even comprehend what a prostate gland was , let alone consent to the surgery he s used to being in institutions , she said in an interview , speaking on condition that she and her brother not be identified he s been in them all his life he does what he is told he 'll just follow you she said that whenever her brother had been hospitalized for treatment of cellulitis , an inflammation of the connective tissue of the skin , the home had contacted her or another brother no one notified them about the prostate surgery , she said to say that patient 10 would be capable of signing his own permission on a form for surgery is absurd , she said the state health department inquiry into the two doctors' conduct began after an anonymous call the department is also examining the role of parkway hospital in the surgeries the state attorney general s office is investigating whether the doctors or the hospital committed medicaid fraud still , lawyers at mfy legal services , disability advocates and patterson , belknap , webb tyler , which brought the suit on behalf of the men , said the state had not done enough they are asking a federal judge to remove the home s operator , jacob rubin , and are seeking damages from the two doctors , jamile a peress and harry josifidis jay l t breakstone , mr rubin s lawyer , described the lawsuit as scurrilous , saying that it was not the home s role to ensure that doctors or a hospital obtain proper consent for the surgeries leben home is a residence , not a health care facility , mr breakstone said the home has no legal responsibility to make what amounts to medical decisions on behalf of the residents , he said , any more than the desk clerk at the new york hilton would make a decision on behalf of you or i dr peress , who arranged the surgeries and whose license was revoked , assailed the state health department and the lawsuit , saying he was being demonized after trying to help a group of poor souls he said that although he had arranged the surgeries , it had not been his responsibility to ensure that the patients gave proper consent i am not a culprit , he said i am a hero for treating these patients dr josifidis , who performed the operations , and his lawyer , gerard j heubel , did not respond to three messages left at their offices seeking comment the health department suspended dr josifidis s license for three years , then stayed the suspension for all but six months and put him on probation for the remaining two and a half years
washington , march 6 the marine corps commandant , gen james jones , has ordered the marines to search for helicopter alternatives to the v22 osprey , the innovative but problemplagued aircraft , as within the pentagon concerns grow that the 40 billion osprey program will be canceled , marine officials said general jones s order is the first clear acknowledgment by the marines that the program is in peril the osprey faces a series of potentially debilitating inquiries into its safety , cost and reliability two osprey crashes killed 23 marines last year , and the pentagon is investigating accusations of falsified maintenance records at the marines' lone osprey squadron , in north carolina marine officials asserted today that general jones s move did not mean he had lost faith in the safety or capability of the osprey , which can land and take off like a helicopter and cruise like an airplane if the osprey survives the investigations , the marines still hope to buy 358 of them to replace their vietnamera troop transport helicopters but there is also a growing sense within the pentagon that support for the osprey in the white house and congress , as well as among many marines , has waned in recent weeks , as newly released reports by congressional and pentagon officials have raised questions about the osprey s effectiveness , affordability and safety as well as the marines' management of the program we 've got to be pragmatic about this , one senior marine corps officer said , noting that general jones wanted to have a backup plan for replacing aging ch46 and ch53 helicopters if the osprey program was killed senior marine officials continue to be unenthusiastic about the available helicopter alternatives , none of which can fly as fast or as far as the osprey the main alternative , marine officials said , would probably be some version of the h60 black hawk , which is made by sikorsky and is one of the army s main infantry transport helicopters another option would be to build a new version of the ch53e super stallion , also by sikorsky , which can carry more troops than the osprey but is slower and has less range in 1991 , dick cheney , who was then defense secretary and is now vice president , canceled the osprey program , calling it too expensive but mr cheney was overruled by congress , led by delegations from texas and pennsylvania where the osprey is being built by boeing and textron s bell helicopter unit mr cheney has declined to comment on the osprey since taking office but bush administration officials have said the aircraft is high on a list of expensive military programs being reviewed for potential cuts a fourmember panel conducting a review of the osprey program is preparing to hold its first public hearing this friday witness are expected to include relatives of marines killed in an osprey crash last year and their lawyers , who are contemplating suing the manufacturers the panel , which is expected to send its final report to secretary of defense donald h rumsfeld next month , has already received private briefings from a number of experts who contend that the osprey may be more aerodynamically unstable , harder to maintain and costlier to operate than the marines have been willing to acknowledge in one briefing , a navy investigator reported that between 1998 and 2000 , two osprey caught fire after hydraulic lines broke a frayed hydraulic line , combined with a computer malfunction , is thought to have caused an osprey crash last december that killed four marines in another briefing , the general accounting office reported that the marines canceled important tests on the osprey in 1997 and 1998 to save time and money those tests might have shed light on a potentially dangerous aerodynamic condition known as vortex ring state , which was later ruled the primary cause of an osprey crash in april 2000 that killed 19 marines , the report said major concerns about the aircraft s performance and operations remain unresolved , the accounting office said these known and potential problems and their associated costs leave open the question of the v22 s real value , as demonstrated , for marine corps operations yet another report to the panel , by the pentagon s chief testing office , raised concerns about the apparent inability of the osprey to autorotate , a crashlanding maneuver used when a helicopter loses all power the marines contend that the osprey can glide down to a crash landing like an airplane the department of defense s inspector general is conducting a separate investigation into accusations that maintenance records were falsified at the osprey s home base , new river air station in north carolina although the former commander of that squadron , lt col odin f leberman , is at the center of that inquiry , the investigators are also looking into the possibility that marine generals who oversaw the osprey program knew of and perhaps even encouraged improper behavior at new river , military officials say colonel leberman has been reassigned pending the investigation the swirl of inquiries and public criticism of the v22 program have contributed to rising concern within the marine corps itself about the safety of the osprey and the integrity of the program , marine corps officials said it is in part to assuage those fears that general jones has ordered the search for potential alternatives , those officials said in addition , general jones has made a point in recent weeks of declaring his willingness to cancel the program if the osprey is proven unsafe , to assure marines and their families that he is not a zealot about the aircraft , a senior marine corps official said i think what we have to do is essentially not be blinded and not have tunnel vision on this , general jones said in a recent interview he added that he would try to make sure the marines never get so far down the road that we have no other options other than the osprey the option the corps seems to favor most would be to avoid killing the osprey by putting it back into research and development for possibly a year or longer the marines could then spend the money saved on keeping their aging helicopters flying or buying a small number of black hawks as an interim measure while the osprey undergoes new tests or even a redesign it is unclear whether efforts by the bush administration or the marines to delay or cancel the osprey program will run into opposition on capitol hill many members of congress still view the v22 program as an important source of jobs for their constituents and many aerospace industry officials contend that the osprey s tiltrotor technology could have commercial applications but several pentagon officials say the driving force behind the osprey has always been the marines if the marines cool to the program , congress is likely to follow , one pentagon official said if the marines are n't willing to fight for it , people will back away from it , the official said
al gore taught his last journalism class at columbia university yesterday the reviews are in for this politicianasteacher , and they are mixed some students were thrilled by their proximity to fame and said they believed that the former vice president had opened their horizons others felt cheated they complained that he had treated them more like a studio audience than budding journalists as he chatted with celebrity guests like rupert murdoch , david letterman and alan greenspan , and ducked questions about the election it s really a problem to have a professor who s afraid to say what he thinks , said seth solomonow , a journalism graduate student who attended most of the classes in mr gore s noncredit course at columbia s school of journalism mr gore s explanation yesterday that he did not want to worsen the postelection rifts during a period of constitutional vulnerability mollified some skeptical students , but they said they would have welcomed the explanation more when the course began , not as it was ending the former vice president s reticence , like so much about his course , was a product of a jarring culture clash from the moment the school agreed to his offer to teach , the remnants of the gore campaign image machine a rump caucus of aides with cell phones buzzing , email flying and thumbs punching away at wireless pager keyboards were inserted , episodically , into a freewheeling , questioning academic culture but an academic culture of free inquiry is not usually besieged by reporters on hand to record every random musing usually , courses take weeks to plan , not days usually , the students do not suspect that a professor is imagemongering at their expense , and few professors worry about students' fattening their clipping files by writing news articles about their lectures for michael arnone , a journalism student , the class offered a lesson that the school may not have intended i did get lots out of it , he said i learned how to interact with a very intelligent , highly connected and experienced source who is n't there to tell me what i want to know he s there to tell me what he wants me to know that is valuable experience for any reporter to hear mr gore tell it , he chanced on the notion of teaching journalism when musing on his immediate future after the supreme court ruling that led to george w bush s becoming president i thought about the subjects i might be qualified to teach , he said in an interview yesterday and i concluded that there were really none , he added with a laugh and then i glanced back at my r sum and what popped out at me was the fact that i had worked as a journalist for several years roshni abayasekara , a journalism student , said she would have preferred that mr gore play to his strengths and explain how politicians handled the press she warmed to the class when the guest speakers arrived what i particularly enjoyed were the speakers that he brought in and the almost questionandanswer sessions he would have , she said he was very intuitive and posed a bunch of really insightful questions among the things mr gore would not talk about in class were his future political plans in a brief interview yesterday , he explained the election was not what i came here to talk about and i tried to make that clear and i think the vast majority of the students understood it , and whether they agreed with it or not , they certainly respected it as for his future , he added i do n't know what i will do i do n't know if i will be a candidate again or not and i'm enjoying making a contribution in other ways by teaching my wife and i are writing a book he said he wanted to wait and make decisions when i have a little more distance and perspective distance from and perspective on the last election his students had hoped to share in that perspective mr gore s reticence and the haphazard style of the early lectures left them frustrated the course was fraught with unintended consequences from the moment when reed e hundt , mr gore s friend and a former chairman of the federal communications commission , called tom goldstein , the journalism dean , to propose that mr gore teach at columbia the course was thrown together at the last minute i do n't think ever in the history of a university has a course been put together in two days , mr goldstein said that led to some initial confusion , i think we can operate pretty fast , but a university is not accustomed to working under those deadlines even a journalism school the gore camp s conditions clashed with administrators' desire to expose many students to the prize guest lecturer mr gore wanted a class to have a consistent group of students , and be small enough for him to build a rapport , said those who were part of the initial planning the gore camp balked when administrators at the school of international and public affairs set up a lottery , hoping to cycle roughly 100 of their students through the course the first lecture was the defeated democratic presidential candidate s first public appearance since president bush s inauguration a hungry press corps was waiting outside to hear what he had to say the idea of a news conference after class had been rejected by the gore camp , according to people briefed on the negotiations so news organizations including newsday , cnn , fox news , usa today , the daily news and the new york times were recruiting students to report on their class at which point david klatell , the associate dean , who was quarterbacking the fracas while mr goldstein was on a trip abroad , declared that the class was off the record the idea that a journalism school was pulling a veil over a newsworthy event led to a public relations disaster , which some students said gave them a dose of cynicism about their celebrity professor evan cornog , a journalism professor , said yesterday , a better job could have been done preparing everyone for reasonable expectations the course , he added , just evolved and there were a few mistakes as the classes turned from goreled lectures to goreled questionandanswer sessions , some students kept pushing him to answer electionrelated questions some of the nonjournalists in the class tired of it benjamin bolger , a graduate student in architecture , said last week i admire professor gore deeply i think he s made a very genuine effort to give of himself freely to students what i find troubling is that a lot of students ask questions that are clearly things he has suggested he is not prepared to speak about i think it s a problem when journalism students do n't respect those wishes marguerite reardon , who attended some of the lectures , said you know , i thought it was interesting i think maybe there are people out there who think he should n't have been there , that it was a waste of time i do n't think it was a waste of time i thought it was interesting he s a noteworthy person he is probably going to be doing other stuff i wanted to hear what he had to say photo al gore , with security and aides , arriving at columbia university s graduate school of journalism to teach his final

the enron corporation , its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence , yesterday ousted its chief financial officer , andrew s fastow , whose involvement in complicated transactions with enron has drawn the scrutiny of the securities and exchange commission in my continued discussions with the financial community , it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace andy as cfo , kenneth l lay , enron s chairman and chief executive , said in a statement announcing the change only one day before , mr lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the enron board continue to have the highest faith and confidence in andy the company said that mr fastow had taken a leave of absence , but it also named his successor , jeffrey mcmahon , the head of enron s industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night the move came after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange , where enron s shares fell 338 , to 1641 the price has been cut in half since oct 16 , when enron reported its thirdquarter earnings a 12 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that mr fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release mr lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed , but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate 1 billion writeoff that was disclosed in the earnings document , and were angered when they later learned about it on tuesday , when both mr fastow and mr lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call , neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by mr fastow mr lay cited the sec inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions the fact the transactions took place has been known for a year , but enron s disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand by structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver enron stock , it appears that enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses , but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement that is one of the issues the sec , whose inquiries were disclosed monday by the company , is expected to address concerns have also grown this week over whether enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying either in cash or with stock if things went wrong on tuesday , mr fastow assured investors that the company expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations , and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate mr fastow was viewed as one of the architects , with jeffrey k skilling , the former enron chief executive who resigned in august , of the change in business strategy that turned enron from a gaspipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large wall street following its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at 9075 according to a person close to the company , while mr mcmahon , mr fastow s successor , was enron s treasurer , he told mr skilling , who at the time was the chief operating officer , that he thought the partnerships involving mr fastow presented a conflict of interest after that discussion , mr mcmahon moved to a different job at the company , this person said shares of enron traded as low as 1551 yesterday afternoon , the lowest price for the stock since early 1995 , before recovering in afterhours trading , they fell to 1614 one of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by m carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , to drop her rating to sell from hold she had lowered the rating to hold from buy on monday after the sec inquiry was announced , she said in an interview yesterday evening , enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat , as a gesture to the street now they are replacing him today the timing is a little late , but i think it will be received positively by the street but she said that investor sentiment might work the other way people could fear that if you remove fastow from the management team , you 'll never get any answers
fountain hills , ariz , july 4 as the investigation continued today into the death of a 14yearold boy at a desert boot camp for troubled youth , other campers told of abusive treatment they said they had suffered at the hands of counselors who were not much older than the children they were supervising children at the camp west of phoenix said they were punched , kicked , handcuffed and forced to swallow mud they said they were allowed to wear only black sweat pants and sweatshirts in temperatures that regularly exceeded 100 degrees and were physically abused for asking for food , water or medical attention the autopsy report on the teenager who died on sunday , tony haynes , is not expected to be made public for several weeks but justin hurff , 12 , and his brother , michael , 9 , who watched him as artificial respiration failed to revive him , said tony was dehydrated and delirious before help arrived other witnesses said tony vomited after he was forced to eat mud we all cried and cried and cried , michael hurff said in an hourlong interview in which he and justin recounted their experiences at the camp run by america s buffalo soldiers reenactors association , which describes itself as a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping troubled youth the camp , 15 miles south of buckeye , ariz , was shut down on monday by the maricopa county sheriff s department , which is investigating the boy s death and the litany of accusations from parents that the camp operators had abused their children the sheriff s department said about 40 boys and girls , ages 7 to 17 , had been attending tony haynes is the latest child to die in a series of incidents in recent years at socalled wilderness therapy camps for young people in which rugged conditions and tough discipline are used to break antisocial and , in many cases , criminal habits many of the camps are in western states , like arizona , that do not regulate them capt tim dorn , the commander of investigations for the maricopa sheriff s department , said today that much of what the hurff boys said had been corroborated by others and that investigators were putting together a case to present to the county attorney for prosecution when asked if he believed the accusations rose to the level of criminal offenses , captain dorn said , there certainly is that possibility sheriff joe arpaio said that when investigators came to the camp this week they noticed bruises on some children the camp is run by charles f long , 56 , who calls himself colonel captain dorn said mr long had refused to speak to investigators mr long did not return telephone messages seeking comment today or tuesday the hurff boys said much of the abuse occurred when mr long was absent , leaving all supervision in the hands of three people known to the campers as sergeants justin said one was about the same age as mr long and two others were 17 or 18 captain dorn said the three had been interviewed by investigators the hurff brothers , who had enrolled for a fiveweek program , said beatings and other abuses began several days after they arrived last week once , they said , all the campers were told to lie on their backs alongside one another after which the sergeants , wearing boots , ran across their chests michael said younger campers were often made to ingest dirt that turned to mud after the sergeants poured water into their mouths complaints , the boys said , were answered with physical punishment they 'd make you stand up at attention , and if you moved they 'd punch you down , michael said in one exercise , they said , campers were made to place rocks along a trail but if you did n't do it right , they stomped on your arms , justin said they could do anything they wanted because colonel long was n't there but the boys said they were frightened of mr long as well they said he once held a knife to the throat of an older boy who wanted to quit the program i saw that , justin said the hurff boys said they believed that of all the children , none were abused more than tony haynes , whose troubled past included slashing the tires on his mother s car justin hurff said the sergeants once handcuffed and shackled tony before they pulled down his pants and beat his butt with a boot he was screaming , 'i want to go home , ' but they just put mud in his mouth and kicked him some more , michael said by sunday , the hurff boys said , tony was hallucinating , insisting that indians were chasing him at one point , they said , he passed out , prompting the sergeants to douse him with water when that did not appear to help , he was taken by pickup truck to a hotel in buckeye where they said mr long was staying , only to be returned a short time later at that time , justin said , the sergeants dragged him from the truck and placed him in a sleeping bag to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation he looked blue to me and he was foaming at the mouth , justin said someone called 911 , and tony was taken to a hospital in buckeye , where he was pronounced dead hours later in many cases , parents said they relied on wordofmouth endorsements before sending their children to the camp , and heard of abuses only after the boy died chris hanner , whose son brandon , 14 , described similar episodes of abuse in a separate interview , said brandon s mother , from whom he is divorced , had been assured by a friend that the camp had proved helpful to the friend s daughter she is his mom i respected her decision , mr hanner said then my child comes home with a bootprint bruise on his body it almost makes me sick doreen hurff said that after her sons attended another of mr long s camps last summer and a saturday program for five months this year , with no problems , she did not hesitate to send them back this year but the difference , she discovered , was that mr long was not at the camp at all times this year , as she said he had told parents he would be sure , i signed a form that said i understood corporal punishment would be used , ms hurff said but i thought corporal punishment would mean a swat on the rear end i never thought it meant anything like this photo doreen hurff with her sons justin , left , and michael ms hurff said the boot camp she sent them to lacked the supervision she had expected \( jeff topping for the new york times \)
t is one of the more confounding casualties of any broadway season in recent memory how could seussical the musical , a show that moved producers to tears at a toronto workshop , wind up limping its way to broadway from a boston tryout last fall , dismissed by critics , begging for audiences \( mother s day offer ! bring your mom for free ! \) and shut out of the tony awards \? ultimately , it closed in less than six months , at a loss of 105 million now that this theater season has ended , and other musicals contemplate the long road to broadway , are there lessons in this sorry tale \? why did seussical a collection of stories from the children s books by dr seuss , strung together with songs fail to live up to its powerful promise \? how did a show with arguably the best buzz in years end up bombing on broadway \? people in the industry point fingers in many directions at the producers , who sidelined members of the original creative team including the director , the costume designer and the set designer when the going got tough and desperately booked backtoback celebrities as the cat in the hat to keep the show afloat at the design team that took over and , some say , only made the show garish while trying to brighten it , eroding the simple charm that once made seussical magical at the original director , frank galati , who many say lacked the necessary strong hand and subversive vision to help seussical resonate with adults as well as children at david shiner , who had been the costar of the mime show fool moon , for not being charismatic enough in his first professional speaking role as the cat in the hat , though many agree that he did the best that he could with what he was given at the show s composer , stephen flaherty , and its lyricist , lynn ahrens , who insisted that they did not need a book writer and were later criticized for failing to make seussical clear , compelling and quirky the story begins with livent , the production company , now defunct , that was run by garth drabinsky in 1997 it acquired the rights to the seuss books , written by theodore geisel \( a k a dr seuss \) , from geisel s widow , audrey at a reading in new york in march 1999 , the show captivated potential backers with its songs eric idle , the monty python comedian , who is credited in the seussical program as the show s coconceiver with ms ahrens and mr flaherty , played the cat in the hat at the reading and remembers feeling that the score was so strong that it could stand up as a concert in the royal albert hall in london it was brilliant , he said brought in by mr drabinsky to write the book , mr idle said he and the musical s songwriters worked together , and he then went off to sketch his ideas for the show mr idle said he envisioned mayhem steam and debris flying up from the orchestra pit , arms reaching out of the walls , people dragged to the stage , a spirit of anarchy it needed to be much more mad , he said i wanted the whole thing to be sticky green stuff he thought the cat should be central , like the mc in cabaret but after livent declared bankruptcy , and mr drabinsky retreated to canada , mr idle said that ms ahrens and mr flaherty told him they wanted to write the show themselves it seemed to me a mistake , he said some say seussical should have kept mr idle , with his offcenter sensibility , on board \( the producers tried later to bring him back \) we needed the outsider , his warped vision , one cast member said marty bell , the former creative director of livent , who was a major force behind seussical , said that in his initial conversations with mr galati , they had envisioned a simpler show we were looking to do 'the fantastiks , ' he said it was a show about the words the show that was done was ringling brothers it was about everything except the words so why did n't mr galati forge ahead with his original concept \? there was a lot of pressure on him , mr bell said people try to create what they think a broadway musical is supposed to do instead of what the material calls for , and that s where they get into trouble after seussical was acquired by clear channel entertainment then called sfx theatrical group , which took over livent actors performed the toronto workshop production in august 1999 it was performed on a bare stage , with the cast in everyday clothes andrea martin played the cat in the hat , but later withdrew because she did not want to be away from her family in california the producers who traveled to see the performance were practically tripping over one another to get a piece of the show there was a sense that seussical could be the next lion king , appealing to both adults and children clear channel decided on fran and barry weissler , the husbandandwife team behind successful revivals like chicago and grease , as partners universal studios was also a producer those who attended the workshop said they responded to the show s tuneful score and the way it honored the imagination but many now say that this response was largely due to a certain workshop sorcery people create a production in their heads that will never match the actual production , said kevin chamberlin , who played horton the elephant from the beginning the imagination is much stronger than anything you can actually do
viacom may soon face a formidable rival to its mtv and vh1 cable music networks , which have yet to face any real competition aol time warner is contemplating a new cable music network to compete with those of viacom , company executives said earlier this month it would be controlled by the company s turner broadcasting system division and would probably work closely with the division s wb network , the executives said on friday , msnbccom reported that executives were considering calling the network aol music and had not decided whether to start it as its own standalone channel or on the tnt cable channel as a parttime service aol time warner had no comment on the report news that the company was considering its own music channel was not surprising turner has an array of cable news and entertainment channels , but none that draw a young audience comparable to that of mtv though other cable music channels other than the vh1 and mtv networks do exist , none have the backing of a company as large as aol time warner , which not only owns time warner cable but also has formidable promotional power with some of the bestknown brands in television , the internet and magazines executives said earlier this month that they thought wb , with its young audience , could work well in promoting a music network they cited that as a reason for folding the network into the turner broadcasting system , which is now headed by jamie kellner , who is also chief executive of wb still , they have said that no plans were definite and that no time frame was set for the start of such a network
las vegas , nov 17 lennox lewis , finding the resolve , poise and finally the power he lost seven months ago , reclaimed his heavyweight titles tonight with a knockout of hasim rahman at 1 minute 29 seconds of the fourth round entering the ring to the strains of james brown s big payback , lewis erased the blemish of last april , when he was stunningly knocked out by rahman in the fifth round of their fight in south africa stinging rahman throughout the fight tonight with combinations , lewis followed a grazing left hand with a sledgehammer right cross that sent rahman sprawling backward dazed and unable to rise to his feet , rahman was counted out by referee joe cortez before a roaring crowd of nearly 12 , 000 at the mandalay bay resort and casino lewis \( 3921 , 30 knockouts \) pounded his heart with his gloves , and the 36yearold briton quickly seized the world boxing council and international boxing federation belts he had lost last april from the opening bell , lewis battered rahman , who fell to 353 and was knocked out for the third time in his career lewis hit rahman with a leftright combination in the third round and controlled the pace with his jab throughout rahman appeared frustrated in the opening rounds , unable to measure the distance it would take to land another big right hand on the chin of the 6foot5 lewis cortez broke up clenches often with two straight lefts , lewis opened a small cut over the corner of rahman s left eye about 90 seconds into the fight both fighters came out jabbing , connecting well enough to bring the sellout crowd to its feet lewis s victory may mean a hugemoney fight with mike tyson next april but if not for his dominating performance tonight , he might have gone down as just another heavyweight who could not fill the shoes of his predecessors lewis entered tonight s fight as a slight favorite , far removed in the oddsmakers' eyes from the polished champion who was a lopsided favorite in south africa in april he weighed in at 246 1 2 pounds , less than the careerhigh 253 pounds he weighed for their first fight in that bout , an overconfident lewis did not travel to acclimate himself to the high altitude until two weeks before the fight he loaded up on a buffet of overhand rights in the first few rounds , trying to take rahman out lewis s lack of preparation , and then rahman , caught up with him in

to buck almost 70 years of history he is the 13th former heavyweight champion to forgo a tuneup fight and opt for an immediate rematch with the man who beat him only three of those former champions regained their title jack sharkey was beaten by max schmeling in 1930 , but reclaimed the title in the rematch , a 15round decision in 1932 floyd patterson knocked out ingemar johansson twice after he

eastman s righthand counter over the top of joppy s left glove in the final 10 seconds of the 12th round joppy was given a standingeight count before the bell rang but joppy s ability to land more

surrounded by ncaa sanctions and speculation , max good has performed like a trapeze artist without a net since replacing the fired bill bayno as the nevadalas vegas men s basketball coach after his promotion from bayno s staff , good was quickly reminded that such insecurity goes with coaching at unlv when a booster approached to offer support coach , you got to understand , good said the booster told him this is unlv the tents go up , and the tents go down indeed , a threering circus has formed around good and the runnin' rebels in the wake of a fouryear probation and postseason sanctions levied against the program dec 12 by the national collegiate athletic association the ncaa report cited numerous rules infractions dating from 1996 , including the recruitment of lamar odom , and issued a reprimand for lack of institutional control that led to bayno s ouster and put a program trying to revive its record and rehabilitate its outlaw image at a crossroads in the center ring are unlv s president , carol harter , and its athletic director , charlie cavagnaro , whose aggressive appeal to the ncaa and highspeed pursuit of rick pitino has upstaged the xfl for local intrigue and entertainment value whether arguing unsuccessfully before the ncaa to overturn its postseason ban or flying to meet with pitino , harter and cavagnaro admit to a carpe diem approach to restoring unlv basketball to national prominence we felt the same way with our football program a few years ago , that we had to do something , although the glare of the public was n't on it like the basketball program , cavagnaro said , referring to john robinson s hiring as football coach in 1998 this is one of those programs that can win a national championship that s crystal clear we have the tools to do it unlv , in basketball , is a magic name we have to work that magic in a positive way the university has won one national championship in basketball , in 1990 under jerry tarkanian , and it was in the final four three times from 1987 through 1991 but the program has floundered since tarkanian s departure in 1992 in just over three seasons under bayno , the rebels were 5543 we should aspire to be great , harter said why not \? every great public university has great athletic teams and academic programs across the board unlv in 20 years can be to nevada what ucla is to california i do n't think there s anything wrong with trying to reach that level and whether we get pitino or not , i want somebody of that caliber such ambition , combined with criticism that influential boosters like the casino magnate steve wynn and the local developer irwin molasky drive university decisions , has increased the scrutiny of harter and cavagnaro , particularly from some members of the board of regents determined to avoid a repeat of the behindthescenes dealings with rollie massimino , who was then the basketball coach , that led to ncaa probation in the early 90 s , one regent , mark alden , has warned that he will seek to dismiss harter and cavagnaro at any hint of impropriety during their search for a coach if you bring me massimino ii , i will bring you two heads , alden said i 've been criticized for saying that and for being hard on the program , but i'm going to stand tall i do n't want us to be put in a position by renegade boosters who put the program in harm s way again he added , the days of secret contracts and golden parachutes are over alden and other regents on the 11member board agree that unlv s past makes full disclosure especially critical the program was placed under probation three times previously under tarkanian other than final approval of the new coach s contract , though , the regents have little power except that of opinion , which they have thrown like dice at harter s and cavagnaro s management of basketball matters , especially the midseason courtship of pitino it s a screwedup way to do it , tom kirkpatrick , a regent , said it s kind of a squirrely thing to do , if you ask me it s not really a search , is it \? another regent , tom wiesner , said they 're doing their jobs and i hardly think there s going to be any rubberstamping of rick pitino or whoever is the next coach the regent douglas seastrand added it s going to be clean we 're committed to that our vision is to carry the team well beyond the ncaa sanctions alden and kirkpatrick were the two dissenters in a 92 vote last year that gave harter another threeyear contract although not necessarily enamored of some decisions on unlv basketball , alden and kirkpatrick say they support harter and cavagnaro in their overall efforts to revive the program and control overzealous boosters we need to make sure that the state does not get obligated to contracts and deals and payoffs we do n't know about , alden said offering his own disclosure , alden said during an interview that he is a good friend of and the tax accountant for bayno of harter , kirkpatrick said , she s already been advised that whatever she brings before the board better have all the t s crossed and all the i s dotted
museums in new york city have been hurting since sept 11 with the big drop in tourism , attendance at some museums is down by as much as 40 percent so there is a lot of scrambling going on shows have been canceled and jobs have been cut but museums are resilient they hold certain things beauty , ideas , history we all want and ca n't find in the same concentration elsewhere that s why , through good times and bad , they have always been able to rely on the kindness of friends and strangers for support people just like to give things to museums objects they love or do n't know what else to do with , or whose worth they can write off whatever the motive , every gift benefits all of us , not least the generations of avid , arthungry new york tourists to come to experience such support in action , you can view some of the recent gifts on display in museums around town the nature of donations varies , from items given outright or promised , to chunks of cash earmarked for acquisitions there s even a jointcustody deal it is called a fractional gift where you get to keep an object you 've donated for part of the year and gifts come in many sizes , from petite to extra large extra large certainly describes the collection of hundreds of truly fabulous objects given by ralph esmerian to the american folk art museum , of which he is chairman many went on view last week in the museum s new building and it describes the ultragem tlich neue galerie new york , museum for german and austrian art , which is basically a splendidly wrapped gift of an entire museum presented to the city obviously not all contributions can be on that scale , but even modest ones are precious , as the following selection of museum gifts suggests the list is in no particular order take it as a randomly packed box of goodies but by all means , in this holiday season traditionally associated with giving , lend your presence to local museums they have endless gifts waiting for you museum of chinese in the americas consider starting in chinatown , which has been uncharacteristically subdued since september this is where you 'll find the museum of chinese in the americas , on the second floor of a centuryold public school building the museum is minute , just two tiny galleries but its permanent collection space designed by the architect billie tsien in the shape of a chinese lantern and filled with steamer trunks , handpainted shop signs and a snarling new year dragon is warm with the traces of urban life , past and present among the most eyecatching entries is an elaborately ornamental chinese opera costume , one with many stories to tell patterned after a manchu court robe and sewn in layers of multicolored silk and satin , it is embroidered with the form of a flying bat , a symbol of happiness , whose tendrilthin wings unfurl across the sleeves the costume was taken to an immigrant community in vancouver , canada , from china , around 1900 it was created for a cantonese opera titled the celestial concubine returns her son , for the character of an immortal who descends from heaven \( to enhance the illusion of otherworldliness , the robe is designed to be quickly turned inside out , revealing an equally spectacular blue robe on its other side \) at some point the robe ended up in the collection of new york city s oldest continuously performing cantonese opera company , the chinese musical and theatrical association when the association moved to smaller headquarters in chinatown , it abandoned some of its old costumes , including this one , which the museum rescued that was in 1989 , so , technically , the robe is n't a fresh acquisition , though it has been added to the permanent gallery only recently as for being a gift \?

henry wilhelm , a foremost authority on the conservation of color photographs , says that the show is an event that will be recorded in the history books and that he is thrilled to be alive to witness it the event is epson s america in detail a photographic collection , a traveling show that is on view both in santa monica , calif , through next sunday and at the navy pier in chicago through april 6 in keeping with the turn that history has been taking recently , the exhibition is in fact a trade advertisement for a new technology history often rides in on the back of new technologies , if less often on brand names still , photographic history has been transported by technologies \( art history sometimes , too \) , so the advances this show represents might indeed end up in the history books if technology does n't eliminate books first on the walls in chicago , and in santa monica at the patricia correia gallery at bergamot station arts center , are 40 large color photographs by stephen wilkes , the largest about three by eight and a half feet these are good , straight , reportorial and engaging pictures of a kind familiar from magazines , about people and places in america in the year 2000 but the real subjects are the newest printers and inksets by epson , the electronics company what these produce is just another printing process , but a process with an uncommon degree of detail at large scale as well as unprecedented longevity the exhibition would be called hyperreal if reality were n't a dirty word by now america in detail indeed the detail is overwhelming and almost unequaled by other color photographs every red and white stripe of the flag is reflected in an airman s eye , every insect swarming over a billboard that advertises food is visible in the photograph the sense of depth is palpable , the sense of light and atmosphere convincing , the color brilliant a hall in grand central terminal grandly recedes behind a workman early sunlight spreads like a blessing over a vineyard and morning mist a palomino s coat stands out rich and warm against a pale green field and a charcoalcolored sky at first glance , these look like just another instance of highcolor , polished reporting of the sort that national geographic and travel advertisements specialize in , but these photographs have actually achieved the optical intensity those only pretended to this is a bit startling marvin heiferman , curator of the show with carole kismaric , said at a press conference when the show was at the chelsea piers in new york in january and february that he kept looking into every office window in a picture of times square to see what was on the walls he sounded like the observer in 1839 who expressed wonder at being able to count every brick in a daguerreotype photography is notorious for giving us more details than the eye can take in unaided , but color photography has not picked up every hair and pore like this andreas gursky s photographs now at the museum of modern art printed in a darkroom , even if often manipulated in the computer beforehand may seem amazingly sharp from a distance , but up close none have anything like the precision of these prints the new experience is like looking at a painting by jan van eyck , who could make you suspect that he habitually regarded the world through a magnifying glass what we used to think of as reality could never live up to the new inkjet prints human eyes are always on information overload millions of bits of information zoom into the brain every minute , but there s an editor there who says , you can handle only so much here s what you 'll see besides , confronting a man instead of a picture , you would n't have the time \( or the effrontery \) to count the hairs in his eyebrows current technology constantly provides greater and greater fidelity , which we consumers lap up old records and cd s are remastered stereo sound to mimic our rightleft hearing has come to cinema , television and computers digital video is being engineered to approximate the richness and clarity of analog film high definition television is on the wish list of millions of people the illusions of virtual reality are becoming increasingly , um , real the less direct contact we have , the more representation we are immersed in , the more we seek to replicate the look and sound of direct experience and even to better it we the consumers feel entitled to demand that the substitutes we live with at least pretend not to be pretenders color photographs up to now have been compromises , but we were accustomed to them no photographer can print quite what he or she saw or what was registered on the negative or transparency because no enlarger can handle it adequately the computer program photoshop , however , can in combination with the right inks , printer and paper and in the hands of a master printmaker like r mac holbert , who printed mr wilkes s images mr wilkes made his photographs with standard cameras and film , then scanned them into a computer mr holbert added nothing that was not there but brought out what was
inhalation anthrax , the form of the disease that killed robert stevens , a photography editor in south florida is so rare that very few doctors have ever seen it but anthrax is a common disease of livestock and other animals in much of the world and the bacterial spores that produce it are commonplace in the soil of many countries in this country , anthrax is rare even among animals , said dr martin e hughjones , an anthrax expert at louisiana state university he said fewer than 100 farm animals contract the disease in the united states in a typical year cases among people are even rarer , and the inhalation form is rarer still anthrax is caused by a bacterium , bacillus anthracis , and is transmitted by spores that can enter the body in three ways it can be inhaled , ingested or can enter the skin through a scratch or cut worldwide , most people who contract anthrax get the cutaneous form , in which spores enter the skin , usually through a cut or a scratch most of the time , these cases occur in people who handle animal hides or wool that contained anthrax spores in the united states , 224 human cases of cutaneous anthrax were reported from 1944 to 1994 in southwest texas this summer , a ranch worker became infected after he cut himself skinning a buffalo that had died of the disease the man recovered after taking antibiotics when anthrax spores infect the skin , the infection starts out like a small itchy insect bite the lesion develops into a pusfilled blister , which crusts into a black scab symptoms include fever , malaise and headache untreated , about a quarter of those affected die because the anthrax bacteria enter the bloodstream , causing an overwhelming infection and releasing toxins treatment with antibiotics reduces the death rate to about 1 percent people who eat undercooked meat from animals that were infected with anthrax can contract gastrointestinal anthrax , in which spores germinate into bacteria in the intestines , causing nausea , vomiting , fever and abdominal pain untreated , about 25 to 60 percent of people with ingestional anthrax die worldwide , relatively few anthrax cases have been gastrointestinal inhalation anthrax , the form that affected the man who died in florida , is extremely rare and by far the most deadly form of the disease only 18 cases were reported in the united states in the 20th century how anthrax works much of what is known about how the disease progresses was learned from a single outbreak , in the soviet union in 1979 , in which 79 people are known to have been infected at once from an accidental release of anthrax spores being grown in a germ warfare laboratory on a military base in sverdlovsk sixtyeight of them died and 42 had autopsies the disease starts when a person inhales spores into the lung once there , the spores travel to lymph nodes in the mediastinum , in the middle of the chest , a journey that can take just a few hours there , in the lymph nodes , in a process the sverdlovsk outbreak shows can take anywhere from days to weeks , the spores in the lymph nodes turn into anthrax bacteria , which begin producing deadly toxins that attack body tissues because the timing of this germination process can vary , it is hard to know until about 60 days have passed if a person who inhales the spores has the disease but once the spores germinate , it does not take long for symptoms to appear , said dr jerome hazen smith , a retired pathologist at the university of texas medical branch at galveston who examined autopsy tissues from the russian anthrax victims they are caused by the toxins , which kill cells and cause fluids to accumulate in tissues the first symptoms are nonspecific like fever , cough , headache , vomiting and chills but within hours to a few days , the disease enters a second phase patients have trouble breathing because their lungs are compressed by fluid in the mediastinum they sweat profusely and go into shock because their blood vessels leak and their blood pressure drops about half the patients have bloodfilled fluid in the tissue covering their brains , which compresses the brain , causing coma and delirium once the second phase begins , death can occur within hours the disease is so distinctive , said dr david walker , a pathologist at the university of texas at galveston who helped examine autopsy material from the russian victims , that a russian pathologist , dr faina a abromova , recognized immediately what had killed them beneath a victim s skull , she saw a hallmark of inhalation anthrax the lining of the brain , filled with blood she said 'oh it s the cardinal s cap i remember that from when i was a student that s anthrax , ' dr walker recalled dr walker said that , for him , the bloodfilled fluid in the mediastinum , the tissue in the middle of the chest , was what tipped him off treating exposed people because there are so few cases of human anthrax , and because it would be unethical to deliberately expose people to the bacteria in tests , little is known about treating people exposed to it but experiments with animals have provided some clues
things are starting to sizzle just in time for the annual interleague theatrics between the mets and yankees a matchup most definitely not be repeated this october , by the way george steinbrenner is naming names of all the people who have failed him he cannot be any happier after last night s 21 failure to montreal in 12 innings that can only be characterized by george as more of the same the owner takes these things personally , but give him credit for this he will spend money for frontline replacements , sooner rather than later the mets on the other hand , have been outspent ever since they were outplayed , outscored and outcheered in their own ballpark last october the mets fell asleep all winter hearing let s go , yankees ! echoing in their ears some of them have not woken up yet after these serial drubbings , the mets were not about to be outcontroversied by the yankees , not if bobby valentine could help it last night , just before the 103 laugher victory in baltimore , the manager issued an impromptu mea culpa we basically started the season thinking we were n't good enough , valentine volunteered he added i think they thought we were going to add stuff during the winter or change it during spring training , and by the time the season started , there was just that feeling that maybe they were n't good enough the manager then said that has been my fault one thing i have n't been able to do is convince them they are good enough that s my job but we still have plenty of time to convert the nonbeliever valentine is being much too hard on himself he must not beat himself up about whether he failed to motivate his lads these guys are professionals they can look around it was quite apparent when they headed north that the mets of 2001 did not have \( a \) the arms and \( b \) the bats to equal their splendid season of 2000 what was valentine going to do , emulate the late chuck dressen , who once instructed his brooklyn dodgers to hold the other team and he would think of something \? it may sound a trifle nixonian for valentine to take so much blame on his shoulders , since it raises the question of just who was responsible for the outages on the mound and at the plate the general manager \? the owners \? or the listless mets themselves \? valentine does have a point this slump may have begun when derek jeter looked like an alien come down from some superior planet , to show the mets just how far away they were from world championship status at the time , the mets were conducting a strange mating dance with alex rodriguez , who seemed afraid he might catch something in the tacky joint in flushing the mets , for reasons known only to them , blew arod away every minute since last year , there was this thought , this idea out there , that we 're going to do all these things , and the more they hear that , they just deduce the reason we 're going to do all these things is because we need to , valentine said last night i'm sure there s some rationalization that went through their minds when people said , 'why did n't you beat the yankees \? ' and part of the rationalization was we were one player short , or something like that , valentine concluded it was more than one player after awhile mike hampton snubbed them , went to colorado who knew he would hit five home runs and win nine games , so far \? when gary sheffield basically begged to come to the mets , there was a general impression that steve phillips could not make it happen or maybe it came from the owners phillips seemed to be taken aback by valentine s essentially unsolicited remarks last night i have n't seen that , phillips said of the players' alleged defeatism none of them have shared that with me i find it hard to believe that would impact us in that sort of a significant way valentine , who has differed with phillips in the past , said later that he was not criticizing the personnel decisions , only the way the team has reacted but the issue has been raised one difference between the mets and yankees is that on the yankees the owner throws the potshots he has quite noticeably not extended the contract of joe torre , who merely won four world championships in the last five years if this season gets away , what has torre done for george lately \? ticktock , ticktock both new york teams are attached to smoldering fuses , just in time for them to be locked into the same ballpark this weekend photo bobby valentine \( barton silverman \)
sofia , bulgaria , july 24 the king has won most of the attention , but a few facts have not escaped note about the two americaneducated investment bankers who , as of today , are among the most powerful people in the new order of bulgaria first is their age the new finance minister is 35 and the deputy prime minister in charge of the economy is only 31 second , in a nation where the average monthly wage is just over 100 , are the salaries they just left behind two ministers quit 715 , 000 jobs , a frontpage headline in the leading daily newspaper read on monday the paper did not neglect to say that , as ministers , they will now earn only 450 a month i really ca n't comment , the new finance minister , milen velchev , a former vice president with merrill lynch in london , said with some embarrassment today when asked about his old salary king simeon ii , the deposed child czar whom parliament officially approved as prime minister today , preferred not to disclose many specifics during the campaign that ended in a sweep last month for his new party and so the people of bulgaria a poor nation that is nonetheless a haven of stability in the troubled balkans are looking for fresh clues about his intentions in the faces of the 16 people also approved today to form his new cabinet at first glance , some say , his choice of a cabinet appears to show him keeping his promise to appoint professionals , untainted by the corruption and cronyism that has angered bulgarians in fact , most are untainted by government at all like the king himself , few in the new cabinet have any political experience none have ever been a minister rather than looking for jobs to reward his people , he is actually trying to find the best people to fill the particular jobs , mr velchev said that s why most of them are experts in their fields , not politicians but some bulgarians express at least mild concern about having so many unknown faces running the government particularly given king simeon s now famous unwillingness to reveal too much this is the first time in the last 12 years or so to have prominent politicians you know nothing about , said boyan belev of the center for the study of democracy , a research institute in sofia it does n't have to be bad i think it s not but he has to talk about it , he added , because bulgarians are now used to hearing about the personal and professional accomplishments of their politicians the less transparent , the public fears , the less democratic ivan stancioff , a bulgarian businessman who is the former ambassador to britain , praised king simeon s courage in taking on the job of prime minister , a much grittier job than the largely ceremonial post of president that he was thought to prefer when he first entered the political fray in his native land more than five decades after being forced by the communists to flee but , mr stancioff said , today marks a new phase in his new political career he s proven that he can be successful in getting votes , he said he is successful because he has said very little he has said nothing obviously that is over he has to produce today , in a speech to parliament , king simeon outlined in broad strokes what he has called his 800day drive for reform in bulgaria he promised a speededup improvement in living standards , a fight against corruption , an increase in foreign investment and the lowering of personal and corporate taxes he also repeated his promise to push bulgaria toward membership in nato and the european union the king had reportedly been undecided about joining with european defenses , but in the end he picked as his foreign minister a mathematician named solomon passi , who has campaigned for more than a decade for bulgaria to join nato today we stand a real chance of being able to usher bulgaria into the new 21st century and take the place we deserve in united europe , king simeon , who is 64 and who fled bulgaria in 1946 , living mostly in spain , said in his speech in parliament the king s party , the national movement for simeon ii , won exactly half of the 240 parliamentary seats last month , and joined in a ruling coalition with the turk movement for rights and freedom to ensure a working majority in the legislature ethnic turks make up roughly 10 percent of the nation s eight million people and , while they have had some say in government before , today marks the first time they have held ministerial seats two cabinet posts were given to turks , the agriculture ministry and a minister without portfolio ahmed dogan , leader of the turkish party , today noted what he called a historic moment for turks in bulgaria , who faced repression in the 1980 s during communist rule and remain far poorer than most bulgarians we are prepared to bear the responsibility for being in government , he said in parliament the previous government , the union of democratic forces , was credited with many reforms that moved bulgaria forward economically , and the country has grown for the last three years but voters were angry because living standards are still low , unemployment is high and the economy remains the most pressing issue for bulgarians and so king simeon s economic team has perhaps attracted the most interest mr velchev began his career in the foreign ministry , then studied on a fulbright fellowship , first at the university of rochester in new york and then at the massachusetts institute of technology the 31yearold deputy prime minister , nikolai vassilov , studied at the state university of new york in oswego and at brandeis university an investment banker most recently with lazard capital markets in london , he became well known in bulgaria during the last two years through a program in which bulgarians working abroad commented on government reforms the two men have given themselves 800 days to produce tangible change but today was given over both to celebration and the mundane nice office , mr velchev said , in his new , and bare , space in the grand finance ministry building in downtown sofia still trying to find out if the phones work photo king simeon

moscow , april 3 foes of the russian press baron vladimir a gusinsky breached the walls of his media empire at last today , staging a renegade stockholders' meeting at which they appeared to seize control of the prize asset , the nationwide ntv television network the day s events touched off an extraordinary scene this evening on ntv , the only network not under effective state control , as its journalists and supporters mounted a marathon broadcast to protest what they call an illdisguised takeover by interests of the kremlin mr gusinsky , a frequent critic of president vladimir v putin , has cast the struggle over ntv and ediamost , the holding company for his businesses , as a key test of russia s shaky press freedom aides to mr gusinsky called the meeting today illegal and meaningless , and promised to fight it in court but in an especially telling blow to mr gusinsky , whose battle has been buoyed largely by western support , the deciding shares were cast by american investors who had , until now , largely sat out the battle apparently at their behest , mr gusinsky s opponents also selected a new york investor with extensive holdings in russia , boris a jordan , as the network s general director and they placed vladimir m kulistikov , a former ntv journalist who once worked for the american government s radio liberty and the kremlin press agency ria novosti , in charge of news operations in a meeting late today with reporters , mr jordan said he hoped to recruit a foreign investor quickly to buy at least a third of ntv s shares , something he said would give the network fiscal stability and a public image of political independence he insisted that he would not permit the network s news programs to be compromised by government pressure i have gotten guarantees from the shareholders that they will not meddle in news judgments , he said i think they 'll think twice before doing it with me none of this mollified ntv s supporters , including the former soviet leader , mikhail s gorbachev , who appeared on the network tonight to denounce the shareholders' vote it s a challenge to all society , said mr gorbachev , the chairman of a public council established by ntv to monitor and protect the network s independence all attempts to present it as something legal are futile the stockholders' meeting was called by a unit of gazprom , the statedominated naturalgas monopoly , which is both a shareholder and by far the largest creditor of mediamost gazprom , which is 38 percent state owned , guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in loans for mr gusinsky s company , only to be forced to make good on the debts after russia s fiscal collapse in 1998 left mediamost unable to pay off the balance as mr gusinsky fell into disfavor with mr putin last year , gazprom officials refused to give mediamost a new grace period for the loans , and asked state prosecutors to investigate suspicions that the company was moving its assets offshore mr gusinsky has been under investigation at least since last may , and fled russia last june he is now fighting extradition from spain , where he is under house arrest it has long been clear that ntv and mediamost were in fiscal straits that made them vulnerable to gazprom s attacks mediamost officials say ntv has registered a profit in only one quarter since it was founded in 1993 mr gusinsky built an empire of newspapers , magazines , cable and satellite television and theaters through the 1990 s , largely with borrowed money the 1998 economic crisis swept through russia just as he was preparing to sell stock in ntv on international exchanges , a move that could have pumped millions into the company and perhaps forestalled the showdown today mr gusinsky s situation has not been helped by the fact that the head of gazprom media , his principal creditor , is a former kremlin official who was bitterly assailed by his media outlets mr jordan , the new yorker who will apparently control the network , is also an old gusinsky rival from the mid1990 s , when mr jordan advised competitors who bid successfully for a stake in russia s national telephone monopoly but politics and rivalries aside , the shareholder revolt would not have succeeded had ntv s american stakeholder not sided 1 2with gazprom the investor , the capital research and management company , is a los angelesbased unit of the capital group of companies inc , which has some 30 billion invested in emerging markets around the world the company also has holdings in russia s telecommunications industry gazprom media owns 46 percent of ntv as a result of an agreement in november with mr gusinsky that raised its stake in return for forgiving some of mediamost s debt capital research owns 44 percent of ntv , giving the two a bare majority in the vote today mr gusinsky owns 4956 percent of the network s stock , but some 19 per cent of that is pledged against loans due in july , and its validity in shareholder votes is in dispute mr gusinsky did not vote his shares today mr jordan said today that he deplored any political persecution of mr gusinsky and admired him as a man ahead of his time i think his contribution to the development of a free press in this country has been enormous , he said i ca n't say much for his financial management mr jordan was sharply critical of the network s management a preliminary review of ntv s books , he said , indicates that the network has never consistently made money and has a negative net worth many suppliers of programs have not been paid , he said , and employees have been paid in part with loans many never intended for repayment that still sit on the company s books he said he has already talked with ted turner , the founder of cable news network , about taking a stake in ntv , and indicated that he will also seek proposals from media companies in germany and other parts of europe mr turner has also talked with mr gusinsky about buying a share of the network , but those discussions have yet to bear fruit photos boris a jordan , above , of new york , told yesterday how he and a state agency gained control of the russian

vincent van gogh made virtually nothing from his paintings james joyce , the author , lived in poverty and america s school bus drivers earn , on average , just 1076 an hour despite their relative penury , these people can teach a lesson to american companies about executive compensation after all , one of the main arguments offered in defense of skyhigh pay for chief executives is that they need incentives to do a good job but is money such a great motivator \? in some ways , yes systems that radically divorce productivity from reward are destined to fail , as they have in the past yet it should come as no surprise that , once their basic needs are met , people are motivated by a lot more than money and the better the job , the less important money seems to be consider joe dimaggio he cared deeply about money and bitterly resented the feudal system that deprived him of bargaining power with the new york yankees despite feeling underpaid , he still managed to be a great baseball player similarly , van gogh and joyce excelled without multimilliondollar stock options and school bus drivers apparently need no great financial incentive to keep our children safe the president of the united states , meanwhile , has an annual salary of 400 , 000 , a pittance for a highpowered executive \( it was just 200 , 000 until january , when it was increased for the first time since 1969 \) yet there is never a shortage of candidates for that job among the 50 states , not a single governorship has gone begging for want of bonuses and stock options is running a public company so much more onerous \? is that why john f welch jr of general electric made 1445 million last year \? and did it get so much harder for the admittedly able mr welch that he deserved an increase of more than 100 percent from the previous year \? none of this is to say that gigantic paydays are bad i myself would love to enjoy a few , and bernie williams , dimaggio s latest successor as the yankees' center fielder , is entitled to whatever astronomical sum he can get , since the free agent system amounts to an open auction for his services the problem is that the pay of america s chief executives is not much subject to the discipline of the marketplace the whole process is far too chummy , with many executives in effect paying themselves and claiming that they will do a good job only for a compensation package that would make croesus blush despite chief executives' insatiable needs for incentives , there is a body of evidence suggesting that pay for performance is not a very effective workplace motivator , at least when compared with others like giving employees a sense of mission , worth and proprietorship pay for performance probably is most effective in settings where the work is n't much fun and the output can be counted easily piecework pay for making widgets will generally result in more widgets per hour worked but it begs credulity to suggest that an extra 10 million for the chief executive will finally make him put his nose to the grindstone the late w edwards deming , a guru of quality control , was a particularly vigorous opponent of trying to pay for performance , as andrea gabor points out in the capitalist philosophers \( times books \) deming believed that if you hired the right people for the right jobs and put them into the right environment , everyone would perform pretty well pay for performance is particularly dubious in bad times during a recession , ms gabor writes , pay for performance becomes a zerosum game that produces more losers than winners a bigger slice for the chief executive can mean smaller slices for everyone else with the economy slowing and stocks in a slump , shareholders may finally become less tolerant of excessive executive compensation and severance packages in effect , the chiefs will have to do more work for less money i predict , and you heard it here first , that there will be no wholesale resignations , despite the great hardships of running businesses on a few million dollars less america s chief executives will just have to learn what any school bus driver can already tell you money is n't everything drawing \( david suter \)
washington , oct 20 after 40 days of the most aggressive criminal investigation in american history , federal law enforcement officials have arrested 830 people but have failed to develop evidence that anyone now in custody was a conspirator in the sept 11 terror attacks despite pursuing more than 365 , 000 tips from the public , senior investigators in the united states acknowledged that most of their promising leads for finding accomplices and some of their longheld suspicions about several suspects have unraveled beyond that , none of the nearly 100 people still being sought by the federal bureau of investigation is seen as a major suspect , law enforcement officials said there is no one in that group that i 'd want someone to wake me up at 3 o'clock in the morning to tell me about , a government official said investigators' latest hope for a break was dashed late this week in chicago on oct 11 , the arrests of nine egyptian men living in evansville , ind , had sent ripples of excitement through law enforcement circles two senior law enforcement officials said there was speculation that the men were an al qaeda cell plotting a terrorist attack federal authorities had learned that one of the men had recently taken flying lessons and that they lived together in indiana and sent money home to egypt , a law enforcement official said the men were sent to chicago for questioning , but on thursday night , with investigators' suspicions evaporating , seven of the nine were released one was still in custody and another faced only immigration charges one of the men released , tarek albasti , 29 , a part owner of the crazy tomato restaurant in evansville , had been arrested while making a pot of spaghetti during the dinner rush that night as it turned out , the flight lessons that apparently made him appear suspicious were a gift from his fatherinlaw , a lawyer and former united states diplomat who is also a pilot the widespread arrests began the day of the terrorist attacks , and the numbers mounted as agents tracked down people through logs of the hijackers' cellphones , through interviews with their neighbors and through tips phoned in or sent to the fbi s web site but none of those arrested have been accused of playing a supporting role in the hijackings most are being held on unrelated immigration violations , traffic violations or charges of falsifying documents , prompting complaints from civil rights advocates and immigration lawyers but the arrests have a purpose beyond the investigation of the sept 11 attacks to prevent more attacks on that score , officials say the detentions have been much more successful senior government officials say they believe they have captured at least 10 members of osama bin laden s network , al qaeda , who may have been involved in cells planning other attacks while there is no firm evidence of specific plots that have been thwarted , one senior law enforcement official said , we know we 've changed the atmosphere officials also say that they believe arrests in other counties since sept 11 have disrupted planned attacks investigators say they know the hijackers received financial and logistical support from a small group of al qaeda lieutenants outside the country , and the investigation has increasingly focused overseas but , one senior government official said , we have seen no evidence of a big network here that helped them out the search for potential conspirators in this country has centered on nearly 20 material witnesses who are believed to have important information and have been brought to manhattan for detention but in recent weeks at least nine of them have been released from jail , officials said , and those still in custody are not cooperating we are getting into squeeze time , a senior official said we are getting them before grand juries and confronting them with financial records and phone records , and it will be harder for some people to dodge and weave in the last 10 days , two men have been charged with lying to the grand juries investigating the attacks one was charged in phoenix with giving false statements to the federal investigators about his association with hani hanjour , the hijacker believed to have piloted the jet that crashed into the pentagon a jordanian man attending college in california was charged with making false statements describing his association with two other hijackers , nawaf alhazmi and khalid almihdhar the charges allow the authorities to keep the men in jail while they continue to investigate but law enforcement officials say there is no evidence either man had advance knowledge of the sept 11 plot investigators have established connections between the hijackers and about two dozen people now in custody , although those connections are only casual shortly after the hijackings , the fbi thought it had stumbled onto a cell of young arab men in san diego who might have helped two of the hijackers the agency became interested in at least five men , most of them college students , through a tantalizing lead the first name and the phone number of one of them , osama awadallah , was found scrawled on a piece of paper in the 1988 toyota corolla that mr alhazmi , had left in a parking garage at dulles international airport in virginia on sept 11 before boarding american airlines flight 77 , which hit the pentagon
east rutherford , nj , nov 11 never mind that the jets' defenders were quick , relentless , tenacious , clever and more in today s 277 drubbing of the kansas city chiefs maybe their most impressive accomplishment was that none of them seemed satisfied they said they were still learning , still getting comfortable with their new coaches and new schemes , still expecting improvement the chiefs are hardly an elite team , and the jets' defense kept the chiefs' offense under control from the start the chiefs gained only 224 yards , averaging 37 yards a play the jets caused four turnovers , and three of them two interceptions and a fumble led to 17 points the chiefs' longest completion \( 25 yards \) and longest run \( 13 yards \) came when the jets were leading by 270 trent green , the chiefs' quarterback , was impressed they really put the pressure on , he said give them credit it may have been the defense s best game of the season coach herman edwards would say only that defensively , we played pretty good strong safety victor green said the defense had played pretty solid outside linebacker james farrior called the defensive effort one of our better games nose tackle steve martin s word was effective while john abraham , the energetic secondyear defensive end , said he thought the defense had played pretty well , he quickly added we missed a lot of plays we should have made some of my pressures should have been sacks there were no worries for the defensive line , a source of concern most of the season abraham had 11 tackles \( 9 unassisted \) , 1 1 2 sacks and a forced fumble defensive tackle shane burton batted two passes \( intercepting one \) and had a sack farrior made 12 tackles , 10 unassisted abraham and outside linebacker mo lewis pursued adamantly from the weak side as farrior explained , the defense did what it had to do the game plan was good , he said just stop the run they had a good running back in priest holmes we stopped him holmes carried 18 times for 71 yards after the game s first possession , he did not trouble the jets because , steve martin said , we made a little change one guy up , one guy back and he did n't hurt us again trent green , the chiefs' passer , did little damage we saw on film that he had a low release , burton said , so we went in there with our hands up that gave us a quick turnover we always talk about getting a turnover early and setting the tempo after that , it was a matter of getting on the quarterback and watching for draws and screens ray mickens , the nickel back , said it was also a matter of keeping the chiefs from knowing what the jets' secondary would do basically , mickens said , we can disguise our coverages better earlier this year , the calls were good , but we just were n't playing them right today , we did a good job sometimes we were playing man and zone on the same play after the fact , it all sounds easy but mickens said the jets had to be sure they treated the chiefs as a team that could beat them this was a sandwich game , mickens said the rest of the sandwich was new orleans last week and miami next week those are two good teams , and the coach emphasized that we could n't go out lackadaisical and look to miami abraham has been improving by the week , and he sees the defensive unit doing the same the defense is n't there , not yet , he said when we get to be where we need , we will be a good team burton likes what he sees we do n't have a lot of big egos on defense , he said we 've got a lot of good players today , those good players won a more or less ugly game when the jets hear the word ugly , they often smile if the final score was 270 , farrior said , this would have been pretty but there was a little joke going around the locker room all week that we 're the ugliest 53 team now i guess we 're the ugliest 63 team photo john abraham pulling down the chiefs' dante hall abraham was in on 11 tackles and had 1 1 2 sacks \( barton silverman the new york times \)

the nation s first economic downturn in 10 years began , like many of its predecessors , with a drop in factory orders along the manufacturing spine that runs from the great lakes to the gulf of mexico by early this year , the slump had spread to the technology cubicles of silicon valley and elsewhere , courtesy of the deflation of the internet bubble but in the three months since sept 11 , the recession s narrow early focus has been lost the downturn has quickly become one of the broadest on record every large industry , save health care and housing , is shrinking almost every state is losing jobs unemployment has risen for nearly every group , climbing most sharply for college graduates and others who usually escape the brunt of a downturn however weakened , today s economy remains much stronger than it was in the 1980 s or early 90 s many fewer people are out of work today than then yet most remarkably , the blanket of recession has managed to cover the country despite remaining relatively thin this is a very broadbased , shallow recession , said mark zandi , the chief economist at economycom , a consulting firm in west chester , pa in resorts around lake tahoe , in california and nevada , hotels are offering rooms for 39 a night to keep up their business in boston and elsewhere , temporaryhelp agencies continue to pare their payrolls business is still weak in technology centers like san jose , calif and oldline industries like steel and textiles , which were shrinking even before the recession began , are faring even worse now almost no part of the country has been spared , mr zandi said , but nearly every part of the country is worse off than it was a year ago and the magnitude of the decline has been unusually uniform this pattern contrasts with the patchwork of past recessions , when layoffs were concentrated in a few regions and among those who worked with their hands on assembly lines and construction sites the recession of 199091 was the first to leave large numbers of whitecollar workers jobless , but it still did not spread its pain equitably , pushing the northeast and california into such a deep hole that they did not catch up with the rest of the country for several years even the vast service sector , which normally serves as the economic stabilizer , is now suffering it has lost more jobs since september than it did in any other threemonth period since world war ii people who remain secure in their jobs are receiving smaller salary increases than they did in recent years , and many welloff americans whose prodigal spending helped fuel the boom will be receiving much smaller bonus checks in coming weeks than they did in recent years the end of rapid income growth could make consumers thrifty for months , some economists worry , and could mean that the recovery gets off to a slow start still , with interest rates and energy prices low , forecasters expect the recession to end early next year , even if they disagree about how strong the recovery will be the breadth of the current downturn is not solely the result of the shock caused by the terrorist attacks in recent years , as many cities and towns have lured companies from elsewhere with tax breaks and cash grants , regional economies have diversified and begun to look more alike between march , when the recession officially began , and november , 37 states lost more jobs than they gained many of those states , now grappling with revenue shortfalls , are considering budget cuts that themselves are likely to aggravate the downturn although the 199091 recession was more severe than this downturn , employment fell in only 31 states through its first eight months for many younger people , who have known nothing but prosperity since they entered the work force , the new situation has come as a shock many without work are unsure how soon they will be able to find a job that pays as much as their old one did growing up , you never heard of this this did n't happen to my friends' parents , said allegra kochman , a 31yearold graduate of dartmouth and columbia who was laid off this month , along with 40 other people , from her job at an architecture firm in new york i was stunned , said ms kochman , who was locked in a stairwell the night she was laid off , when her company turned off her electronic key before she was finished cleaning out her desk this is n't supposed to be happening travel the industry hurt the most snow for the nearby ski slopes was on its way outside a huge casino in southern lake tahoe in nevada , but inside , the chairman of harrah s entertainment inc was anxiously watching the chips fall instead those are 100 chips , said philip g satre , harrah s chief executive , peering across the floor of the casino at an elderly man seated at a nearly empty poker table the problem , from mr satre s standpoint , was that there were not enough of them when mr satre s eyes lit upon six young players clustered around a nearby game , however , they brightened i like that table , he said it s fully occupied
baltimore , dec 31 once the baltimore ravens shut down your running game , once they decide that you must pass the ball because there will not be successful sweeps or traps or draws no running lanes allowed , period then your offense sags and melts even executing the most routine offensive play becomes an adventure game over and in this case , for the denver broncos , season over , too baltimore strangled the denver offense in a 213 playoff victory today before 69 , 638 fans the largest crowd ever at psinet stadium it was a complete victory for baltimore , which improved to 134 and advanced to play at the tennessee titans on sunday the baltimore defense crippled the broncos , the american football conference s best offense , in a variety of ways denver ran 61 plays , but only 18 were rushing attempts that was because the broncos , with the rookie back mike anderson , rushed for only 42 yards anderson , a 1 , 500yard rusher this season , had 40 denver managed only 177 yards and averaged 29 yards per play quarterback brian griese sat out the game because of a shoulder injury and gus frerotte \( 13 of 28 for 124 yards , with an interception \) looked off track and spooked he was sacked five times and twice as often was hit hard when i see a quarterback trying to get the snap and get out from under center so quick that he s dropping the ball , i know he thinks he s in trouble from our pass rush , ravens safety kim herring said frerotte started doing that in the second quarter ravens cornerback robert bailey said sure , we made them onedimensional , and that played right into our hands they threw a lot of stuff at us , but we were up for it denver tried quick runs quick passes the left , right and middle attacked none of it worked they controlled the tempo of the game right from the beginning , denver coach mike shanahan said they are good great defenses step up in the playoffs , and that s exactly what they did i do n't know if you are ever confident that you can run the ball successfully any time a team goes 33 games without letting someone gain 100 yards , you know they are pretty darn good we wanted to keep a scenario where they had to respect the run , so they could n't tee off and go right after the quarterback if you put this defense into a onedimensional game , you are in for a long time make that 34 games now that the ravens have not allowed a 100yard rusher for the ravens , however , the rookie back jamal lewis rushed 30 times for 110 yards and 2 touchdowns he produced the game s first score on a 1yard run early in the second quarter it was actually a leap and dive in which lewis landed and stretched the tip of the ball over the goal line before the score , lewis had broken free on a 20yard run all afternoon , lewis looked focused and ready , while anderson looked frustrated and trapped i went in there and pounded it and got a feel for the game , lewis said i just tried to hit the hole hard and take what i could get i was n't worried so much about their rookie back i was just worried about making sure i was playing next week' denver scored its only points a 31yard field goal by jason elam with 4 minutes 31 seconds left before halftime but 25 seconds later , tight end shannon sharpe , a former bronco , pierced his old team a trent dilfer pass meant for lewis bounced off his hands and then off the chest of denver cornerback terrell buckley sharpe was running near the play , grabbed the ball and ran 58 yards down the right sideline right in front of the denver bench for a touchdown he was freed on the run by a sensational , menacing block from fullback sam gash on broncos linebacker bill romanowski that s the same offense over there only without john elway and a healthy terrell davis , sharpe said , omitting the fact that he , too , was a key part of denver s super bowl champion offenses they 're the no 1 offense in the afc for a reason , but today they just ran up against a great defense i was in the right place at the right time on my score i have a lot of love and respect for those guys i think that s why i did n't go overboard with the touchdown lewis added a punctuation mark with his second touchdown , a 27yard run late in the third quarter in which he broke through several arm tackles at the line of scrimmage the ravens were ahead , 213 , and denver was dead there was no way the broncos could rebound now because the baltimore pass rush simply teed off , eventually knocking frerotte woozy and out of the game now come the titans , a divisional opponent baltimore knows them well this game was strictly about playing passionate and being physical , baltimore coach brian billick said i think denver has the most balanced offense and the best offense in the national football league , so you can take that and tell what i think about our defense photo the ravens overwhelmed the broncos' mike anderson , holding him to 40 rushing yards \( associated press \)
the man on the phone from bombay was exceptionally polite , almost grave his author photo is grave as well , a formal study in grays in which the author , in a suit , leans against some sort of distressed stump or pillar while gazing very seriously into the camera this man , manil suri , 41 , a professor of mathematics at the university of maryland , baltimore county , who was in bombay visiting his parents in december , looks simultaneously too stylish for a mathematician and too precise for a novelist he responded to a wandering observational query like this to begin with the first part of your question one wonders about the possible impact of fame on a man like this , whose only other appearance in print \( before the new yorker ran an excerpt of the death of vishnu \) was a short story called the tyranny of vegetables , which was about vegetables taking over the world it ran in a bulgarian journal it s in bulgarian , suri said with relief , so no one can read it before the death of vishnu , his first novel , suri wrote what he said was an average of one story a year , none concerning india , all of which \( save the vegetable saga \) were rejected , and an unfinished novel about a woman in pittsburgh who has an affair with an indian student he wrote two chapters of the death of vishnu in 1995 , then waited until 1997 to begin the third when he got to the third chapter , he found that he was stuck , because an ambulance had arrived to take vishnu , his main , semidead character , away , which would effectively end the story he pondered this problem for another year and a half i remarked that he seemed to be patient suri , surprised , replied it was a hobby something to do on the side while i was doing mathematics that was the big question that confronted me in '97 should i just concentrate on math , or continue with this novel that had been languishing \? he sounded as if he still might be considering this crisis of faith , slightly fate intervened in the person of michael cunningham , with whom suri took a fiveday course at the fine arts work center in provincetown , mass cunningham told suri to forget about the stories , including one suri had been working on for five years , and do everything in his power to finish the novel then i thought , suri said , that maybe i could do this things began to move more rapidly after that , and by 1999 suri had an agent and a draft where the stories had often taken flight into the surreal , the novel , which is very human and comic and not about the tragic ambition of vegetables at all , mined the real in the apartment building where suri grew up , and where his parents still live , a man named vishnu did indeed live and die on the landing woven into the text are shimmery strands of sex and plot , which suri says he learned from the harold robbins and arthur hailey novels he borrowed from bombay libraries as a child also present are the many , many hindi movies he was raised on , since his father worked as an assistant to composers of music for those movies hindi movies , he explained , are extremely tragic , just one horrible thing after another but in the book it s almost a camp sensibility in relation to these movies he added , and i 've been through this , the fighting neighbors , though since i'm not living there anymore , i can bring out the comic aspects that were n't apparent to me when i was in it because his parents still live in the building , i asked if suri thinks the people there will read the book he laughed hmmm i hope not no , that s not what i really meant it would be nice the only people i know are my parents' immediate neighbors , and i do n't know if they read books his mother has already read it , closely , as it progressed one of suri s main objectives was not to bore her suri said that he also gave a few copies of the book to other people in his family , who promised to read it but apparently have n't i'm just learning how tricky that is , he remarked , to give someone a book , even if they ask for it math takes new , human shape in the novel as well , in terms of both method and material andrew wiles , who cracked fermat s last theorem , said that when you 're trying to prove a theorem in mathematics , it s like entering a dark room , feeling your way , seeing a bit of light and then finally finding your way out , suri said and cunningham told me the same thing you find your character , and then look around and see what options are available to him when i'm writing a proof , i put myself in the position of a mathematical entity you have some quantity , x , say , and you want to find out if it s bounded by some other number , so you push against it in his applied mathematics work , which concerns the numerical analysis of stress , suri is always trying to come up with the most abstract theorem , because the more abstract the theorem , the more applicable it is to many situations planes , bridges , heart attacks i almost think of the building like that , he said it s india , or the various stages of hinduism , or just what it is and , suri pointed out , in a passage in which the highly cerebral mr jalal has a revelatory vision of vishnu as a god made of multiple , aweinspiring suns , the passage of the bhagavadgita he is envisioning is the same one that the physicist robert oppenheimer quoted when he witnessed the atomic blast politely , gravely , suri has built an abstract structure in which all these elements live and talk and argue together , as if they were neighbors sharing a common kitchen , a common death harold robbins , hindi cinema , robert oppenheimer , the bhagavadgita , x , various gods and his mother a less patient man might have given up i asked suri if he would say he s a believer as a bombay car horn honked , he said i think i started the book as a nonbeliever , but around the fifth chapter , when i read the bhagavadgita for the first time , i found it so amazing , just in a secular sense i find myself reading it a lot , especially at night he mentioned his identification with mr jalal , the character in the death of vishnu who tries so hard to resolve the contradiction between faith and science i think in the next book , he speculated , there will be a mr jalallike character who will go farther , perhaps photo \( norton marion ettlinger \)
the six firefighters would have moved faster if they had n't stopped to help a weary woman trying to flee they would have moved slower if they had n't been able to coax her along , to tell her that if she wanted to see her children and grandchildren again , she had to keep moving down the stairs it was that precise intersection of rescuers and rescued , that destined bit of timing , not a few seconds less or more , that enabled them all to survive inside a twisted stairwell of the world trade center when the north tower crashed down on them the woman and the firefighters , in the actions each took , saved each other almost all of the stories about firefighters summoned to the world trade center on sept 11 have been stories of brave men who went into the towers and never returned the story of six men of ladder company 6 is a rare happy story it is the tale of a group of men and one woman trapped for three hours inside a sliver of stairs , lucky enough to be between the second and fourth floors , for there were no longer any floors above them , and beneath them was impassable debris but they kept their wits until the sun shone through and they climbed out there s no reason we should be alive , firefighter matt komorowski said ladder company 6 is on canal street in chinatown it usually fights fires in nearby tenement buildings , only occasionally having to enter the city s skyscrapers on the morning of the 11th , six men were on duty mike meldrum , mr komorowski , bill butler , tom falco , sal d'agostino and the captain , john jonas five of them were sitting inside the firehouse when they heard a loud noise captain jonas thought it was a truck plunging off the manhattan bridge matt komorowski was out front , getting ready to go home he and the house watchman saw a plane slipping between the buildings the watchman said into the intercom , a plane just hit the world trade center within minutes , the members of ladder 6 parked their fire truck in front of the towers debris rained down as they hurried into the lobby of 1 world trade center a woman whose hair and clothes had been melted off passed them someone was assisting her two bodies lay on the floor awaiting their assignment , they saw a shadow on the ground and then heard an eruption the second plane striking the other tower captain jonas said , oh my god , they 're trying to kill us they had to begin rescuing people the men , each carrying about 100 pounds of gear , entered stairway b and climbed people descending cheered them on captain jonas figured the fire had probably spread as low as the 80th floor he had to pace his men or they would be too spent to help every 8 or 10 floors they rested when they reached the 27th floor , the entire building shook the other tower had collapsed ok , if that building can go , the captain announced , this building can go it s time to head down descending , bill butler noticed a man who he thought looked middle eastern , clutching a stuffed animal , possibly a lion police officers grabbed him , handcuffed him , and hustled him down the stairs the stuffed lion fell on the ground somewhere around the 14th or 15th floor , they encountered a middleaged woman her name was josephine harris she worked for the port authority and had been walking down from the 73rd floor she was exhausted bill butler folded her arm around his neck and began moving i could hear the clock ticking in the back of my head , captain jonas said i'm thinking , 'c'mon , c'mon we 've got to keep moving' they would n't think of abandoning ms harris but they recognized that she was slowing them down others were passing them and moving out of sight ms harris collapsed nearing the fourth floor mr butler asked her about her family she told him she had grown children and grandchildren mr butler said , your grandchildren and your kids want to see you at home you 've got to pick up the pace here tom falco lifted her from the other side captain jonas scoured the fourth floor for a chair to carry her in neither the nearby swiveling receptionist s chair nor some couches would work he returned to the stairwell mr komorowski was last in line he felt an incredible rush of wind he urged everyone to move faster and then the tower collapsed everything starts heaving , captain jonas said unbelievable noise everything flying around tremendous dust clouds i'm thinking , 'i ca n't believe this is how it ends for me' matt komorowski , last in the line , was hurled two flights and found himself in front of the others the men were spread out in the stairwell between the second and fourth floors four other rescue workers were trapped as well two firefighters , a port authority police officer and a fire department chief , rich picciotta they had cuts and bruises they were caked with dust voices rang out hey , tommy , you ok \? hey , billy , you there \? mr butler opened his eyes and saw something rise out of the dust like the blob coming out of the water in a horror movie it was ms harris all 11 of them were alive they assumed that just a part of the tower had collapsed bill butler thought it was a bomb that had exploded inside the stuffed lion
san francisco , feb 13 a day after napster suffered a crippling legal blow , officials within the company scrambled to chart a legal and business future , while skeptical industry analysts said napster might never become profitable , and might eventually fade away last year , when it announced that it was joining forces with the german media giant bertelsmann , the company said it planned to gravitate to becoming a forpay membershipbased service but hank barry , the company s chief executive , said today that he did not yet know when napster would have the technology in place to make the transition in the meantime , mr barry said he was uncertain whether napster could continue to operate given the limitations imposed by monday s legal decision that ruling , by a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit here , largely affirmed a lower court decision that found napster , which allows users to exchange music free over the internet , abets the infringement of copyrights held by the major record labels the appellate ruling sent the case back to the lower court with instructions to narrow a preliminary injunction originally ordered in july to prevent napster from being used to exchange unauthorized songs the court said such an injunction must at the same time respect the technological limitations that napster faces in policing its service lawyers representing the record industry and several musicians said they believed that it would be simple to fashion an injunction to prevent exchange of their client s songs copyright holders will provide napster with a song name and artist , and if they 're in napster s directory , they 'll have to be taken off , said howard king , a los angeles lawyer who represents metallica and dr dre , two musicians who have sued napster , asserting contributory copyright infringement mr king said it was simple and relatively quick for copyright holders to learn if their songs were available on the service he said that last may , a technology company hired by metallica was able in just two days to identify 322 , 000 users of napster exchanging copyrighted metallica songs but officials within napster say the record labels have made the policing sound much more technologically feasible than it is they have said , for example , that napster would have difficulty blocking some songs without blocking other songs with similar names and they said the process could slow the service to the point of making it unworkable cary sherman , the general counsel for the recording industry association of america , a trade group that represents the five major record labels , countered that napster s suggestion that it cannot create such technology would have more credibility if they 'd actually tried to do it this is not rocket science , he said they do n't want to do it because they want to continue to build a business model based on the model they have napster s technological and business challenges will not end with the injunction the company has been working at breakneck pace to develop a membership service , which might , for example , charge users a monthly fee to exchange music files napster has been developing the system as part of its agreement with the bmg division of bertelsmann , one of the five major record labels but mr barry said one major issue was that the company had not yet determined how to allow users to trade only songs that record labels and musicians have authorized , while preventing the trading of unauthorized copyrighted works asked how soon the service could be in place , mr barry said , we do n't really have a time frame still , some legal and industry experts said there were several offsetting aspects to monday s decision mr sherman , the lawyer for the recording industry association , said the decision might actually lift barriers to a settlement between napster and the record labels the reason , mr sherman said , is that the record companies may have wanted to wait until they got a definitive legal precedent he said the decision might make them feel more free to deal with napster , given that they may now feel the legal decision will scare off other entrepreneurs who want to emulate a free napsterlike service the time is right for settlement , said steve gottlieb , the president and founder of tvt records , an independent record label in new york that first sued napster , then settled with the company earlier this year mr gottlieb said the record companies must proceed to the negotiating table to make napster the most potent legitimate force for music it can possibly be mr gottlieb said the popularity of napster , which says 58 million people have downloaded its software , came not only from the fact that the music was free , but that the experience of exchanging music was universal and immediate eric scheirer , an analyst with forrester research , a market research firm and consultancy in cambridge , mass , said he had counseled record companies to consider settling with napster to take advantage of its popularity , but to the labels' own ends for instance , mr scheirer said the labels could pick and choose which songs they wanted to allow to be exchanged on napster , thus using it as a promotional vehicle but , should they choose not to negotiate with napster , to pull their music off the site altogether , the service will probably fade away , he said none of the scenarios i'm painting has napster being in a position of importance for more than a couple of months , mr scheirer said the importance of napster is on a downward trajectory at this point lawyers for napster said they planned to appeal monday s ruling , ultimately to the united states supreme court if necessary edward samuels , a professor at new york law school and an expert in intellectual property law , said he doubted that the supreme court would take the case he said the ninth circuit decision looked solid and well reasoned and probably did not leave the supreme court much cause to review the decision
mies in berlin and mies in america two major museum shows dreaded by many , especially by me have turned out to be surprisingly good they actually do what they set out to do present a picture of ludwig mies van der rohe we have n't seen before rather than repackaging this great german modernist \( 18861969 \) as a field marshal of reason , obsessed with compressing all of human existence into uniform , threedimensional grids , these two shows depict mies as a supervisor of fantasy an interpreter of the 20th century s deepest dream of itself an architectural aesthetic long regarded as a negation of self is revealed to be the crystallized expression of a path toward selfdiscovery the seagram building , the farnsworth house , the new national gallery in berlin and mies s other masterworks are shown to be autobiographies organized jointly by the museum of modern art and the whitney museum of american art , but by different curatorial teams , the shows both emphasize process over product mies in berlin , at the modern , traces the development of this architect s formal vocabulary in the years before he left europe in 1938 mies in america , at the whitney , documents the obsessive perfectionism with which he refined that vocabulary down to the smallest detail you really do need to see both , and in chronological order together they establish that mies was preoccupied by issues that remain of architectural moment historical awareness , urban context and architecture s role in defining the relationship between subjective perception and objective reality above all , these exhibitions point toward a fundamental unity of architectural forms and the history of ideas why the dread \? for more than two years the modern numbed visitors with an epic trio of exhibitions modern starts , making choices and open ends that surveyed every clogged pore of the museum s own past each included a multitude of miniexhibitions on this or that thematic premise by the end the enterprise seemed to spin and spin into a senseless blur then the drumrolls started this was going to be the definitive portrait of mies it was going to blow away the distorted views of him held all these years the problem with such claims is that it has never been possible to generalize about the reception of mies s work did his reputation suffer during the postmodern dispensation \? no postmodernists who belittled mies only made fools of themselves was it a secret that some of his early work was expressionist in spirit \? no that he paid careful attention to movement and landscape as well as void space , abstract geometric form and structural expression \? no so why bother with these exercises \? simply because in the past the modern itself had presented an overly simplistic version of the architect most closely identified with its own aesthetic \? do n't go to these shows expecting radically new ideas then what you will find is the documented story of an extraordinarily rich and complex mind , as well as an immersion in a creative process that spanned , and helped to define , a critical chapter in the history of the present and you will find a touchstone for philosophical issues that engage architects even more fully today than they did in mies s lifetime organized by terence riley , chief curator of the modern s department of architecture and design , and barry bergdoll , professor of art history at columbia university , mies in berlin is a powerful study of artistic formation it unfolds in a series of dynamic exchanges between mies s inner and outer worlds like its subject the show starts in the world of turnofthecentury german suburban neoclassicism , if you can bear to imagine such a thing evidently mies himself could not stand to recall it he suppressed publication of works from this early period they are gems after a brief presentation of work by architects who influenced mies , the show focuses on a group of country houses , including one for a philosophy professor , a nietzsche scholar , who became the young architect s mentor \( this in itself is fascinating , particularly if you never subscribed to the orthodox view of mies as a pure classicist \) seen through a nietzschean lens the riehl house , mies s first executed work \( 1907 \) his classicism reveals the irrational strain of greek thought in its relationship to the landscape the building is mainly an ornament to the land , an arrangement of garden rooms that echoes the building s floor plan though mies equips the house with conventional windows , he introduces the continuity between inside and outside that his glass buildings later achieve mies s second commission , the perls house \( 1911 \) , also demonstrates the reconciliation of opposites through controlled movement classical , romantic and picturesque , the house is distinguished by monumental steps that lead from the house to the garden possibly inspired by appia , the famed theatrical designer , the steps create an architecture of pure fluid movement through open space , unencumbered by walls , roofs and interior enclosures
rome , sept 11 one of the first laws proposed after prime minister silvio berlusconi took office would change how certain white collar crimes are prosecuted in a way almost certain to benefit the country s most famous defendant mr berlusconi of course , the prime minister , italy s richest man , who has three accounting fraud cases pending against him , has never exactly been paralyzed by a preoccupation with appearances he owns much of the news media that cover his government , as well as the polling company that shows him with an unprecedented 70 percent approval rating one of his lawyers is the member of parliament who , as he puts it , explained the corporate crime legislation , expected to become law , to the parliamentary committee in the three months since mr berlusconi took office , his effect on italian political life has been outsized he has not only quieted the uproar that followed police brutality during the group of 8 meetings in genoa , but has also used the violence and isolated incidents of terrorism in italy recently to marshal support for his tough lawandorder agenda tonight , his minister of reforms , umberto bossi , of the rightist northern league , suggested that the terrorist attacks on the united states had proven the berlusconi government right in its more authoritarian line one could sense that terrorism was coming back , he said mr berlusconi has also signaled his intention to engineer a series of fundamental legal and social changes adding criminal penalties for illegal immigration for the first time , for instance , and financing private schools in a way that is now unconstitutional in a europe governed mainly by the centerleft , mr berlusconi s moves have caused a stir there is suspicion of his methods , and there is concern about his mingling of political and business interests he s very authoritarian , and that s creating a lot of problems for italy , said gert weisskirchen , foreign policy spokesman for legislators from the social democratic party of chancellor gerhard schr der of germany the whole european style of democracy demands a clear separation of political power from the power of the media , but he s thrown out that rule , and put the whole framework of italian democracy in danger james walston , a professor of political science at the american university of rome , said , the rest of europe is extremely worried , but not quite sure how to respond and hesitant to criticize too forcefully after their experience with haider , the farright austrian j rg haider last year the european union imposed sanctions on austria after mr haider s party joined the government , but the effort backfired , uniting humiliated austrians against what they saw as their meddling neighbors italians are already hunkering down in the face of foreign criticism such references as a recent one in the british daily the guardian , calling mr berlusconi and his ministers italy s telegenic ancient mariner and his 'postfascist' crew , are being written off as antiitalian people using that language are the victim of some prejudice , said marcello pera , the wellspoken president of the senate , who is a member of mr berlusconi s party , forza italia mr pera said italians were willing to wait and see what the government actually does rather than being upset by rumors and slurs mr berlusconi , meanwhile , is working mostly from off stage , leaving his deputies to float various proposals and sometimes to take the blame for them he himself appears in public only rarely , exuding confidence and repeatedly referring to himself as italy s paterfamilias alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of the former fascist dictator , who is outspoken on women s issues , says nobody minds you know , people want the father , she said yes ! so berlusconi is doing well elsewhere in europe , mr berlusconi s apparently casual view of civil liberties has been seen as another unhappy reminder of why even mr bossi , the formerly separatist northern league leader , referred to mr berlusconi as berluskaiser back in 1994 , the last time they were political partners but the prime minister seems to be relishing the opportunity to take a tough line last week , he announced that it was his duty , as a good father of the family , to protect holy rome from unruly demonstrators during a coming conference on global hunger this plan to move a planned world food summit meeting outside rome reneged on a longstanding commitment to the food and agriculture organization in rome but it was barely criticized inside italy after mr berlusconi said he would not allow a repetition of the antiglobalization protests in genoa in july he said he made the decision only after considering public opinion as measured by a survey conducted by his own polling company later , one of mr berlusconi s ministers explained that the plan was not only to move the meeting , but also to ban all demonstrations in the city while the meeting was going on
a facetoface meeting between richie phillips and major league baseball officials this week will determine the fate of the 22 umpires who have been trying to get their jobs back for two years if phillips agrees to drop his lawsuit against commissioner bud selig and other officials , 10 of the 22 will be rehired and the others will receive financial settlements people with knowledge of the negotiations said yesterday that the two sides had reached agreement on a settlement of the longrunning dispute , but it is contingent on phillips s position if he agrees to drop his legal action stemming from his ouster as the umpires' labor representative , the deal will go through if he does not , the umpires will most likely remain out of baseball and out of luck no one on either side was harboring much hope that phillips would drop the lawsuit none of the negotiators would comment on the development , but howard pearl , the lawyer for the 22 umpires , said we 've made great progress in our negotiations with major league baseball and have only one unresolved issue we continue to work together with baseball , and i am hopeful that we 'll make progress in resolving that by the end of the week the umpires lost their jobs in september 1999 , when the national and american leagues accepted the resignations they had tendered as part of phillips s labor strategy earlier this year an arbitrator , alan symonette , ordered baseball to rehire nine of the umpires both sides have appealed the ruling under the contingency agreement , four of those nine umpires would regain their major league jobs gary darling , bill hohn , larry poncino and larry vanover two umpires whom symonette did not order rehired would nevertheless get major league jobs under the contingency agreement bob davidson and tom hallion four others would get minor league jobs in class aaa bruce dreckman , ed hickox , sam holbrook and paul nauert under the plan , the umpires not rehired would receive severance payments or retirement pay , and some of those not going back to work would receive back pay health care benefits also would be granted the umpires were not optimistic that phillips would drop his lawsuit they no longer have a connection with him , and they know how he feels about what he believes was baseball s role in his ouster an official of major league baseball said it had asked umpires who had remained loyal to phillips to ask him about dropping the suit clifford haines , phillips s lawyer , said last month that no one from baseball had contacted him to discuss the matter haines did not return a telephone call yesterday seeking comment about the pending meeting phillips sued selig and others early this year , alleging libel and slander and charging that they interfered illegally with his relationship with the old umpires union the union s internal dispute over phillips s resignation strategy prompted a large group of umpires , mostly from the american league , to form a new union and challenge the old union the insurgent group won an election conducted by the national labor relations board

in afghanistan , the hunt for osama bin laden is narrowing but on the war s financial front , the government is only now beginning to come to grips with al qaeda s moneyraising apparatus , which officials say is so farflung and diversified that it could survive even if mr bin laden is captured or killed delving into a network that generates millions of dollars a year , yet often trafficks in small amounts , the inquiry has uncovered at least 238 , 000 sent to the sept 11 hijackers in the united states through a dozen wire transfers from the united arab emirates several transfers are linked to an al qaeda official who used various aliases , united states government officials said in recent interviews investigators have also found that the hijackers and some of their acquaintances declared about 40 , 000 in cash when entering the united states , the officials said , and law enforcement officials are trying to determine if that cash also aided the attacks despite progress in unraveling the finances of the september attacks , government officials say dismantling the overall financing of al qaeda is proving more difficult , in part because it hinges far less on mr bin laden s fortune than was once believed during the last few years , government officials have concluded that mr bin laden s inheritance , once estimated at 300 million , was actually more in the range of 25 million instead , al qaeda uses an amalgam of private enterprises , corporate shells and charities that are structured like a financial archipelago with connections hidden beneath the surface to support al qaeda , some operatives work like organized crime crews government officials exploring al qaeda s operation in bosnia found that operatives skimmed money from relief charities and linked up with bosnian crime bosses the success in bosnia made it a model for al qaeda to use in embattled countries around the world the description of the expansive and selfsufficient structure of the network is based on interviews with current and former officials of many american government agencies , as well as from court records and other official documents the bush administration s attempt to break up this financial network is as vital as the military action in afghanistan , experts say a military success would not be sufficient without an attack on the financial infrastructure of al qaeda , said michael zeldin , former head of the moneylaundering section at the justice department if that stays in place , then you may chase them from one geography to the next , you may be disruptive , but you have n't gotten to the root of the problem since sept 11 the bush administration has taken three public steps to block dozens of individuals , companies , charities and other organizations with al qaeda connections from the international banking system but out of public view , the effort is far broader , government officials say , involving diplomatic and covert actions working with governments in the middle east and europe , officials have privately confronted several international charities with accusations that terrorists had infiltrated their organizations and were diverting money to al qaeda united states officials , working with foreign counterparts , have monitored back transactions trying to track down al qaeda supporters socalled jump teams of american forensic accountants , lawyers and other experts have descended on foreign countries to review records in search of al qaeda connections evaluating progress on the financial front is far more difficult than it is in military battles much of the effort is only now getting under way , and the bush administration has made public virtually none of the evidence it says it has linking individuals and private groups to al qaeda success in this fight will be hardwon , experts say , primarily because mr bin laden has fundamentally changed the nature of terrorist financing in effect , at a time when state sponsorship for terrorism was in decline , mr bin laden undertook a privatization of terror , creating a far more diffuse network than any faced in the past the decline in statesponsored terrorism means that the private support for terrorist groups has become the most essential element in fundraising , said reuven paz , former academic director with the international policy institute for counterterrorism in herzlia , israel that means any attempt to cut the money flow into al qaeda or other similar organizations will prove far more difficult than it has been in the past invasion prompts money flow it all began as with most things al qaeda with the soviet union s invasion of afghanistan in 1979 as devout muslims trooped there to defend the islamic nation , wealthy saudi businessmen funneled millions of dollars to support the effort through assorted charities among those businessmen was mr bin laden , an heir to a saudi construction fortune with the afghan war playing out on the geopolitical

miami , sept 7 bobby valentine watched the atlanta braves' game in the visiting manager s office at pro player stadium today , shouting at the television , pleading for the chicago cubs to win they did not , and the result was posted on the scoreboard in left field during batting practice the mets knew they could not gain ground on the firstplace braves in the national league east tonight , but they went ahead and won anyway , because that is all they do now glendon rusch tossed an eighthitter , rey ord ez had a home run and three runs batted in , and the mets beat the florida marlins , 61 the victory was the 16th in 20 games for the mets \( 7072 \) , who trail the braves by seven games with 20 to play the phillies , who lost tonight at montreal , 42 , trail atlanta by a seasonhigh three and a half games the mets won for the first time in eight starts by rusch he struck out eight , walked none and allowed one unearned run in pitching his first nineinning complete game in more than three years i take a lot of pride in doing my job , and i was n't doing my job , rusch said it s frustrating , especially when the team s playing as well as they have been i 've been letting them down rusch lost his fourth straight start last sunday , and the next day he was at veterans stadium in philadelphia before 10 am , jogging on the warning track before a day game when he returned to the dugout , he encountered the hall of famer tom seaver , a mets broadcaster , and they sat down and talked for perhaps 20 minutes seaver had not talked about pitching with rusch since spring training he wants to see me succeed , rusch said he told me , 'you have far too good stuff to not be elevating yourself to the next level' i totally agree seaver told rusch he had to use his legs , a lesson the pitching coach charlie hough had also tried to impart seaver told rusch his front shoulder was flying open because he was not properly loading his weight on his back leg and driving forward rusch s arm was dragging behind the rest of his body vance wilson , who caught rusch tonight for the fourth time , reminded him of the advice during the game when wilson called for a curveball , he motioned toward the dirt with his glove , reminding rusch to keep the pitch down the only way to do that was to close the front shoulder i did a better job of staying on top of the ball more consistently , but i was still falling off with quite a few of my pitches , rusch said it s just a constant battle to get to where you 're totally consistent with that you look at tom glavine and guys like that they have a consistent delivery every single time but rusch will take the result he threw inside confidently and effectively and did not allow an extrabase hit until luis castillo s double in the eighth by then , the mets had taken full advantage of a bumbling team that did no better after manager tony perez benched three starters just before castillo s double , ramon castro , a september callup , was thrown out at second without a slide after hitting a ball off the wall and breaking into a home run trot ord ez and tsuyoshi shinjo trotted for the mets , both connecting for tworun homers off high fastballs from a j burnett with two outs in the fifth , ord ez pounded a ball over the 26 1 2foot teal wall , five rows of seats and another wall before a fan caught it it was his third homer of the season , a career high , and gave the mets a 21 lead ord ez , who shares the mets' lead with 23 doubles , has more runs batted in \( 17 \) since the allstar game break than robin ventura \( 11 \) he has one fewer extrabase hit \( 30 \) than todd zeile \( 31 \) this is the best he s ever swung in his life as a professional , valentine said with two outs and one on in the sixth , shinjo provided the other big blow , using a borrowed bat before the game , shinjo had exchanged bats with the marlins' preston wilson , a hitter he admires shinjo , who said he had been too eager with his own light bats , used wilson s heavier bat to pull a homer to left field wilson did not regret his charity you ca n't lay a bat in the batter s box and tell it to hit it out of the ballpark , he said in other words , it takes ability it is probably too late , but the mets are finally displaying theirs inside pitch second baseman edgardo alfonzo left the game with a sprained joint in his left index finger after diving for a single by derrek lee in the sixth inning the finger was placed in a splint overnight , and manager bobby valentine was not sure if alfonzo could play saturday the mets recalled the class aaa infielder jorge velandia catcher mike piazza , who had started the previous nine games , was off to rest a strained abdominal muscle while warming up before the fourth inning , the marlins' a j burnett fired a pitch that shattered the window of a moving truck carrying the team s mascot burnett said the pitch slipped was n't that classic \?

washington , feb 2 president bush ventured into enemy territory today , meeting with senate democrats to outline his hopes for his first year in office later in the day , in a speech to republican members of congress at a retreat in williamsburg , va , he vowed to make the case for deep tax cuts over and over again until americans were convinced that his plan would help the middle class and act as a remedy for economic slowdown mr bush s spokesman said the democrats , who met mr bush behind closed doors , listened politely but were tentative and silent during his 12minute speech , which was followed by a brief questionandanswer period but after they emerged from their own strategy sessions , the senate democrats warmly praised mr bush for the gracious gesture of showing up the republicans , not surprisingly , were basking in the glow of the legislative possibilities ahead , and talked openly about tax cuts that are even deeper than what mr bush proposed in his campaign i come from the school of thought that by cutting marginal rates for everybody who pays taxes is a good way to help ease the pain of what may be an economic slowdown , mr bush told the republicans , brushing past alan greenspan s warning last week that by the time any tax cut would be passed and take effect , it would probably be too late to correct the current slowdown and we 'll make that case over and over and over again until we get a bill through at both the democratic and republican gatherings , mr bush turned on his charm and repeated some welltested laughlines to show that he was at ease in his new setting and confident of legislative victory he told house and senate republicans , who went to williamsburg with their spouses , that he would invite them all to the white house just do n't take any silverware , he said , to much applause mr bush was not specific today about his tax proposals , but his spokesman , ari fleischer , said the bill he would propose next week would closely mirror the 16 billion tax cut he proposed in the campaign that plan seemed a long shot a few months ago , but today , with the economy slowing and new estimates of the federal surplus rising , it is clear that mr bush will almost certainly get a huge tax cut through congress democrats are trying to limit any cut to 750 billion to 1 trillion over the next 10 years far larger than the tax cut al gore ran on in his campaign while some republicans are talking about mr bush s proposal of 16 trillion as a floor , not a ceiling the result is a predictable rush among washington lobbyists to get their favorite tax provisions included in the legislative language , with everyone from hightech corporations to automakers arguing that after years of higher productivity , they now need a break mr bush discussed none of that today but he did warn republicans that it s important for us not to let the tax relief debate fall into a class warfare debate , arguing , as he did during the campaign , that even a single mother making 22 , 000 a year would benefit it seems like to me the fair way to do things , he said , is if people pay taxes , they ought to get tax relief the white house has set aside next week as its taxcut week , just as last week was devoted to education reform and this week to helping religious organizations perform charitable work and once again , the white house is choreographing events to keep its agenda on television and the front pages on monday , mr bush is planning to bring four families to the white house to talk about how his tax cuts could aid them on tuesday he is to visit a small business , and on wednesday he plans to hold a reunion of families he met on the campaign trail to humanize his tax proposals on thursday , he is to send his tax legislation to capitol hill the size and composition of the tax legislation , however , will be the subject of a protracted struggle so mr bush took the unusual step of appearing at the annual party retreat of the senate democrats , at the library of congress , as a sign that he wanted to reach across the aisle while he stayed for under an hour and did not get into detailed discussions of policy , democrats called mr bush s very appearance before them an unusual gesture of good will and said it the first time a president of the opposition party had appeared at the strategy sessions that have been a staple of party politics since the 1980 s mr bush expressed the hope that the parties could reach compromises on education , tax cutting and medicare prescription drug coverage , the lawmakers said and there was no discussion of the confirmation battle just past over john ashcroft i give him very high marks for being there , said senator patrick j leahy , democrat of vermont senator tom daschle of south dakota , the minority leader , said , i thought that his remarks were very conciliatory he indicated an interest in working with us and reaching compromise on issues senator joseph r biden jr of delaware called the visit to the democratic gathering a good gesture , but cautioned that the president might have a hard time pulling the parties together where are the compromises \? mr biden asked bipartisanship does n't mean we just like each other i mean , we do like each other but it means how does that translate \? are you really going to have compromises on issues \? he said he thought we could photo president bush and speaker j dennis hastert yesterday at a retreat for republicans in williamsburg , va earlier in the day , mr bush met with democrats and outlined his plans

the number tumbles first 6 , 700 , then 5 , 000 down , down , down , 4 , 500 , 4 , 000 , now 3 , 300 the death toll in the world trade center attack keeps falling as officials refine their count when they are finished , the toll will be much smaller than anyone anticipated , probably about 3 , 000 , less than half the number that made headlines in the weeks following the attack that is a fact in historical terms it means that sept 11 can no longer be called the bloodiest day in american history \( that was sept 17 , 1862 , when at least 3 , 650 confederate and union soldiers died at the battle of antietam , and thousands of others were wounded \) in contemporary ones it means that the evacuation and rescue efforts were even more spectacularly successful than anyone imagined the 400 rescuers who died helped save more people than anyone might have dreamed possible mere numbers , of course , do little to diminish the nation s sense of horror and yet as the number has fallen , and been publicly recorded , people have reacted in a variety of ways , not all of them simple relief one sister of a victim watched the number shrink and felt all the lonelier , briefly fearful that people might think the wholesale devastation that took her brother was somehow less epic the mayor of new york excoriated reporters for chronicling the declining totals , describing it as a macabre exercise military and political leaders have said the total does not for a second change their sense of outrage historians and psychologists say that such a mix of relief and confusion , anger and insistence is not unusual , and maybe even to be expected over history , the early , dreaded estimates of death totals in cataclysmic events have had a way of taking stubborn hold people invest in them , however broken their hearts people come to defend them in certain ways , in part because they think worrying about definitively counting the deaths amounts to a conscious effort to diminish the event s awfulness no one is wrong in all this , and no one , however conflicted their emotions , feels that sept 11 was anything less than a cursed day much of it just has to do with how people process loss , how humans protect that which they cherish , how slowly some truths nudge powerful myths from the historical stage lori barzvi , whose brother , guy , 29 , worked at cantor fitzgerald and died in the attack , said she watched the numbers of dead and missing decline and felt something might be at risk i was afraid that it might be looked at as being less of a tragedy or it would be easier to forget because less people died , ms barzvi said it is not that i wish that there were more people it just made me feel a little bit more alone joel best , chairman of the department of sociology and criminal justice at the university of delaware and author of the book damned lies and statistics says that sometimes people s feelings can go beyond the strangely disconcerting sensation experienced by ms barzvi people can almost actively cling to high numbers of dead or hurt despite the fact that those numbers have been proven erroneous people develop an emotional stake in defending a number , mr best said they feel they have to defend it the phenomenon , while understandable , can also blunt what is objectively a good development if there are 3 , 000 dead instead of 6 , 000 dead that does not make the tragedy half as bad , mr best said what people ought to see is the astonishing good fortune that we had in evacuating these buildings and yet the ability to feel anything like comfort can prove difficult some people ask , not without sound reasoning , how anyone can feel any better knowing that only about 3 , 000 people died even engaging in a discussion about the declining count has brought some people criticism it appears to many people to be callous , said john allen paulos , a professor of mathematics at temple university and author of the book innumeracy mathematical illiteracy and its consequences i have had conversations with people and i sense it a bit that concerns with the numbers is somehow unseemly certainly , the united states diplomats , military leaders and members of congress who have repeatedly cited the thousands killed in explaining why the country has gone to war do not think the lower total affects their rationale or the country s cause for weeks , they cited 5 , 000 and 6 , 000 dead when it was public knowledge that the figure was substantially lower , although they probably were erring unintentionally spokesmen for the pentagon and the state department , where gen richard b myers , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , and secretary of state colin l powell have each referred to much higher death tolls in explaining the united states engagement , said the lower numbers changed nothing our country was attacked , thousands of innocent americans and citizens from other countries were killed and the terrorists have threatened to kill more , said philip reeker , a deputy spokesman at the state department we are waging a campaign in selfdefense
gaza , sept 19 two symbols of palestinians' anger against the united states hovered over gaza city shortly after noon on saturday the city went to the streets , all heads craned up the two black dots above were americanmade apache helicopters , searching for targets a boy on a bicycle , his eyes more on the sky than the road , struck a cab children ran out of school five rockets from the helicopters crashed into a military intelligence headquarters of the palestinian authority one of three official buildings struck that day in the gaza strip a ceasefire has now taken tenuous hold , but the mood remains dark we are against terrorism , said abd alraof abu daka , a captain with the palestinian police force in the southern town of rafah , who watched as his headquarters was hit we do n't like americans to die but the israelis are hitting us with american weapons anger , even hatred , of the united states as the perceived best friend of israel is strong in the gaza strip few palestinians in the strip , whose unresolved status fuels conflict in the middle east , go so far as to say they feel the joy of other palestinians filmed celebrating after the terror attacks last week in new york and washington but they look at the misery of their lives and cannot help feeling that the united states has a hand in it the two sides are killing each other , but nearly every day for the last year , young palestinians have died in intensified clashes with israeli soldiers and , increasingly , in israeli assaults on palestinian areas here in the isolated territory of gaza , the israelis have sealed off the border for almost a year that has made israelis feel safer , but it has made palestinians feel that they live in a giant prison of poverty and despair , which makes a ripe breeding ground for fanatics and suicide bombers baram alfaramawy , 17 , shrieked away with giggles from israeli soldiers who were firing back bullets at youths like him throwing stones near rafah last weekend out of breath but full of bravado , he stopped amid shops eroded by bullet holes and said he would happily do worse , and to americans if he had the chance i am willing to go and explode myself , he said eyad sarraj , a psychiatrist and human rights activist in gaza , said most palestinians , like most people around the world , were horrified at the enormous loss of civilian life in new york and washington but he added that united states support of israel , particularly during the yearlong surge in fighting , had earned america few friends here many people around the world , he added , including this place , are expressing a kind of evil spirit of joy that the americans , at last , are tasting from the same cup we are backward and ignorant , but this has been helped by the american policies in the middle east as with most of the military strikes , israeli officials said the attacks on saturday had been retribution for palestinian violence , in this case grenades thrown at the main crossing from israel into gaza , at erez , wounding two israeli soldiers israel s prime minister , ariel sharon , has drawn parallels between the attack on the united states and israel s long experience with violence all suicide bombers are terrorists , he says , whether in jerusalem or manhattan he has called yasir arafat , the palestinian leader , our bin laden there is some debate in gaza home to the radical islamic groups hamas and islamic holy war over whether the attacks in the united states should force a change in tactics ziad abuamr , a prominent palestinian politician , said most palestinian leaders had agreed in recent days that suicide bombings inside israel should be suspended this would be helping israel , he said of further bombings now and unless you are ignorant and stupid , you would n't do these things under the circumstances one who disagrees is sheik abdallah alshami , spokesman for islamic holy war , a group founded in the 1970 s that has carried out so many suicide bombings that he said he could not count them there is a big difference between what is going on inside occupied palestine and what is going on inside the united states , he said , strongly disavowing any connection between his group and the men who carried out the attacks in the united states we do n't have the weapons that israel has here he drew a connection to the united states and the fighter jets it sells to israel they have f16 s , he said of the israeli military we have f16 s that are our bodies , and that s what we use by exploding public opinion polls show that since the socalled second intifada , or uprising , began last september , extremist groups like islamic holy war and hamas have gained more support even before the new fighting , the gaza strip , where some 700 , 000 of the palestinian residents live as refugees , was exceptionally poor and a hotbed for extremism but since last september , almost none of the 40 , 000 gazans who worked in israel have been able to cross the border the united nations estimates that the unemployment rate has shot up to about 50 percent from 25 percent the poverty rate , defined as those living on less than 2 a day , has risen hamed albatnijy , 74 , a farmer , is letting some of his fields lie fallow because trucks cannot take his tomatoes and cucumbers to their usual markets in israel and jordan nazir ghabir , 43 , said he had succumbed recently to the despair of not having enough money for his 12 children by pouring about five gallons of gasoline on himself and threatening to light a match his neighbors stopped him last week , muhammad almadhon , 13 , dyed his hair to cover up gray growing in , which his mother insists is from the stress of constantly hearing israeli warplanes over gaza our husbands are sitting at home , said his mother , mariam , 52 , whose husband , for years a construction worker in israel , has not worked for a year like nearly every palestinian interviewed in gaza , she said she felt bad for the people who had died in new york but she added that the attack was , in the end , america s own fault america is the one who caused it , because of what it is doing , she said america is a superpower they are the strongest they should stand beside us why do we get all this pressure \? this pressure is generating a volcano in gaza , death has become routine this is normal , said raed albalawi , 18 , as yet another funeral for a young man shot while throwing stones passed by flags waved , and men fired guns in the air and hauled the body through the streets on a green army cot sometimes it s even more crazy , he said the dead boy s father , khalil hasona , said his son , ramzy , 17 , had been shot while throwing stones on three occasions in the last six months , twice in the same leg and then , on friday , through the heart the first time he was shot , he promised he would n't go anymore , mr hasona said but he was shot again , so i knew he was going again i beat him up still , he was proud of his son proud , he explained , that ramzy was a martyr but , he added , i hope he is the last martyr photo palestinian boys in gaza throwing stones at an

patrick bridges and charles kappler had their sights on harlem even before the local real estate market started heating up they were tired of their cramped , tiny onebedroom walkup on the upper west side , and they missed the sense of neighborliness both had known growing up in south carolina it took a year and several false starts , but eventually the couple , both marketing executives , found a small brownstone at 350 west 121st street , between frederick douglass boulevard and manhattan avenue , that met their requirements it was a shell that needed to be completely rebuilt , but the facade was in good shape , and a park and public transportation were nearby but more than a year after mr bridges , 34 , and mr kappler , 35 , signed a contract to buy the brownstone for 270 , 000 from a seller they knew only as st stephen s baptist church , they still do not have their house after months of wondering what was holding up their closing , they recently discovered that they are among the victims of a complex scheme to defraud a federally insured mortgage program intended to promote homeownership in poor neighborhoods the house the couple thought they were buying is one of at least 450 brownstones in new york city , most in harlem and brooklyn , that are in default their seller , identified as st stephen s baptist church at 90 park avenue in manhattan , is one of a dozen obscure nonprofit organizations under investigation the lawyer representing the church in negotiations with mr bridges and mr kappler was recently arrested by state and federal authorities on fraudrelated charges there is no st stephen s church at that address it was a dummy corporation mr bridges and mr kappler are not alone desperate to find housing in a tight real estate market , several new york residents have found their dreams of homeownership in harlem thwarted , at least for now , by unscrupulous real estate speculators working in concert with mortgage lenders , real estate brokers , appraisers and nonprofit groups sixteen people have been arrested in the complex case what happened with the property at 350 west 121st street illustrates how the scheme worked in many instances according to borough property records , on nov 17 , 1998 , the building was sold for 110 , 000 to a realty company , which , in a practice known as flipping , resold it three days later to st stephen s for 235 , 000 the purchase was made in the name of a nonprofit organization the church so that participants could take advantage of the department of housing and urban development s 203 \( k \) program , which is off limits to real estate investors but st stephen s was not a community group with a proven track record in housing rehabilitation , as required by the 203 \( k \) program rather , court documents say , it was set up by a hudapproved mortgage bank expressly to get these federally guaranteed mortgages that bank has closed , and three loan officers have been arrested a 203 \( k \) loan is supposed to finance both the acquisition and the rehabilitation of a property , but in this case the mortgage was for 327 , 400 after the realty company was paid 270 , 000 , only 92 , 400 remained for repairs a fraction of what was needed for a fourstory brownstone mr bridges and mr kappler said that had they been able to buy the house , they expected to spend 300 , 000 to make it habitable even as details of the fraudulent schemes have emerged in recent weeks , one real estate broker at jadestone properties in brooklyn said last week that people continued to want to buy the troubled brownstones and that she had 27 under contract but hud officials say these contracts are not valid because none of the 203 \( k \) properties in default can be resold without the agency s approval , even if a buyer has a new lender willing to pay off the old loan the agency wants to make sure that the properties do not fall into the hands of real estate speculators a second time , said william c apgar , assistant secretary for housing mr apgar said hud expected to acquire the brownstones facing foreclosure from the nonprofits and resell them to responsible community groups or residents so that the 203 \( k \) program s mission could be fulfilled our goal is to figure out how to do the right thing , he said in recent interviews , several wouldbe homeowners acknowledged that they had not taken steps that might have alerted them to the problems with getting clear title to the brownstones they wanted to buy instead , they said , they relied on their lawyers and title companies to detect any problems examining property records would not have helped brett renwick , however after searching for 13 months , mr renwick , 36 , the marketing director of an internet company , and his wife , marla , 28 , bid , sight unseen , on a property at 148 west 121st street , in the mount morris park area of harlem the interior of the brownstone was destroyed in a fire in

first came the fires on the long island rail road s new locomotives , then the report that the east river rail tunnels were little better than firetraps finally was the announcement that crime on lirr trains , platforms and parking lots was soaring none of these safety problems were of kenneth j bauer s making but the 52yearold lido beach resident is the new president of the long island rail road , and it is his problem now mr bauer said his no 1 focus has always been on safety issues when the fires broke out on the locomotives , he said , we jumped on it with a series of corrective steps we have not had another incident since , he said any time we have any type of safety issue , it always takes priority but his main emphasis so far he had been acting president since may and was appointed to the post full time on dec 18 seems to be on nonsafety issues , particularly keeping trains clean in november he began a campaign to encourage riders to take their trash with them when they get off the train in addition , he said , the railroad is now cleaning all 30 of the trains that make two trips each morning before they make their second trip the same is being done on all 25 of the evening trains that make two trips and by march , mr bauer said he expected that all of the plastic globes that cover ceiling fluorescent lights on electric coaches will be changed because they have yellowed with age we are doing a number of large capital improvement programs that will improve things in five years , but we want to do things for customers today , he said his attention to passenger comfort seems to be what passengers want mr bauer routinely visits different stations in the mornings to solicit comments from commuters , and he has held monthly dinner meetings with 15 to 20 commuters chosen at random for detailed feedback there are a lot of things that need to be addressed and improved , and a major focus for me has been the customer , he explained the railroad over the last couple of years has had little to do with the customer , and i want a lot of input some of the railroad s problems crowded trains and parking lots , most obviously are related to its success in attracting riders with ridership of 78 , 312 , 866 for the first 11 months of 2000 , up 47 percent over the record 74 , 825 , 637 for the comparable period in 1999 , the long island rail road is now carrying more passengers than at any time since world war ii , mr bauer said he also noted that the ontime performance of the railroad has improved an average of 18 percent in 2000 on the railroad s 11 branches , which translates into 4 , 000 fewer delayed trains safety questions did not seem to be the highest priority for a knot of commuters buttonholed with a pleasant hi , i'm ken bauer , president of the long island rail road , how have you been finding the railroad \? as they changed trains at jamaica station on a recent cold and blustery morning henry brewer of east norwich told mr bauer that he has to drive to the westbury station because of insufficient parking in syosset a commuter from albertson , who boarded a train before giving his name , complained of having to wait 15 minutes at jamaica each morning for a connection to brooklyn and stacy fitzmaurice of locust valley said she had heard complaints of too much heat in the new doubledecker cars only deneed womack of laurelton , queens , voiced concern about a safety issue , citing news reports of an inadequate police presence at lirr stations and on trains questioned by a reporter as he walked through penn station on his way from the train that brought him from his home in babylon , donald j longo said he was aware of the locomotive fires but was not concerned things happen , he said i do n't have any fears or concerns and i'm not going to stop taking the railroad but daniel e kelly of freeport said his greatest concern is the east river tunnels my fear is what would happen if there was a bomb , explosion or fire in the tunnel , how would you get out , he said the four east river tunnels used by the long island rail road are owned by amtrak in december , the inspector general of the department of transportation said it would take 898 million to make the corrections by 2010 mr bauer said the railroad has put aside 125 million in its 200004 capital budget to deal with these safety issues among the requirements , he said , are a ventilation system that would pump in fresh air while smoke was sucked out , standpipes that would provide water for firefighters along the entire 24mile length of the tunnels , a communications system in the tunnel and additional staircases for an emergency exit there is now only one stairway on the queens side and one in manhattan if a train got stuck in the middle of a tunnel and passengers had to be evacuated through the staircases , mr bauer said they would have to walk half a mile in either direction to reach one but mr bauer said an evacuation through those staircases would be a last resort because they are so narrow that emergency personnel cannot descend while passengers are evacuating , and the 10story staircases have no landing area to allow someone to rest while others can proceed
perhaps by now one should not be surprised by the program that the congress of racial equality puts together for its annual dinner dedicated to the rev dr martin luther king jr on the dais last year was jorg haider , the austrian xenophobe a couple of years earlier , a place of honor was set for bob grant , the radio talk show host who in the past had called blacks savages and had used a crude sexual epithet in dismissing dr king as a fake and a phony say this about roy innis , core s conservative national chairman you can count on him not to shrink from marching to a different drummer sometimes he seems to have an entire percussion section of his own but while that does not come as news , it was hard to keep the eyebrows from arching over the invitation to the 2001 core dinner , to be held at the sheraton new york hotel on jan 15 , dr king s birthday the evening s honors list includes the blues guitarist b b king and the rev leon sullivan , who formulated the sullivan principles , a code of corporate conduct in south africa in the apartheid days nothing out of the ordinary there it was a third name , at the top of the list , that caught the eye charlton heston , president of the national rifle association , described in the invitation as actor , director , constitutional rights activist now it must be said at the outset that the man who played moses on film has a sterling civilrights history among other things , he led the hollywood contingent to the 1963 march on washington , the landmark event in which dr king gave his i have a dream speech even so , mr heston is now a redmeat speaker preaching the sanctity of the second amendment to the pistolpacking segment of america is n't the country s most famous gun advocate perhaps an odd choice for honors at a dinner named for a national hero killed in 1968 by a gun \? not at all , said mr innis , himself an nra board member we are becoming more and more closeminded as americans , and that s unfortunate , he said we pigeonhole people too easily of mr heston , he said he s been a civil rights fighter most of his career just because a person is a supporter of the second amendment , it does n't mean he s violent and opposed to what dr king stood for admired or not , and there is no shortage of critics who wave him off as a showboat , mr innis has long stood firm against the notion that there is somehow only one way to think black he opposes not only gun control but also affirmative action he supported robert h bork s nomination to the supreme court , and came to the defense of bernard goetz , the subway gunman obviously , these are not positions embraced by many prominent black figures this time , mr innis seems to have lost support among some people who allowed their names to be used to promote the king dinner the core invitation included a list of 116 men and women described as forming the awards program committee , a lineup heavy with show business personalities judging from the reaction of several committee members who were contacted , it seems that few , if any , had a clue about mr heston the lawyer johnnie l cochran jr insisted through a spokeswoman that core had no authorization to use his name some people , like former representative geraldine a ferraro , said they had no plans to go to the dinner i'm for racial equality , and i do n't care who supports it , liberal or conservative , ms ferraro said but to honor the head of the nra on the day we are remembering a civil rights leader who was torn down by a gun , it just seems so strange , she said others , while surprised by the dinner program , were not prepared to turn their backs on core or mr heston i suppose if i were pressed , i might have to disavow the association with this , but not at this point , the actor ossie davis said one name practically leaped off the committee list that of yoko ono , whose husband , john lennon , was shot to death in 1980 what did she think of all this \? i respect mr heston for lending his name to the cause of racial equality , she replied in a written statement thank you none of us have to agree 100 percent on all issues we could n't it s nice that we share some points of view it s time , ms ono said , for all of us to come together well , that certainly is a more comforting thought than another lyric from the beatles happiness is a warm gun
bill clinton walked into an aids fundraiser at the apollo theater in harlem the other night to a flicker of applause and recognition from the audience his wife was in washington , so mr clinton s company for his night out consisted of representative charles b rangel of harlem , the singer roberta flack , and a modest crew of secret service agents the former president spent the next four hours in a cramped center seat , at times chatting with mr rangel and ms flack and occasionally autographing a program that was passed over the seats mostly , though , he was a very famous man who was sitting very much alone that night in harlem captured , in many ways , what life has become for mr clinton in the six weeks since he left the white house whether he is roaming around his 11room home in chappaqua with his dog , buddy , unpacking 120 boxes of books , learning how to use his atm cash card and his new palm pilot , or venturing out of the wooded confines of northern westchester for a night in manhattan , a man who so craves attention and company is described by friends as adrift and often isolated he has lost much of his white house staff , the counsel of many of the people who have guided him through eight years of intermittent crises , and even the daily companionship of his family his wife , hillary rodham clinton , the new senator from new york , essentially lives in washington , and their daughter , chelsea , 21 , is about to head back to college in california mr clinton s friends had warned him of the solitude he would face as he made the adjustment to becoming another spouse of a member of congress , living alone in the suburban house his wife chose when she was running for the senate but the incessant controversy over a series of lastminute pardons has exacerbated his forced isolation many of the people to whom he might turn were involved in either seeking or reviewing the pardons and thus have drawn the attention of congressional and federal investigators several of them , including bruce r lindsey , the former deputy white house counsel , are expected to testify before a house panel today the staff you want to help you out are part of the story , said one of mr clinton s former white house aides mrs clinton was described by friends as torn over her husband s predicament , at once angered that the pardons he granted have tarnished her entry into public life , but distressed that no one is around to help mr clinton deal with the public relations disasters that have marked his entry into private life , or to help him work out of what the family friend described as his funk , at a time when he is pretty much walled up in chappaqua the two clintons continue to share advice , one friend said but that has been complicated by their geographic separation , by suggestions of some of mrs clinton s advisers that she draw some distance from her husband , and by the continuing distraction of mrs clinton s new job , the friend said they have yet to take the vacation together that mr clinton had said they would take at the first congressional recess , now long passed the difficulties of mr clinton s personal transition in ways large but also small , like the times he accidentally cut friends off while trying to place his own telephone calls from his makeshift office have become a subject of increased discussion and concern among his friends , even as they plot ways to rehabilitate his image both mr clinton and mrs clinton declined requests for an interview mr clinton s paid transition staff about 10 people , including schedulers , a correspondence unit , a press secretary , and his longtime personal secretary , betty currie work 300 miles away from chappaqua , out of an office on jackson place across the street from the white house mr clinton has explicitly avoided visiting washington until the furor over the details of his exit subsides , one friend said as a result , he has spent only one night there since he left office , staying with mrs clinton in their new home near embassy row he has yet to visit his transition office for her part , mrs clinton has made it back to new york only on weekends , and not always then in chappaqua , the former president s staff consists of oscar , his personal military valet \( mr clinton s aides have declined to divulge oscar s last name \) who cooks him meals and tends to his clothes and household needs when he travels , he is accompanied by the personal assistant who served the same function for him when he was president after years in which white house operators tracked down whom he wanted when he wanted them , and bid them to wait for mr clinton to come on the line , the 42nd president of the united states now has to make his own telephone calls , from his temporary office at home in chappaqua none of this will change , it seems , at least until summer , when his harlem office should be ready despite the isolation of his private life , he remains an enormous celebrity , especially in new york the very first week that mr clinton was in new york , he attended a performance of aida at the metropolitan opera , where he was mobbed by operagoers but if his appearance at the apollo theater the other night is any indication , there are signs that the novelty may be fading his presence was mentioned only once from the stage , and most theatergoers seemed as impressed at catching sight of ms flack as they were with seeing mr clinton
following are excerpts from the senate judiciary committee s confirmation hearings yesterday for john ashcroft , presidentelect george w bush s choice for attorney general , as recorded by federal news service inc mr ashcroft was questioned by senators herb kohl , democrat of wisconsin arlen specter , republican of pennsylvania dianne feinstein , democrat of california and jeff sessions , republican of alabama on political partisanship mr kohl senator ashcroft , i believe that we fail the senate and our constituents when we put politics above policy and bitterness above compromise in an equally divided senate , we have a terrific opportunity to give the public faith in democratic institutions it s not clear whether or not you fully agree yesterday senator leahy read a 1998 quotation of yours quote there are voices in the republican party today who preach pragmatism , who champion conciliation and who counsel compromise i stand here today to reject those deceptions if ever there was a time to unfurl the banner of unabashed conservatism , it is now , unquote and that year you were also quoted as saying , quote there are two things you find in the middle of the road a moderate and a dead skunk and i do n't want to be either one of those as someone who works the middle of the road myself , i find these statements troubling tell us why we should believe that , as attorney general , you will accept those voices in your own party who counsel compromise mr ashcroft the first quotation was a quotation about whether , in my judgment , a party should set forth a clear agenda and i think it s important for the party to be in a position to debate and i would expect the republican party to be stating a clear conservative position , and i generally expect people on the other side to state a more predominantly liberal position and the process , in the collision of those ideas , is what i appreciated as the process in which we were able to work together in many instances to get legislation when different ideas come from different quarters , those differences enhance the ultimate quality and i think that when there are people who state a strong position on one side and a strong position on the other , representing their parties , and then they come together in the process to reach a conclusion , it s valuable another way of putting it would be that if we were all right there in the middle together , we would n't need the legislative process the legislative process is the process of disagreement it s the process of debate it s the process of stating these and examining the various positions from one end to the other and then harmonizing those differences by working together the joke about what you find in the middle of the road , i really regret it if anyone s offended by it it was meant as a humorous sort of aside to say that i generally have been characterized fairly as a commonsense conservative , and i have n't been right in the middle of the road mr kohl well , you 're likely to be confirmed , as we all know , as the next attorney general of the united states how will you be or will you be a different kind of an advocate as attorney general than you have been as a senator in the sense that we in the senate have seen you consistently very much on the right on virtually every issue \? mr ashcroft these are vastly different roles i mean , if a person is playing at the power forward position , he has one approach to the basket if he s playing as the distributor of the ball , as the playmaker , he has another approach when i was in leadership responsibilities with the national association of attorneys general , i understood that it was n't my position to be i had to sacrifice some of my advocacy roles and some of what otherwise would have been my approach to be responsible in those positions and there s another important difference with the attorney general as it relates to policy matters as it relates to policy matters , he is referenced to the president of the united states and it would be my responsibility to carry forward on things that this president of the united states would expect me to advance that s not inconsistent with what an attorney does , because an attorney represents individuals all the time that s part of what we 're trained to do on abortion rights mr specter permit me to go to a key issue on the choice issue , a woman s right to choose , and concerns which have been expressed about your enforcing the law , which i thought you stated very positively yesterday , and move to the area of prosecutorial discretion , where there is substantial leeway for an attorney general or even a district attorney , as i was for many years , dealing with the prosecutor s discretion on what cases to prosecute and how to handle them and what i think many americans are looking for , beyond your assurance that you will enforce the law , is your commitment to exercise your discretion to carry out the intent of the law on a woman s right to choose within the confines of existing law , which you have promised to support what assurances can you give , senator ashcroft , that your discretionary calls as attorney general will be to enforce the intent behind existing law on a woman s right to choose \?

jason isringhausen had just thrown the biggest pitch of his career , freezing jorge posada with a perfect fastball on the outside corner to put the oakland a s two outs away from escaping yankee stadium with a stunning twogamestonone lead in their american league division series against the yankees jason giambi wandered over from first base , spying the grimaces and gumchewing that racked the neophyte closer s face , and told him to relax isringhausen tried to hide his response , covering his face in his large black glove , but he could not hide the nervous laughter he came up to me and said , 'just calm down , ' isringhausen said i told him , 'i ca n't feel my legs' that was the only thing , it made us both kind of laugh in this kind of atmosphere , it s real nerveracking i feel much better now , after it s all said and done the nerves now are on the other side isringhausen , the current a s closer and former mets starter , saved his second game in a row to preserve a 20 victory isringhausen , after a perfect ninth inning in game 1 , had both dugouts , as well as the raucous crowd , biting their fingernails in the final inning of game 2 the a s had stretched a onerun lead to two in the top of the ninth by scoring an unearned run against mariano rivera , the best reliever in the business now it was up to isringhausen , and when he surrendered a leadoff double to bernie williams and a walk to tino martinez , the nine saves he had blown this season bubbled to the surface but isringhausen s pitching has always relied on his talent more than on his mindset while some pitchers might wilt under the pressure , isringhausen did n't think he struck out posada , then got david justice and scott brosius on popups i was just raring back and throwing the ball as hard as i could and taking my chances , isringhausen said i was nervous , i admit i was scared to death but in the same sense , i was able to make some good pitches when i had to i 've never been in a position like this it was very exciting it s something i 'll never forget it s just nerves when was the last time i was ever here doing this \? before the game , a s manager art howe said that his closer has been throwing the ball well for us ever since he s been here , as far as i'm concerned last night , it showed you what he s made of and the kind of stuff he has , he said he s going to play a vital role for us in the postseason that might have seemed an unlikely proposition earlier this season isringhausen was converted from starter to closer when he was dealt from the mets to the a s on july 31 , 1999 , along with greg mcmichael , in exchange for billy taylor the experiment paid immediate dividends for the a s , because isringhausen did not allow a run in his first seven outings he finished that season by picking up eight consecutive saves when i scouted him , i had gone to see other guys , said j p ricciardi , the a s director of player personnel i saw izzy and i called billy beane and said , 'his stuff is just unbelievable' he had an aboveaverage fastball , a plus curve but around four innings in he would start to lose focus i mentioned to billy that i 'd really like to get this guy his stuff for one inning was just incredible billy then called me and said , 'we have a chance to get him for billy taylor' would i do it \? i said , 'do it , but remember , we 've got to make him a closer' as a starter , i would n't do it but it s worked out so far in his first full season as a closer in 2000 , isringhausen made the american league allstar team and finished the year with 33 saves in 40 opportunities but the move to the bullpen had its rocky moments , like the game on aug 8 last season when he blew his seventh save opportunity of the season on backtoback ninth inning home runs by bernie williams and justice this season , isringhausen s struggles grew worse he had nine blown saves by the start of august but the a s noticed a flaw in his delivery , a giveaway of what pitch was on the way that had been detected by the opponents isringhausen corrected the delivery and finished the season with nine saves in his last nine chances he has added two saves in the postseason it s great to go home up two , but we still know who we 're playing , isringhausen said i'm sure game 3 , if i'm out there doing the same thing , i 'll be just as nervous i think when you 're not nervous , you do n't need to be doing it anymore i mean , a lot of people are scared to death when they go out there , but it keeps you on the edge photo closer jason isringhausen finished the regular season for the a s by converting his final nine save chances \( barton silverman the new york times \)

albany , july 30 on sunday afternoon , the giants' new specialteams coach , fred von appen , characterized the state of the team s kicking game as muddled and sure enough , this morning at giants training camp even the giants' placekickers were suddenly thrown into the punting mix , booting spirals as they dusted off their form it looked like an open casting call now , over on field no 5 , it is four guys with no nfl punting experience trying out for a job with the national football conference champions standing nearby was andrew giuliani , son of the mayor of new york in giants camp to act as a ball boy , it seemed only a matter of time before he also tried out it is not every year that a conference champion defends its title without an experienced punter or placekicker , but in the nfl s salary cap era , every team gambles somewhere , and the giants have done so with their kicking game brad maynard , the giants' punter the last four seasons , signed a 1 million contract with the chicago bears the giants likewise chose to turn the page on the longtime placekicker brad daluiso , whose kickoff strength waned last season and so , on a team with some of the league s bestknown stars , the fortunes of the season could yet turn on one or two of these names john markham , rodney williams , tony umholtz and jaret holmes for the record , markham and holmes are the placekickers and williams and umholtz are the punters and for the record , although holmes was a allamerican punter at auburn , and markham was a punter at vanderbilt , neither is considered a viable punting option this season they punted as well as the genuine punting candidates today , but as holmes said , we were just screwing around the timing seemed a little odd , coming as it did hours after markham scuffed a kick , umholtz had a bad day and williams scattered a few punts as the team and coaching staff watched but von appen insisted he was just letting the placekickers punt to liven up practice and in case they are ever needed in an emergency you do n't want one guy doing both jobs , von appen said not only is it difficult , but if that one guy gets hurt , you 're really in trouble at the same time , as fickle as football coaches are in this department , it is possible that none of the kickers and punters in training camp will make the team markham was a fifthround draft pick this spring but the others are freeagent signings in the next few weeks , other teams will release placekickers and punters if the current cast of giants kickers does not start to impress , someone else s castoff might seem enticing if we 're not satisfied , that s true , von appen said the guys here have to know that von appen , 59 , is a longtime football coach but hardly a conventional one already he has introduced wild scramble kickoff formations where all the coverage men group behind the kicker and then sprout in 10 different directions as the ball is kicked he has practiced half a dozen trick plays on punts and fieldgoal attempts and even let some players devise schemes von appen is a voracious reader and taught a course while serving as the head football coach at the university of hawaii he lectured on the poet sylvia plath but he acknowledges that he is taking on a lot to mold a specialteams unit behind a placekicker and a punter with so little experience that s always tough , von appen said i 've been reminded of it frequently by all factions inside and outside the team holmes does have nfl experience he kicked two field goals in 1999 with the bears and two more for the giants last season when daluiso was injured but the giants were obviously not sold on holmes as daluiso s replacement because they drafted markham , even though the collegian was not on any allstar teams nor invited to scouting combines holmes and markham kicked better this afternoon in their second audition in front of coach jim fassel so did williams , who was a highly rated punter coming out of georgia tech two years ago after he averaged 425 yards a punt his senior year , the st louis rams used their seventhround pick on him , but he was cut in training camp williams surfaced last year with the washington redskins , who also cut him in training camp washington thought they were going to be a super bowl team , and they wanted an established punter , williams said but i had a great camp , and i really believe i could have done as well as anyone else in the league last year but williams did not get a call from anyone until the giants brought him in for a tryout last february so

one of shakespeare s most linguistically sophisticated plays , and also one of his most bitterly satirical , troilus and cressida is a sort of backstage drama , a tale of the bickering and backbiting that fester behind public presentation it s a love story set during the seventh year of the trojan war , but the focus is on folly , not grandeur the lovers of the title are more selfish than noble , more randy than pure of heart and as for the military adversaries , the greek officers are bored and selfinvolved and basically ca n't stand one another the trojans are war weary and their royal family \( priam and his sons , including the great warrior hector , the priapic paris and the whimsically passionate troilus \) is divided about whether the war is worth perpetuating all may be fair in love and war , but none of it , in this play , is admirable there s no real protagonist the clearest perspective belongs to thersites , a vulgar , unkempt , invectivespewing slave who serves as a mocking chorus and finds everyone , not without reason , contemptible and it all takes place during a hiatus in battle , at a time when troilus and cressida have a brief , consummating encounter and are then forcibly separated , so very little loving or fighting actually goes on it is a play in which rhetoric of a particularly convoluted and densely clever stripe is the star a new production of it by the off broadway company theater for a new audience opened yesterday at the american place theater the director is peter hall , a british theater icon who , among a long list of achievements , founded the royal shakespeare company and who last october directed john barton s 10hour epic , tantalus , which also deals with the trojan war sir peter is , by his own confession , dedicated to shakespeare s language the disciplined delivery of its poetics he has said as well that he approaches a production without an overall concept and lets the rehearsal process and the actors determine the show s tone and direction it is an idealistic approach that expresses utter confidence in the theater s collaborative creative process but in this case it has generated a sluggish , unilluminating production of a play that begs for the kind of momentum and clarity that a propulsive directorial hand can provide performed here in the round , on a stage turned into a sandbox , the play opens with its most stirring imagery two skeletons swathed in rags and propped against each other as if rotting after a beach picnic , and two others in a stark , coital embrace , a chilling depiction of shakespeare s bilefilled connection between lust and battle but it is merely an admonitory prologue the skeletons are swept off by the grimy thersites \( andrew weems \) , and the stage is left clear for the static gatherings and the verbal proclamations and manipulations that hold sway in each of the opposing military camps in spite of a relentless parade of entrances and exits and a couple of gymnastic fight scenes toward the end , the production is thicklimbed and trudging it never burrows from under the selfdeluding and often overwrought bloviations of characters for whom selfimportance knows no bounds it is both shakespeare s genius and shakespeare s joke that they express themselves with some of the knottiest verbiage in any of his plays princes , begins agamemnon , addressing his high command in an attempt to rouse their flagging enthusiasm for the war , what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks \?

east rutherford , nj , april 28 it took the devils more than four periods over two games before they finally pushed a puck past toronto goaltender curtis joseph it then took the devils less than a period to blow a threegoal lead tonight but with the defending stanley cup champions in danger of falling into a twogamestonone hole in the fourofsevengame eastern conference semifinals , the devils' randy mckay redeemed his teammates , his linemates and himself from just off the right post , with his line attacking joseph on a threeontwo rush , mckay tapped in a pass from bobby holik at 5 minutes 31 seconds of overtime to give the devils a wild 65 victory in game 2 i just tried to redirect it , mckay said of holik s pass through the slot in doing so , mckay , whose line was on the ice for four of toronto s goals , tied the series at 11 the series now shifts to toronto for games 3 and 4 on tuesday and thursday nights alexander mogilny had two goals and three assists , and scott gomez contributed a goal and two assists before the devils blew thirdperiod leads of 41 and 52 mats sundin and steve thomas who did not score last season when the devils beat the leafs in the semifinals in six games led a furious comeback with two thirdperiod goals apiece it was all for naught , however sergei brylin , a new addition tonight to holik s line , blocked aki berg s shot from the right point , a play that led to the gamewinning rush up the ice by mckay the goal was the fourth this spring for mckay , a 34yearold right wing whose 18 playoff goals are the most by any active devil but mckay thought he played so poorly that he apologized to coach larry robinson afterward he said , 'i do n't think i have ever played this poorly , ' robinson said mckay said i was really upset in the third period , i seemed to be going the wrong way for once , a playoff overtime was kind to martin brodeur , the devils' goaltender , who was 412 in extra time in the postseason before tonight the leafs , meanwhile , had won seven consecutive overtime games in the playoffs everybody s been talking about cujo , cujo , cujo , brodeur said , referring to joseph , who had allowed three goals in five playoff games this spring it was nice to go out and get some goals and see he s human like everybody else joseph beat the devils , 20 , in game 1 until gomez redirected ken daneyko s shot past joseph at 2 58 of the second period tonight to tie the game at 11 , it looked as though the devils might never score but once gomez did , joseph s shutout string of 213 47 on the road this postseason , and his aura of invincibility , vanished gomez turned in his best period of the postseason in the second , parking himself in front of joseph at every opportunity , no matter how many times he was knocked down he was possessed , robinson said mckay said he played smart he played hard he got rewarded joseph , however , complained that gomez was in the crease quite a bit he s that good , you 've got to do something , gomez said with a smile and a shrug after opening the playoffs by not allowing a goal away from home in 11 periods , joseph , and the leafs in front of him , became a sieve in the second period with gomez distracting joseph as he battled dmitri yushkevich off the right post as the teams skated four a side , brian rafalski beat joseph with a wrist shot from the left circle at 5 25 to give the devils a 21 lead mogilny made it 31 at 9 27 , when he beat joseph after gomez had freed him on a breakaway rush with three leafs in pursuit john madden finished off the scoring in the second at 15 04 with his first goal of the playoffs on another breakaway after toronto had committed a turnover in the neutral zone the leafs panicked in the second period , said pat quinn , the toronto coach and general manager the devils panicked in the third , robinson said toronto , which had received a firstperiod goal from defenseman danny markov , opened the third period shorthanded and trailing by 41 before we went out in the third , we had a little chat , thomas said we wanted to win the period we said we were n't going to roll over and do whatever they want the leafs accomplished more than that when sundin , toronto s captain , lifted a backhand shot over brodeur s right shoulder 29 seconds into the third period , the leafs were within 42 mogilny answered from the slot at 1 07 to reestablish the threegoal lead , this time at 52 the goal was the first for the devils on the power play this series it was set up by a gomez pass , and by mckay , who distracted joseph by occupying a pair of toronto defensemen just outside the crease brodeur stopped sundin on a breakaway less than three minutes into the third period but thomas cut the lead to 53 at 5 59 , elevating a backhander over brodeur , who was lying on his stomach after stopping sundin on a rush when sundin scored his second goal of the night at 9 33 , beating brodeur on the stick side from off the right post , the devils' lead was only 54 finally , with about a minute remaining in regulation , joseph skated toward the toronto bench , as brodeur missed wide on his rinklong attempt to score into an empty net toronto pressed its attack , and it paid off thomas teed up a loose puck at the right circle and rifled a shot over scott stevens and past brodeur for the tying goal with 23 seconds to play the devils' collapse ended in overtime , however i feel very strange right now , said robinson , who admitted that his team was a little lucky to be heading to toronto with the series even at a game apiece slap shots lou lamoriello , the devils' president and general manager , has asked the national hockey league for a postponement in the decision he must make about the devils' draft choice compensation from the st louis blues from a sevenyearold tampering case he requested the postponement because of a new rule in which the stanley cup champion now drafts last in the first round regardless of where it finished in the regular season the devils were awarded the option , on jan 4 , 1999 , of a no 1 draft pick and the right to switch no 1 picks with the blues , over a span of five years , after st louis was found guilty of tampering with the freeagenttobe scott stevens in the summer of 1994 unless a postponement is granted , the devils must tell the league by may 1 what they want to do photo randy mckay flipping the puck past maple leafs goalie curtis joseph for the winning goal five and a half minutes into overtime the series , tied at 11 , shifts to toronto \(

the rangers played their last home game of another futile season last night and the only news really worth noting was that it might have been the last time adam graves appeared as a new york ranger in madison square garden no one knows whether the rangers will bring back the immensely popular graves for one more season , or buy out the final year of his guaranteed contract graves struggled this season , but ranger fans will forever remember that in 199394 , he scored a franchiserecord 52 goals as the rangers won the stanley cup for the first time in 54 years and that three years later , he scored the overtime goal in game 5 that gave the rangers a stunning secondround upset of the rival devils for the rangers and in particular for graves , brian leetch , mike richter and the captain , mark messier , the four players who were there then and now that goal was something of a last hurrah , because the team has not made it to the postseason since it has been a depressing free fall , and as a fourth straight empty campaign comes to a conclusion , the questions are what caused it \? was it the bitter departure of messier in the summer of 1997 , when he opted for a big contract offer from vancouver \? or did the crumbling begin before then , while the rangers were still qualifying for the playoffs and giving their fans some reason to believe \? certainly , recordwise , we 've fallen from 1997 , but we were already starting to go through some changes even then , said leetch , who has been a ranger since the spring of 1988 and has the longest current tenure on the team maybe making the semifinals that spring masked some problems and then mark being gone made it worse not even messier s triumphant return to the rangers last summer could prevent another seminar in bad hockey this season , which included last night s 31 loss to carolina even a messier guarantee in this case , that the team would make the playoffs went unfulfilled messier has been steadfast in refusing to speak publicly about what went wrong this season it is what it is , he said recently it just speaks for itself messier s boss , glen sather , a hockey hall of famer who spent most of his first season in new york spinning his wheels , vows he will turn the franchise around the question is how \? recently , sather was asked whether he thought that cablevision , which owns the rangers , would tolerate a true rebuilding , even it meant several more barren years without a postseason appearance do n't say , 'could i \? ' the team s 57yearold president and general manager said defiantly i am going to rebuild don maloney , a rangers player for more than 10 seasons and the club s assistant general manager for the past four , said the mindset before this was that the people of new york were n't going to wait to see a team grow and mature i do n't believe that maloney is not sure where it went wrong for a franchise that , remarkably , has had the biggest payroll in the national hockey league through this entire collapse you ca n't just nail it down to one thing , maloney said you can probably start tracing it back to '96'97 , when the organization continued to try to acquire players for cup runs and maybe sacrificed some younger players and draft picks in the 1990 s , the rangers were run by neil smith , who put together the team that won the rangers' first stanley cup since 1940 , even though it meant trading away valuable young players like tony amonte and doug weight who could argue it was not worth it , particularly for a franchise that heard taunting chants of 1940 when it played on the road people could still be chanting that , said st louis blues general manager larry pleau , who was smith s assistant general manager at the time that s the bottom line they won and neil did the right things to put the team in that position but there were other deals that did not work out i do n't know what prompted them to trade sergei zubov and aleksei kovalev , said one league executive who asked not to be identified , referring to the departure of two russianborn players who helped the rangers win the cup those are two impact players and not resigning messier for whatever reason , they decided they wanted wayne gretzky instead those are the three critical things for me then there were the annual entry drafts from 1989 to 1997 , the rangers' top choices were steven rice , michael stewart , kovalev , peter ferraro , niklas sundstrom , dan cloutier , christian dube , jeff brown and stefan cherneski none are now with the team if you look back at the drafts and the development of players , we were a little thin there , said maloney , who insisted on accepting his share of the blame when you look at the drafts of five or six years ago , those are the players you expect to be on your hockey team now in the summer of 1999 , smith decided to put more emphasis on the draft and rebuilding , trading up to take pavel brendl fourth over all and jamie lundmark ninth to buy time for both to develop and become centerpieces of the team , smith went out and signed six free agents to lucrative contracts theo fleury , valery kamensky , st phane quintal , sylvain lefebvre , tim taylor and kirk mclean it did not work if there was a miscalculation , it was that new york would n't support a total revamping of the team , maloney said we tried to revamp in a subtle way and so we signed the free agents to carry us through as a stopgap but what we learned was that you ca n't sign as many guys as we ended up signing to try and plug holes you need a core of homegrown players to be successful if you do n't have that , you 're never going to be successful and that takes time which smith eventually ran out of the freeagent avenue they took was right in principle , said john davidson , the team s former goalie and its longtime television analyst but it just shows you what the team concept is all about in other words , a lot of free agents do not necessarily make for a determined team said colin campbell , the rangers' coach from 1995 to early 1998 , it s always easy to secondguess , especially after missing out on the playoffs four years in a row but the plan always has been altered every year sather said a total rebuilding of the team is what he is after sather even conceded the process began with smith neil made a real conscious choice to get brendl and lundmark and those might turn out to be great decisions for this team , sather said but you have to be prepared to suffer for a while as if the past four seasons were not enough photo adam graves , giving his jersey to a fan , may never again wear a rangers sweater \( chang w lee the new york times \)

washington , nov 11 the police chief of portland , me , says the fbi threatened to charge him with obstruction of justice if his officers continued to chase a terrorism suspect after sept 11 baltimore s police commissioner says he was dumbfounded to learn that the federal bureau of investigation would give him the names of suspects who might be connected to the september hijackings but not their photographs the mayor of reno , nev , was shocked to learn from a local television reporter not from the fbi that the bureau had seized a suspicious letter from a local microsoft office and that a preliminary test indicated it was laced with anthrax two months after state and local law enforcement officials found themselves forced onto the front lines of a global war on terrorism , many are complaining that the fbi is refusing to provide them with the information they need to protect their communities there s real frustration , said bill berger , president of the international association of chiefs of police and police chief of north miami beach , fla he said that despite repeated pledges from the bureau to step up cooperation after sept 11 , he was still hearing angry complaints from his fellow chiefs i do n't think that we can afford to have these impediments to information any longer , the chief said some of these terrorists were living in our communities criticism of the bureau s performance since sept 11 has been growing in washington as well the frustration on capitol hill has deepened in recent days with the disclosure that bureau agents may have missed opportunities to gather valuable evidence in the investigation of anthrax attacks the bureau s new director , robert s mueller iii , has acknowledged serious coordination problems with state and local law enforcement agencies , and he has pledged to work with them more closely i learned that in some cases , the fbi was turning away your offers of help that is unacceptable , he told a convention of police chiefs last week i have heard that there are some areas where lines of communications are n't as open as they should be , where we 're keeping you at arm s length but the frustration of state and local officials has already been communicated to congress , where a powerful , bipartisan group of senators is supporting a bill to lift a variety of restrictions on intelligence sharing between the fbi and state and local law enforcement officials though complaints from the local authorities are not limited to intelligence sharing since the days of j edgar hoover , state and local officials have complained that the bureau is highhanded with its local counterparts and that the fbi looks for any excuse not to share even the most innocuous intelligence information even with changes in the law , bureau officials say , it will still be impossible to share certain , highly classified national security information but the complaints from local officials have taken on new urgency with the government s warnings of the possibility of another wave of terrorist attacks on american soil many police departments say the bureau is passing up a valuable resource by failing to allow local police to follow up on the tips that have overwhelmed the fbi s 11 , 000 agents since sept 11 and is hampering their ability to protect their communities there are 650 , 000 cops in this country , and we should all be used in this hunt , said edward t norris , baltimore s police commissioner there are leads that the fbi ca n't possibly find the time to run down we 've got experienced investigators who can run them out the bureau has announced that a highranking official , kathleen l mcchesney , an assistant director who now directs the fbi training center in quantico , va , will be responsible for improving coordination with state and local police departments we 're fighting the terrorists , not each other , said ms mcchesney , who joined the bureau after seven years with the police department in king county , wash mr mueller has also agreed to a request from state and local police departments to make the bureau s watch list of criminal suspects available instantly by computer the fbi director is scheduled to meet later this month with a delegation of local police officials to discuss other ways to improve communications the fbi does have prominent supporters in the ranks of state and local law enforcement agencies the chief spokesman of the los angeles police department said city officials had received excellent cooperation from the bureau in dealing with terrorists threats since sept 11 the police chief of tulsa , okla , ron palmer , said , i know some of my peers are not pleased , but we 're very lucky in tulsa because we have established a good rapport with the fbi there is mutual respect and communication chief berger in north miami beach said he , too , had a good relationship with the bureau s miami office but in interviews , many other state and local officials around the country said that their frustration was growing and that they found it difficult to believe that mr mueller would be able to change the culture of one of the federal government s most hidebound and turfconscious agencies i understand what the fbi is about it s all about culture and elitism , said chief michael j chitwood in portland , me sept 11 should have changed all that but it did n't sept 11 showed that there are terrorists who lived among us who better to know these people than the local police \? he said the exchange of information with the fbi remained a oneway street , with the bureau accepting information but offering none in return the city s police were quickly drawn into the sept 11 investigation after it was discovered that two of the hijackers had spent their final night in portland chief chitwood said his officers received a tip on sept 12 that an afghan man living nearby might be tied to the hijackings and that he , too , had sought flying lessons but when portland police officers went looking for the man , mr chitwood said , they were confronted by local fbi agents who issued a stark threat they said , 'you tell chitwood that he s skirting with obstruction of justice , ' if the inquiry continued , the chief recalled mr chitwood said he later learned that the afghan man had been under fbi surveillance for weeks , without any notice to the local police department the man , he said , was subsequently cleared of suspicion i do n't have to know what s going on in new york city , chief chitwood said i do n't have to know what s going on in los angeles but i think i'm entitled to know what s going on in portland a spokeswoman for the fbi office in boston , which oversees portland , had no comment on the chief s remarks
acting in a case that was being closely watched by foreign governments and death penalty lawyers around the country , gov frank keating of oklahoma yesterday turned down a request for clemency from a mexican citizen who at the time of his arrest was not advised of his right under an international treaty to contact his embassy in a letter to president vicente fox of mexico , who had personally appealed for the sentence to be commuted , mr keating acknowledged that the failure of oklahoma officials to advise the inmate , gerardo valdez , of his right to contact mexican diplomats was a clear violation of article 36 of the vienna convention on consular rights , which the united states has ratified while regretful and inexcusable , governor keating wrote , this violation does not in and of itself establish clearly discernible prejudice or that a different conclusion would have been reached at trial or on appeal of mr valdez s conviction or sentence the mexican government said last night that it deeply regrets the decision , which is contrary to international law and the elemental principles of cooperation between nations it added , we consider it is an obligation of the government of the united states to assure that states comply with the vienna convention mr valdez was convicted in 1989 of the murder of a man who had made homosexual advances to him in a bar , according to the record in the case the mexican government did not learn about his conviction until last april when it did , it hired lawyers and psychologists who developed evidence about brain damage to mr valdez that had not been presented to the jury governor keating s decision caught the mexican government and death penalty lawyers by surprise the action came even though the oklahoma pardons board had voted to recommend that the governor commute mr valdez s sentence to life in prison it was only the second time in 30 years that the oklahoma board had voted for clemency in a capital case , and one of those voting for clemency was a former prosecutor who strongly supports the death penalty if governor keating had granted clemency to mr valdez , there would have been pressure on other governors to follow suit , death penalty lawyers said currently , 97 foreign citizens are on death rows in 17 states , according to mark warren , a human rights researcher in canada who is considered a leading authority on the subject with 26 , california has the most , followed by texas , with 24 the inmates are from 34 countries , including britain and france , but nearly half are mexican , according to mr warren in reaching his decision , governor keating told president fox that he and his staff had consulted with the state and justice departments the state department said yesterday that it had asked governor keating to give careful consideration to the representations of the government of mexico in the clemency process and to consider whether the failure of consular notification prejudiced the conviction or sentence the mexican government was disappointed that the state department had not acted more forcefully mexican officials and mr valdez s lawyers said that in the case of a canadian citizen facing execution in texas two years ago , secretary of state madeleine k albright had sent a long letter that left no doubt that she wanted the authorities to grant clemency in spite of the effort , the canadian , stanley faulder , was executed in the last eight years , 15 foreign citizens have been executed by seven states , according to mr warren s list none were advised of their consular rights several foreign governments have in the past made formal protests to the united states over the failure to comply with the vienna convention it is a right that the united states vigorously asserts on behalf of american citizens arrested abroad there is no dispute about mr valdez s guilt but his lawyers strongly took issue with numerous points in mr keating s letter to mr fox mr keating said that mr valdez had been well represented by an experienced lawyer , and twice mr keating said that the lawyer spoke spanish sandra babcock , who represents the mexican government in this case , said that mr valdez s lawyer , while good , had never tried a case in which the death penalty was possible it would have been better if they had appointed somebody who had tried a capital case , ms babcock said , rather than someone merely because he spoke spanish ms babcock , a death penalty lawyer from minneapolis , added that the mexican government considered this the most egregious case of a vienna convention violation because of the length of time without any consular assistance whatsoever , and because no one , either at trial or on appeal , ever bothered to conduct even the most rudimentary investigation into his background after the mexican government learned of mr valdez s case two months before his scheduled execution , it hired ms babcock and spanishspeaking investigators and neuropsychologists an investigator went to mexico and learned that as a child mr valdez had fallen from a tree , suffering damage to his head , and that as an adult he had been in two or three car accidents the neuropsychologist examined mr valdez for two days and gave him extensive brain tests he concluded that mr valdez suffered from severe brain damage none of this was known by mr valdez s trial lawyers , so it was not presented to the jury it could have helped mr valdez in his insanity defense and after he was convicted , it would have been powerful evidence to present to the jury in arguing that mr valdez should not be executed , ms babcock said photo gov frank keating of oklahoma refused to stay the execution of a mexican convicted of murder \( associated press

herat , afghanistan , feb 25 three of muhammad uddin s sons froze to death along the narrow rim of the sabzak pass , where the elevation was steep and the truck tires could not hold the snowfall was thick , the winds piercing to one side was a yawning plunge the eight families that had crowded into the vehicle s open flatbed thought it better to climb out and sleep on the wet ground than chance a mortal slide over the edge they were fleeing hunger , and their journey had begun with a threeday walk to the road through the mountains , carrying what they could , many of them burdened with exhausted children rather than extra clothing and blankets mr uddin s boys were 8 , 6 and 3 in the morning s unfolding light , he saw that their faces had turned a bluish color and their jaws had gone slack he poked at them he poked again and then he understood the cold took their lives , he said listlessly , soon after reaching herat , drawn here by a lodestone of food no more bountiful than a monthly ration of wheat flour since fall , afghan villagers have been making their way to this city by the hundreds , until the hundreds are now 80 , 000 , and the 80 , 000 may well double as the snows melt in the distant peaks and gullies they have buried their dead , mortgaged their land and sold the last of their possessions usually a proud and rugged people , they have dropped even the pretense of tenacity they are begging famine is a gradual disaster , slowly depleting crops and cupboards , and when it finally arrives in its fullness , the world looks at the skeletal victims and wonders how did it happen \? where were the warnings \? in afghanistan afflicted with unending war and without an effectual government famine has been regularly dispatching its heralds for three years running , drought has parched the fields , starved the farm animals and dried up the rivers hungry people , deprived of yet another harvest , have eaten what little seed they had kept in reserve in all , more than 700 , 000 people about 4 percent of afghanistan s population have been on the move in a desperate migration , according to aid groups they have flocked to the bigger towns and cities or crossed the border into iran and pakistan more than one million are at risk of starvation , say united nations officials , pleading for emergency help erick de mul , the organization s relief coordinator for afghanistan , defined at risk as death by outright starvation or weakening or epidemic in the next few months for the most part , help is not on its way the united nations and many relief organizations have had trouble raising money for assistance donor fatigue is thought to be the problem , a weariness from two decades of afghanistan s sequential woes it s not a case of crying wolf it s a case of the wolf always being at the door , said hanschristian poulsen , who heads the united nations humanitarian efforts in herat afghans have been at war for 22 years , first in an epic resistance against soviet troops , then in factional , backstabbing combat against each other most of the nation is now ruled by taliban mullahs who offend the west with their stern interpretations of islam and their unflagging hospitality to the accused terrorist osama bin laden nations donating aid are also skeptical about the dimensions of the crisis for now , estimating the endangered population involves guesswork , with most presumed victims living in remote villages , unreachable by aid workers either because of the winter or the war then as well , in afghanistan it is often hard to distinguish between the bad times and the worse even without famine , more than one in four children die before the age of 5 and the average life expectancy is 44 hunger has become a helpmate to other causes of death we 're about kneedeep into a crisis now , and the potential of it becoming shoulderdeep is very great , said simon richards , who runs the office in herat for the charity christian aid what we are seeing are displaced people pouring in , but they 're actually the better off they at least had the means to pay for transportation most people do n't mr uddin , with his three sons now buried and his spirit in atrophy , paid about 12 a person for his family s ride in that open truck , packed so tightly that people had to take turns to sit down his home is a village in badghis province people are starving there , he said i borrowed money to go , with my land as collateral he tugged at a thin tawny blanket that was draped over his shoulders and again relived his worst memory it was very , very cold in the sabzak pass day after day , the big trucks arrive , people and possessions piled in a disorderly heap six camps have been set up in and around herat , the largest being maslakh , 12 miles away in a treeless stretch of windswept land another vehicle from badghis rumbles in , this one with farmers from a different village but a story that was much the same muhammad ramazan had lost two children , ages 5 and 3 , during the frigid journey he too was wrapped in a thin blanket a safety pin substituted for buttons on his shirt we were on top of the truck , and we could never cover ourselves properly , he said
i love to go to places like this , but none of my friends do what fun , said a diner at house of dosas , a south indian vegetarian restaurant in hicksville that attracts adventurous eaters seeking authenticity and variety conservative meatandpotato types are not among the sprinkling of anglos who join the many natives of the subcontinent at this new 64seat spot at 416 south broadway \( 5169387517 \) although house of dosas , with its rice and lentil flour crepes , is an offbeat experience for americans , people from southern india see it as the real thing , a taste of home they come not just from the growing hicksville indian community but from flushing , new jersey and all around the new york metropolitan area they arrive at this clean , bright , simple eating place wearing flowing gowns and jeans , turbans and baseball caps sitting at bare tables in the modest stucco and brick dining room with its artificial flowers , mirrors and sparse scattering of indian art , they most often order the rarely encountered dosas and equally uncommon uttappams the latter is a bland lentil and rice flour pancake given occasional spicy jolts by green pepper slivers unlike the flat uttappams , the feathery dosas \( whose rice and lentil flour mixture is fermented over night \) come in all shapes , sizes , textures and flavors some look like ordinary crepes or pancakes , others are folded over like an omelet , rolled into very long hollow cylinders or made into crisp , waferlike sheets that flake off and disintegrate to the touch most are stuffed curried and spiced vegetables , usually a more or less similar mash of potatoes , onions , herbs and spices dosas are often served for breakfast in india , accompanied by a number of cooling chutneys and a sambar , or lentil pur e , cooked with various vegetables and spices but house of dosas is n't india s answer to the international house of pancakes its dosas are never heavy , soggy or sweet although many dishes here look like asian versions of standard american preparations , they yield very different flavors an aloo bonda \( 3 \) appetizer of two fried onionstudded potatofilled lentil dumplings look a bit like knishes , but pack some unexpected punch from fiery peppers dahi vada \( 4 \) , another starter , two warm doughnut lookalikes , are made from coarsely ground lentil flour and floated in an anemic milky yogurt rasam \( 2 \) might seem to be a placid consomm , but this tasty lentilbased brew packs a big , spicy kick a vegetable curry , palak paneer \( 650 \) , seemingly a ringer for creamed spinach , is a supercharged version with chunks of cottage cheese and a lively though not spicy masala or spice mixture it s the masalas and chutneys with their intricate , varied mixtures that give character and add interest to even the blandest dishes speaking of spices , although some dishes without the star signifying spicy deliver a kick , perhaps half the menu is more soothing than searing six or seven of the nine rice specialties \( 550 and 650 \) are mild and subtle the aromatic lemon rice was nonthreatening , and even the starred tamarind version was n't particularly hot both came with coconut chutney and sambar , a cooling yogurt and onion dip and masalas containing coriander , curry leaves , garlic , ginger chili , onions and much more my favorite dosa was the cheese masala \( 695 \) , a rolled rice crepe with melting cheese on its inner wall and an onion and potato filler it beats the safe , though not particularly interesting , chinese dosa with pallid vegetables and noodles pakoras \( 350 \) coarse , chopped , deepfried onion , spinach and chickpea flour fritters are a savory starter selection , but unlike most choices from this menu they are widely available house of dosas is as notable for what it omits as for what it serves none of the northern favorites seen at most local indian restaurants \( roghan josh , tandoori dishes , tikka kebabs or chicken curries \) will be found here \( also noteworthy are the prices entrees cost from 5 to 8 and a glass of soda is 1 \) the exotic , narrowly focused ingredients , combinations and

belle terre matt and debra cody seem like a couple who have it all married for 18 years , they finish each other s sentences , still look at each other like newlyweds , and call themselves soul mates their 20 , 000squarefoot home in the affluent village of belle terre has an indoor pool and an outdoor pool , an elevator , a playground straight out of most children s dreams and customized bedrooms for each of their three children but the closedcircuit television on the grounds was not installed to catch burglars the pools are used less for recreation than for therapy and none of the children invite their classmates over to swim or climb in their playground the cody children are all autistic dillon , 16 , often hits himself in the head with his foot , or smacks his nose with the palm of his hand , sometimes splitting his lip he eats inedible objects and has to be watched at all times shawn , 13 , is no danger to himself or others , but , something like dustin hoffman s character in the film rainman , he can name all the american presidents in order , the dates they were in office and the names of every president s wife kaitlin , 8 , takes daily medication to control her mood swings and aggressive behavior for their parents , life is a constant vigil , a juggling act and a roller coaster of emotions but looking beyond their own misfortune , the codys have made a commitment to help other families with autistic children they have given 500 , 000 to establish a resource data bank at the state university of new york at stony brook and recently pledged another 25 million to expand the university s autism clinic into a center combining diagnosis , clinical services and treatment , research , education and outreach the cody center for autism and developmental disabilities is tentatively scheduled to open in two years , directed by dr john pomeroy , who has worked with all three cody children and heads stony brook s autism clinic the idea , mr cody said , is to improve services for families with autistic children from the time we knew we had a problem with dillon , it took us almost three years and a lot of running around from doctor to doctor before we got a diagnosis , he said and as the kids get older , the resources diminish and the system gives up on them , parents do n't know where to turn , and the children are lost these kids have a normal lifespan , but no one thinks about what happens to them when they grow up our vision is a regional center , from birth to elder care at stony brook , officials are thrilled the cody center will greatly accelerate the work that we 're able to do for the autistic population , said the university s president , shirley strum kenny it allows us to bring together scientists and doctors from various departments who can all work together on the same issues the university has pledged 500 , 000 , to be matched by the state university of new york system the number of children being diagnosed with autism has risen significantly over the last five years , dr pomeroy said we 're not sure whether there is a real increase , or we are doing a better job diagnosing autism , he said at stony brook we already see about 300 families every year , and the numbers are growing the codys' challenge has spanned 15 years , since they noticed that their first son , dillon , at 1 year of age , was n't developing normally he was a beautiful , attentive and normal baby , mrs cody said then little by little , he stopped progressing , and after a while , i could no longer get his attention he seemed to have lost everything that he had learned by 3 years old , we knew something was wrong , but no doctor could figure out what it was i was seven months pregnant with our second child when we finally learned that dillon was autistic we had never before even heard the term , and i suddenly felt as if somebody had just ripped my heart out when shawn was born , i was a nervous wreck , mrs cody said but the doctors reassured us that although autism tends to run in families , the odds were in our favor for it not to happen again and shawn was a perfect baby but at about 3 years old , shawn too began to display obsessive and repetitive behaviors , lining up his blocks over and over again then suddenly he stopped talking and became locked in his own world , not interacting at all with other children , mrs cody said it was n't long before we realized that he too was autistic five years later , mrs cody became pregnant again we sat together at the kitchen table , agonizing over what to do , said mrs cody , who is now 44 i did n't know if i could go through it again mr cody said we were relieved to find out from the amniocentesis that the baby was a girl , because the risk of autism with girls is far less but we also knew that after having two autistic children , our risk was higher to have a third autistic child but he said , if anyone could take care of these kids with special needs , we could like her brothers , katy was born happy , healthy and seemingly normal but once again , at age 3 katy began to withdraw
red bank this is a restaurant review , but it may remind you of those almosttoogoodtobetrue articles meant to put a human face on the newest census data immigrant striver comes to new jersey , opens ethnic restaurant in virgin territory in the suburbs , wows the critics , succeeds beyond wildest dreams throw in a couple of john le carr plot twists , and you have the story of siam garden myra downey , who despite her whitebread name is not only the general manager of this allthai restaurant but a native ukrainian , worked as a chemical engineer in kiev , her home country s capital she and her husband fell in love with kiev s only thai restaurant when their company relocated them to new jersey , the downeys conceived an idea that even in hindsight sounds a little wacky why not move the restaurant , chef and all , from kiev to monmouth county \? it may have sounded wacky , but events proved it shrewd , if not visionary in recent years red bank has become an upscale shopping destination , the sort of town that could emerge from the highflying 90 s with a restoration hardware , a starbucks and an officially designated arts and antique district it was clearly ready for the hip , mildly adventurous dining experience that siam garden was ready to provide the restaurant holds down a prominent corner of the galleria , an elegantly restored factory building from red bank s early20thcentury heyday as a manufacturing hub it inhabits an lshaped space with room for 27 tables \( 5 more in the summer , when an outdoor patio becomes an ideal setting for thai food and fourth of july fireworks \) the name siam garden sounds generic , but it s apt ms downey and her decorators have turned this postindustrial space into a kind of biosphere , far removed from whatever world you 've just stepped out of behind the reception desk , a small wooden model of a thai fishing boat glistens with fresh seafood laid out on ice the exposedbrick walls are hung with ornamental fans and scarves , the concrete ceilings with pinpoint halogen lamps that cast a diffused , exotic glow banks of orchids lend a soothing rainforest note , offsetting the restaurant s noise and bustle the melodiously named kitchen team suchart tiawskul , the executive chef , and jintana viriyamano , manut nyamsittivorapong and half a dozen others have assembled one of those endless , bewildering menus that consist of many variations on several themes \( the dinner menu a woodbound volume with the heft of an encyclopedia lists 92 numbered dishes , and the servers inform you that any curry can be substituted for any other , multiplying the choices into three digits \) other reviewers have couched their praise for siam garden in mild complaints that the cooking is not quite authentic , slightly toned down and homogenized for american palates i see their point , but for the most part i think the dishes work on their own terms take the most arresting dish we sampled over two visits , thai river prawns in red curry , a special one saturday night two prawns fiercelooking primeval creatures almost as big as young lobsters came split down the middle on a great platter of blue thai crockery , bathed in an unctuous sauce of coconut milk laced with strips of hot red pepper the prawns are so spiny that you wish you had work gloves \( they must not have many natural enemies , a fellow diner observed dryly \) , but their meat is tender , chewy and flavorful , and the curry is potent and satisfying you soak it up with steamed fragrant rice from a big casserole set in the center of the table other dishes strike this same exuberant note among the appetizers , som tam thai , greenpapaya salad served in a ceramic boat , has layers of flavor and texture tart papaya , crunchy peanuts and green beans , with a small sharp explosion of green pepper keang pha gai is chicken soup in a hot , clear broth , fragrant with pepper and basil , given a welcome sour edge by green tomato we also liked marinated chicken wrapped in broad pandan leaves , which are grilled to give the dish a smoky essence , and the mixed satay of curried , grilled pork , chicken and beef spring rolls were tasty but greasy among the main dishes , beef and chicken curries seemed merely ordinary alongside those river prawns and a special seafood combination had a few too many elements , including mussels that were far too salty and chewy , though we loved the turbocharged green curry of lemongrass , dill , basil and hot green pepper but fried softshell crabs made a gorgeous impression , buried under an aromatic mound of yellow curry and deep green coriander a whole fried grouper looked nearly as spectacular as the prawns , and while the flavors were more muted , the fish was moist , meaty and huge and we enjoyed both braised duck served in a plain but satisfying soybased sauce on a bed of napa cabbage and vegetarian duck , a tofu concoction that will not fool anyone but has a pleasant , meaty texture and nicely absorbs its sauce \( vegetarian chicken , on the other hand , is simply weird \) desserts may owe something to the chefs' sojourn in kiev ice creams and sorbets are served in sundae glasses and topped with whipped cream and a cherry heavy and overproduced , after the multifaceted abundance that has come before mango with sticky rice would be better without the rice but one dessert is fascinating and , i have to suppose , authentically thai bour louy , described on the menu as rice dumpling boiled in coconut milk with plum sugar served in a crispy basket all true , but nothing quite prepares you for the dumplings , multicolored peasized balls of rice flour that soak up the sweet coconut milk , resulting in a texture somewhere between tapioca and bean paste it may not sound appealing , but it s hard to stop eating a return to a fanciful childhood , somewhere between bangkok , kiev and red bank , that completes the experience of dining in this fine , surprising

istanbul , jan 13 turkey s powerful military , whose influence and economic reach are unparalleled in other democracies , is facing its toughest fight yet not on the battlefield , but in a struggle against those who want to remodel the country to enter the european union of all the reforms turkey is being asked to undertake to join the european club , none would transform it as deeply as asserting civilian authority over the generals the outcome of the tussle between the military and those who demand change is important to more than turkey it will affect the balance of power in a strategic area between europe and asia , christianity and islam turkey , a nato and american ally , fields the region s strongest army and is regarded as a bulwark against instability still , a senior european union diplomat said , in its present militarycivilian configuration , turkey would be unacceptable to the eu the turks , the diplomat added , have to find a way to get the pashas out of politics that task confronts the generals with the prospect of losing their wellknown dominance of civilian affairs and their much less publicized but no less influential role in the country s economy both are changes they are prepared to resist modern turkey was founded in 1923 by a general , mustafa kemal ataturk , and his successors have staged coups three times in four decades , returning to barracks only after deeming affairs sufficiently secure to entrust to civilians after the most recent coup , in 1980 , it was the militarybacked government that drew up the 1982 constitution that still governs turkey the document anointed the generals guardians of turkey s secular government and territorial integrity , a mandate that has been interpreted broadly to cover almost any issue from the 15year war against kurdish separatists to pushing out an islamicled government in 1997 this week , president ahmet necdet sezer whom opinion polls recently placed in the unusual position of being more popular than the traditionally respected military threw down the latest of several challenges to the generals , calling for the constitution to be rewritten deputy prime minister mesut yilmaz has said that change in the role of the military is inevitable as the country approaches european union membership , though he carefully added that reforms would take time but the generals and their many supporters in government are resisting any major realignment , arguing that the strategic importance of turkey in a rough neighborhood demands a powerful military the conflicts and relations in the balkans , caucasus and middle east require us to maintain strong armed forces with a deterrence capability , defense minister sabahattin cakmakoglu said in an interview european countries face far less hostility from their neighbors and do not understand the need for a powerful military in turkey , he said the potential for tension between politicians and the military was further illustrated this week when the army was accused of meddling in government affairs through an investigation of corruption in the state energy department mr yilmaz , the deputy prime minister , remarked that government under the military would be more corrupt stung , the general staff swiftly responded with a statement accusing mr yilmaz of the greatest slander turkish military experts and western diplomats said in interviews that turkey s armed forces represent a stable and uncorrupted element in a society whose politicians are often weak and where scandals are routine believe me , we are not happy to be involved in all kinds of problems of turkey , said atilla kiyat , who retired 18 months ago as an admiral the lack of civilian authority is forcing us to be involved in those kinds of issues in a coincidence seen by some as symbolic , the offices for the new bureaucracy created to guide turkey s candidacy for the european union sit squarely in the shadow of the eightstory headquarters of the national security council in ankara , turkey s capital the 10member council , including the president , four cabinet ministers and the five top military commanders , sets the agenda on almost every important issue it is an arrangement that many say enables the generals to dominate , because they present a united front while the ministers are often divided by fractious politics the european union identified the reduction of the council s role as a top priority for turkey s membership volkan vural , the country s general secretary for european union affairs , said that the military supports membership and that the security council is already the advisory body the europeans demand how this can be clarified , i do n't know , said mr vural , a veteran diplomat who is preparing a 900page outline on joining europe for government leaders this month indirect pressure to curtail the military is also coming from the international monetary fund , which asked the government last month to trim the budget for the armed forces as part of reforms in return for 75 billion in emergency aid
twentyfive years ago this month , the yankees returned home from cincinnati , down two games in the world series on their way to being swept it was 1976 and yankee stadium , remodeled and reopened that very season , was back after a 12year absence in the world series business for me , as a young player in my first world series , i remember it feeling so different from anything during the regular season and even in the playoffs against kansas city , willie randolph said yesterday in the doorway of the coaches' room in the yankees' clubhouse everything felt different it even smelled different there was that fall crispness in fact , i remember it was cold , really cold these last few years , october does n't seem as cold as it did back then global warming hit the bronx , and maybe randolph s chilled memory has something to do with wintry tingles running down the spine of a rookie second baseman getting his baptism of fall classic fire against the big red machine of morgan and bench , of perez and rose history instructs us that the yankees used that series as a learning tool , acquiring more power and ego in the person of reggie jackson and beating the dodgers the next two years since 1996 , randolph has added four championship rings to his collection as the yankees' thirdbase coach he has spent most of a quartercentury in pinstripes after a childhood in brooklyn , a mets fan conditioned in the early 1960 s to believe that the world series had the permanent address of bronx , ny , much like kids around these parts now he and the yankees came home early yesterday morning after a couple of nights in phoenix that , for randolph , were virtual nights off he sent one runner home to score against curt shilling and none against randy johnson in games 1 and 2 of the 2001 world series the yankees looked as overmatched in the arizona desert at the bank one ballpark one of those new luxuryladen , taxfunded fun houses against the diamondbacks as they did against the reds in 1976 tonight , as they attempt to make this a series , the yankees play their last ace , and we 're not talking about their game 3 starter , roger clemens tonight the scene shifts to a cooler place , weatherwise and otherwise tonight they play the world series at yankee stadium , where , as manager joe torre said yesterday , you really feel it forgive these yankee bluebloods , for they cannot help themselves to them , yankee stadium is to the world series what harvard is to academia even randolph , who made it to the series with the oakland a s in 1990 against paul o'neill and another cincinnati team , admitted to his wife , gretchen it did n't feel much like fall in phoenix and he just could n't tap into classic karma at a place called the bob it was noisy and the park is beautiful but , i do n't know , it did n't feel the same , he said i ca n't really explain why it s just a special feeling i 've always gotten when we play a world series game at home for obvious reasons , yankee stadium will be more fortified than ever tonight in terms of public address pollution , it sure is a lot louder than in 1976 when , after a twoyear renovation , the stadium was hailed as a modernized monument to itself otherwise , yankee stadium has n't changed only the expectations of george steinbrenner , who has alternately been lobbying and threatening new york city for a new park , preferably in manhattan , in order to maximize his earning potential with four championships in five years , soaring attendance and ticket prices and mammoth television deals , steinbrenner deserves no sports owner welfare a metronorth stadium stop \? for sure improved parking and ramp access \? why not \? a few more luxury boxes \? go ahead , keep up with the joneses and jacobses but after sept 11 , with the hole in the city s downtown skyline still smoldering , who is going to so much as dare suggest we pull down yet another new york city landmark for more leg room and a couple of sushi bar concession stands \? more than ever we ought to understand why major league baseball should be preserved in the bronx and realize that yankee stadium is even more entwined with new york culture than it is with the world series as randolph said , it s about connecting the years , about familiar sights and smell the stadium itself will not beat arizona tonight the night will be chilly , though the feelings will be old i 'll know where i am when i step out there , randolph said he 'll be at home in the world series , at yankee stadium , bronx , ny photo a baseball park worth preserving \( g paul burnett the new york times \)
washington , may 24 attorney general john ashcroft said today that he would not further delay the scheduled june 11 execution of timothy j mcveigh , but acknowledged that the fbi had found about 900 more pages of documents related to the oklahoma city bombing that the government had failed to turn over to mr mcveigh s lawyers for his trial mr ashcroft said at a news conference at the justice department that he was now certain that the federal bureau of investigation had found all relevant documents in the case and that none cast doubt on mr mcveigh s conviction or the sentence of death he received for the 1995 terrorist attack that killed 168 people and injured scores of others the american people can have confidence that all documents now have been identified and produced , mr ashcroft said , and that nothing in any of the documents undermines mcveigh s admission of the murder of 168 of his fellow american citizens , or nothing in these documents undermines the justice of his sentence the attorney general announced his determination to go forward with mr mcveigh s execution , which was originally scheduled for may 16 , even as some government officials expressed concern that the new documents might lead to another postponement in what would be the first federal death sentence carried out in 38 years mr mcveigh s two top lawyers , robert nigh jr of tulsa , okla , and nathan d chambers of denver , had far different views of the documents than the attorney general at a news conference in tulsa , mr nigh said several of the witness statements that had been released to to the lawyers could have been used at mr mcveigh s trial mr nigh also questioned mr ashcroft s assertion that all the bureau s documents relating to mr mcveigh had been found and turned over to the lawyers mr nigh said he had not talked to mr mcveigh about mr ashcroft s statements but would continue to urge him to fight the execution mr mcveigh has not yet made a decision about whether to do so , mr neigh said in denver , mr chambers told reporters , we do not necessarily agree with his interpretation of the documents mr chambers added that he thought the new documents were potentially helpful in total , mr ashcroft said federal prosecutors had provided nearly 4 , 000 pages of interview reports and other documents to defense lawyers for mr mcveigh , and terry l nichols , who was sentenced to life in prison for helping to carry out the bombing mr nichols s lawyers have sought a new trial michael tigar , a lawyer for mr nichols , said today that mr ashcroft was wrong in his description of the some of the documents as the irrelevant and unsolicited writings of psychics and mental patients there are no ufo sightings i 've seen , mr tigar said of his review of the documents that s not the content of the majority of these documents for him to suggest to the contrary and seek to kill another human being without an inquiry into the unprecedented series of fbi failures to obey judicial orders seems to me unconscionable the first collection of 3 , 135 pages of documents was given defense lawyers on may 10 since then , mr ashcroft said , additional documents about the bombing that had not been produced to the defense were found in bureau files in several cities the documents , he said , included 103 pages of material found in the baltimore fbi office on may 15 , 327 pages of documents found in denver on may 18 , 405 pages from various offices on may 23 and 63 pages from oklahoma city produced today but in an unusual step that seemed to reflect his shaky confidence in the the bureau resulting from the records lapse , mr ashcroft said that he had obtained a legal certification from director louis j freeh of the fbi assuring mr ashcroft that the agency has completed its search and produced every relevant document in its possession in addition , mr ashcroft said that he had ordered the public release of an internal justice department report on the documents none of the documents at issue have been publicly disclosed because of an order issued by the trial judge barring release of evidentiary material nevertheless , mr ashcroft suggested that many of the documents were unrelated to whether mr mcveigh was responsible for the bombing some documents , mr ashcroft said , were letters from psychics offering to contact victims who perished in the attack another document , he said , was a letter written to the bureau by an unidentified man who offered information in exchange for money and the release of a federal prisoner other documents , he said , were clippings of newspapers and magazines , in one case material sent in by a person under psychiatric care if the imposition of mr mcveigh s death sentence is delayed past june 19 , juan raul garza , who was sentenced to death for three drugrelated killings in texas , would become the first federal prisoner in line for execution since the federal death penalty was reestablished by congress in the late 1980 s
nyack , ny full disclosure this hudson river village , 10 minutes north of bergen county , is where i grew up in the 1950 s and 60 s in my day , though nyack had its charms , fine dining was not among them it was a stolid workingman s town , home to shoe factories and meat markets and secondhand stores aside from taverns and luncheonettes , i remember only one restaurant a chinese place whose egg rolls could have served as ballast down at julius petersen s boat yard these days , nyack has the word charming written all over it solidly established as the antiquesandcrafts capital of the lower hudson valley , it seems to have shrugged off competition from the gargantuan palisades center mall , a mile up the new york state thruway its graceful streetscapes , many looking down to the river and the twinkling expanse of the tappan zee , are thickly planted with victorian houses houses that i remember as badly needing paint , but now turning up in real estate ads with milliondollar price tags and highend restaurants that 1960 s chinesefood dungeon now houses heather s open cucina , a bustling trattoria reviewed enthusiastically in this space in 1995 and now heather s is jostling for position with half a dozen restaurants with entrees in the 20to 25 range lanterna tuscan bistro , which opened a year ago in a long , narrow storefront at the heart of the shopping district , is one of the newest , but to judge from the crowds on two recent saturday evenings , its reputation has spread well beyond nyack for the most part , the reputation is deserved rossano giannini , the 41yearold chef and owner , is an actual tuscan , a native of lucca who learned his craft at the cooking school in the resort town of montecatini he came to the united states six years ago and quickly rose to executive chef at torre di pisa , the bombastic but wellreviewed tuscan restaurant in manhattan s theater district he has been around , and he knows what he s doing he seems to know his audience , too the food here is the opposite of bombastic honest , dependable , middleoftheroad tuscan cooking , well executed , generously portioned and only moderately expensive i 'd have liked to have been dazzled once in a while , but this is n't that kind of place , and its patrons seem to like it that way it says something about lanterna s approach that the best appetizers are the simplest farro , the chewy grain also called spelt , is the lead player in a robust soup bolstered by pur ed red borlotti beans , rosemary , sage and garlic it sets off no fireworks , but it s homey , well balanced and satisfying carpaccio of bresaola , thin slices of dried cured beef , need nothing more than what they get a pile of pungent arugula in a light and lemony vinaigrette with chunks of good aged parmesan cheese grilled calamari are simple and lovely , in a garlicky pesto sauce with radicchio and endive to lend color and crunch an edible basket of baked parmesan , holding a salad of mixed greens draped with too salty prosciutto , is about as theatrical as it gets here mr giannini also makes a fine vegetable napoleon , a minitower of yellow squash , zucchini , eggplant and porcini mushrooms whose grilled flavor is emphasized but not overpowered by a layer of smoked mozzarella the only appetizer that misfired was grilled portobello on polenta , which sounded foolproof but tasted weirdly sweet , like a portobello dunkin' donut main courses are pleasant and hearty but tend to be undercut by one misstep or another a special of veal chop topped with porcini , at 2495 the most expensive entree , looked impressive and tasted fine but it was awkward and messy to eat , sitting on a bed of flaccid mashed potatoes , and its cream sauce was too rich by half sea bass , on a tower of spinach and mashed potatoes , looked inviting under a mantle of tomatoes , onions , olives and capers , but the fish was bland , its skin was tough , and the overriding flavor came from the onions chicken breast lucchese , named for the chef s hometown , is essentially a stirfry of chicken , broccoli , red peppers , onions and roasted potatoes , with a balsamicvinegar sauce nothing wrong with it , but you could make it at home the same went for sea scallops with spinach , a special that was n't of the pastas , we liked both the ravioli with spinachricotta filling and the wonderfully dense and chewy wholewheat linguine , though the wildmushroomandpesto sauce could have used more zip the only outright failure among main courses was insipid risotto , studded with good , accurately cooked shrimp and badly overcooked asparagus mr giannini cheerfully concedes that he is not a pastry chef he does a good imitation of one , though , with a superb flourless chocolate torte that is crisp outside and molten inside a granny smith apple torte is fine , too \( though one night its crust was a little burned \) , and so is a selection of refreshing sorbets , especially lemon and coconut i 'd skip ricotta cheesecake and tiramis , which are merely ordinary , and sfogliatina , or puff pastry with berries , which is tough mr giannini s coowner and manager is his wife , maureen , who is also a nurse at hackensack university medical center she must have a great bedside manner , because lanterna is highly welcoming small , unpretentious and spicandspan , with simply painted plaster walls hung with family photos the servers do not know as much about the food and wine as you might like , but they 're so cheerful you ca n't help liking them the same could be said of this restaurant

when mark green took to the stage of the sheraton new york hotel last night to the beat of the jackson five to accept the democratic nomination for mayor , he spoke about his youth as a brooklyn dodger fan you remember how we always had to wait 'til next year \? mr green asked , invoking both lost pennants and failed elections of years past well , this is next year it was a night of stark contrasts as mr green , the public advocate , claimed victory over fernando ferrer , the bronx borough president there were the ebullient green campaign aides , the disc jockey spinning tunes from saturday night fever , the shouts of go green go ! when ny1 news projected that mr green had won , the people lining up for 7 cocktails but there was also somber reminders that , as former mayor david n dinkins told the crowd , it was the end of one of the most devastating months in the history of our city the music and cheering came to a screeching halt when michael a carter , the vice president of the uniformed firefighters association , which backed mr green , led a moment of silence for firefighters who died in the attack on the world trade center and , given that the odd twists and turns of the campaign left mr green , 56 , in the unusual position of being endorsed by both the nation and the new york post , it was none too surprising that there should be some strange bedfellows at his victory party there was patrick j lynch , the president of the patrolmen s benevolent association , telling the crowd this city has heard the message of unity ! an hour later mr dinkins , who has had his share of tangles with the police union , was speaking at the same lectern , praising the same candidate the gorgeous mosaic happily did not crumble , he said what we see in this room , mr green said in his victory speech , is a validation of the observation that new york city is a continuing experiment to see if all of the peoples of the world can live together in one small space and he ended with another baseball saying , from the mets this time , telling those who are unsure about new york city s future , you gotta believe at the headquarters of 1199 , the city s powerful health care workers union , mr ferrer and his supporters made note of his strong showing carried by a coalition of black and latino voters you opened a door that will never be closed again , mr ferrer said in his concession speech delivered just before 11 pm a new ship has docked in the new york harbor today filled with hopes and dreams of the beautiful array of cultures and neighborhoods that make our city the capital of the world , said mr ferrer , who promised to support mr green mr ferrer was even more forceful in an interview yesterday with wadoam , a spanish language radio station we have broken barriers and what the city of new york understands well right now is that we are voting , we are participating , we are powerful presence in the city of new york mr ferrer , 51 , closed out his campaigning a few hours before the polls closed with a stop in east harlem , pitching to both union and hispanic voters , two voting blocs that analysts deemed crucial to his victory while he sounded a conciliatory note , some of his supporters remained bitter over a lastminute negative commercial mr green broadcast this week several of mr ferrer s supporters blamed his loss in large part on the ad , that appeared repeatedly over the last several days it called mr ferrer borderline irresponsible and said his election would lead to a divided city i think it was unfortunate that mark green decided to go negative and put out distortion and lies , said adolfo carri n jr , the democratic nominee for bronx borough president i think it is still too fresh to say if i'm going to support mark green i'm still going to remember how low he went mr ferrer called the advertisement ugly and divisive and suggested a racial subtext by drawing parallels to the los angeles mayoral race last spring in which a white candidate broadcast a negative commercial linking his hispanic opponent to a drug dealer in the final days of the race in a poignant note in his concession speech last night , mr ferrer highlighted what he believed was the legacy of his strong showing tonight we still are one step closer to breaking down yet another barrier and sending our children a powerful message , mr ferrer said and that powerful message is new york city our city will give you all the tools you need to realize your greatest dreams and satisfy our highest hopes to serve the people of new york photo mark green greeted wellwishers at the sheraton new york in manhattan last night after his victory speech \( james estrin the new york times \)

tokyo , feb 26 the mitsubishi motors corporation outlined a sweeping restructuring plan today that in some ways mirrors that of daimlerchrysler , which owns about onethird of its stock mitsubishi , which has been reeling from sagging car sales as well as recalls and scandals , said it would eliminate 9 , 500 jobs , or 14 percent of its global work force close one of its four car plants in japan and find ways to reduce spending on parts and supplies by 15 percent the company s goal is to achieve a gross profit margin of 45 percent by 2003 the challenge we face now is something we have never experienced before , takashi sonobe , mitsubishi s chief executive , said at a news conference here we realized that a small reform will not be sufficient for us the latest series of troubles began in august for the company , when it acknowledged that it had systematically covered up defects that may have led to largescale recalls of cars car sales in its home japanese market dropped in subsequent months by as much as 30 percent , compared with the similar periods a year before even in january , five months after the initial bad news , sales were still running almost 10 percent below those in january 2000 then , on feb 15 , the company said it was recalling about one million mitsubishi galants and eclipses , dodge avengers and sebrings and other vehicles it builds for the united states market , as well as 400 , 000 sold in japan , in connection with faulty ball joints and air bags in the process , the company s brand image was hurt given the scale of mitsubishi s troubles , some analysts were not impressed by the measures announced today the new plan contains no surprises , said seiji sugiura of nomura securities here i would have thought that they would close one or two more plants analysts also questioned whether the ambitious goal for reducing the cost of materials was realistic unlike many of its competitors , mitsubishi motors counts as major suppliers sister companies like mitsubishi heavy industries and mitsubishi electric , which wield powerful influence over the automaker and have substantial crossholdings in its stock mitsubishi heavy industries owns 169 percent of mitsubishi motors , the largest stake after daimlerchrysler s it is far from clear how much scope mitsubishi motors has to squeeze such suppliers on price still , rolf eckrodt , the executive dispatched by daimlerchrysler to be mitsubishi motors' chief operating officer , exuded confidence and resolve at today s news conference this turnaround plan will create a new mmc , he said , using the company s initials complacency , he said , was a big part of past problems too often , the company has reacted to the market , mr eckrodt said this resulted in too many models and platforms , leading to excessive costs while the number of models will probably not be sharply cut , he said , they will be built on 6 platforms instead of the 12 used now , and some will be shared with chrysler mitsubishi s cost structure has suffered from having much lower production for each platform than competitors none of the eight passenger car models that mitsubishi offers in japan sell more than 1 , 000 a month , while toyota and honda sell five times that number of their popular models in this country two lowvolume luxury models for the japanese market , the dignity and the proudia , will be eliminated the company said they had been sold mostly to mitsubishi group executives photo takashi sonobe , mitsubishi motors' chief executive , left , and the chief operating officer , rolf eckrodt , discussing cutbacks in tokyo yesterday \( reuters \)
there s a reallife minidrama unfolding this summer in the waiting room of the old greenwich train station and it s as full of intrigue and passion as any of the beachreading novels commuters devour as they ride the trains every day the story line \? a feisty old man fights city hall for what he sees as his godgiven right to make a nice buck for his retirement but local and state officials , with the law on their side , stand firm against him a wellmeaning hero in the form of an exnew york yankee shortstop tries to save the day , but ends up holding his white \( and blue \) hat in his hand while there s no ending yet to this saga , all the participating characters agree that 76yearold vito roberto is caught in the middle of a real pageturner for the last 13 years , mr roberto , a former insurance underwriter for new york life , had arrived at the station at 3 30 am every weekday to put the coffee on and lay out the day s newspapers for the hundreds of residents who take the train to work he bought the concession stand in 1988 from his late brother , anthony , who retired after running it for 18 years now mr roberto said it s time for him to relax , only it s been anything but restful since he notified greenwich officials about two months ago that he was going to sell the concession and move to pennsylvania with his wife , estelle being a nice guy , i called the town to tell them i was going to sell and they told me i could n't because i did n't have a lease , mr roberto said i think they are selling me down the river in reality , however , mr roberto and his brother were the recipients of a sweetheart deal that allowed them to pay 70 a month rent to the town of greenwich , much less than fairmarket rates , according to carl rosa , supervisor of rail property management for the state department of transportation i think this guy is barking up the wrong tree he has the right to sell his equipment , but he does n't have the right to sell the space that s because operators of 10 other concession stands in stations along the metronorth railroad route from new haven to greenwich lease space either from the state transportation department or from the municipality in which the station is located , mr rosa said , and none of them can sell their concessions unless their lease says so i know i ca n't sell my business without the town s approval , said mike dibenedetto , who has operated the coffee central concession stand and restaurant in the stratford train station for the past six years he said the town put the concession lease out to bid every three years and he was the only one to bid for it the last time around i do n't take any money out of it , he said it pays for the person that comes in every day and for my company truck and my gym membership wynne barrett , president of commuter foods group in shelton , which owns and operates the dunkin' donuts concessions at the fairfield and stamford train stations , experienced the problem of selling his business firsthand mr barrett said he used to own a dunkin' donuts stand that was in a building attached to the main greenwich station , but lost his lease from the private landlord when he tried to sell the business the lease said if we entered into a sales agreement with someone , then the landlord had the right to make our lease null and void , he said it was ridiculous mr barrett said because of that experience , his leases with fairfield and , in the case of his stamford concession , the state , are written so that the landlord and tenant come away with mutual satisfaction upon the transfer of the business he said the leases allow him to sell the franchise if he can demonstrate that the new owners can operate with the same standards that commuters have come to know the dot purchased all the station buildings in 1985 from the former penn central transportation company mr roberto said he had a 1972 rental agreement that penn central made with his brother , an agreement mr roberto inherited when he bought the business in 1988 he said he also made an agreement with the town in 1989 mr roberto told the greenwich time , the local newspaper , that he paid his brother 25 , 000 in a series of payments for the concession mr roberto , who refused to confirm the amount , said neither he nor his brother contacted the state or town about the transfer mr roberto said that should give him the right to sell his business i took it for granted that i had what i needed to sell , mr roberto said but after mr rosa was notified that mr roberto intended to sell the concession stand , he canceled the 1972 lease agreement , but the state and town have agreed to allow mr roberto to run the stand through the summer until the town puts the concession out to bid , said james lavin of the greenwich department of public works , which handles the lease agreement it s just the principle of the thing now i was man of the year in old greenwich in 1997 and now they want me to get out , like an old shoe , said mr roberto about the award from the old greenwich association i did n't expect this to happen mr roberto has asked customers to sign a petition demanding the town to allow him to sell his business , and more than 300 people have more than a few customers have called mr lavin to complain about the situation as well he s done a great job over the years , mr lavin said but the lease is pretty clear mr roberto s white knight in this tale is phil f linz , a former new york yankees shortstop who lives in stamford and commutes from the old greenwich station to his job as assistant vice president at fidelity national title in new york city mr linz , who said he buys a cup of coffee and a new york newspaper most days , has taken up mr roberto s cause because he thought what was happening was unfair the concession stand , mr linz said , is a nice , beautiful place where he was always open and played classical music mr linz put mr roberto in touch with a lawyer and made some calls for him , including one to the office of the fourth district congressman , christopher shays i felt if there was some way of putting some pressure on people , it would help him , mr linz said he said mr shays' office declined to get involved because it was clear that the dot had specific leasing regulations officials from mr shays' office did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment for now , mr roberto has hired 19yearold greg maher of milford to fill in for him each morning now that he s living in pennsylvania \( mr maher is the son of anne maher , the metronorth employee who sells tickets at the station \) mr lavin said the town had already received several inquiries from people who want to take over the concession our primary concern is that commuters get service , mr lavin said photo vito roberto , center , has been told he ca n't sell his newsstand at the old greenwich railroad station with him is greg maher ,

the terrorists who attacked the world trade center may have been trying to crush american capitalism and its masters of the universe on wall street but the economic impact of the attack is felling a very different group of people cooks , cabdrivers , sales clerks and seamstresses workers in traditionally lowwage industries , like restaurants and hotels , retailing and transportation , have been hit hard in the fallout from sept 11 , according to a new analysis from the new york state department of labor and a report released yesterday by the laborbacked fiscal policy institute forecasts that almost 80 , 000 people will have lost their jobs by the end of the year and that 60 percent of these positions paid an average of 23 , 000 a year that is far below the citywide average salary of roughly 58 , 000 the spillover effects hit the retail and service industries very hard in new york city , said james parrott , the chief economist for the institute and those tend to be lowerwage jobs the sudden decline in these jobs marks a sea change in the economy since sept 11 earlier this year , while the job market was softening , the losses were concentrated among whitecollar workers like dotcom programmers , stockbrokers and advertising executives now , they are concentrated among people like kim daily a single mother of two , ms daily worked her way up from a 6anhourjob picking up roomservice trays to a 15anhour job stocking minibars at the world trade center marriott when the hotel was destroyed on sept 11 , so was her job and she has not been able to find another one it is not for lack of trying she stood in line for four hours outside a citysponsored job fair but never even made it in the door she has been talking to her union , but the only position available so far was so tipdependent that she worried it would not cover her 700amonth rent a job bank had only a few hotel positions , and none paid anywhere near the 25 , 000 she earned at the marriott last year i do n't want to go for less money , she said the changed job market raises huge challenges for the city at a time when hundreds of thousands of families have moved off the welfare rolls the most successful of these former welfare recipients , as well as many newcomers to this country , found jobs at hotels and restaurants , as cleaners at office buildings and as messengers in lower manhattan now that the economy has exploded along with the world trade center , their prospects of staying in the world of work have diminished , said david r jones , president of the community service society of new york , which has been helping workers who lost their jobs after sept 11 his group is recommending a governmentfinanced jobs program , he said otherwise , we 'll have people sitting on stoops , getting a little check and doing nothing , he said how many new yorkers are unemployed is unclear in a government survey taken in the week of sept 11 , in which anyone who worked at all was counted as employed , 223 , 100 people in new york city were looking for work \( after adjustments for seasonal factors \) that was an increase of almost 20 , 000 people in a month the unemployment rate hit 63 percent the october survey will not be released for several weeks , but its results are included in federal figures , released friday , that showed a surge in national unemployment , which rose by half a percentage point , to 54 percent unemployment insurance covers only about a third of unemployed workers , but the number of people applying for benefits in the city has soared in the last month , an average of 12 , 745 people a week has applied a year ago , that figure was 5 , 616 a special program , disaster unemployment assistance , is supposed to help those who are not eligible for unemployment insurance \( usually because they worked part time or were selfemployed \) but only 2 , 350 people are now getting those benefits almost 25 , 000 people told the new york state department of labor that they lost their jobs because of the trade center disaster an analysis of the first 22 , 000 of those claims found that about 16 percent worked at bars and restaurants , 14 percent worked at hotels and 5 percent worked in air transportation only 4 percent worked at wall street brokerage firms \( many of which simply relocated workers to midtown or new jersey \) the largest group of people 21 percent worked in a category called business services many of them were temporary workers , like lisa mendes , a single mother who lost her job as an accounting clerk on sept 12 in years past , when one temporary job ended , she could pick and choose among the offerings at the agencies now , there s just nothing there , she said it s scary ms mendes is typical of the unemployed in another way she lives in brooklyn the labor department analysis found that almost 26 percent of those who said they were jobless because of the twin towers collapse live in brooklyn 24 percent live in queens , and 12 percent live in the bronx just 18 percent live in manhattan
a telescope in eastern australia has seen what appear to be the faint imprint of waves , much like sound waves , that may have rippled through the gases of the young universe scientists have long theorized such waves were the seeds for all structures glittering in the heavens today the imprints were revealed within the clumps and filamentary patterns formed by tens of thousands of galaxies that the telescope observed in earth s cosmic neighborhood the findings , which were presented last week at a scientific conference but are being made available to scientists around the world today , have emerged from the largest and most detailed mapping of galaxies ever made using the 12footwide angloaustralian telescope near coonabarabran , australia , the project involving scientists at a dozen institutions in australia , britain and the united states has mapped the positions of nearly 170 , 000 galaxies the map not only revealed great clusters and filigree patterns made by the galaxies , which earlier surveys had seen , but also let project scientists analyze the data for more subtle features when they did so , the scientists found that hidden in the irregular clumps and filaments were imprints of waves of particular sizes , or wavelengths , that cosmologists believe were generated in the explosive birth of the universe the waves are thought to have seeded the primordial gases with slight irregularities that later grew into galaxies and clusters if confirmed , the observations would be scientists' first direct glimpse of what amounts to a blueprint for the structure of the universe we 're seeing the big picture cosmology in the early universe and in the local universe coming together for the first time , said dr karl glazebrook , an astronomer at johns hopkins university and a member of the project , called the 2degree field galaxy red shift survey , or 2df dr max tegmark , a cosmologist at the university of pennsylvania , said that emissions from the early universe , called the cosmic microwave background , had provided strong evidence that the waves existed when the universe was just a few hundred thousand years old but the span of billions of years of cosmic history since then has erased all but slight traces of the original waves , or wiggles , in structures today , dr tegmark said none of the earlier surveys had the sheer brute size that was needed to see them , dr tegmark said not only are the wiggles there , but they 're the right size the team s paper on the finding , whose lead author is dr will percival of the university of edinburgh , is being posted today on an electronic archive at los alamos national laboratory \( arxivorg abs astroph 0105252 \) where scientists often place their new findings dr john peacock , a professor of physics and astronomy at the university of edinburgh , said that even larger surveys would be needed to ensure that the difficult measurements were correct he presented the results last week at a conference at the fermi national accelerator laboratory near chicago one of the organizers of that conference , dr joshua frieman of fermilab and the university of chicago , said that a much larger survey now in progress , called the sloan digital sky survey and involving the united states , germany and japan , would among other things determine about a million galaxy positions over the next several years he said that the initial finding by the 2df team suggested that the sloan survey would be able to use the wiggles as a sort of probe of the overall contents of the universe the 2df finding holds out the promise that when we have an even larger sample , we 'll be able to use this as another cosmological tool , said dr frieman , who like dr tegmark is a member of the sloan team strange as it sounds , the problem of how structures like galaxies and galaxy clusters could have formed has persistently bedeviled scientists working out the theory of the big bang , the great explosion in which the universe apparently began early measurements of the cosmic background radiation , emitted from the hot gases of the young universe , seemed to show that it was nearly smooth and featureless , with no irregularities that could have spawned lumpy structures like galaxies but in 1992 , a nasa satellite called the cosmic background explorer satellite , or cobe , made highly sensitive measurements of the radiation and saw minute temperature variations suggesting the existence of socalled acoustic waves sloshing in the early universe subsequently , measurements of the radiation have turned up a series of discrete tones , or wavelengths , that theorists have predicted should have been generated in the explosion but while those waves are thought to have been the seeds that allowed galaxies and other structures to coalesce , no direct evidence for the waves had until this point turned up in the confusion of the presentday heavens the 2df survey tried to find them by rigging the angloaustralian telescope with robotics , electronic light detectors and computers that enabled it to determine the distances and positions on the sky of hundreds of galaxies at a time the question is , are the imprints that we see in the microwave background still apparent in the galaxy distribution that we see today \? said dr matthew colless , a 2df member at the australian national university the answer turned out to be yes , somewhat to our surprise the size of the imprints seen by the survey range from about 300 million to 15 billion lightyears , dr peacock said for reference , the milky way s nearest neighbor , the andromeda galaxy , is about 25 million lightyears away one of the largest clusters of galaxies in the milky way s neighborhood , called the coma cluster , is about 500 million lightyears away the intensity of the features seen by the survey give an accounting of all the matter in the universe the results confirm studies that have concluded that a vast majority of the cosmos is not ordinary matter but dark matter , whose gravity is felt but which has not been detected directly but dr carlos frenk , an astrophysicist at the university of durham in britain and a member of the 2df team , said the importance of the findings were to be found in the grand perspective they provided for the first time , we have a convincing connection between the initial state as probed by the microwave background and the present universe as probed by the galaxies , dr frenk said the microwave background tells us about the seeds , and what we are doing now is reaping the fruit that s been growing through 10 billion years of cosmic evolution
washington , oct 22 rockers , actors and comedians got big rounds of applause at the concert for new york city on saturday night , a sixhour telethon from madison square garden but the real star treatment shouting , whistling , stamping , standing ovations greeted firefighters , police officers , rescue workers and mayor rudolph w giuliani the front seats , 6 , 000 of them , had been donated to those uniformed workers and their survivors , many of whom had brought photographs to hold up for vh1 s cameras the rest of the arena joined in their cheers , gratefully and wholeheartedly performers , for the moment , had suspended any conflicts with authority figures they flaunted fire and policedepartment shirts , and they happily wore the hats passed up to the stage from the audience simply by doing their jobs , the city workers have taken on clear symbolic roles they are brothers , heroes , mourners and pillars of public strength but the fantasy icons of pop culture have no such certainty they are still groping to decide what they 're supposed to do with their celebrity and their tunes the concert for new york city was part of a weekend of major benefit concerts , including one here today , for victims of the sept 11 attacks promoters of the madison square garden concert told the associated press that ticket sales had raised 14 million and that millions more were expected in pledges from those who saw it on television after vh1 s largely middleaged lineup on saturday night , which featured english rockers making proamerican statements , younger pop hitmakers along with established acts like aerosmith and james brown performed today at rfk stadium here and as that concert ended , country stars were to sing at the gaylord entertainment center in nashville for relief efforts song for song , none of the concerts were as consistently moving as the national telecast america a tribute to heroes on sept 21 , for which each performer selected just one trenchant song but that program took place without audiences , in studios that could just as well have been fortified bunkers the weekend s concerts were public events , with celebrities and audiences gathering to defy fear of terror there was comedy at madison square garden , along with appearances by political figures and short films by new york directors including martin scorsese , spike lee and woody allen between performers , there were chants of usa and , equally strong , let s go , yankees there were some strange juxtapositions , as when bill clinton declared that the difference between america and its adversaries was that our common humanity is more important than all of our interesting differences he then went on to introduce james taylor while the concert for new york city spoke directly to those who had lost coworkers , the tone of the concert here was more thoroughly celebratory in midafternoon , james brown jumped immediately from sex machine to god bless america , as if both affirmed the same spirit at every event , performers were testing their new responsibilities should they be rallying the audience , or helping it party and blow off steam \? should they be proffering consolation , stoking anger , preaching idealism \? or should they ignore the whole situation , insist that life goes on and remind people of their everyday routines and romances \? in the meantime , would it hurt to promote their latest projects \? all those impulses have emerged as pop has enlisted for charity and less quantifiable emotional relief michael jackson was the headliner today at rfk stadium for an eighthour concert that will be edited into a twohour abctv special to be broadcast on nov 1 mr jackson has an album , invincible , coming out on oct 30 , and the exposure wo n't hurt yet he has undeniable charitable reflexes that date back to we are the world in 1985 , and he has announced plans to release a new benefit single , what more can i give \? sir paul mccartney , who initiated and headlined the concert for new york city , also has a new album on the way , and he is donating the proceeds from its first single , from a lover to a friend , to relief efforts he also introduced a more militant response to the attacks freedom , a song written after sept 11 that declares , over chords reminiscent of stand by me , that i will fight for the right to live in freedom context can change everything in pop on thursday night at the count basie theater in red bank , nj , bruce springsteen was headlining the first of two benefit concerts that raised 1 million for the alliance of neighbors of monmouth county , which is assisting families of local world trade center victims mr springsteen sang my city of ruins , a song written before sept 11 , which envisions a destroyed city and calls for its resurrection he had also performed it on the sept 21 telecast the song , he said , had been written about asbury park , nj but songs are funny , he continued they go out to who needs them when they need them across the pop spectrum , songs about lost love have begun to double as songs about a more general sense of loss , while songs of adolescent defiance can suggest national resolve when sir paul sang yesterday , its first verse all my troubles seemed so far away now i need a place to hide away could apply to america s new sense of vulnerability billy joel sang miami 2017 , a postapocalyptic fantasy with lines like i watched the mighty skyline fall when he wrote it , mr joel said i thought it was going to be a sciencefiction song i thought it would never really happen but unlike the end of that song , we ai n't goin' anywhere mick jagger , who brought his partner keith richards with him unannounced , found two perfectly apt rolling stones songs salt of the earth , praising the working classes and stripped of irony , and miss you , a new york song that \( with a bit left out \) became a thumping memorial james taylor s elegy fire and rain had an eerie moment as he sang sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground when the who blasted wo n't get fooled again with images of the twin towers behind them , the lyrics' cynicism about politics could simply be ignored as the title became a vow and when the backstreet boys , opening united we stand in washington , sang some people say we do n't belong they try to put us under , it was no longer a song about the persistence of boyband pop the events of sept 11 had inadvertent pop beneficiaries enya s album a day without rain , released in november , rose into the top 10 when radio stations rediscovered only time , a hymnlike song about uncertainty whitney houston s version of the starspangled banner , sung during the gulf war , is a bestselling single again as a benefit for police and firefighters' disaster relief john mellencamp had just released a new single , peaceful world , before the attack , and it s now a hit its wishfully upbeat chorus , everything is cool as can be in a peaceful world and its more troubled verses looks like everything is rollin' our way till you gotta look the devil in the eye rang true at the garden musicians like sir paul and mr jackson , as well as countless lesserknowns , are now reacting directly to the events of sept 11 but in the meantime , pop listeners , radio stations and musicians will all be retrofitting songs to say what none of their creators could have predicted photos among the performers at the concert for new york city at madison square garden top , sir paul mccartney left , john mellencamp and right , eric clapton , at left , with the blues guitarist and singer buddy guy \( photographs by nancy siesel the new york times \) \( pg e1 \) the backstreet boys opened a concert at rfk stadium in washington yesterday , part of three big benefits for victims of sept 11 s attacks \( agence francepresse \) \( pg e5 \)
primetime blues african americans on network television by donald bogle illustrated 520 pp new york farrar , straus giroux 30 when abc announced its plans to broadcast a multicultural version of the

caryn james observed , the matteroffact racial casting works so smoothly that it becomes one of the show s happiest effects there is no cause to wonder why one stepsister is black and one white the

show that was denounced by the naacp for presenting blacks as inferior , lazy , dumb and dishonest derived from an even more popular radio program , it was shown in syndication until 1966 even then , enjoying what he was watching on television , bogle experienced a double sense of unreality while television in those days \( even more than these \) rarely reflected anyone s world accurately , he felt actively excluded in primetime blues african americans on network television , bogle whose earlier books have examined various aspects of race in america describes this early , uneasy sensation before i could consciously express it , i think i was aware , as was most of black america , of a fundamental racism or a misinterpretation of africanamerican life that underlay much of what appeared on the tube , he writes rather than turn the television off , however , he became mesmerized by the images that influenced him , positively and negatively in this book , he examines the evolution of black characterizations throughout television s relatively brief history , in the context of their time , explaining his gratification at seeing africanamerican performers doing good work and his embarrassment at witnessing some of the work they were given to do in the beginning there was a parade of maids and sidekicks , starting with beulah , a radio character from a show of the same name , transferred to television in 1950 beulah was a relentlessly goodhearted servant , whose job was to solve the problems of her white employers and their cute son on the radio she was played by three different people , two of them white men the third was hattie mcdaniel , best known as scarlett s nanny in the movie of gone with the wind for television , abc cast ethel waters in the role , which bogle describes as a classic stereotype the large , often dowdy , usually darker , all knowing , allseeing , allhearing , allunderstanding mammy figure , whose life is built about nurturing and nourishing those in the big house that s the embarrassment the gratification , bogle writes , came from the performance gracing this nothing character with her own profound warmth and tenderness as well as a modicum of conviction , waters transformed beulah into a knowing earth mother with this mixture of appreciation and apprehension , bogle examines africanamericans on television decade by decade , show by show , sometimes episode by episode he not only measures the shows aesthetically and sociologically , he aims to explain the influence of ratings and hollywood politics on how blacks have been represented he also provides brief biographies of many of the dozens of actors whose work he describes that s a lot of detail , and the book sometimes is dragged down by the voluminosity of its own authority and by bogle s lapses into academic jargon but even if you find his fondness for words like contextualize annoying , and his straightahead method numbing at times , his thoroughness and insightful analyses are admirable this is a valuable chronicle
ever tried restaurant lulu s mustard \? how about chocolate chix cookies or crazy richard s peanut butter \? they are popular products that have won awards for taste but they are not in most supermarkets because their manufacturers cannot find food brokers to represent them food brokers are responsible for the majority of products , edible or not , that end up on grocers' shelves they push the products , negotiate purchasing agreements and ensure that everything is in stock , properly displayed and accurately priced you 're dead in the water without a broker , said burt p flickinger iii of reach marketing , a consulting firm in westport , conn the business is consolidating rapidly , though , a trend that may be reducing consumer choice by killing off both new and familiar brands that consolidation , much of it since 1997 , and the failure in june of one of the largest companies , marketing specialists inc of dallas , has narrowed the field of national companies to three all are private advantage sales and marketing of irvine , calif acosta , based in jacksonville , fla and crossmark of plano , tex with so few brokers to choose from , a manufacturer is left in a bind , because it is hard to find an agent who does not already represent a competing brand we ca n't take on direct competitors because of potential conflicts of interest , said sonny king , chairman and chief executive of advantage john m mcmillin , a food industry analyst at prudential securities , added , that means big trouble if you 're the no 4andbeyond brand examples might include libby s canned vegetables , from seneca foods , or la martinique salad dressing , from reily foods , which lead in certain markets but lag behind nationwide these manufacturers did not respond to requests for interviews the consolidation also ties the hands of manufacturers of the three topselling brands in any category because they have nowhere else to go it s not like you can drop your broker if you do n't like the service , said a manufacturer of a topselling snack food , who did not want his name used for fear of antagonizing his broker the other two are working for your competitor of course , food makers could have their own direct sales forces , but that is considerably more expensive most manufacturers use brokers to sell some or all product lines , paying them 2 to 5 percent of each product s wholesale price direct selling , by contrast , may cost as much as 10 percent the situation is worse for small manufacturers that want to sell products nationally the big brokers wo n't give the little guy the time of day , said r craig sonkson , owner of the krema peanut butter company in dublin , ohio , maker of the krema and crazy richard s brands mr sonkson ran into a brick wall with a national expansion effort three years ago without a national broker to negotiate with grocers , he says he has not been able to sell his products beyond cities in the midwest and midatlantic states , where he makes his own sales calls or uses the remaining independent , singlemarket brokers even if small producers like krema can demonstrate that their products would not compete directly with any of the large brokers' existing brands , they do not have the sales numbers to make them attractive clients you have to be able to guarantee huge sales and nationwide appeal for them to take you , said leslie wilson , director of marketing for restaurant lulu gourmet products in san francisco the company s line of 44 condiments , developed in 1997 , is available in many epicurean shops and in a handful of small grocery chains because ms wilson has found a few specialty food brokers scattered across the country one former regional broker , who sold his company to a national broker , then went to work for it , said things have really changed it does n't matter how good the product may be we can only take on manufacturers that have a proven national sales record butch smith , chief executive of crossmark , said his company takes on smaller manufacturers if they pay a retainer fee but cheryl surana , president of chocolate chix , a fouryearold cookie maker in dallas , said such charges were prohibitively expensive for a startup it s real discouraging when you 've got something people are asking for but you ca n't get it into the major stores , she said as yet , her products are available at only a few grocery stores in texas , through gift catalogs and at a booth in the dallas world trade center as recently as five years ago , there were hundreds of regional brokers large manufacturers created national broker networks by choosing outfits they thought would best serve them in particular markets it was not unusual for a single manufacturer to use up to 75 different broker companies to sell products nationwide the regional brokers were really in tune with local tastes and preferences , mr flickinger , the consultant , said they were willing to use their market knowledge to incubate and nurse promising new products , he added

the women do n't even know what some of these occupations are the first time lucy goes job hunting , the only paid employment she can find is babysitting seasons later , when she helps an italian friend by filling in for him making pizzas , she does 200 worth of damage to the restaurant \( in 1956 dollars \) her artistic skills are n't much more impressive she s comically bad in ballet class and a failure as a sculptor , and when she writes a novel , a publisher buys it only to include portions in another book as an example of bad writing and her career in television commercials \? one word vitameatavegamin i'm not saying it is n't funny i'm just saying the woman was n't much of a role model and although slapstick comedians usually do n't have to worry about setting noble examples , lucy ricardo a woman at the center of a vastly popular show in a vastly influential new medium was in that position by default of course the career lucy ricardo really wanted was one in show business that was part of the concept from the beginning in his modestly titled book laughs , luck and lucy how i came to create the most popular sitcom of all time , jess oppenheimer , the show s producer and longtime head writer , reprinted the original series summary that he filed with the screen writers' guild in march 1951 it included these two sentences but ricky , who was raised in show business , sees none of its glamour , only its deficiencies , and yearns to be an ordinary citizen , keeping regular hours and living a normal life as show business is the only way he knows to make a living , and he makes a very good one , the closest he can get to this dream is having a wife who s out of show business and devotes herself to keeping as nearly a normal life as possible for him no kidding i always thought it was because she was embarrassingly untalented
washington , june 1 buried deep in the mammoth tax bill congress approved last week is this sentence paragraph \( 4 \) of section 1114 \( c \) of the tax reform act of 1986 is hereby repealed the explanation the congressional joint tax committee gave to senators and representatives before they cast their votes last saturday said only that the repeal applies to an employer incorporated on dec 15 , 1924 , that meets certain specific requirements the paragraph being repealed is equally obscure it is called a special rule for determining highly compensated employees and also identifies the company only by date of incorporation it sounds fishy in the old days when representatives dan rostenkowski and wilbur d mills ran the house ways and means committee and senators russell b long and bob packwood were chairmen of the senate finance committee , congress often enacted hidden tax breaks like this for specific , unidentified companies but this has not been done for years so why now \? what is the company \? what kind of tax advantage did it get in 1986 \? and why is it being repealed \? congressional staff assistants and several tax lawyers who have scrutinized the legislation said they believed this was the only provision in this tax bill that affected just one taxpayer and it appears that what congress did both in 1986 and this year can be justified the only unanswered questions are who pulled the strings and why congress felt obliged to hide what it was doing here is the story the company is j c penney , the department store chain in 1986 , penney was one of the few retailers that offered its employers a 401 \( k \) plan these are the plans that allow workers to have money withheld from their paychecks and deposited in taxdeferred retirement accounts like many other companies , penney matched part of what the employees contributed to keep top executives from giving themselves benefits not available to the rank and file , congress had limited how much highly compensated employees could deposit in their retirement accounts and the percentage that could be matched penney s problem in 1986 was that a much higher proportion of its workers were lowpaid than in most other companies that offered 401 \( k \) plans more than half of penney employees earned less than 25 , 000 if the complex formula that applied to other companies had been applied to penney , almost none of its workers would have been eligible for the program so a special rule was written for penney s 401 \( k \) plan then in 1996 , congress changed the formula for who was considered highly compensated but did not change the special rule for penney the consequence was that almost all penney employees were allowed to contribute only 8 percent of their wages to their retirement accounts , instead of 16 percent , as ordinary employees in other companies were allowed to contribute so in 1998 , penney asked for repeal of its special rule so it could follow the same 401 \( k \) rules as everyone else the repeal was written into several tax bills , but until this year , the bills either died or were vetoed for reasons having nothing to do with the penney rule no one at penney can remember who was responsible for getting the special rule enacted in 1986 or getting the repeal written i 've asked around everywhere , and everyone has died or retired and moved on , stephanie m brown , a spokeswoman for penney , said david h koshgarian , the administrative assistant of representative benjamin l cardin , democrat of maryland , one of the chief sponsors of the pension and retirement provisions of the tax bill , said he could not remember either but mr koshgarian said he did remember that mr cardin s reaction was , any time anybody says they want to play by the regular rules , that s ok by us a senate staff assistant said she vaguely recalled two penney lobbyists coming to see her and other staff members , probably in 1998 , and making a reasonable pitch , but she cannot remember who they were they said , we did this thing in 1986 , and it turned out to be dumb and we 're sorry , the staff assistant said but why not just name the company in the legislation \? that s up to the legislative counsel , she said , referring to the congressional staff that drafts legislation they have this goofy way of writing
barely eight years have passed since the campaign first started but the dairy industry s ads , with the got milk \? tagline , have made a lasting mark on the american consumer landscape a recent study by the california milk processor board indicates that the ads have been instrumental in stemming an erosion in domestic milk sales that seemed pretty much unstoppable back in the early 1990 s , when got milk \? was first devised by goodby , silverstein partners in san francisco , a unit of the omnicom group entitled milk beyond the glass , the california milk consumption tracking study , just released , is the 13th in a series conducted by the california board since 1993 the got milk \? ads began running in california in october of that year , and were later used throughout the united states by two national groups dairy management inc , representing dairy farmers , and the milk processor education program , which comprises commercial milk processors like the california board , these organizations are financed largely by contributions from industry members today , the national organizations use the got milk \? slogan as part of their milk mustache campaign , for which bozell new york , part of the interpublic group , is the creative agency \( though the mustache is seen in national advertising , california does not use it in its own got milk \? ads , which continue to be the work of goodby , silverstein \) total marketing budgets are about 24 million in california and approximately 180 million nationwide , according to jeff manning , the executive director of the california board though it covers only california , the 600participant study conducted by telephone during january and february is equally valid as a barometer of trends nationwide , according to mr manning , who noted that california is a highly diverse state with about 11 percent of the nation s population most significantly , the study found that milk consumption in california has stabilized , with 72 percent of those surveyed saying they had used milk within the last 24 hours , and that the average amount they drank during that period was 171 ounces those numbers are almost the same as the precampaign levels in 1993 , and they dovetail with figures indicating that roughly 740 million gallons of milk have been sold each year in california since 1993 before 1993 , we were going down about 3 percent a year , mr manning said of milk sales in california if that trend had continued , he said , we would be down today by about 122 million gallons the data are consistent with national numbers between 1995 , soon after the got milk \? campaign went national , and 2000 , annual milk consumption rose only marginally , to 648 billion gallons from 635 billion , according to figures prepared by beverage marketing , a research and consulting concern based in new york but again , a slight increase is preferable to the previous annual declines for the milk industry the survey showed other bright spots for milk producers for example , the frequency of milk consumption increased from 39 times a day last year to 43 times this year among hispanic consumers , the rise was even more dramatic , from 4 times a day last year to 52 times a day this year do the got milk \? ads deserve the credit \? mr manning said that he believes so , although it is difficult to separate the effect of local ads from the national ads with the tagline and the equally famous milk mustache nevertheless , figures in the study would seem to bear him out approximately 40 percent of those surveyed said they recalled the got milk slogan , compared with only 22 percent who recalled seeing ads featuring celebrities with milk mustaches none of this means that got milk \? has n't got problems though the ad campaigns have created something akin to a brand identity for the product itself , there are really no national brands in the dairy industry because of regulations that have always kept milk sales a fairly local affair milk use by teenagers is decreasing dramatically , and the use of milk at breakfast is also dropping , as americans change the way they eat there has been a fundamental shift in breakfast habits , said mr manning people are rushing out on the morning , buying breakfast bars , going to starbucks only 69 percent of survey respondents now report using milk with dry cereal , compared with 78 percent of those questioned in 1993 and the drop is fairly steep among all age groups as for teenagers , they are the target of every beverage marketer in the world , noted mr manning , who cited sodas , iced teas , bottled waters and even alcoholic beverages as competition , even though teenagers are not supposed to be drinking alcohol in addition to advertising , he said , new innovations are needed if milk is to reverse its slide with this group and raise its appeal in others that may already be happening , according to michael bellas , the chairman of beverage marketing , who said that better singleserve packaging was now reaching the market and that the flavor mix of milk products beyond mere plain and chocolate was starting to improve there is also a likelihood that strong national brands may finally begin to emerge , he said , citing as proof the proposed merger of suiza foods , the nation s largest dairy processor , and dean foods , which is no 2 in the industry they still have a tough go , said mr bellas but we believe that the worst is over for milk photo the campaign has created a brand identity for milk , despite there being no national brands in the dairy industry
burlington , vt , may 24 august jaccaci came here to cheer senator james m jeffords s break with the republican party dressed as a vermont rebel from an earlier era , one of ethan allen s green mountain boys we do our own thing , absolutely , mr jaccaci said of vermont his hometown , thetford , he noted was the first political body in the united states to impeach richard nixon , in our town meeting mr jeffords explicitly drew on the state s maverick tradition today in his announcement , noting that vermont had been the first state to ban slavery in its constitution that it had elected to congress a man who had been jailed for sedition that a vermont senator had spoken out against the mccarthy hearings his decision , he said , comes as no surprise to vermonters because independence is the vermont way though , he said at one point , compared to past nonconformist vermont decisions , today s chapter is of much smaller consequence others would disagree politicians attending the announcement said they were well aware that for this morning , little vermont , with its population of 600 , 000 , was shaking the world and historians said today that though vermonters in congress had cast some pivotal votes , none had ever shifted the balance of power this way this is the biggest political event in vermont since calvin coolidge s father swore him in , howard coffin , a vermont historian , told the associated press the word historic could be heard quite a bit here today , and among the scores of supporters and a few opponents who gathered here for the announcement some said they were drawn by the immensity of the news issuing from this small city on lake champlain it is so exciting to see senator jeffords stand up for his convictions , said judy breitmeyer , a psychotherapist here i'm so proud to be a vermonter today we have a long history of being independent thinkers and standing up for what we believe in , beginning with ethan allen and the green mountain boys it s been there a long , long time but mr jeffords s opponents also drew on revolutionary heritage one , dressed as benedict arnold , rang his bell among the throngs outside the radisson hotel where mr jeffords made his announcement and declared that the senator was a traitor another , stephen coss , the manager of a plumbing and heating supply company , complained that he had given money to mr jeffords as a republican , and then he took the money and ran he did n't do what he said he would do , mr coss said , and as a vermonter , i expect him to do that mr jeffords said in an interview today that he had expected an overwhelming response , but that he had expected it to come from opponents in fact , the vast majority of the couple of hundred vermonters who showed up at the announcement supported him they chanted , thank you , jim ! and held signs with slogans like wow , a politician with a conscience ! and thanks for being your own man , jim vermont , like most of the rest of new england , has long been known for its spirit of independence and moderation and republicans from new england carry the same reputation , tending to see their inspiration in lincoln rather than reagan vermont has also been a place where people came to be themselves , said frank bryan , a political historian at the university of vermont even before the nation s birth , it was a place that drew people escaping from the rigidity of the puritan churches of southern new england , professor bryan said , and its tolerance was so great that , for example , in 1840 it had more nudists than anywhere else in the country a recent book that professor bryan helped to write , the vermont owner s manual \( the new england press \) , lists several vermont firsts that reflect on the state s tolerant , independent bent it was the first state to graduate an africanamerican from college , for example , and the first to give the vote to people without property in his speech today , mr jeffords mentioned several of his republican predecessors from vermont who also went their own way , from george aiken , the senator who suggested that the united states simply declare it had won the war in vietnam and leave , to ralph flanders , who stood up against mccarthyism more recently , the influx of backtothelanders since the 1960 s thickened the state s liberal streak , and last year vermont became the first state to pass a law allowing gay couples to marry in everything but name the state was fairly evenly split over the civil unions , but in general , it is considered one of the most liberal states in the country , and one of the least partisan , about evenly divided among democrats , republicans and independents so , political analysts here say , mr jeffords , who is the most popular politician in the state , need not worry that he will alienate many voters on radio callin shows here , the calls have run heavily in favor of the senator s move the views expressed have tended to focus on praising mr jeffords for courage rather than for his positions , which have been so clear for years that some have long called him a democrat in all but name mr jaccaci , in the green mountain boy costume , harked back to history again when he described the appeal of the moment to him every 200 years , he said , we have to take some arrogant and ignorant person named george and take him to school photo awaiting senator james m jeffords yesterday in burlington , vt , were many supporters , and critics \( paul hosefros the new york times \)
the phone rang unexpectedly a week ago saturday morning in the home of barbara walters , the abc news anchor it was her boss , david westin , the abc news president his opening salutation telegraphed trouble i thought there was a death in the family , ms walters said last week he was so somber it was not life or death but in the world of network television news , it was the nextworst thing the network was moving her edition of 20 20 out of its friday night time slot at 10 pm for a good part of the next television season to make way for a relatively lowrated dramatic series , once and again , which is produced by abc s corporate parent , the walt disney company i was amazed and disappointed , ms walters said so were the rest of her colleagues abc news is a famously factionalized place , full of intense rivalries and grudges that go back years \( that was my interview ! \) but the opera of the schedule change had a strange unifying effect inside the division , with ms walters cast as a martyr in the great battle to defend news coverage , an irony of sorts because some abc colleagues have long sniffed at what they consider her softer , showbusiness approach to news selfpreservation was on the minds of many as one senior abc news correspondent put it if they can move against barbara , what s next \? we always thought barbara was sacrosanct but in the changing dynamics of broadcast television , not even ms walters is sacrosanct and her eviction from friday night tapped into a growing sense in the news division of its waning relevance storm clouds are overhead increasingly the networks , under advertiser pressure , are reaching out to younger consumers , and the news audience is a notoriously wrinkled crowd and although news and sports were once the primary programming a network could own , that is no longer true networks can now freely take stakes in entertainment shows , intensifying the cane and abel sibling rivalry between the news and entertainment divisions meanwhile , in this arid economic environment , costs must be cut , so it is hard to justify huge outlays of cash for news gathering operations that drag down profits which is one reason cbs news is discussing a possible operational merger with cnn \( and why abc news has let cnn know it might be interested in striking such an arrangement , too , a development reported by the web site insidecom \) of course , news magazines are often moved around in the network schedules for instance , cbs news has decided to move 48 hours into the friday 10 pm time slot this fall but 20 20 on friday nights is considered to be as much of an institution by abc news as is 60 minutes on sunday nights by cbs news the 20 20 staff fears that by moving 20 20 to wednesday nights for the first six weeks of the television season , then possibly taking it off the air for several weeks before returning it to fridays at 10 , abc will cause confusion that will cost it not only viewers to cbs , but also important interviews i do n't think they understood how far we book in advance , ms walters said , which makes it difficult to stop and then pick up steam again ms walters spent the week in clear conflict she put on a brave face but nearly burst into tears during a staff meeting discussing the move she put herself forward as a team player , but in an interview on tuesday she let it be known that her contract had a reopener clause the window is december and that she would consider her options why , newsstaff members wondered , risk angering ms walters to save once and again , a marginal though critically acclaimed program that documents the struggles of divorcees with children in suburban chicago and has sela ward and billy campbell as its stars \? several division executives and correspondents saw in the move the changing times of network economics and politics though 20 20 draws a larger overall audience than does once and again \( 114 million to 85 million \) , once and again has a larger audience of people between 18 and 49 \( 53 million to 47 million \) a demographic that is both increasingly coveted by advertisers and hard for news programs to attract another point in favor of once and again is that disney s touchstone television produces it once and again would need to be shown on abc for at least another year before it could be successfully sold into syndication where the studio would make its real money on the program until 1995 , federal regulations sharply limited the ability of parent companies of the major networks to own scripted programming meanwhile , disney makes additional money on the program because it is rebroadcast each week on lifetime , the cable channel that the company owns in partnership with the hearst corporation adding to this cornucopia of corporate synergy the program s producers , marshall herskovitz and edward zwick , are also successful movie producers with films that have won academy awards two of the last three years seven for shakespeare in love \( distributed by disney s miramax \) , including best picture , and four for traffic \( distributed by usa films \) , including best director and best supporting actor with all of this in mind , one senior news executive , who spoke on condition that his name not be used , said , it s as if they 've chosen sela ward over barbara walters
grambling , la , nov 7 slivers of sunlight stream through halfclosed blinds as doug williams sits in his office at grambling state university williams is in an athletic building named after the former coach eddie robinson , adjacent to the school s stadium , also named after robinson williams is scanning the parking lot but is looking at nothing in particular while his mind is taking a wistful walk , reflecting on his bus trip in 1973 from his hometown of zachary , la , to grambling to begin his college football career the setting suits williams fine you cannot see in , but he certainly can see out i got on the old salter bus line and made my way up here , and after my first week of practice , coach rob told me i was going to be redshirted , williams said i had never sat out of anything i had played ball all of my life but the next year i had a good spring practice and yet i ended up being the third quarterback i did n't play in the first game or the second game not the third and just a little of the fourth by the fifth game , i 'd had enough i quit i did n't go to film study that monday and i planned on missing practice that tuesday i was sitting in my dorm room watching 'the big valley' show on tv when the grambling basketball coach , fred hobdy , came in i ca n't repeat everything with as much color and with the language he used , but basically it was , 'boy , get your tail up and get to practice ! ' i went for the last bit of it but i had an attitude and i was going to show everybody how upset i was by not talking to anybody and then i realized something nobody was talking to me , either that brought me back to earth in the next game , the starting quarterback broke his wrist the backup did not play well williams entered , soared and grambling beat tennessee state , 216 a star was born the rest is history and that is a fitting description of what grambling football , what robinson and williams are all about shimmering history , tangled history grambling is a division iaa school that has won 10 national black college championships \( including one with williams as coach last year \) and has sent more than 200 players to the national football league robinson is an 82yearold icon who coached here for 57 years and won 408 games , a college football record williams was the first black quarterback to play in a super bowl \( xxii , a 4210 washington redskins victory over the denver broncos in which williams threw four touchdown passes in the second quarter \) and is the only black quarterback to win a super bowl most valuable player award he is also the coach who in 1998 took command and followed robinson at grambling it was not an easy transition how do you replace 57 years and 408 victories \? how do you fill the shoes of your former coach \? how do you create new history while being a caretaker of cherished deeds \? on the grambling campus and throughout the state of louisiana , there was a tendency to look for conflict , drama and a split between robinson and williams throughout their relationship , each man has left much unspoken each has expected the other to simply deduce and understand , fueling misconceptions both men have mastered the art of making it difficult for the other to see in as much as the other sees out take , for example , the idea that williams helped force robinson s exit in 1998 after robinson s teams produced 56 , 38 and 38 records in his last three seasons that rumor blew in the wind for some time and that is just what it was , a rumor , and i do not deal in that , williams said i was never one who came to chitchat in coach s office as a player and i do n't do a lot of that now no man can fill his shoes they need to make him a pair of bronze shoes , put them up on a pedestal and let me put on my shoes and let the chips fall where they may but people have always wanted to talk doug this and doug that when it comes to me and coach rob some people just want to find wrong take , for example , the idea that robinson was forced out and that williams was not the choice he endorsed it never happened no one told me that i had to quit or i was finished because if they had , i guarantee you , it all would have worked out another way , robinson said i recommended doug for the job and he was the one person that could do it i have not been looking over his shoulder and i have great respect for him he s a good person and a hard worker and anything he would need from me he can get it they are so different , yet alike each is cordial yet the one does not let the other see in when people talk about eddie robinson and doug williams , they would prefer to see it buddybuddy and not him go his way and i go my way , robinson said neither one of us are buddybuddy like that but we have mutual respect and there is no split doug is trying to win football games and make his players better men those are beautiful traits to have in common a week after williams finally took over at quarterback in 1974 , robinson had a talk with him he told williams he knew he was good , but if he had played him from the start , the other quarterbacks would have never gotten in williams thought that was crazy , but he never said so when williams won the super bowl mvp , robinson has told others that it was his proudest moment in football , but williams said that robinson never told him that i guess he figured i 'd hear it , williams said robinson occasionally drives to grambling practices but sits in his car and watches he comes to games but sits in the president s box , high above the action he has observed a coach , he said , that will be in demand doug comes over to me at the car and leaves practice to talk to me , but i tell him i just come to watch and learn and do n't leave his practice , robinson said i told him if he keeps it up , i 'll stop coming i'm not a drinking man but i see his coaching like a liquor that is its finest with age he s doing exceptionally well and the longer he coaches the more he s going to find out about himself as a coach i hope he does n't leave he s about the best thing that s happened for grambling williams has gone 56 , 74 , 102 and , thus far this season , 71 grambling won its first seven before losing last week to alabama state it plays at nichols state on saturday any coach that tells you after having losing teams at the end of a long career that he just wants to walk away is lying , robinson said i just did n't believe people were supposed to beat me but sometimes , when it s time to go , that s just the way it is , and it was time to go people have a short memory you can be a friend , even a relative as a coach , but they want you to win doug can tell you about that sure williams can his family and friends advised him not to succeed robinson they said it was too much let someone else take over first williams , though , would have none of that he arrived and changed the grambling uniforms he changed the offense from the longtime single wing and wingt robinson used to a multiple pro set he initially had players run at 5 am he cut 31 in his first season some resisted change , even among the grambling players but like robinson throughout the years at grambling , guess who won out \? last year was the season where the rope was broken on the eras and i think the fans now understand that this is the doug williams era while appreciating the coach rob era , williams said coach rob is a living legend and he will always have my respect we had a perfect dream for a perfect season this year and we have lost one game , so that s over , and now we can get back to real life and to playing tiger football and that means playing at full speed , with attitude , with love and playing to win for a coach with a practical , direct , firm and winning hand for robinson and williams , for grambling football , that is plenty of common ground photos eddie robinson , 82 , coached at grambling for 57 years and won 408 games , the most in the history of college football doug williams , the first black quarterback to play in a super bowl , took over for eddie robinson in the 1998 season \( photographs by associated press \)
o winston link , a photographer whose requiem for steam railroading portrayed it as a spectacularly alive and often surreal presence in 1950 s smalltown america , died on tuesday in south salem , ny he was 86 mr link s epiphany came in january 1955 while on assignment for an advertising agency in virginia , he stopped one evening by the norfolk western train yard in waynesboro to await the arrival of a steampowered passenger train by the mid50 s , most of the major american railroads had replaced their steam locomotives with diesels what mr link saw and felt that night started him on a fiveyear odyssey through the small railroad towns in the appalachian mountains and the shenandoah valley to document the last years of steam railroading not only did he get norfolk western s approval for his project , but he was given a key to the railroad s switch boxes this meant he could telephone dispatchers for exact arrival times and , on occasion , to ask them to delay a train or to backtrack so he could take the desired picture the marvel in mr link s norfolk western photographs is not the elaborate behindthescenes preparation for those images but their arresting spontaneity in main line on main street , north fork , w va \( 1958 \) , a train belching white steam into the black sky seems to be heading sedately , and outlandishly , down a deserted street that is lined on one side by modest houses , some with lighted windows in birmingham special at rural retreat \( 1957 \) , a lone signalman is dwarfed by the nighttime express steaming past his country station late in life , mr link became embroiled in a bitter divorce battle that resulted in civil and criminal charges against his wife , conchita , who is now in prison in 1993 he sought a divorce from her after nearly a decade of marriage in a related civil action , he contended that she had taken control of his life and his business , imprisoning him in his basement where he made prints , isolating him from the outside world by cutting off his telephone and causing his driver s license to be suspended , telling gallery owners that he had alzheimer s disease , and stealing about 2 , 000 of his railroad prints in a subsequent criminal investigation , mrs link was indicted and convicted of grand larceny for stealing 1 , 400 prints worth 16 million from mr link mr link s fame came after many years of obscurity born in brooklyn on dec 16 , 1914 , he was a commercial photographer trained as a civil engineer at the polytechnic institute of brooklyn \( now polytechnic university \) , he was photo editor and a photographer on the campus newspaper his familiarity with the camera and the darkroom began when he was a teenager and went with friends to rail yards and photographed the trains he developed his film at home , printing the pictures with an enlarger that he built in 1937 mr link graduated from polytechnic and began working as a photographer at carl byoir and associates , a public relations firm he was technically adept with studio camera equipment and had a superb eye for framing pictures he also had a keen sense of the absurd above all , he had a flair for storytelling through startling staged photography during world war ii mr link was eager to contribute to the war effort unable to serve in the military because of neartotal deafness in one ear , he left byoir to work at a columbia university wartime laboratory , developing a device to detect submarines from lowflying aircraft the laboratory , in mineola , ny , was near the long island rail road mr link s interest in trains was revived and , ignoring the wartime ban on railroad photography , he took pictures of trains after the war he worked as a freelance photographer , specializing in industrial subjects his clients included advertising agencies , newspapers , fashion houses , the triborough bridge and tunnel authority , alcoa , b f goodrich and texaco in between his commercial projects , mr link made railroad scouting forays before plotting his picturetaking with military precision usually with an assistant , he drove to his sites and , for nighttime scenes , began setting up complex lighting equipment , a painstaking process that could take from several hours to three days there was no room for error everything had to work the first time mr link s railroad project ended with his return to commercial photography shortly before norfolk western retired its last steam engine in may 1960 decades later his train images began to be noticed beyond railway circles in 1976 , john szarkowski , then the director of the photography department at the museum of modern art , bought six of his photographs for the museum in 1982 an article about mr link and his work in american photographer magazine sparked wider interest exhibitions followed , with his images influencing photographers like gregory crewdson and jeff wall mr link s first marriage , to the former marteal

trenton there was christie whitman , canoeing down a pristine stream in the interior of new jersey this was not a tourism advertisement , but rather a backtonature touch strategically inserted into the governor s state of the state address several weeks ago and this was not just any governor , but the woman who had just been chosen by presidentelect bush to head the nation s environmental protection agency as the state s own senator robert g torricelli put it , there are few training grounds that could better prepare someone for this position than the governor of new jersey but as mrs whitman begins her new career , there is some debate over the depth of her concern for the environment her efforts to preserve open space and to protect the coastline have received high marks from nearly every environmental group but the governor s overall record particularly in her first term , when open for business was a campaign theme has another side faced with a deep economic slump , mrs whitman took office pledging to slash not only taxes but regulations that stood in the way of business she is certainly good on open space , said edward lloyd , a professor at columbia university law school and a former director of the rutgers environmental law clinic that is what she is best known for in the environmental area on the regulatory side , there is a very different story to tell indeed , in her last address as governor , mrs whitman cited her program to protect a million acres of woods and farmland from development , and used the speech to unveil a new effort to improve state parks even as the state has been growing , our air and water are cleaner , with fewer days of high ozone and carbon monoxide and far fewer beach closings , mrs whitman said all policy is personal , and for me few policies are more personal than our efforts to preserve open space in the garden state raised on a farm , i want every new jersey child now and in the future to enjoy the character of the state that i have always loved the reality is far more complex for instance , the state department of environmental protection was one of governor whitman s first targets she clearly intended to shift the organization and philosophy of an agency long viewed as an enemy of business and developers in her first budget , mrs whitman cut more than 200 positions from the department , an action that included transferring the board of public utilities to the treasury department when environmental groups and public employee unions strenuously protested , the governor was unmoved , saying increased regulation was not the best way to get a cleaner environment the cuts mrs whitman proposed for later budgets were so deep that they drew opposition from her own party in may 1996 , some state senators including john o bennett , the majority leader from little silver , said republicans would oppose the governor s budget unless she restored money for environmental programs the proposed budget would require dramatic reductions in scientific , technical and human resources , senator bennett and six other senators wrote in a letter to the governor we feel strongly that the proposed layoffs of dep personnel will negatively impact the department s ability to effectively safeguard the environment and protect public health in subsequent years , mrs whitman restored much of the agency s financing though her budget allocations did not reach the 1994 level until the fiscal year 2000 in a recent interview , eileen mcginnis , the governor s chief of policy and planning , said that although some of mrs whitman s policies in her first term were a response to the state s economic problems , the changes at the department of environmental protection were not among them the department needed a more focused mission , ms mcginnis said in many ways , the whitman administration marked a deep change for new jersey s environmental policies from a trend toward greater regulation and control to a more cooperative relationship with industry and developers while her predecessors created large blocks of rules to shape the environment the byrne administration s creation of the pinelands commission , the financing of municipal sewage plants in the kean years and the florio administration s stringent pollution regulations mrs whitman concentrated on adjusting existing rules rather than creating new ones ms mcginnis said the intent was not to simply cut down on regulation , but to replace a thicket of confusing requirements with clear timetables and concrete goals she said the plan was to maintain strict environmental standards while eliminating the creation of what some considered unneeded regulations i would say sensible regulation , ms mcginnis said but the definition of sensible can vary depending on one s agenda , and that change in philosophy is controversial to this day many of the steps taken by mrs whitman still rankle environmental groups in the state , including these actions elimination of the office of environmental prosecutor and the office of the public advocate and the creation of the office of the business ombudsman downsizing the department of environmental protection , which saw its staff drop to a low of 3 , 022 in 1998 from 3 , 729 in 1994 elimination of the department of environmental protection lab support for the expansion of controversial highways and such developments such as merrill lynch s corporate park in hopewell reduction in both staff and financing for the state s parks elimination of more than 100 stations that monitor water quality removal of more than 1 , 000 chemicals from a group of hazardous industrial chemicals , called the righttoknow list , that are subject to state inspection
for the first time in years , my town has not been covered with mushy brown , frostdestroyed magnolia petals the continuous cold of our socalled endless winter ensured that the buds on traditionally early bloomers stayed tightly closed the vast majority of magnolias throughout much of the northeast are asian varieties that flower before their leaves unfurl give them a couple of days of warm , late winter sunshine and they are ready to strut their stuff in their asian haunts , this works out fine because frosts rarely appear after such weather but on our continent , such balmy temperatures are almost always followed by devastating cold spells the fact that the flowers on these asian magnolias are particularly vulnerable to frosts did not stop 19thcentury plant explorers from sending them back to the northeast the ubiquitous star magnolia \( magnolia stellata \) , for example , made its american debut in 1862 in long island , and has been blasted by spring frosts ever since in the 1950 s , plant breeders started developing magnolias that would look lovely in northern springs they initially used genetic stock from a second group of asian magnolias , those that flower later and just as their leaves unfurl there was also an emphasis on shorter magnolias , plants that would be suitable for small properties the leonard messel magnolia \( m x loebneri \) , developed in england , was the first such magnolia to make an appearance this tree , about 15 feet tall , can take temperatures down to minus 30 degrees fahrenheit its lovely pink flowers are the most frost resistant of all magnolias two united states national arboretum scientists francis de vos and william kosar did outstanding work in the area in 1955 , mr de vos began to transfer pollen from star magnolia cultivars to lily magnolia \( m lilliflora \) cultivars mr kosar continued the effort , with the result that eight very special hybrids were introduced in 1965 in horticultural circles , these magnolias are known as the de vos and kosar hybrids to the general gardening public , they are known as the eight little girls because of their relatively small stature and because their names honor arboretum secretaries or staff wives and daughters ten years ago , i planted one of these magnolias in my garden in central new jersey betty tops out at 14 feet and is covered with eightinch wide , pink and white flowers for up to six spring weeks neither pests nor diseases have bothered it in the decade it has graced my garden as all magnolias require , it was placed in a sunny spot with reasonably fertile , welldrained soil betty s siblings are named ann , jane , judy , pinkie , randy , ricki , and susan all are hardy to minus 20 degrees their lily magnolia genes place them in the second group of magnolias , giving them late flowering characteristics , and their star magnolia genes provide mildew resistance and prolific , fragrant flowers both parents ensure that none of the girls exceed 20 feet most are in the 12foot range all eight were honored with an award of garden merit by the royal horticultural society in 1993 and all have some sporadic bloom through summer it s enough to make you realize that these are great plants for the first time in my garden , betty jumpstarted its flowering period last year its luscious blossoms opened at the end of an exceptionally balmy march though soon punished by frost , it continued to bloom albeit with ugly brown spots at the end of many petals until the past few decades , those wanting magnolia flowers completely unaffected by frost had to rely on towering american magnolias , which range in height from 50 to 90 feet nature gave their flowers frost protection by providing them with fully emerged , sheltering leaves and with a late spring flowering date in 1968 , however , ray bracken discovered a 20foottall , exceptionally hardy form of a southern magnolia \( m grandiflora \) growing in his south carolina nursery he registered it in 1987 and named it bracken s brown beauty thriving in winter temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees , it bears numerous fragrant white flowers in late spring and repeat blooms throughout summer out in california , todd greshman made a significant contribution with his 1986 introduction porcelain dove , a hybrid between the asian m globosa and the american m virginiana this 15foot tree , hardy to minus 20 degrees , bears fragrant white flowers that turn warm , humid summer evenings into luxurious experiences while the heaviest bloom occurs in june , flowers continue to open throughout july and august august kehr , a retired united states department of agriculture research scientist , has taken another approach working independently in western north carolina , he has been creating frostresistant flowers that open before leaves unfurl in 1995 , he introduced eskimo , with 5 to 6inch wide flowers consisting of pale lilac petals that can tolerate at least six degrees of frost this slowgrowing tree only 10 feet tall in 20 years is just now becoming commercially available eskimo is easily hardy to minus 10 degrees and perhaps to minus 20 a wide variety of magnolias

washington , feb 22 the furor over president bill clinton s pardons intensified today as congressional investigators focused on roger clinton and his efforts to win pardons for friends and associates from his half brother in discussions with bill clinton , roger clinton sought clemency for about 10 people , although he had not been paid for his efforts , said julia payne , an aide to the former president ms payne added that all of the requests had been denied congressional officials said they were investigating roger clinton s assertions that he had pressed for the pardons without pay as congressional investigators broadened their inquiry in washington , federal prosecutors in new york in the office of united states attorney mary jo white expanded their criminal inquiry to determine whether efforts were made to buy pardons in some cases , the officials said while the investigations rapidly accelerated beyond the initial inquiry into mr clinton s pardon of the fugitive commodities trader marc rich , senator hillary rodham clinton told reporters today that she played no role in any of the dozens of pardons that her husband granted she expressed chagrin that her brother hugh rodham accepted a large fee as a pardon lobbyist excerpts , page a15 in another development , clinton aides said today that mrs clinton s senate campaign treasurer helped obtain lastminute pardons for two convicted felons from president clinton the treasurer , william cunningham iii , a new york lawyer , is the law partner of harold ickes , an adviser to the clintons in an interview today , mr ickes said a friendcame to him in january , and asked him to help obtain pardons for james manning and robert fain , who had been convicted in 1982 on tax evasion charges mr ickes said he told the friend that he was not practicing law , and so referred him to mr cunningham , a former assistant united states attorney a lawyer knowledgeable about the case identified the friend as harry thomason , a television producer and arkansas friend of the clintons mr cunningham , who is with the firm of meyer , suozzi , english klein in mineola , ny , drew up the paperwork and on jan 16 sent it to the pardon office at the department of justice mr ickes s partner at the washington firm of ickes enright , janice enright , sent the pardon applications to the white house , mr ickes said mr ickes said that he had had no discussions with president clinton or mrs clinton about the pardons and that he had received no money he said mr cunningham charged the men on an hourly basis , receiving a total of about 4 , 000 roger clinton s lobbying became known one day after hugh rodham , president clinton s brotherinlaw , agreed to return a fee of 400 , 000 that he had beenpaid to help two men who received a presidential pardon and a grant of clemency on jan 20 , mr clinton s last day in office former white house aides said tonight that roger clinton had given the president a list of pardon candidates in 1998 and another list in december or january , when he made a personal appeal to his brother none of those people received pardons the pardons , along with expensive gifts that the clintons took with them as they left office , have clouded mrs clinton s effort to establish herself as the new democratic senator from new york even so , she swept into a senate office building and coolly responded to reporters' questions i was just heartbroken and shocked by it , she said of the payment to her brother and , you know , immediately said it was a terrible misjudgment and the money had to

for the last decade , whenever i mentioned to anyone that i was working on a life of bing crosby , the usual response was , why \? i ca n't say i was surprised for 30 years , between 1927 and 1956 , crosby was a looming presence in america s cultural landscape at the peak of his career , in the 1930 s and 1940 s , he was thought by many to be the most famous american alive for much of that period , he was undoubtedly the most admired the cycle of road pictures with bob hope established crosby as a great comic actor yet by the 1960 s , the ocean began to roll over der bingle , and though he continued to sell millions of records chiefly holiday songs he had morphed into a grand old man while retaining little of the bite of his contemporary , louis armstrong , or his aging offspring , frank sinatra crosby s reputation faltered along with his music after his death , in 1977 when his eldest son , gary crosby , published a bitter memoir describing the unflappable bing administering vigorous corporal punishment , his halo tilted and crashed soon the afterlife of his career imploded jazz lovers kept his memory alive , mainly because of his early records and the later collaborations with armstrong , louis jordan , les paul and others but jazz lovers are by nature classicists , and crosby had spent most of his life on the other side of the divide the pop world , where success is measured in numbers a world remade by rock , in which even the oldest of oldies postdate heartbreak hotel yet consider this in 1946 , three of the five topgrossing hollywood pictures \( the bells of st mary s , blue skies , road to utopia \) were crosby vehicles for five years running \( 1944 to 1948 \) , he was no 1 at the box office his radio programs \( 1931 to 1962 \) attracted at their wartime peak as many as 50 million listeners he recorded nearly 400 hit singles , an achievement no one not sinatra , elvis or the beatles has come close to matching could a man who spoke so deeply to so many for so long have nothing to say to us now \? for a biographer , crosby s career offers more incentive than mere statistics he is the ideal figure for tracking the rise of american popular culture he played pivotal roles in the development of the recording , radio and film industries , while virtually defining the microphone as a singer s instrument his influence on other singers including sinatra , elvis and john lennon , avowed fans all would be hard to overstate , and he managed to maintain his popularity through several major cultural upheavals in 20thcentury american history prohibition , depression , world war ii , the cold war and the affluent society like many in my generation , i was drawn to the enunciated clarity , effortless swing and insouciant scatsinging of crosby in his jazz years while ignoring his later work as meretricious after listening to his exhaustive discography , more than 2 , 000 recordings \( including radio broadcasts \) , it became apparent that his voice and style peaked not in the 1920 s , when he joined paul whiteman s orchestra as the first ever fulltime band singer , but a decade later , in hollywood jazzborn prejudices are often inadequate in evaluating a popular idol irving berlin once said he wrote music for the mob and that as far as he was concerned , the mob was always right crosby s dickensian appetite for every kind of song obliges us to savor the validity and verve of music created not by or for the elect but for the delectation of the millions the mob is not always right its infinite longing for rote repetition and screwy novelties \( three little fishies , anyone \? \) is matched by its impatience with music that demands concentration yet the ability of the millions to discriminate is not negligible examine the pop records released between 1934 and 1954 , and compare the major hits to the numberless misses you cannot help admiring the mob s batting average the public had little trouble distinguishing between crosby and his rivals in the 1920 s his first solo record , though not a hit , showed those who were paying attention that the times were changing a year after armstrong recorded heebie jeebies , the explosive scatdriven number that put his vocal style on the map , and three months after crosby had begun touring with whiteman , he was allotted a chorus on muddy water the session took place on march 7 , 1927 , at leiderkranz hall in new york crosby s record , unlike armstrong s , no longer seems as radical as it once did unless you listen to it in tandem with the other white pop records of the time , in which case his debut seems absolutely astonishing the song itself is a conventional idyll about life down dixie way , created by an integrated team , the white composer peter derose and the black lyricist jo trent in matty malneck s arrangement , muddy water opens with a trombone and a bold unison ensemble chorus , promising a jazz performance yet only the vocal , backed by viola and rhythm , makes good on that promise compared to his mature work , crosby s chorus is stilted , almost formal but his rhythm and articulation are sure , especially on the bridge , in which he emphasizes there and care with a trilling vibrato that displays his innate affinity for swing giving each word its due , his winged phrasing banishes sentimentality the sound of his voice is unlike that of any of his contemporaries a vibrant , virile baritone , completely at odds with the effete tenors and semifalsetto warblers who dominated male popular singing in that era after hearing him , duke ellington vowed not to hire a male vocalist until he found one who sounded like crosby

berga , germany four plain wooden crosses stand in the cemetery above this quiet town in eastern germany one of them is inscribed unknown allied soldier he is unlikely to be an american , because the gi s who died here were exhumed after world war ii and taken home but the mystery of this soldier s identity is only one of many hanging over berga and its former nazi camp on a cold , late march day , with snow falling on the graves , a thin , softspoken american stands filming in the cemetery he has hired some local volunteers , one of whom is portraying a nazi guard , as two others turn the earth in preparation for the burial of the simulated corpses whose limp feet dangle out of sacks the scene has an eerie luminosity in the silence of the snow the weather is cinematographically perfect it is also unseasonably cold and infernally damp the american , charles guggenheim , shivers as he says this is a slow business , filming something like this sort of like watching grass grow but for him the fate of the american soldiers imprisoned and worked to death more than a halfcentury ago in berga has become something of an obsession time may be needed for an obsession to take hold , time for the halfthoughts , nagging regrets and suppressed memories to coalesce into a determination to act mr guggenheim , a documentary filmmaker who has won four academy awards , waited a long time to embark on this movie his daughter , grace guggenheim , has a theory as to why this is sort of a survivor s guilt story , she said in september 1944 mr guggenheim , now 77 , was with the american 106th infantry division , preparing to go to europe but when the other soldiers embarked , he was immobilized with a foot infection he remained in indiana while his fellow infantrymen were plunged , within weeks , into the battle of the bulge two regiments were lost thousands of american soldiers were captured , and several hundred who were jewish or who looked jewish ended up in berga up to now their fate has received relatively little attention , partly because the surviving soldiers long tended to repress the trauma i could have been among the captured or the killed , mr guggenheim mused i never wished i had come to europe anyone in the infantry who wishes for war has something wrong with them but i 've thought a lot why in the hell am i here and they not \? perhaps in the next life they 'll get even i'm trying not to believe in a next life even this life seems incredible enough when gazing at little berga , a place outside time it was exploited by the nazis before being taken over by the russians , who mined uranium in the area in 1990 it was made part of a united germany unemployment here stands at about 24 percent , so mr guggenheim had no problem finding volunteers for his film to conjure an atmosphere of desolation was not difficult either beside the unused redbrick textile factory of a vanished jewish family \( named englander \) , stray cats wander through junkyards , watched by old men standing huddled against the cold germany s ghosts , its myriad secrets , are almost palpable in a place like this among the onlookers near the cemetery is sabine knuppel , a municipal worker she says she has photographs of the old days in berga a lighted swastika glowing among trees heavy with snow none of the old people in town like to talk about those days , she says , when the nazis set up a satellite camp to buchenwald in the middle of town and used the slave laborers imprisoned there to dig tunnels into the rock cliffs bordering the elster river all that , she continues , constitutes a lost world but once there were perhaps 1 , 000 prisoners working in the tunnels , where the nazis planned to install a factory producing synthetic fuel but until now , nobody in the town knew there were americans among the prisoners , ms knuppel says after the war the russians blew up many of the tunnels in their vestiges bats established a vast colony now officially designated as a german nature reserve along the wooded banks of the elster , a dozen entrances to the tunnels may still be seen they are barred with steel doors layer upon layer of german secrets more tangible in a place like berga than in the west of the country , where postwar prosperity wiped away most traces of tragedy mr guggenheim , whose awardwinning documentaries include j f k remembered and an account of the civil rights movement called a time for justice , has been digging into the secrets for two years now he has interviewed 40 american survivors of berga for a documentary tentatively titled gi holocaust the film , a coproduction of mr guggenheim s company and wnet , the publictelevision station in new york , centers on what happened to a group of american soldiers captured by the germans after the battle of the bulge \( which began on dec 16 , 1944 \) and later transported to berga this group of about 350 men was selected from among the more than 2 , 000 american prisoners initially taken to the stalag 9b prisoner of war camp at bad orb , 50 miles north of frankfurt among them was william shapiro , now a retired doctor living in florida a medic attached to the 28th infantry division , he was captured on dec 17 , 1944 , the day after the battle began

key largo , fla just before sept 11 changed storytelling in america forever , my hollywood agent explained that my new novel was doomed in movieland because it lacked sufficient explosive moments it was exactly nine fireballs short of the prevailing formula given this , the fact that our defense department is currently consulting with hollywood script writers and producers to help our generals think outside the box is beyond comprehension hollywood storytellers invented the box they worship the box they have spent their lives massproducing the box as our movie geniuses scramble to reinvent their formula and edit out scenes that might offend postsept 11 sensibilities , i feel a wonderful release the box is dead the tyranny of hollywood is temporarily abated what will fill this storytelling vacuum has yet to be seen , but my bet is that the appetite for stories that explore violence and mayhem , rather than exploiting them , will have an even broader appeal although the body count is traditionally high in my genre , the best thrillers and crime novels have never been about thrills or crime they are about the often subtle , often banal inner workings of evil , and about the many shapes of heroism those impossible struggles of the individual challenged by forces that threaten his soul more than his body certainly , some of the landscape of popular fiction is changed stock characters that have been so reliable in their ability to scare us silly serial killers , stalkers , hit men , mob bosses , psychopathic cannibals wither and turn to dust in the face of the far more potent forms of evil we have encountered reallife heroes reshape standards for bravery who among us has not tested his imagination by banding together with strangers on that doomed plane , throwing together a hasty plan , then storming down the narrow aisle to tackle a group of razorwielding thugs \? who has n't imagined himself pushing upward alongside our comrades into those smokedarkened hallways as choking civilians rush out of harm s way , while all around us a faint rumble rises \? thriller writers grapple with the devilish distinction between revenge and justice , show violence and bravery in its starkest forms , take a noholdsbarred journey into labyrinths of malevolence and the ordinary back rooms of ordinary taverns some master writers have been here before us books like huckleberry finn , moby dick and a farewell to arms share the gritty sensibility and brutally honest portraits of violence that distinguish the modern thriller since sept 11 , my hollywood agent has changed her tune now the reason my book will never be made into a film is that the one explosive moment it did contain is a scene portraying an airliner brought down by terrorists in a book written over a year ago , i 've broken a brand new taboo i get no points for prescience and want none my barometer was twitching that s all i can say i write about what scares me and these days everywhere i look , i see material
washington , june 6 though the senate has never before changed hands in the middle of a session , tom daschle , the new majority leader , confronts problems and opportunities similar to those that faced bob dole , robert c byrd , howard h baker jr and lyndon b johnson they all assumed control of the senate with a party behind them that had a lengthy , unfulfilled agenda that it was itching to bring up but none of them had a majority big enough to overcome a filibuster , and only mr baker , in 1981 , had a popular , newly elected president of his own party to help him the others all faced presidents of the other party but the others all had two months from the election to taking office to get ready for their new roles and the party they had ousted also had a couple of months to adjust this time it was only two weeks so there was a particular urgency to mr daschle s appeal for cooperation , when he said , polarized positions are an indulgence , an indulgence the senate cannot afford and our nation will not tolerate with his party eager to pass legislation putting into effect patients' rights , a higher minimum wage and prescription drug coverage for the elderly , mr daschle , a south dakota democrat , has a program to pursue just as mr dole could pledge action to rein in government in 1995 , when he said , we will roll back federal programs , laws , and regulations from a to z , from amtrak to zoological studies but while that produced major legislation , like welfare law revisions , repeal of farm price supports and deep spending cuts , the senate did not play the leading role the republican energy came from the house , and it was compromising with a democratic president who embarrassed the republicans over shutting down the government now the senate is the only player in the legislative process in democratic hands , and any democratic measures will have to start there in the other shifts over the last half century , the party gaining the senate had either the house or the white house as an ally in 1981 , mr baker had little to say early about a legislative program , leaving that to a new president , ronald reagan , who was not yet inaugurated when mr baker became majority leader earlier in january indeed , republicans were still shaking themselves over an election that saw them gain nine seats and a majority when mr baker , on election night 1980 , called mr dole to tell him that republicans had control and that mr dole would head the finance committee , mr dole replied , but who will tell russell long \? mr long , a louisiana democrat , had headed the committee since 1966 mr dole led the successful fight for deep tax cuts , a centerpiece of republican policy then and now , although mr baker , while supporting them , called the move a riverboat gamble the 1987 shift was different , because the democrats confronted a lame duck in president reagan , and one whose approval rating in a new york times cbs news poll had slipped to 52 percent positive , 38 percent negative after the irancontra affair when mr byrd took over , he did not attack mr reagan \( as mr dole attacked mr clinton in 1995 \) , but he lectured him and demanded that he recognize that congress was coequal with the executive to drive the lesson home , that very month congress repassed a clean water bill that mr reagan had pocketvetoed in 1986 , and then overrode his new veto before that new democratic senate adjourned in 1988 , it had made law in areas like civil rights , trade and welfare some democrats hyperbolically compared its record to the 196566 congress that enacted johnson s great society program johnson himself treated his new leadership in 1955 gingerly he resisted efforts by liberal democrats to push legislation that might not pass he and his mentor , speaker sam rayburn , emphasized their desire to cooperate with president dwight d eisenhower , whose approval rating stood at 69 percent , according to gallup indeed , on the 84th congress s opening day , johnson let rayburn do the talking , promising that eisenhower s legislation would be looked on with kindliness because he is the leader of our country before that congress adjourned , it had enacted three important democratic measures , an expansion of public housing , new disability benefits under social security and an increase of the minimum wage to a dollar an hour from 75 cents , and eisenhower s highway program johnson s biographer robert dallek says johnson s approach was to let eisenhower fight with the republican right and to portray democrats as the president s allies he would attach himself to eisenhower and take advantage of his power and prestige , mr dallek said perhaps the most interesting comparison of mr daschle s situation with johnson s is in what johnson did not do in 1953 and 1954 republicans began the 83rd congress with 48 of the 96 senators , and the vice president , equivalent to the 50 out of 100 they had this year but nine senators died during that congress , and at one time there were two more democrats than republicans johnson did not , however , try to convert those numbers into the majority leadership there were three main reasons , mr dallek said first , it might have seemed like a challenge to eisenhower second , johnson s allies among southern chairmen were wary of any abrupt change and especially , he said , johnson was being very careful to see to it that senate republicans had the chore of bringing down senator joseph r mccarthy of wisconsin , whose unsubstantiated accusations of communists in government plagued washington at the time as long as republicans ran the senate , johnson believed , it would be their job , and democrats would not suffer in the messy censure process this year , mr daschle had no similar inhibitions photos from left , senator daschle found a quiet spot yesterday celebrated with colleagues and met with a former majority leader , senator robert c byrd senator tom daschle , left , the new majority leader , met yesterday with his new committee chairmen as democrats took control of the senate \( photographs by paul hosefros the new york times \)

philadelphia , feb 13 after eight years in prison , joseph fabio now lives in a halfway house next to a funeral home here , where counselors have helped him steer clear of drugs , find a job in a gas station and contain the uncontrollable anger that earned him a murder sentence at age 18 his three months in the program have been a blessing , mr fabio said , and like many other residents , he said his only complaint was that for some reason the kitchen served nothing but vegetarian food when he was told that the cuisine was restricted because this halfway house was affiliated with the international society for krishna consciousness , better known as the hare krishnas , mr fabio looked as if he had been ambushed by candid camera they 're around still \? he asked , recalling having seen monks in saffron robes in airports years ago i did n't know for almost 20 years , hare krishna devotees in philadelphia have received millions of dollars in government contracts to run a network of services , including a shelter for homeless veterans , transitional homes for recovering addicts and this halfway house for parolees the unusual collaboration between government agencies and a religious group that depicts god as a babyfaced boy with blue skin offers a glimpse of the challenges ahead for president bush s initiative to expand government support for social service programs run by religious organizations mr bush s new white house office of faithbased and community initiatives officially opens for business on feb 20 the president says religious programs will be judged not on their beliefs but on the results of their work we do not impose any religion , mr bush said at a prayer breakfast on feb 1 we welcome all religion the president s assertion may be questioned in the coming days while established charitable programs , like those run by catholic charities and the salvation army , are expected to have little trouble winning further government support , it is the smaller programs run by less traditional faiths that are likely to test the president s promise to avoid discriminating on the basis of belief , and the public s acceptance of his approach devoting government money to selected religious programs also runs the risk of sparking conflict already , one group has tried to prevent another from being allowed to participate mr bush signed the executive orders establishing his initiative flanked by a score of christian ministers , two jewish leaders and a muslim imam , and hailed the event as a picture of the strength and diversity of the country but if the religious portrait of the nation were a great stainedglass window , those leaders would represent only a few large pieces of glass now , members of a wide variety of religious groups , some once considered far outside the mainstream , are busy preparing proposals for government financing to support the kinds of programs that mr bush has said he will make his focus literacy , sexual abstinence and substance abuse the church of scientology plans to seek support for its drug rehabilitation and literacy programs the rev sun myung moon s church , now called the family federation for world peace and unification usa , plans to promote its abstinence programs in the schools you will see us deeply involved in any area where we can partner in practical projects with government , said the rev phillip d schanker , the unification church s vice president for public affairs , who had on his desk a copy of a magazine he had just subscribed to about government contracting opportunities and krishna leaders , who have centers in 40 american cities , have been phoning david d dobson , executive director of the philadelphia programs for the hare krishnas a hindu sect often stigmatized in this country but well established in india to discuss how to follow his example and become government contractors mr bush s effort could provoke new questions about what constitutes a legitimate religion one definition of religion likely to be applied grows out of the supreme court s ruling in a 1965 case involving draft exemptions in that case , the court defined religion as a sincere and meaningful belief occupying in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the god of those admittedly qualified for the exemption by any measure , the definition is broad one of the big issues that people have n't talked about much is that some very controversial religions could get active in this , said philip jenkins , the author of mystics and messiahs cults and new religions in american history \( oxford university press , 2000 \) , and a professor of history and religious studies at pennsylvania state university running a faithbased program raises the question , what faiths are out of bounds \?

the answer is , you ca n't

reading chekhov a critical journey by janet malcolm 210 pp new york random house 2395 of all the forms of immortality that can befall a writer , perhaps none is so injurious as being embalmed in an adjective the word chekhovian is typically used to evoke an unimposing , almost anecdotal mode of realism and a cozy sense of human decency in her elegant , elusive new book , janet malcolm seeks to liberate chekhov from the prison that his name has become , and from the kind of ritualized , sentimental admiration that is , in her rigorous view , the opposite of appreciative reading chekhov , she writes , remains the most misunderstood as well as the most beloved of the 19thcentury russian geniuses in russia , no less than in our country , possibly even more than in our country , chekhov attracts a kind of sickening piety you utter the name 'chekhov' and people arrange their features as if a baby deer had come into the room if malcolm s chekhov is a more dangerous beast , it is partly because he ventures out in disguise , appearing docile and familiar the gist of her argument is a paradox chekhov s stories and she concentrates more on these than on the plays , which are meant to be seen and heard , rather than read have a straightforward , natural , rational , modern surface they have been described as modest , delicate , gray in fact they are wild and strange , archaic and brilliantly painted but the wildness and strangeness and archaism and brilliant colors are concealed , as are the complexity and difficulty something similar could be said about malcolm s own book its humdrum title and calm , meditative tone conceal a furious , restless sensibility what seems like a leisurely stroll through biography , travel writing and textual interpretation is in fact \( if i may borrow malcolm s deadpan formulation \) a fierce assault on literary decorum , and a calm demolition of the ideological defenses that protect us from the writers we claim to love reading chekhov is , like geoff dyer s out of sheer rage , about its own failure to be something else a biography , a critical study , a literary travelogue and thus is a radical debunking of those genres for reasons that she never quite explains , malcolm finds herself in russia , glumly following bossy tour guides through the postsoviet drear of st petersburg , yalta and moscow on a mission whose very futility may be its purpose without knowing exactly why , she writes , i have always found travel writing a little boring , and now the reason seemed clear travel itself is a lowkey emotional experience , a pallid affair in comparison to ordinary life it may seem a bit disingenuous to go halfway around the world to make this discovery , especially when it might have been confirmed \( as , indeed , it soon is \) by reading the author who inspired the journey in the first place but then again , without the organizing principle of travel , the book might be as shapeless as it occasionally appears in his stories and plays , malcolm notes , chekhov sometimes creates an illusion of lifelike pointlessness , but in fact every action has a point and the point of going to yalta , for malcolm , is to prove the pointlessness of going to yalta malcolm s desultory wanderings in that city and others suggest that it would have been better to stay home reading chekhov , and her forays into chekhov s life yield the same lesson one of the most gratifying things about reading chekhov is its quiet , vigorous defense of the prerogatives of criticism against the imperial banality of biography the book was originally commissioned for the penguin lives series that it did n't work out there is hardly surprising , since no book \( except , perhaps , the silent woman , malcolm s earlier book about sylvia plath and ted hughes \) has so thoroughly demonstrated the uselessness of biography in one chapter , malcolm juxtaposes the various accounts of chekhov s death that have appeared over the years , including the memoir by his wife , olga , and raymond carver s short story errand , and finds , in fictional and nonfictional treatments alike , a selfcanceling blend of hearsay , embellishment and outright invention her intent is not simply to protect her subject from the distortions of his biographers , but to point out that lives are the enemy of life the silence of the famous dead offers an enormous temptation to the selfpromoting living , she observes , but more than opportunism is at stake she is fascinated by chekhov s regard for privacy his own and , extraordinarily , that of his characters and finds in it not only an ethical but a metaphysical challenge to the books that claim to be authoritative or definitive the letters and journals we leave behind and the impressions we have made on our contemporaries are the mere husk of the kernel of our essential life when we die , the kernel is buried with us this is the horror and pity of death and the reason for the inescapable triviality of biography

war story by gwen edelman 168 pages riverhead books 2195 a train is rumbling through the endless fields of northern france at the beginning of gwen edelman s accomplished first novel , about the love affair between an aging european playwright who has seen it all and a much younger american woman , who has seen almost nothing at the end of the novel the train arrives in amsterdam where the funeral of the playwright , recently deceased , is going to be held within the short span of that journey , ms edelman traces the somber and angry recollections of the young woman , whose encounter with the older man was not simply a love affair it was a private lesson in the psychic and spiritual scars left by history it was a journey , parallel to the train trip through northern europe , into an unfathomable other time and place you silly girl , the playwright , who has several names , joseph most common , tells the woman , kitty you listen to my stories because you have none of your own kitty protests that she has lived , too , but that her family protected her from the hardships of the past they wanted , as she puts it , to start anew start anew \? he said with scorn this is the dream of a firefly , a summer moth kitty closed her eyes for a moment never mind , darling , he murmured i know better than you \( the author uses no quotation marks \) the story of joseph and kitty belongs in a sense to that large category that we could call holocaust literature , since what joseph has seen and what kitty has not was the slaughter of the european jews the truth is that from the standpoint of literature this is a crowded and challenging field what can a new writer like ms edelman say about the savage effects of the past that has not already been said by the likes of primo levi , andre schwarzbart , cynthia ozick , isaac bashevis singer , william styron and many others \? on those rare occasions when ms edelman departs from the track of her personal story , delving into more general matter about the persecution of the jews , war story loses some of the very narrowness of focus that gives it its power but mostly war story stays with its two characters , with the memories of joseph , kitty s memories of joseph s memories and the way history both feeds a certain passion and ensures the impossibility of love it is joseph and ms edelman s stark , intelligent portrait of him that gives war story its distinction kitty herself is almost a cipher in this book , a prop , a screen onto which joseph projects lust , need and cynicism we learn very little about her , only that as she rides the train to amsterdam , she has n't seen joseph for almost a decade , having moved to paris and married a french architect in the meantime she , like joseph , is jewish , and she is aware of living within the same historical terrain as he , and that partly explains her fascination with him , her addiction to his intelligence , his strength of character , his embodiment of history she asks him questions she is capable of judgment , but she is also submissive , allowing herself to be adored and mistreated by a man who is too elemental in his needs to wish for attachment too attached to those green eyes and white bottom , joseph tells her at one point and that s no good kitty wants to know what is wrong with attachment joseph is eating an egg with bread yellow strands of yoke run down his chin he is not a man attentive to the little things , like table manners during the war those with attachments made fatal mistakes , he says if you are not attached you have nothing to lose you are a free man joseph is the heart of war story , and he has a dark , intelligent heart he shows a cynical clarity , a quickness of wit , a tranquil arrogance and a jokey kind of irony that are all both seductive and horrifying the majority of this novel consists of the words that ms edelman puts in joseph s mouth , words that show him smarter than everybody else , a consummate realist and a man immunized by cruel experience against the standard appeals to sentiment or to guilt what kitty learns is that she can never have a fair share of power in her love affair with joseph because he has toughened himself to expect the worst that s the jews for you , he says at one point in his sheherezadelike days and nights with kitty could n't wait to die what s the matter \? why do n't you drink \? he asked too dark for you \? he lifted the cover of the teapot and peered in it s as black as night in there , he remarked steeped too long drink it anyway darling a little bitterness does n't hurt joseph tells a sketchy autobiography he was born in vienna but spent the war years in amsterdam , where he survived when a prostitute who loved him gave him the money to buy false papers he became a novelist and playwright celebrated in the austrian and german press as a master not since kafka is the way that reviews of his work often start he boasts of his sexual prowess , his success with women , and one believes him because there is something powerful in the brutality of joseph s vision , his repudiation of euphemism and comfort for an american woman like kitty , born long after the tragedies that were the central events of joseph s life , he stands at the opposite end of that bland american happiness after him , another man would seem like a diluted experience , a fake and that is the fierce hold that joseph also has over ms edelman s readers the accomplishment of this slim book is to have created a character who is entirely believable indeed , you feel that you have encountered someone like him yourself and yet utterly different from any other being you 've encountered , in life or in literature photo gwen edelman \( riverhead books \)
the singersongwriters bob dorough and dave frishberg , who performed together for the first major show of the jvc jazz festival at the kaye playhouse on tuesday night , make a pretty classic pair of wet and dry personalities abbott and costello , or maybe penn and teller mr dorough , 10 years the elder at 77 , lurched around the stage like a puppet with loose joints , hands and forearms swinging and flapping , and played bebop piano lumpily but enthusiastically he s all eternal youth and love for life , with a ponytail , a toothy smile and a goofy charisma mr frishberg , on the other hand , has a much smoother keyboard legato , and in his blue blazer and layer of selfprotective irony he could pass through any crowd unnoticed \( he seems like someone whose handwriting would be very small , observed the friend i 'd brought with me \) in between songs , the two men talked a bit about their long friendship as members of the new york bebop scene of the 1950 s \( mr dorough now lives in mount bethel , pa , and mr frishberg in portland , ore \) , they often played for each other at home , and their unusual talents surely rubbed off on each other but they wrote only one song together i'm hip , a wicked roasting of a downwardly mobile jazz snob who has no idea how square he really is i'm hip was one of a few songs the pair played together on tuesday the rest of the evening was split , with each performer working alone , as on their recent tandem cd , who s on first \? \( blue note emi \) i'm hip was also the only song that bore any skepticism about the jazz world which leads to the one thing these performers clearly have in common beneath all their tart or bizarre humor is bleedingheart , achingly nostalgic love for the music they grew up with , and the night was dotted with songs about , or in some cases addressed to , musicians like sidney bechet and zoot sims neither man is a particularly good singer or toplevel musician \( though mr frishberg is no slouch as a jazz pianist \) they have made careers on the force of wordplay mr dorough , in his unpolishedness , is the more shocking his delivery is totally brains over beauty , with a cornpone southern twang and weirdo vocal embellishments that verge on the annoying but his enthusiasm for songwriting and , it seems , for life has led him to such experiments as what he calls his pop art songs , which turn official prose into song lyrics he performed numbers adapted from parking and laundry tickets , as well as the five definitions of love from a dictionary he was n't merely eccentric he also played love songs that were more touching than funny , an unbearably cute topical song called health food nut and a few hoagy carmichael songs they seemed like keys to his mind if you 're looking for what in american culture led to an oddball like mr dorough , carmichael , with his mother wit , his cool and his croaky voice , might be the best answer mr frishberg s work is tighter and easier to define his segment s best songs in the literary tradition of novels like diary of a nobody were about marginal people , in gentle satires that made fun of him as much as an outside target they are controlled little pieces none , in the end , are about exactly what you think they 're about i want to be a sideman seemed like a protest against the poor conditions of the jazz world but in the end was probably about habitual selfeffacement and a new song , the hopi way , made several turns it began as a rant against the obnoxiousness of younger generations , then seemed , weirdly , to turn into praise for the ethical stolidity of the american indian , ending as an ineffectual man s cry of frustration
stanford , calif in reorienting american foreign and defense policy , the bush administration is in danger of replacing a workable china policy with an unstable and unworkable one partly as an unintended consequence , but mostly by design , the administration s actions have appeared to cast beijing as america s enemy the expanded arms sales to taiwan , rhetoric that enlarges the commitment to defend the island , the thinly disguised decision to make chinese missiles a target of revised missile defense plans , the proposed shift in defense strategy from europe to the pacific and the call for new longrange weapons to counter china s military power have come in stunning procession president bush s support for trade with china cannot by itself neutralize the antagonism that beijing leaders clearly sense mr bush s strategic policy is based on a serious internal contradiction one premise maintains that china is a rising power whose interests and objectives conflict with our own and whose ambitions require immediate and longterm containment yet the policy also presumes that china is unable to meet a forceful american challenge the first premise exaggerates the political weight of the hardliners the second miscalculates the range of beijing s options and the importance of national pride both premises ignore the positive and impressive changes in china over the past two decades beijing , it should be said , has made it easy for the administration to be tougher in its china policy the growing and dreary list of americans and others currently detained by china , its deployment of greater numbers of missiles opposite taiwan , and the vitriolic rhetoric of some of its officials and media against american global designs have conveniently made mr bush s policy shift seem more tenable the administration s policy plays into the hands of beijing s hardliners just as china s political succession begins the hardliners denounce any further appeasement of washington they oppose militarytomilitary exchanges as a plot to expose china s secrets and to intimidate by comparison their resistance to reduced military budgets and influence is legendary , and their demands for a slowdown in economic restructuring have intensified most of all , they have assailed a basic plank in china s reform platform improved and stable relations with america the bush administration , by abandoning a difficult but workable approach that has balanced discord and agreement , now risks stumbling into a selffulfilling prophecy the consequences of increased hostility between china and the united states are not hard to imagine beijing is likely to work to enhance its authority with governments that are concerned about american highhandedness it will act more aggressively to thwart american influence in the united nations and to blunt our efforts to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons current arenas of sinoamerican cooperation counterterrorism and work to fight drug trafficking and crime could wither and hopes for promoting regional stability and peace on the korean peninsula would fade none of this need happen the vast majority of americans and chinese do not regard each other as enemies , and most americans embrace a future in which the two nations respect each other and , where it counts , cooperate the bush administration s caution in moving too quickly toward a strategic partnership is sensible there will always be some degree of competition between our two countries , given the differences in our political systems and living standards moreover , we will continue to disagree over resolution of the taiwan issue yet wise leaders can manage those disagreements power and wisdom are not adversaries china is already engaged in an accelerating process of change , and only a renewed cold war could threaten that progress the revolution in communications and the globalization of ideas have reshaped many nations , and the impact on china has been profound the hardliners there know that the chinese people , not they , will chart the nation s course , though they can distort it the realists in china also know this they would work with an american government that pursued a china policy based on an informed understanding of the historic transformations now under way and on whose tide we ride together
the atlanta braves have fortified themselves with a trade they have speed , the ability to sustain rallies and a superstar playing at his best the mets have none of those things , and that was why they lost to the braves at shea stadium again yesterday , 93 , in 11 innings it was an excruciating finish for the mets the braves scored six runs after the first two hitters made out in the 11th inning they used their speed and their slugger to finish off the mets , giving a victory to steve reed , a reliever who arrived at the park in the eighth inning after being traded from cleveland in the john rocker deal on friday this rollercoaster thing we 're on , it all happened over the course of 11 innings today , mets second baseman desi relaford said up , down , up , down a little frustrating whatever ride the mets are on , it has had a lot more dips than crests for the second weekend in a row , they lost the first two games of a home series to a rival last weekend it was the yankees this time atlanta our mistakes really hurt us these last two games , said mets catcher mike piazza , who was 0 for 4 and grounded into two double plays if you give that team an opportunity to hurt you , they will but it is not only highprofile series that bring out the mets' deficiencies they have been obvious all year the mets \( 3342 \) have followed their seasonhigh fourgame winning streak with three losses in a row , by a combined score of 297 the mets tied it yesterday , 33 , when relaford homered with one out in the bottom of the ninth off the lefthander mike remlinger , whose lowkey appearance graying goatee , pants hiked up in the old style reminded no one of the huffing , snarling rocker remlinger blew the save but stayed in for the 10th darryl hamilton hit a leadoff single , and braves manager bobby cox called for reed , one of two relievers just obtained from the indians reed , a submarinethrowing righthander , got piazza to bounce to third , starting the braves' third double play rick white \( 11 \) , the mets' fifth reliever of the game , retired the first two hitters he faced in the 11th then rico brogna singled and dave martinez popped up white thought it would be caught by the shortstop , but it carried into shallow center hamilton , playing deep to guard against a double , had no chance quilvio veras was up next , and white walked him on a full count then rafael furcal chopped a ball to second relaford dived for it on the grass , snared it in the webbing of his glove and fired , off balance , to first but furcal , who is probably faster than any met , beat it out , and the goahead run scored it got much , much worse from there andruw jones hit a ball halfway up the thirdbase line , and robin ventura barehanded it jones beat ventura s throw to first , and the braves had legged out a 53 lead like the saying goes , relaford said , speed kills chipper jones came up , already having doubled and homered in the early innings off glendon rusch jones did what he so often does against the mets , stomping out their hope , this time with a tworun double two more runs scored with dicky gonzalez pitching , and kerry ligtenberg struck out the side to end it i must have done something wrong , said white , who was not really hit hard , because they made sure i paid for it with everything they could white would not have been needed had the mets gotten a big hit with a runner on base they had three home runs by relaford , alex escobar and todd zeile but were 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position lack of clutch hitting has been a chronic problem for the mets , whose biggest producer , piazza , is batting 261 with 43 runs batted in he was hitting 360 with 71 rbi after the same number of games last season few other mets have

as a longtime clinical psychologist , carolyn goodman is familiar with the concept of closure but as a mother whose son , andrew , was murdered in mississippi 37 years ago , even the glimmer of closure was delayed when she saw the obituary of cecil r price , the deputy sheriff who delivered andrew to his killers andrew goodman was a 20yearold queens college student who lived with his family on the upper west side he and michael schwerner , who grew up in pelham , ny , and james chaney of meridian , miss , were shot to death in 1964 when the three young men were taking part in freedom summer , a sometimes bloody effort to register black voters in the south their bodies were discovered near neshoba , miss , more than a month after they had disappeared of the seven men convicted for the crimes , none spent more than six years in prison the authorities are still considering murder charges against the surviving suspects , and mr price was expected to have testified against those men if nothing else , mr price s death from a skull fracture suffered in a fall in a mississippi equipment rental store delays that process i did n't have any feeling for him , dr goodman said of mr price in her strong , clear voice i was just sorry justice will be delayed today , 85 and retired , dr goodman is an elegant woman who wears gold hoop earrings and her hair in short bangs dressed this day in black slacks and a matching turtleneck , she was sitting in the rambling prewar apartment on the upper west side where she has lived for 50 years and where she raised andrew and his two brothers the apartment is filled with portraits and photographs of andrew , a darkhaired , dreamyeyed young man with bushy eyebrows and beautiful full lips all three goodman boys attended the walden school , a progressive institution that was taken over by the trevor day school trevor day has a building named for andrew goodman dr goodman has had other losses her first husband , robert goodman , an engineer and the father of her three children , died of a brain hemorrhage in 1969 her second husband , joseph eisner , died in 1992 after 20 years of marriage she has spoken publicly about her son many times and in many places , particularly in connection with her work for the andrew goodman foundation , which supports causes like civil rights and gay rights as she spoke a few days after learning of mr price s death by seeing his obituary in the newspaper , sitting in a greencarpeted room off the foyer , she was generally composed and matter of fact but her voice faltered and her eyes filled with tears when she pointed to the spot in the foyer where she had last seen her andy he was beautiful , she said he was wonderful thirtyseven years is a long time but , like the 1963 bombing of the church in birmingham , ala , in which four black girls were killed , a crime for which thomas e blanton jr was sentenced this month to four life terms , the death of the three young men in mississippi became a powerful metaphor for the anguish of that time and because the goodman and schwerner families had strong links to new york , the crime had special meaning in the city the goodmans had always embraced social causes like civil rights and opposition to mccarthyism , and they had a wide circle of friends and relatives in new york nathan and anne schwerner , mr schwerner s parents , both now dead , were native new yorkers who attended colleges in the city after their son s death , the schwerners raised money for civil rights groups like the congress of racial equality dr goodman used to keep in touch with mr chaney s mother , who still lives in mississippi , but they have not spoken recently in february , however , dr goodman went south herself for the retirement party of stanley dearman , the editor and publisher of the neshoba democrat , a local newspaper it was the first time she had set foot in the state in nearly two decades mr dearman is dr goodman s hero , because he risked his life to say in print that he knew the ku klux klan was involved in the murders of the three young men it was such an emotional moment , she said of seeing mr dearman he looked at me and started to cry i looked at him and started to cry this summer , dr goodman plans to begin writing a book about her life and her son s death she tried writing with a partner , she said , and we both agreed that i should do the book on my own drawing \( mark matcho \)
champaign , ill , oct 3 here , in a bustling college town where greyhound is often the next best thing to having your own set of wheels for getting home , news of the bus attack in tennessee early this morning left students wondering , is anything safe anymore \? that question swirled this afternoon around the campus of the university of illinois , where bartholomew sojka , 22 , sat in the student union lobby a greyhound traveler who makes the 125mile trip by bus from college to chicago at least three times a year , mr sojka said he would think twice about taking the bus again it s like you feel like you ca n't be safe anymore anywhere , mr sojka , a senior liberal arts major , said it s like you could either ride the bike , take your car or walk and even walking is getting a little dangerous mr sojka has his own car , a g20 infiniti , on campus , but he takes greyhound home because it is cheap \( 32 a round trip \) , saves miles on his car and solves the parking problem in his north side neighborhood he plans to go home in early november , he said , but i'm not taking greyhound while the authorities said the attack on the greyhound driver was not related to international terrorism , it added another layer of worry for people already concerned about traveling by air others said they had not been deterred in denver , at a downtown greyhound terminal , glenda bell , a 42yearold machine operator who is moving to st louis from seattle , said , i'm not really scared , but we just all need to be alert , watch the people around us in the south station terminal in boston this morning , christian ramirez , 20 , a student at emerson college , was waiting for a bus to michigan mr ramirez said he shrugged it off when his mother called him this morning to tell him of the tennessee incident i say , 'hey mom , it s so crazy right now , but you ca n't stop your life , ' he said others were more concerned at the denver bus station , an thonette tarin , a 50yearold day care worker from the macy indian reservation in nebraska , was on her way to san bernardino , calif , to visit her daughter and had chosen the bus over the plane out of fear i had a dream about an eagle on my back that kept biting my finger , ms tarin said , and i took that as a sign not to fly , but maybe it meant this , that i should fly loroy adams , 20 , a junior majoring in economics , said , with the whole incident on sept 11 and then with this incident now , you never know what to expect riding the bus , i will be like a little skeptical , mr adams said i may try to find a ride home with friends in a car , try to carpool or something like that the american bus association , the industry s main trade group , said fears of traveling by bus were unwarranted the bus industry carries about two million people a day , including those on package tours , charters and special school trips , michele janis , a spokeswoman for the association , said , and motor coaches are the safest form of intercity transportation , bar none ms janis said that after the sept 11 attacks in new york and at the pentagon , greyhound ridership rose 50 percent in some markets , but that it had not translated to an overall increase in bus travel the attacks have had a chilling effect on travel , she said people do n't want to leave their homes greyhound service around the country was halted throughout this morning after the incident in tennessee , and many stranded passengers expressed frustration les l thomas , 46 , of tuskegee , ala , was headed home from visiting a relative in detroit , and got as far as atlanta when bus service was halted i guess we 'll just sit here , mr thomas said that s all i know to do till they get the bus running it s too far to walk from here to tuskegee in new york , gary coles , district manager for greyhound s northeast corridor , said about 30 buses leaving the port authority terminal were affected by the shutdown , which began at 7 30 am the mood at the terminal was particularly somber because many people there are mourning the port authority police officers missing after the attack on the world trade center a sprawling memorial of flowers and flags , pictures and poems dominates the terminal s center hallway but even with news of the attack on the greyhound driver , some people said they were determined to go about life as usual i'm not at all thinking about canceling my trip , said joe arango , 44 , a bronx plumber who was scheduled to take a greyhound to manchester , nh , for a job mayor giuliani wants the american people to use the rails and buses so i feel it s my obligation it s my patriotic duty to do what i got to do but mr arango s wife , helen smitharango , said i 'd still rather a bus than a plane , but i'm not going anywhere for a long time i'm just here to see him off then i'm going back home here in champaign , mr sojka seemed just as concerned as ms smitharango we 've got to deal with it every day , he said , shaking his head in our classes , it s the topic on the quad it s the topic , at home , with our friends it s on the news and every time something like this comes up , it s the topic to talk about

in what is emerging as a clear and not particularly kind verdict on the field of new york mayoral candidates , powerful players in democratic politics including unions and elected officials have decided to hold back their endorsements in this year s primary contest they said none of the candidates had yet presented compelling reasons to take sides , and that voters seemed persistently uninterested in a contest just eight weeks away from a vote after eagerly anticipating this year as an opportunity to succeed mayor rudolph w giuliani , these elected officials and union leaders , whose support has been intensely courted by the four major democratic candidates , expressed concern about a race that they described as flat and unengaged several said they were now considering staying neutral in the primary , and waiting to see who emerges in the expected twoway runoff , which would take place on sept 25 others whose endorsements have been sought said they would not announce any decision until it appeared that voters were paying attention i 've never done anything like this before in my political life , said charles b rangel , the harlem democrat who is the dean of the new york congressional delegation he said he was leaning toward staying neutral in the primary my wife does n't believe it i just do n't think any of the candidates has really made the type of impression that would allow you to feel excited mr rangel , the irritation evident in his voice , said the democratic mayoral candidates were stuck in the mud , adding that he wished they would just do something to draw voter attention and justify their campaigns for mayor randi weingarten , the president of the new york city teachers' union , said her union was also considering sitting out the primary , and said none of the candidates had commanded the attention of her members there is not a lot of interest yet in the election , she said there are some exceptions to a trend that has clearly concerned advisers to the democrats the executive committee of district council 37 , the municipal workers union , recommended yesterday that its members support peter f vallone , the city council speaker the union s administrator , lee saunders , described mr vallone as a consistent supporter of union positions in the council , and said mr vallone deserved to be rewarded mr vallone s supporters , who had been worried about a campaign that had appeared to be adrift , seized on the decision the city comptroller , alan g hevesi , has attracted a large number of endorsements from elected officials and county leaders his advisers say the endorsements validated his credentials among different segments of voters who did not know him yet and mark green , the public advocate , has won two bigname endorsements david n dinkins , the former democratic mayor , and william j bratton , who was mr giuliani s first police commissioner democrats said they were struck by the major players who had still not endorsed in addition to teachers , the city s health care workers' union , one of the most important when it comes to getting out the vote , has been unable to come to an agreement on any candidate its influential leader , dennis rivera , is serving a 30day prison term for protesting on vieques , pr similarly , the city s police union , after meeting twice with the candidates , has yet to reach a consensus on whom , if anybody , to endorse in congress , representative jerrold nadler , a west side democrat who is thought to be particularly influential among liberal voters , has yet to take sides in the race , despite entreaties from the candidates the assembly speaker , sheldon silver , yesterday remarked on what he called the absence of voter interest in the race and said he was deferring any endorsement he was said by other democrats to be prepared to support mr hevesi and the rev al sharpton , after offering fairly encouraging words to mr green and a fourth candidate , fernando ferrer , says he will not make an endorsement until after the candidates appear at a forum he is calling in august , and perhaps not even after that this turn of events is the latest reflection on the difficult adjustment the city clearly faces with the departure of mr giuliani , a more lively public figure than any of the democratic candidates as a constant reminder of this , the democrats have routinely found that mr giuliani has frequently overshadowed them as they have tried to campaign at a time of relative prosperity and low crime , no candidate has found the issue that will allow him to break though yesterday , mr hevesi gave a speech in which he called for revolving credit loans as a way of encouraging economic development , while mr green offered up a sixpoint plan to improve procedures for awarding contracts all the candidates are stressing the same issues education first , housing second reflecting what all their pollsters are discovering in their examination of voter attitudes the difficulty is candidates' distinguishing themselves from other candidates , mr silver said they are democratic candidates who basically stand for the same democratic issues this suggests that any of the candidates would be acceptable to the union leaders and other major democrats not surprisingly , this is producing some frustration among some of the candidates in an interview yesterday , mr vallone made a point of noting that the next mayor would remember next january just who did what this summer they ca n't just hold back forever , mr vallone said the train is going to leave the station the safest thing to do is to wait , obviously , but that s not going to get you anything in the end
washington , jan 18 one of george w bush s selling points during the primary campaign last year was inclusiveness in two campaigns for governor , he and his backers argued , he had done better among blacks and other minorities than most other republicans , and he would do so in the presidential race mr bush urged his party to remember that it carried the mantle of lincoln as if in response , the republicans gave unusually prominent roles to africanamerican speakers and performers at their convention in philadelphia none of it made much difference he won only 9 percent of the black vote , tying ronald reagan for the worst showing by a republican presidential nominee in many years on saturday , africanamericans will be prominent among those protesting at mr bush s inauguration , even though he has chosen for his cabinet the first black secretary of state and a widely respected black educator ask black politicians about the appointments , and they quickly change the subject to florida , where , they assert , antiquated voting equipment and unfriendly electoral officials in minority precincts illegitimately tipped the outcome to mr bush a majority of africanamericans think that the election was stolen , said david bositis , an analyst of minority voting at the joint center for economic studies , a think tank here the bitterness that many black voters and their white allies feel toward the presidentelect was on vivid display as the senate judiciary committee pressed mr bush s choice of former senator john ashcroft as attorney general with attention centered on judge ronnie l white of the missouri supreme court , an africanamerican , and mr ashcroft s success in blocking his nomination as a federal judge , the session was supercharged with racial tension senator charles e schumer , the new york democrat , said mr ashcroft had applied a double standard , campaigning for judge white s defeat last year on grounds that he was soft on crime while voting to approve other , more liberal white judges senator alan j dixon of illinois , regarded as a moderate democrat in his home state , joined in the attack , suggesting that judge white had been vilified for mr ashcroft s selfish political ends describing mr ashcroft as racially insensitive , senator joseph r biden jr of delaware said at a committee hearing on wednesday people are suspect not because they believe you are a racist they are suspect because they believe your ideology blinds you not just to the law but to the facts as they always do , the senators cloaked the intensity of their feelings in polite legislative language but senator dixon s suggestion that mr ashcroft had derailed judge white s nomination in an effort to save his own political skin in an ultimately unsuccessful reelection campaign went well beyond the politesse usually observed by sitting senators in dealing with a former colleague so did senator edward m kennedy s redfaced suggestions that mr ashcroft had spoken treasonously , or something close to it , in arguing that citizens needed firearms to defend themselves against a potentially tyrannical central government senator arlen specter , a pennsylvania republican , said that today s session was the roughest he had sat through in more than 21 years on the committee rougher even than the notably contentious supreme court confirmation hearings for robert h bork and clarence thomas several other republicans warned the democrats to moderate their language and remain collegial in a sense , mr ashcroft has reminded africanamericans of some of the presidentelect s own missteps mr bush spoke at bob jones university in greenville , sc , during the campaign , although it had a history of forbidding interracial dating mr ashcroft , it turned out , spoke there , too mr bush refused to call for the removal of the confederate battle flag from the south carolina capitol mr ashcroft , it turned out , gave an interview to a magazine called southern partisan that avidly celebrates the confederacy in a brief time , the missourian has become the leading symbol of mr bush s difficulties with black voters he is highly likely to be confirmed , and as attorney general he will help mr bush solidify his political base but his presence at the justice department will make it very difficult for the department and the administration to establish effective communications with africanamericans other than the tiny group of black republicans no matter how many black judges mr ashcroft has voted to confirm , no matter how vocally he has decried segregation , the black community seems determined to view him as walking , talking evidence that mr bush is deaf to its interests speaking at northwestern university early this week , before he was knocked off stride by the revelation that he had fathered a child out of wedlock , jesse jackson stated the indictment ashcroft , if he gets through , will determine who is prosecuted , who is targeted , who will be judged , who will go to jail he cannot be trusted mr bush s popularity among black voters apparently sank with the attempt to use the philadelphia convention as a symbol of a new , open attitude black leaders denounced the convention as phony , and several described it as a minstrel show mayor willie brown of san francisco said that it reminded him of a national basketball association game all the people on the stage are black , and all the people in the audience are white studies by the joint center found that mr bush s favorable rating among black voters dropped from 43 percent in may 1999 , when he was pondering a run for president , to 29 percent at the end of september 2000 , when the campaign was nearing a climax the more africanamericans saw of mr bush , said mr bositis , who designed the polls , the less they liked him more fuel went onto the fire in the november imbroglio in florida , with kweisi mfume , president of the naacp , charging that there had been disproportionate purging of voter rolls and other chicanery in mainly africanamerican precincts now mr bush , about to cross the threshold of the white house , faces continuing challenges from a new black militancy to his legitimacy and his ambition to be the president of all americans , as he put it tonight
chancellor harold o levy has ordered the new york city public school system s 32 district superintendents to meet with his deputies at least four times a year to analyze reams of data about their students , schools and teachers , and outline strategies for improvement the idea is loosely based on mayor rudolph w giuliani s compstat program , in which police commanders are grilled about trends in their precincts in frequent , tense meetings at police headquarters mr giuliani has praised the program as a major reason the crime rate has dropped significantly during his administration as mr giuliani prepares to leave office , he is pressing other city agencies to adopt compstattype programs in an effort to increase efficiency and productivity more than a dozen agencies have signed on , including the department of transportation , the offtrack betting corporation and the human resources administration but to city hall s dismay , the quarterly sessions that mr levy has asked superintendents to attend starting this fall will little resemble the nowfamous compstat \( short for computer statistics \) meetings instead of an intense grilling in front of their peers , with public upbraidings for those who cannot explain negative trends in their districts , the superintendents will have more businesslike conversations with the deputy chancellor for management and policy , anthony p shorris , and the deputy chancellor for instruction , judith rizzo the mayor s office thinks the police department model is appropriate for every agency , but we do n't accept that , mr shorris said that is a paramilitary approach , not the approach of a professional services environment he added , the notion is to give the superintendents a lot of performance data , ask them to come in on a regular basis to talk about issues we see , have them take detailed notes and make sure they follow up mr shorris said the quarterly meetings would be attended by all superintendents in a given borough however , the 11 brooklyn superintendents will be split into two groups , one of which will include the staten island superintendent as at compstat meetings , the idea will be for the superintendents to compare trends and share strategies those with troubling data will have to attend private followup meetings with mr shorris and dr rizzo the data , and the superintendents' responses to it , will factor heavily into their annual evaluations , which mr levy began conducting last year the evaluation process for the school year that just ended will begin in the coming weeks weekly meetings were not realistic , mr shorris said , because unlike crime statistics , most school data does not fluctuate from week to week it is especially difficult to track the progress of the system s 11 million students on a frequent basis , he said , because the only achievement data that can be compared across the system are standardized test scores , which are reported at most twice a year geoffrey hess , mr giuliani s special adviser and the city hall official charged with helping various city agencies adopt compstatstyle programs , said that city hall was disappointed with mr levy s answer to compstat because the meetings for superintendents would not have the same pressurecooker atmosphere as those at police headquarters mr levy and his staff outlined their plan to mr hess in a meeting earlier this month we 're going to have to call it 'nostat' until we see the kind of meeting that we have recommended , mr hess said none of the other agencies are hiding from this on the grounds that they are not a paramilitary agency the board of education has long collected many kinds of data , including test scores , attendance rates and the percentage of uncertified teachers mr levy , who promised shortly after his appointment 19 months ago to make the school system more datadriven , has tried to integrate the various performance indicators to make it easier not only to identify , but to explain , trends and anomalies with the help of the consulting firm mckinsey company , mr levy has also developed new performance indicators that have not routinely been studied across the system or even at the district level the percentage of parents who meet with their child s teacher during the school year , for example , and the average number of days that a school s teachers are absent each month andrew rein , a senior policy adviser to mr levy , has just finished mapping different kinds of data geographically to make it easier for superintendents to glean trends for example , they can now look at a map showing the percentage of different immigrant groups in every school in their district , and compare it to a map showing the percentage of students at those schools failing the fourthgrade reading test other maps will be able to combine different data for example , officials can compare schools where more than 80 percent of students receive a free lunch , where more than 5 percent of students attend special education classes full time and where english is not the native language of more than 5 percent of students a total of 221 of the city s 1 , 100 public schools share all three characteristics , mr rein said the next step would be determining which schools have relatively high percentages of students passing the state reading test despite difficult circumstances those schools could then be studied to learn exactly how they are beating the odds , mr rein said you can have a richer conversation about what s going on in specific places , mr rein said helen santiago , the superintendent of district 1 on the lower east side , said that she and many colleagues already collected most data that would be the focus of the quarterly meetings but the idea of integrating many different performance indicators and analyzing them routinely with top board officials is new and potentially helpful , she said this is another level up , ms santiago said it s a more coherent approach toward helping us understand the data in a more coherent fashion at mr giuliani s urging , mr levy and his staff attended a compstat meeting in april and took notes deputy mayor anthony p coles had recommended that mr levy meet with groups of superintendents every week to question them about data and monitor their progress in several areas , from student achievement to the hiring of qualified teachers asked what she thought about mr levy s decision not to adopt a strictly compstatstyle approach , ms santiago was silent for a moment thank you , harold , she said

barbaric , sure nuts , for reasons we 'll get to but it s not global warming , world hunger or a republican coup d' tat baker has even started a nonprofit foundation that rents a warehouse in new hampshire , sheltering several thousand volumes of old newspapers , at a cost of 26 , 000 a year well , i thought , if that s how he wants to distract himself from his true calling , fine we all have our little ways but for baker , it s all the same calling what makes him such a magical novelist is the same impulse that makes him feel , turning the pages of a beautiful chicago tribune volume from 1909 , as if i 'd stumbled on a lost , jewelencrusted city in the jungle baker writes fiction much the way he does guerrilla librarianship trying to cram into it , for safekeeping , everything he ever saw , heard , thought and read like proust , nabokov and any other thinking person who s racking up highway miles on the way to the grave , baker s fixated on the subject of time how much life a single instant contains , how many instants there are , how instantly they pass away forever in his first novel , the mezzanine \( 1988 \) , he chronicled an office worker s expedition to buy shoelaces , with digressive footnotes about icecube trays , jiffy pop and the distinction between oop and oops all in the course of a lunch hour in his craziest and best book , the fermata \( 1994 \) , an office temp \( a temp got it \) can stop time and , in a quiescently frozen world , undress literally statuesque women and manhandle himself , without a second having elapsed and he s said that in his most recent novel , the everlasting story of nory \( 1998 \) , he was trying to preserve \( everlasting got it \) the 9yearoldness of his reallife daughter who must now be 12 or 13 and counting so when baker devotes a page to detailing part of what he read in a 1934 volume of the new york worldtelegram , apparently discarded by the library of congress , it s not whimsy or nostalgia , not even geewhizziness at stumbling over pieces by a j liebling \( on a violent taxi strike \) and joseph mitchell \( on emma goldman s return from exile \) it s an incantation to bring back the dead reading a paper like this is not the only way to understand the lost past life of a city , he writes , but no other way will enclose you so completely within one timestratum s universe of miscellaneous possibility that last phrase pretty well characterizes baker s whole literary enterprise no wonder he s taking this so personally the assault on paper is an assault on his sensibility baker s no leadpencil luddite he s got no problem with searchable digitexts or legible photocopies , as long as we hang on to the real books , magazines and newspapers , which in most cases remain indefinitely usable and he demolishes the arguments against doing so that libraries are running out of space , and that paper , because of its acid content , is rapidly turning to dust the first is easy what the library of congress spends in a year on microfilming would buy a storage facility the size of a home depot , which would hold a century of newsprint why is it so difficult for this great research institution to do what a successful petfood discounter manages to do year after year , without fuss \? it s the turning to dust myth that puts baker on his mettle librarians , he says , have lied to us shamelessly about the extent of paper s fragility , and they continue to lie about it their test to determine a book s brittleness , and , hence , its discardability , gives him his title in the doublefold test , you simply dogear a page and fold it back and forth to see if it breaks off different libraries use different standards two double folds and a very gentle tug doom a book at the university of maryland at the more humid university of florida , a book is brittle if it ca n't stand up to five
milwaukee , april 24 a lot of things went right for the mets tonight edgardo alfonzo had three hits , including a home run benny agbayani returned from the disabled list and had two hits jay payton , who is rousing himself from a twoweek slump , also had two hits mike piazza threw out two runners trying to steal but none of it mattered the mets lost to the milwaukee brewers , 64 , in their first game at miller park , where the home runs soar to right field when the roof is closed the brewers hit three tonight , including a mammoth shot by jeromy burnitz and the gamewinner by tyler houston houston connected off donne wall , the losing pitcher , with one on and one out in the sixth inning , snapping a 44 tie wall has not yet pitched in a mets victory rusch has , and he had thrown seven shutout innings in each of his last two starts but tonight was a fourinning , 10hit , 91pitch struggle rusch pitches to the corners of the strike zone , and when he misses , he must miss off the plate tonight , he missed over it with one on in the second , milwaukee s richie sexson drove a fastball to left , rattling the windows of a stadium restaurant burnitz came up next and crushed a changeup over the last row of bleachers in the second deck above right field the 450foot blast was the longest of the 35 homers hit in the first 10 games here if you 're going to give it up , that s the way to give it up , rusch said the home run was hit so far that the home plate umpire , hunter wendelstedt , smiled as he gave rusch a new ball i think he was probably in awe of how far the ball went , rusch said the brewers scored their first run in the second inning , when tony fernandez s chopper shorthopped third baseman joe mcewing , who was screened by the runner , geoff jenkins mcewing was upset , wincing after the play , but he redeemed himself in the third with a twoout triple alfonzo was up next , and he drilled a pitch over the wall in rightcenter for a tworun homer that gave the mets a 21 lead during batting practice , alfonzo was told the ball jumped out that way , but he said he hit the ball well after his first threehit game of the season , alfonzo was not apologizing for anything his third hit was a double , and it cut the brewers' lead to 43 in the fifth after that atbat , alfonzo briefly lifted his average above 200 for the first time since opening day but his atbat in the sixth brought more frustration payton tripled with two outs , and the brewers who led the national league in walks allowed last year and have not improved their control much walked three mets in a row to force in the tying run alfonzo came up with the bases loaded , but burnitz caught his drive in right field , ending the threat i hit that ball good enough to do some damage , alfonzo said i wish that ball dropped , but so many have been like that i 've been through that many , many times this year i have to see the ball on the ground to believe it in the bottom of the sixth , wall came in and walked jenkins two batters later , he left a fastball over the middle and houston sent it into the first row of bleachers in the second deck in right it was n't a very good pitch , wall said wall , who was acquired from san diego last winter for outfielder bubba trammell , missed much of last season with shoulder tendinitis he said he has not been bothered by the injury , but the pitching coach charlie hough said over the weekend that the mets have been cautious with wall with the loss , the mets dropped to three games under 500 , and they will start the struggling steve trachsel on wednesday and the unproven brett hinchliffe on thursday tonight s was a game they wanted badly and squandered inside pitch the mets will recall the righthander brett hinchliffe from class aaa norfolk on thursday to start in place of al leiter , who has a strained tendon and ligament in his elbow the mets wanted brian rose to make the start , but he was claimed off waivers today by the tampa bay devil rays the mets put rose on waivers last friday before they knew leiter would have to be shut down to make room for injured outfielders benny agbayani and timo perez the mets activated agbayani on tuesday but will wait until friday , at the earliest , to activate perez , who has a strained groin the mets initially thought leiter might start on saturday , but they have bumped him back to tuesday as a precaution i do n't want this to be something that lingers all summer , leiter said it s not major , but it s enough to aggravate me , and i realize rest is the only thing that will make this better robin ventura , who has a sore hamstring , did not start tuesday he was announced as a pinchhitter in the eighth but was replaced when the brewers brought in the lefthander ray king we 'll see how he is tomorrow , manager bobby valentine said he was n't good enough to start , that s for sure photos glendon rusch after giving up a tworun home run to richie sexson in the third inning last

callicoon , ny it s the same every year shortly after dusk , on the evening before the opening of deer season in pennsylvania the season usually opens the monday after thanksgiving three or four of us stuffed into a vehicle driven by chris von strasser can be found doodling around the hills of this quaint old railroad town on the upper delaware river looking for the house of stan petlan it s the one with the two milk cans painted white , someone says no , they 're lampposts along the way , we may pass a similarly loaded vehicle , also looking for stan s , driven by pete renehan or his son steve is this it \? never mind that we 've all known and hunted with stan for many years never mind that we 've been to this house often it s a hard place to find , but once we swing into the wellhidden drive \( the markers , for the record , are white fence posts \) and see the yellow glow emanating from the windows of stan s and his wife linda s enclosed porch , we all breathe a sigh of relief then we open our belts a notch for stan , who for many years owned vasata , a restaurant that specialized in czech cuisine , is the host for an annual prehunt dinner featuring roasted duck with homemade dumplings and sweetandsour cabbage over about 15 years , what began as a mere group meal has evolved into a cherished ritual , a feast during which we stop just short of chucking bones over our shoulders to the dogs the time between thanksgiving and the new year is a glorious one , fraught with deep significance for almost all people , including hunters a fair amount of eating and drinking takes place during the holidays , but i pity the cynic who has either lost sight of , or scoffs at , the value of a ritual dinner the season presents us with so much more than a mere license to eat i'm a little rusty on all the details , but the menu has become a tradition , concedes stan , who is 71 , blueeyed , and , when he grows out his beard , a dead ringer for a robust santa claus i remember one year i was thinking of making pork just for a change of scenery , and when i flew the idea by joe freda he said , 'make anything , stan , just as long as it s the duck' freda , 82 , a local real estate agent , is part of our hunting party , as are his brother dick and his son tom , now 40 we number roughly 15 , and it s a nice mix of young and old , country mice like the fredas , and city mice like von strasser and pete renehan s three kids , steve , jamie and todd some of us were born in europe , others within the proverbial stone s throw of where we congregate dick freda is an airline pilot , tony blumka has a manhattan art gallery , and greg senft is a corrections officer this year the fredas became the first family to bring a third generation to the table when 14yearold jesse , a firsttime hunter , joined us the other addition was van fuller , a coworker of greg s jesse , a blond schoolboy wrestler , and van , a stocky prison guard , knew roughly what to expect from the depths of stan s enormous , restaurantgrade oven but neither of them knew greg s tale the tale of the giant buck of the new brunswick woods i'm not sure just when the story of greg and the enormous canadian whitetailed buck became the highlight of our dinner i do n't even know why after all , between us we have dozens of vivid stories to tell of great deer and big country , many of them with happy endings still , at some point near the end of our dinner , as reliably as a 5 o'clock whistle , someone will say , so greg , tell us about that hunt , the one in new brunswick , that big buck showing a thespian flair none of us had previously detected , greg in recent years has taken to shaking his head and , in his deep , gruff voice , muttering a brief prologue that was some buck it kills me to even think about it now then he clasps his hands together on the table and calmly proceeds the ensuing story is always the same , always different it is about how greg tracked a doe and her companion buck for miles through thick , virgin new brunswick woods , catching only fleeting glimpses of the buck s magnificent antlers through the brush at long last , just as the buck was about to follow the doe out into a rare clearing , greg was positioned to have a clean shot each year , the original tracks greg finds are impressed a little deeper into the soft , dark earth each year , the doe leading the buck is a little more wary each year , the raindrops on the tines of the buck s antlers for all this happened after a hard rain glisten that much more brightly each year , as he peers through the rifle s scope , greg tries to quell his wildly beating heart by reminding himself this is what you came here for this is what you 've waited for all your life and each year , the local yokel who comes crashing and barreling through the woods in his truck , causing the buck to bolt away through the woods and ruining greg s hunt , is a little heavier , a little more fully the slob hunter i stole a glance at young jesse freda while greg told that tale this year , artfully fielding and deflecting the chorus of questions , remarks and quips that the story always elicits and i knew by the rapt look on jesse s face that he would be with us for many dinners to come that , i guess , is the happy ending that greg s tale lacks , and the element that distinguishes a ritual holiday dinner from just another good meal drawing \( glenn wolff \)
milan leonardo da vinci s last supper in the refectory of santa maria delle grazie , completed in 1498 , counts among a handful of images that divide art history into before and after yet its original glory soon fled painted in an experimental and , as it proved , highly perishable fresco technique , the work began to show marked deterioration by 1517 another half century later , giorgio vasari , author of the lives of the most eminent italian architects , painters and sculptors , considered the last supper no more than a macchia abbagliata , a phrase difficult to interpret , perhaps best rendered as a bewildering smudge in the centuries that followed , matters got worse apart from the inherent instability of leonardo s medium , the last supper suffered repeated overpainting , target practice by french soldiers in the 18th century and the bombs of the allies in the 20th yet through copies and copies of copies , its influence persisted imagine at the corner of lexington avenue and 106th street , in spanish harlem , an urban muralist has splashed a funky take of the painting across a brick wall on view through june 17 at the palazzo reale here , the exhibition genius and the passions leonardo and the last supper examines what it calls the precedents , innovations and reflections of this singular creation the exhibition is the latest of several recent blockbusters at this labyrinthine complex and like such predecessors as the soul and the face , lombardy in the 16th century from leonardo to caravaggio and verdi the man , the works , the myth , this one pursues an ambitious intellectual agenda through sprawling displays of splendors the title bears a few words of explanation by 'genius , ' i mean the genius of the art of painting itself as it reveals itself through leonardo , the show s curator , pietro c marani , said at the gallery last month at the same time , he admitted that in fact leonardo s expression of the passions in the last supper is without precedent a professor of art history , a former museum director and a widely published author his scrupulous , lavishly illustrated leonardo da vinci the complete paintings , published in english last year by harry n abrams \( 384 pages , 85 \) , summarizes the state of knowledge in its field mr marani combines the learning of a scholar with the flair of a showman in a surprise prelude of great conceptual elegance , an opening gallery presents an assortment of historical photographs of the last supper supposedly documentary in intent , many of them have been extensively retouched these pious frauds announce what will emerge as mr marani s general theme that throughout its history , the fresco has reached new generations through intermediaries intent on undoing the ravages of time at this point , the plan of the exhibition turns chronological , going back to the early 12th century let the record show that leonardo was not the first to seat his full cast of 13 on the far side of a long table , but other arrangements abound the earliest item in the catalog , a miniature on parchment , has a halfmoon table , its straight edge toward the viewer judas stands isolated in the foreground , eating a morsel actually placed in his mouth by the hand of jesus , as the 11 others look on there are round tables , neatly symbolical , with jesus at 12 o'clock , john \( as usual \) asleep beside him , and judas \( his back to the viewer \) at 6 elsewhere , at a rectangular table , jesus takes the head , judas at his right hand as the others spread out evenly around the three other sides such variations continue well beyond leonardo \( titian places the table on a diagonal \) , but from 1498 onward , leonardo s scheme is the fixed point of reference the early depictions of the last supper in miniatures , tapestries , drawings and frescoes \( some distinctly byzantine in flavor \) have one crucial quality in common all of them convey the pathos of the scene through a sort of diffuse solemnity none remotely anticipates leonardo , who through genius of portraiture and gesture dramatizes a single sharp , specific moment he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , that same shall betray me the fatal words still hang in the air the face of jesus reflects drained resignation , but around him rages a symphony of individual reactions puzzlement , suspicion , brooding , anxiety , terror , denial , the search for allies and \( most moving of all \) the stark , lonely revulsion of james major , caught in full exclamation the moment when the world first laid eyes on this tremendous image is beyond recall yet the ingenious mr marani brings us amazingly close a group of preparatory drawings gleaned from the richest collections in the world takes us deep into leonardo s imagination and technique any museum would be proud to present them as a show unto themselves , but here they occupy a dark rotunda from which we exit to face giampietrino s fullsize copy of the fresco , from about 1515 though giampietrino captures none of the aura we associate with leonardo , he gives a scrupulous \( if sometimes coarse \) inventory of what leonardo painted the view through the windows , the architecture of the room , the setting of the table the colors , in garish oils , can never have matched the more subdued palette of fresco , yet they , too , help wake us up to the effect leonardo made on his contemporaries talk about the shock of the new from here , mr marani conducts a stroll through five centuries of last suppers , past tullio lombardo s in marble , andrea da milano and alberto da lodi s in polychrome and gilded poplar wood , anthony van dyck s baroque homage to leonardo , blake s gothic reenactment , on to parodies in stills from films of luis bu uel and pier paolo pasolini , a dayglo silkscreen treatment from andy warhol , and finally daniel spoerri s folkart takes involving a copy of leonardo on a velvet rug and a dollhouse cabinet s worth of miniature tableware never mind that we sometimes derail for an irrelevant giorgione or caravaggio or degas they are worth stopping for hogarth , too , puts in a gratuitous appearance are there really formal allusions to the last supper in cockpit and columbus breaking the egg \? doubtful still , in a certain frame of mind you start to see them everywhere at the pizzeria vesuvio in vicenza , for instance , where i stopped the sunday after seeing the show in walked an extended family and took their places like born disciples of leonardo but rather than give in to this little id e fixe , i suggest viewers of genius and the passions proceed straight from the palazzo reale to santa maria delle grazie to see leonardo s magnum opus firsthand access is strictly controlled two years after the completion of a 21year restoration project , reservations are a must no one who looked in to see the last supper in the course of restoration \( or remembers it as obliterated from before \) will imagine what the conservation has accomplished the work has in one sense been very humble the fresco remains a ruin but with layer after layer of obfuscation gone , what remains of the original speaks with the force of revelation we see through a glass darkly , but we see pinin brambilla barcilon , chief conservator on the project , ranks with mr marani as the world s foremost authority on the fresco and is his coauthor of leonardo the last supper , published in english this year by the university of chicago press \( 440 pages , 95 \) the historical , aesthetic and technical analysis is exhaustive , and over 200 pages of largeformat postconservation photographs bring a masterpiece before us square inch by square inch all this for a bewildering smudge \? after ms barcilon s labors \(

no structure has been as important to cape may s revival than the emlen physick estate , a threestory residence built on washington street in 1878 the house had been abandoned and was to be demolished when a group of preservationminded residents persuaded the city to buy it in 1973 and made it the centerpiece in festivals and tours that sparked interest in new jersey victorian resort architecture last september , the midatlantic center for the arts , which coordinates tours and manages restoration and is housed in the estate , was given 97 , 651 to begin restoring the landscape michael zuckerman , director of the center , discussed the restoration and its methods q why dig up the past \? a we became interested in the grounds five years ago when we redid the oval flower bed we examined two exterior photographs , one taken in 1890 , the other from 1900 we tried to duplicate some of the plantings in the oval , and then thought about doing other areas in the estate we started with computer image enhancing to get a better idea of the plantings , and then asked an arborist to see if any were still alive on the grounds it turned out that not one of the 40 trees original trees had survived the photos show red maples , american holly and norway spruce what we have now are sycamores , cherry trees , silver maples , pears , and common juniper that grew from seedlings that grew out of bird droppings nothing that s currently here was planted by design we do n't know what happened to the original plantings , but the radar imaging and archaeological work on the grounds tells us where some of their roots were q how was radar used \? a we hired a specialist who brought in what looks like a miniature wheelbarrow he spent a day walking the wheelbarrow up and down , back and forth , sending radar signals through the earth and recording what was reflected back he used computer imaging to create charts showing cross sections of the soil that identified the root structures of many species of trees and other plantings that are no longer here , giving us an idea of where the various plantings were located we also found remnants from human construction the radar confirmed the location of a circular driveway has since disappeared beneath the ground cover it plotted exactly where there had been foundations for greenhouses that had been built around the 1900 s , and are long gone q find any bodies \? a none and no sign of captain kidd s treasure q when do you think you 'll break ground \? a not until the fall , probably after victorian week this will probably be the longest of our restoration projects we expect it to take several years before the shape of the formal garden begins to return we 've spent about 2 million restoring the physick estate since 1973 , and it s still a work in progress q what was the victorian concept of landscaping \? a in general , the victorians believed that nature was theirs to dominate and subjugate but there was also a sentimental and mystical view of nature that had nothing to do with imposing order there were some similarities in landscape philosophies with those of victorian interior d cor and architecture a notion that more is better , and a general lack of restraint involving decorative detail much more dramatic than more naturalistic styles of landscaping common today there are some people with modern tastes who think the preliminary work we 've done with the oval planting area to be absolutely hideous bill kent photo michael zuckerman says some find the victorian landscape restoration at the emlen physic estate hideous \( keith meyers the new york times \)
the members of the new york society of professional inventors last met in may , convening at the state university campus in farmingdale for a lively discussion about patent protection attendance was about double what most meetings draw , and the turnout pleased everyone , said daniel weiss , who has been president of the group since 1988 mainly because , he said , no one else wants to do it the good feeling in the room did n't last long mr weiss had to announce that june s meeting was canceled because of lack of funds next year , in fact , might be cancelled altogether right now , i'm trying to save a little money so next year we can keep the organization going , said mr weiss , a consulting engineer from massapequa frankly , the future of the society is in doubt the society was founded in 1982 by ed manuel , a technology professor at the campus of what was then the state college at farmingdale professor manuel , who has since retired , felt that inventors working without corporate support were at the mercy of their own isolation and lack of entrepreneurial experience improving their access to peer support and trustworthy professional services would spur innovation , thus benefiting the public drawing on funds made available by a federal department of energy program , he assembled a crowd of inventors for that first gathering by mailing out meeting notices to everyone who had received a recent patent from the federal government and listed a 516 or 212 area code on the patent application the state college provided a free place to meet and covered the cost of mailings the group was launched with much enthusiasm the participants agreed there was a real need for such a society inventors get preyed on by companies and individuals who are n't always ethical , mr weiss said inventors are people who want to make their dreams into reality they sometimes spend too much and get absolutely nothing it costs upward of 10 , 000 , even for lowtech products , to bring an invention to market many inventors spend huge sums and never make a dime in addition to the patent lawyer , other service providers include prototype makers , insurance agents , package designers , consulting engineers , accountants , marketing consultants , and many others often , of course , the service providers earn their fees a big part of mr weiss s job is to arrange for those with good reputations to address the society at the monthly meetings there is no payment , but the speakers hope some members will take their cards and call them when the service they provide is needed but the problem , of course , is not the honest ones before , after and sometimes during the meetings the talk is often of money misspent inventors tell bitter stories of being taken in by unscrupulous marketers , inept patent attorneys and a variety of hucksters i 've been telling people for years that you 've got to do the work yourself , mr weiss said nobody is going to sell your invention for you you 've got to make it happen , if it s going to happen heeding his own advice , mr weiss took his own shot at the inventing life in the early 1970 s , when he realized that long island s defense industry , which had employed him \( at grumman \) for years , was waning his design for a solar stove , using a reflector technology similar to that used in flashlight lenses , went into limited production and sold a few units dryly , mr weiss suggested that most of his customers might have purchased the item out of curiosity what terminated the venture and his new inventing career was the realization that purchasing adequate commercial insurance would cost far more than the product was ever likely to bring in through sales that was when i stopped inventing and became a consulting engineer , he said i did n't think i would make a living from inventing but the group s important , so i 've stayed with it the group has about 30 paidup members most hold the rights to their inventions themselves some have inventions that are the property of the companies that employ them most either have products on the market or are moving toward that goal bill cicio of massapequa park has so far spent about 10 , 000 in getting his product , a disposable paper toilet intended for women , called la femme , into production mr cicio said that earlier this summer he signed a contract to manufacture the first 10 , 000 units , and hopes the product will be available soon , via the internet and through catalogs i 've been pretty cautious in doing this , and i managed to keep costs down , said mr cicio , who is secretary of the group there are so many scams it s easy to fall into the trap of spending more money all sorts of marketing people come out of the woodwork promising you the world , and you know none of it will ever materialize pat gasparre of patchogue has invented a garden hose wrench that makes it easier for people with arthritis to attach a garden hose to a water tap or to remove it revenues , he said , are now arriving monthly and fred fink , a huntington resident , has contracted with a group that employs the disabled to manufacture his assistance kit for motorists , called the roadside message board these are dedicated people , said glenn seidman , a marketing consultant based in jericho who spoke to the group earlier this year and has since helped several with their marketing efforts everyone i talked to is serious about bringing their invention to the marketplace for the 13 years mr weiss has served as president he has tried to keep membership and meeting fees as low as possible , he said it costs 55 to join the group for the year at meetings he asks 10 of everyone who shows up , although he does n't turn away anyone who wants to come in inventors do n't have a lot of money , he said members' donations have kept the group going , supplemented by a 4 , 000 foundation grant won some years ago mr weiss is n't sure exactly when now the grant is depleted and the group s bank account wo n't cover the 850 the college now asks all community groups to pay for a year s meeting space the shortfall is not huge about 350 but unless it s bridged , the group will have no place to meet next year mr weiss said he did n't want to raise the rates for membership or meetings he did that once earlier this year , when the group s financial crunch became impossible to ignore he has since begun speaking to leaders of several other local technical service organizations , asking for help so the organization will survive exactly what kind of help , he does n't say i have no regrets , except i probably should have raised the rates earlier than i did , mr weiss said but i 'd certainly like the group to keep going and i 'd like to find someone else to be president i'm 74 years old i ca n't keep doing this forever photo daniel weiss , left , president of the new york society of professional inventors , examines frank a

there is a disquieting inevitability to that split second between the moment you know you have stepped too far into a swift current and the moment it overflows your waders you have a clear sense of having reached the tipping point , a feeling of the world slowing down as it does before a traffic crash there is nothing you can do about it except get wet recalling the experience now , as the bleak days of winter keep all but the most intrepid anglers inside , it takes on the tone of a shaggydog tale the adventure started when we drove down an old logging road to the wildest stretch of the west branch of the ausable in the adirondacks my companions were my longtime fishing partner , tom akstens of bakers mills , ny , and fritz mitchell of charlotte , vt when we arrived at the river , the air was wet with a passing rain the understory of the forest was a thicket of aspen , wildflowers and pale green caribou moss the leaves dripped with heavy summer mist , and mosquitoes feasted on all warmblooded creatures in the late golden sun , the flutter of insect wings filled the air with sparkling light isonychia , large gray mayflies , hatched in numbers even larger isonychia spinners dipped to the surface of the river because of their long white legs they are known as white gloved howdies \( socalled after old politicians who wore white gloves on their gladhanding forays \) the water was high the wading was a bear fritz , who prefers to fish rough pocket water , spotted the broad shoulders of a rising fish he directed me to the best place to cast across the complex current i leaned on my wading staff and fought my way out i cast the fish rose my fly dragged the fish went down i presented my fly again the fish rose again but , on subsequent casts , neglected to reappear funny thing , fritz , i said my experience on pocket water is that the fish are opportunist and not too picky they should keep rising to the fly they will rise at first , he replied but i find that you get one or two shots and if they do n't take , move on with that he suggested we move to the next good trout lie upstream i turned in the current and inched toward shore the river nudged me downstream when i lifted my foot , it was like stepping off a ledge as i tried to catch a foothold , i knew what was coming i did n't have enough purchase on the bottom to move backward i had to move forward at all costs i tippytoed until i was on point like a ballerina and then ran out of toe room the water lapped over the top of my waders cold wetness filled my boots at least you were n't swept downstream , tom said wet , but determined to get even with the trout , i joined my comrades for the march upstream we forded at a nonsuicidal spot and entered the water below the outlet of a feeder creek i waded gingerly into the flat water where i expected to see risers to the isonychia there were none fritz waded into the pocket water with the ease of a bison walking through tall grass he tied on a gray wulff and bam , bam , bam , bam took four nice brook trout he advised me to cast near some rocks and to pass by others every rock that he thought would yield a trout , did all lovely brookies if you are up for it , he said , the flat rock below the pool takes some wading but i know there s a nice fish there no way , i said , faintheartedly you 're doing it , he said i fought through the current , birddogging fritz s footsteps he found a spot where there was enough gravel to dig in he gave me a stimulator , a good pocket water pattern that imitates a large stonefly per his instructions , i laid out a long cast and threw an upstream mend when it hit the water the fly floated through a slick and then past the trunk of a deadfall against the far bank nothing i cast again the fly spun in the eddy just at the point where the line was going to begin to drag , a large fat rainbow slammed it and in the same motion launched itself a foot into the air tom whooped with excitement fritz , too he counseled me to edge backward to the bank and then to fight the fish as i followed downstream i declined i would beat the fish where i stood or i would lose him , but i was not going to take another dunking the rainbow proved pugnacious but compliant within minutes , i had him in my hands he was the best fish and certainly the most dramatic one of my trip being cold and wet was , at that moment , very beside the point photo fritz mitchell found himself a spot on the west branch of the ausable river in the adirondacks , where it s often difficult to keep one s footing \( tom akstens \)
san juan , pr , july 6 mario cuomo had been quiet most of the day today , sitting near the front of a crowded courtroom here , his role as a defense lawyer for robert f kennedy jr and dennis rivera , the labor leader , promising a rare glimpse of a former governor practicing law through seven hours of evidence and testimony , punctuated by a federal judge determined to keep tight rein over a band of highpowered lawyers , celebrity defendants and prominent politicians at the latest trial of protesters of the navy bombings in vieques , mr cuomo stayed silent i'm not going to allow political views , philosophical views , none of that , judge hector laffitte had warned early on but political and historical tones shadowed the day by the end , when mr cuomo rose to deliver a presentencing statement , he mesmerized the courtroom audience with characteristic eloquence but his impassioned defense failed to sway judge laffitte , who swiftly went about sentencing mr kennedy , the environmental lawyer , and mr rivera , president of new york s largest health care workers' union , to 30 days in jail each for their roles in an april protest at camp garcia , where maneuvers take place the sentences jolted the highpowered team of lawyers , including benito romano , the former united states attorney mr cuomo , in his remarks , had invoked the celebration of independence day and extolled the history of civil disobedience we ask the court to recall that our nation was conceived in the civil disobedience that preceded the revolutionary war , he said and that the acts of civil disobedience involved in the fugitive slave act of 1793 , the famous sitdown strikes of 1936 and 1937 , the valiant struggle for civil rights in the 1960 s and the movement against the vietnam war were always treated by the courts not like crimes committed for personal gain or out of pure malice but as technical violations designed to achieve a good purpose , the former new york governor said the degree of judicial punishment has always reflected that difference he and the other defense lawyers argued that because president bush recently changed policy and ordered the bombing tests stopped by 2003 , there was no longer a need to impose jail sentences that might dissuade others from demonstrating it is clear that the die is cast , in significant part because of the role of mr kennedy , mr rivera and many others who chose to participate in acts of civil disobedience , mr cuomo said because there appears now no urgent need to deter them or others from the kind of massive protests that occurred in the past , we ask that the defendants , having been found guilty of civil disobedience , be sentenced to time served the navy s bombing exercises on vieques have galvanized protesters across the country , and have attracted some of the usual suspects , as well as some unusual ones , to the small island , where they have joined puerto ricans to complain about the possible environmental effects of the tests the navy disputes reports of harmful effects after decades of bombing , the broadening uproar has spread far beyond the island s shores in the last several months , with politicians like gov george e pataki traveling to the site with the goal of persuading the bush administration to change its policy the courtroom today continued to reflect the issue s political resonance , not only with latino politicians but also with those who are wooing the increasing numbers of hispanic voters mr kennedy , an environmental lawyer and the son of robert f kennedy , who was assassinated in 1968 , is also the brotherinlaw of mr cuomo s son , andrew not only was mario cuomo defeated by mr pataki , but now andrew cuomo is seeking the democratic nomination against comptroller h carl mccall for a chance to unseat mr pataki a contingent of five members of congress , led by nydia vel zquez and gregory w meeks , both democrats of new york , attended today s trial , which also drew the rev jesse jackson and the aflcio president , john sweeney the sentences handed down today followed those imposed recently by another judge , who began meting out stiffer jail terms in may for protests on vieques among the first to be taken by surprise by longer terms were the rev al sharpton , who is still serving a 90day sentence , and three bronx politicians who just completed their terms the democratic leader roberto ramirez , city councilman adolfo carri n , and assemblyman jos rivera you have an impressive record , judge laffitte told mr kennedy , who stood impassively with mr cuomo at his side it hurts me to sentence you , but i have to promote respect for the law mr kennedy then turned , shook mr cuomo s hand and those of the other lawyers before being escorted away by united states marshals as he left , he spotted mr rivera , who was on the way to the bench to receive his own sentence , and smiled good luck , mr kennedy said see you soon , mr rivera replied in addition to the two new yorkers , six other protesters were sentenced another defendant with an ailment was placed on six months' probation like mr kennedy and mr rivera , everyone who received jail time was sentenced to 30 days , except for senator norma burgos of puerto rico judge laffitte had first announced that she would serve 40 days you 're a lawmaker , not a law breaker , judge laffitte said by way of explaining why her term was longer than those of her codefendants to one whom much is given , much is demanded your actions , if they go unpunished , will motivate others to do the same things in spanish , senator burgos made the unusual request to address the court and , when judge laffitte assented , began assailing the court for what she felt was its blind support of navy policies you 're being defiant , judge laffitte said , narrowing his eyelids and leaning into a microphone at the bench it does not behoove you to defy the court the senator continued ok , the judge said , i 'll change that sentence to 60 days some politicians criticized the judge s stern manner afterward clearly it seems this judge has a mission and is trying to send a message not just to these defendants , but to anyone who might protest later on , mr meeks said for me , this is n't necessarily about guilt or innocence , but justice in terms of sentencing it just seems too harsh mr jackson said this is a class b misdemeanor that s less than a traffic ticket the department of justice is applying a heavy hand in supporting the white house secretary of defense policy despite the sentences , mr cuomo said he had no complaints about the treatment of his clients i think they 're content that we were treated fairly , mr cuomo said as he left the courtroom referring to judge laffitte , who at the end of the trial complimented the array of lawyers , mr cuomo joked he was very nice to the lawyers look , if i was complimented like that when i was younger , i never would have gone into politics noting that vieques has become a major issue and reminded that his son , andrew , is a candidate , mr cuomo said that his son s passion about the subject exceeded his own photos robert f kennedy jr , before being sentenced for trespassing during a protest \( associated press \) \( pg b1 \) former gov mario m cuomo , a lawyer for mr kennedy \( agence francepresse \) \( pg b6 \)
lincoln , mass in a time of high anxiety , why should we add to our troubles with monsters of our own invention \? who needs this \? many parents must be asking themselves this as halloween approaches , with its peculiar mix of prepackaged horror and youthful high spirits this time around the usual seasonal highjinks could fall flat as a tasteless joke when the mention of anthrax spores or box cutters unnerves even the most wellbalanced , can nightmare visions and misshapen creatures of the night supply their reliable quota of creepy fun \? these are the questions inevitably raised by terrors and wonders monsters in contemporary art , an exhibition at the decordova museum here through jan 6 conceived in a more innocent time the show was in the process of installation on sept 11 terrors and wonders risks not only being overtaken by events but also completely devoured by them still , having been thrust into a context never imagined by its organizers may perhaps work to the show s advantage , throwing into bold relief many aspects of the monstrous that might otherwise have remained harder to detect now , more than ever , it seems important not to neglect our fears and to inspect by daylight the demons that always hide in the recesses of the mind psychologists have often suggested a therapeutic role for tales of horror , which allow us to acknowledge real fears but in a form made manageable through narrative conventions that a taste for the macabre has not been dampened by recent events is evident by glancing at the bestseller list , where black house , a tale of supernatural mayhem in rural wisconsin , written by peter straub and stephen king , holds the top spot the current context makes these things more relevant , more important , mr straub said you say , yes , the world is really like this the writing my colleagues and i do is to awaken people to the fragility of existence and the possibility of extremity having been catapulted into what mr straub calls a new psychological place , it seems only prudent to map the territory there s a lot of talk in the media about people not paying attention to things that are frivolous , said nick capasso , who along with jennifer uhrhane organized the exhibition people are doing a certain amount of inward turning , contemplation , selfexamination , and i think these are issues that dovetail with the content that monsters carry even cursory selfexamination reveals that monsters are not completely foreign to our natures but in fact mock us with their uncanny family resemblance they are funhouse mirror versions of our own bodies , just close enough to make us squirm in recognition as limbs sprout in unnatural profusion and the human blueprint combines in unpredictable ways with flora and fauna , monsters test the limits that define who we are , that distinguish the self from that which belongs to the other to possess a sense of what is normal is to posit the existence of the abnormal and be forced to ponder the possibility of slippage from one to the other monsters , said mr capasso , are those things that defy boundaries you ca n't put a box around everything , he continued it s those things that fall outside that end up getting labeled monsters they 're all the exceptions that prove the rules , and that s why they 're important the photographer rosamond purcell , who has 10 works in the exhibition , has dedicated her career to exploring these exceptions through the images she takes of real anatomical anomalies that she discovers in medical museums there is , ms purcell said , this persistence in human beings to believe that anything that is not normal , that is not an average sight something you 've never seen before is monstrous in one photograph the fragile skeleton of a baby supports a head grotesquely enlarged and opened up like a tulip blossom in another , two heads share a single torso though these are not monsters in the traditional sense but the remains of people with real congenital deformities , they remind us that many imaginary monsters are merely variants on nature s own carelessness and cruelty the title of a chapter from ms purcell s book special cases , which documents her exploration of anatomical imperfections , is too much , not enough , and in the wrong place , a phrase that neatly sums up much of the morphology of the grotesque if monsters can be fashioned from illproportioned or mismatched human parts , they can also be formed from the parts of many species or , in the case of nina levy s every little thing you do , parts borrowed liberally from both sexes the castresin sculpture depicts male and female bodies impossibly merging into a single sleek form this hybrid resembles nothing found in nature but , like most of the work in the show , it reflects a palpable psychological reality the bliss and anxiety that accompanies a union in which one risks losing one s own identity the hybrid , like the creature made monstrous through lack of correct proportion , embodies the fear of losing control or identity as form melts into incomprehensible formlessness christopher sharp s sculpture intellect and instinct is kin to all those mythical creatures like centaurs or the minotaur that are part human and part animal mr sharp s invention is a man with a stag s head and hooves , whose contortions perhaps reflect the agony of transformation ada laleian s manipulated photographic selfportraits similarly put her body through a series of close encounters with the animal kingdom worthy of ovid , an experience as liberating as it is frightening
the future of success by robert b reich 289 pp new york alfred a knopf 26 optimists and pessimists look at contemporary america and see different countries optimists are struck by the possibilities opened up by new technologies , especially the internet more options , greater bargaining power , speed of satisfaction pessimists see a society consumed by selfishness civic decline , harassed families , shortchanged children maybe , robert b reich suggests in the future of success , both views are correct and interconnected the defining feature of the internetdriven economy is the terrific deal no longer is the consumer stuck with choices defined by monopolistic companies interested more in the protection of market share than in innovation these days it s my economy whatever the want fine art , medical advice , college , airplane travel , a retirement package the consumer registers his preferences and negotiates the best offer for those who develop and market the technology that makes all this possible , life itself becomes the most terrific deal of all so long as a company that does not employ you is interested in your services , the company that does employ you will throw ever higher salaries your way service providers will pamper you with offers of personalized care there will always be private schools that want your children , brokers willing to return your phone calls and even , should you rise somewhat near the top , politicians , perhaps a president , eager to invite you in for coffee reich cannot be described as an apologist for the new economy like any economy designed for profit , this one rewards some far more than others , and that offends reich s egalitarian instincts still , he recognizes that the coach traveler crammed into an uncomfortable seat on a flight without food service might well never have been able to afford to fly had he not been able to find a cheap fare at the last minute but even if we were to accept the age of the terrific deal as a positive advance in the human condition , reich continues , we ought to be aware of the price we pay for its bounty the relentless drive to make things cheaper and more available looks great when we 're buyers , but causes extreme distress when we 're producers no matter how original your idea , no matter how many hours you devote to realizing it and no matter how unquenchable your ambition , the moment you succeed in offering a new search engine or a clever web site , someone will be right behind you working on something better once , the cycle that began with invention and ended in obsolescence took generations to play itself out now it takes weeks under conditions of hypercompetition , life is not so good after all the neweconomy entrepreneur knows no distinction between work and social life vacations are opportunities for someone else to get ahead friendships hinder the required opportunism very often , reich writes , there are only two tracks , fast or slow the emerging economy does n't offer many gradations in between the new economy , furthermore , comes equipped with its own value system , the opposite of the organization man s conformity to succeed in this new world , you have to sell yourself you go to a brandname college , not to imbibe the wisdom of its professors , but to make impressions and connections you pick a niche that can bring attention to yourself and then develop your personal public relations efforts to let the world know who you are you do n't worry about loyalty to others because , free agents all , they are not worried about loyalty to you the pessimists , then , are right about america s social condition because the optimists are right about its economy our diminished ties of community , mefirst aggressiveness and shortterm outlook on the world have the same root as our quest for ever more efficient ways of doing business once we grasp the whole picture , reich concludes , we might become a little less enthusiastic about the great deals available to us and hence more responsible to our families and friends reich , a former secretary of labor who is a professor of social and economic policy at brandeis university , writes in ways unusual for an economist he is selfeffacing , witty and more interested in exploring the world s complexities than in uncovering unvarying laws at its best , his method of linking the good with the bad displays a wonderfully ironic sensibility , as when he shows how retired public employees , who spent their careers working for the state and are thus improbably cast as rabid promoters of freemarket capitalism , live well because their pension fund is busily severing bonds between companies , employees and communities around the world still , the danger of trying to link the good and the bad is that when the links do not hold we are left with a laundry list of component arguments , none of which , standing alone , are particularly original throughout the future of success , reich touches on material already covered by others stickiness , or getting customers to stay with your product , has been well described by malcolm gladwell both virginia postrel and francis fukuyama have spelled out the social implications of the new economy \( reich cites none of these writers \) pessimists , certain that society has declined , exaggerate how good things once were , while optimists , convinced that we have reached a new era , play down the glories of the past reich , who is both an optimist and a pessimist , cannot quite make up his mind about the world we have lost on the one hand , he actually seems nostalgic for the old days of big industry factory work , he writes , was by the mid20th century no longer dangerous , and the whitecollar worker sold the organization his time , not his soul on the other hand , when reich talks about the dynamism of the new economy , he skips over the ways in which the old one undermined onceprevalent social relations call me an informationsociety skeptic , but the invention of the automobile transformed community in america more radically than the invention of the personal computer to the extent that there s an enemy , we 've seen it , and it s us , reich concludes , lapsing uncharacteristically into cliche because we want the terrific deals offered by the new economy , we share some responsibility for the selfishness rampant in the society yet maybe we do not , as he says we do , stand at the precipice of a new era if we do n't , we need n't be quite so selfflagellating the future of success is not that the price we pay will prove illusory it is instead that meaningful success will go to those to whom it has always gone ordinary people , trying to get a good deal without getting sucked into the market s vortex finding ways of balancing work and family on their own terms and learning to reconcile the innovations of the economy with the stability of timetested social institutions drawings \( andy rash \)
nassau county is falling down oh , the county government s most glaring budget gaps are being patched up , the tax rolls are being updated and the arm wrestling with union leaders over contract concessions has begun but the millions of dollars' worth of buildings it owns literally the facades it presents to the public have fallen into such disrepair that the county complex in garden city is beginning to look like a thirdworld capital county officials say there s enough money to pay janitors , painters , plumbers , carpenters and electricians and buy them the materials they need even so , the job is n't getting done new york state reimburses counties for the upkeep of state court buildings , but over the last two years it has withheld 2 million from nassau because of what david bookstaver , a spokesman for the state office of court administration , described as the county s failure to meet the standards in the contract now , the state is moving to assume direct responsibility for maintenance of its court buildings in nassau maintenance at all countyowned buildings is coming under renewed scrutiny in the last two weeks , judith a jacobs , the majority leader of the nassau county legislature , has asked the county attorney for a list of all property it owns or uses , requested that the county health department conduct periodic safety inspections of all countyowned buildings and asked for a full accounting of a countyowned warehouse at 404 peninsula boulevard in hempstead those requests were prompted by ms jacobs' april 19 visit to the hempstead building , which stores paper the county uses for copying and printing that was the worst thing i 've ever seen , she said a garage door had been eaten by rats and termites rolls of paper and boxes had been eaten by rats there was a horrible odor that we kept thinking was from a dead animal and there were stains on the rolls of paper that we thought were water stains from the roof that had caved in i was nauseated by what was there we all felt sick we were later told it was rat urine we had seen and smelled what happened with the oversight by general services to allow this building to deteriorate to this level \? she asked in a memo to william tripp , who as deputy commissioner of recreation , parks and support services is the official responsible for building maintenance asked what she believed was the cause of the maintenance problem , ms jacobs replied there s a lack of oversight and not enough employees and those who are there can do only what is humanly possible mr tripp said that although his department is budgeted for 306 fulltime employees , it has only 267 the economy has been very good and it was difficult to fill lowerpaying custodial jobs , he explained people could get higherpaying jobs in private industry but john zaher , a spokesman for the county executive s office , said the county managed to spend 472 , 000 in 2000 for temporary custodial help mr zaher said the nassau council of black clergy had been illegally operating a food pantry in space loaned by the county at one end of the hempstead building and that its food had caused the rodent problem he said all food in that section of the building was discarded and the area cleaned and fumigated he said the countyowned space at other end of the building , where the long island council of churches stores food for its food pantry , was not affected mr zaher said the cleanup crew discarded about 2 , 000 worth of ruined county material , but that the bulk of the supplies were salvageable and would continue to be stored there he also said the county was studying whether to repair or replace the leaky roof ms jacobs said her office has received complaints about the maintenance of other county buildings in the county executive building at 1 west street in garden city , ms jacobs pointed out rooms where paint and plasterboard are coming off the walls around the corner , beneath the weatherbeaten dome of the old courthouse , wires could be seen hanging down through the ceiling where tiles used to be anthony p giustino , the president of csea local 830 , which represents 11 , 000 county workers , said the department of social services building on 11th street has a history of fires and fire code violations his assistant , timothy j corr , said the air conditioning in the building housing the county clerk s office is broken four out of five days and that this condition has existed for the last three years another union official , stanley bergman , said that basic cleaning was not being done the carpets are rarely vacuumed , the bathrooms are filthy , the floors are not swept and employees are bringing in their own mops and toilet paper , he said mr tripp said electrical problems at the department of social services building are being corrected regarding conditions in the old courthouse , mr tripp said the county legislature would be asked in the next two or three months to approve the hiring of a consultant to determine the scope of the work that needs to be done there
washington , jan 23 president bush proposed a significant increase today in the federal role in public education , detailing an ambitious plan that includes requirements that states test all students in the third through eighth grades and report on their progress to the public , states and the federal government the proposal , making good on a campaign pledge to focus on education in his first legislative initiative , would also provide parents of children in failing public schools federal money to help pay tuition for private or religious schools mr bush detailed his plans in a presentation in the east room of the white house alongside his new education secretary , roderick r paige , who until a few weeks ago was superintendent of the houston schools mr bush s aides declined to put a price tag on his proposals today , saying they differed slightly from his campaign proposals , but they would clearly cost tens of billions of dollars at the heart of the plan , mr bush said , lies a single concept more accountability for schools that receive federal money , but considerable flexibility in how those schools meet the stricter standards mr bush also signaled a recognition that he may need to compromise on the most contentious element of his plan giving vouchers to parents that will allow them to remove their children from schools that persistently fail to perform parents and children who have only bad options must eventually get good options if we 're to succeed all across the country , mr bush said there are differences of opinions about what those options should be , he said , adding that he would take my opinion to the hill and let folks debate it excerpts , page a14 critics of mr bush s plan , including teachers' unions , say vouchers a word mr bush carefully avoided today would siphon money away from public schools that need the cash the most vouchers are missing from an otherwise similar education proposal introduced today by congressional democrats , led by senator joseph i lieberman of connecticut moderate republicans , in their own plan , have also stricken vouchers , an indication that mr bush may be forced to negotiate if he wants to get the main elements of his program through a congress so closely divided between the parties mr bush frequently talks about how proud he is of the improvement in the texas education system in his tenure as governor , though many of the changes there were put into motion before he took office crucial elements of today s proposals were drawn from his experience in texas but the bush plan also demonstrated how much the republican party s position has changed to conform to mr bush s initiative in 1994 , one of his party s rallying cries was the elimination of the department of education under mr bush s plan , it would become significantly more powerful , overseeing the yearly assessments of how schools and states have progressed there are parts of this we ca n't abide , said amy wilkins , a policy analyst at the education trust , a nonpartisan group that focuses particularly on improving the education of disadvantaged students but you have to say that the core of his proposal accountability is much needed , and a big change it s a serious proposal , ms wilkins said , and there is a lot to work with mr bush s plan includes the following main points states would be allowed to select and design assessments of their choosing for all students in grades three through eight , using federal money to develop the tests but the plan must be used consistently to allow yeartoyear assessments of progress and to clearly show the progress of various groups of students each school must publicly report results by race , gender , english language proficiency , disability and socioeconomic status if a school has not made adequate progress for two years , the local school district must implement corrective action and allow students to choose another public school if there is no progress after the next year , disadvantaged students within the school may use federal aid to transfer to a higher performing public or private school or receive outside tutoring in addition to conforming to state standards for reading and math , the states would also be required to set challenging content standards in history and science states would have access to money from a reading first program , and other funds could be used in preschool and head start programs states or districts could negotiate a charter option with the department of education , which would free them from some federal requirements in return for their agreeing to specific goals for increasing student performance over five years there would be economic sanctions for failing to meet those terms in a separate proposal , the details of which have not yet been released , the bush administration wants to expand education savings accounts so that parents can contribute up to 5 , 000 a year and use the money for any educationrelated expense in kindergarten through 12th grade currently the annual contribution per student is limited to 500 , and the program is intended chiefly for college savings the new proposals would effectively give wealthier parents a taxfree option for helping finance a privateschool education
ettrick , va the princeton review last week released its annual offbeat list of top colleges and universities the toughest to get into , the prettiest campus , the best for jocks , the wildest parties but if the guidebook conjured up one more category for the most polarized institution , virginia state university would stand a good chance of pocketing the title university administrators and department chairmen at this historically black university just lost a 16 million lawsuit for discrimination and retaliation against two africanborn faculty members , who complained that university officials favored american black professors , denying the plaintiffs promotions , pay raises and grants , and sabotaging their work after a reorganization this year that shrank 23 academic departments into 17 and , in the process , reduced the department chairmanships held by africanamerican professors from 13 to 5 , unsigned notes surfaced charging the administration , this time , with favoring foreign blacks over americanborn blacks the africanamerican former chairwoman of social work , jean cobbs , is accusing administrators and department chairmen of discriminating against her for being a republican in a 217 million lawsuit , dr cobbs said a department chairman once shoved her so hard that she lost her balance , and other faculty members called her a traitor to her race and returning

university s web site oliver hill , the interim chairman of the psychology department and the son of the civil rights lawyer of the same name , likens the mistrust on campus to the arabisraeli conflict i really do n't know why it got so bitter , mr hill said here , unfortunately , it got heated and personal really early , and that s what s made it so hard the university , founded in 1882 , sits along the appomattox river , about 20 miles south of richmond for most of its history , virginia state was the hub of black intellectual life in virginia it was a compulsory stop for visiting civil rights leaders , a traditionbound place where students would close each day by joining to sing the university s evening song but as segregation ended and predominantly white universities opened to minorities , black institutions have struggled to redefine their missions virginia state is trying to raise admissions standards and retool academic offerings under pressure to become more responsive to the student market , the university shut or merged academic departments that drew few majors and started tying faculty raises to performance evaluations when things happen to influence the sense of community , then people take on each other in a way , said henry drewry , the coauthor of a forthcoming book , stand and prosper private black colleges and their students nobody can say how or why such a variety of grievances and tensions has crystallized into accusations of discrimination , which have cost the state 4 million in judgments with resentment running so high , charges of prejudice at a university created to ease the debt of slavery offer a powerful weapon florence farley , the last president of the faculty council and the former chairwoman of the psychology department , was a defendant in the recent discrimination and retaliation suit brought by a chemistry professor from nigeria and an engineering professor from egypt witnesses said dr farley called one plaintiff that african trash and the other that egyptian , statements that she denies making but now dr farley is claiming discrimination , describing the university s troubles as an outgrowth of the educational apartheid in the state the latest discontent began in 1993 , when l douglas wilder , a democrat who was then the governor , had his former treasurer , eddie n moore jr , installed as president of the university it was in such poor fiscal shape that state auditors said they could not unravel its accounts mr moore , who had little experience in the academic world , is credited with straightening out the university s finances , and enlarging its endowment to 8 million from 1 million rewarding his success , legislators have increased the university s budget to nearly 76 million this year from 48 million in 1993 mr moore said the faculty members who are complaining cannot accept change the faculty council accuses the administration and the board of visitors of undermining the faculty s elected representatives by forging ties with individual professors , of barring faculty leaders from public meetings , and of retaliating against those who speak up the discontent exploded after the board voted to reorganize the university early this year dr farley and the former president of the faculty council , gerald burton , complained to gov james s gilmore iii that the board had not consulted the faculty in the reorganization , which merged a number of departments with anemic enrollments while creating five additional degree programs it also sharply reduced the chairmanships held by american blacks the faculty council asked for the board s removal in august the board fired back , dissolving the faculty council and replacing it with an interim university council consisting of professors , administrators and student government leaders returning upperclassmen said that the turbulence above had not spilled into the classrooms none could recall an instructor bringing up administrative woes in class dominique pritchett , a senior honors student from seattle , said he was glad that he came to virginia state when he did this year , mr pritchett predicted , it s going to be kind of chaotic
they are baseball s hottest and most heartening team , america s antiarods , the superstarstripped engine that could be careful , however , in characterizing the seattle mariners , who deserve a national round of applause but are no main street shop rising up against the mall we 've got a lot of people who from a character standpoint fit in , a lot of bluecollar guys , pat gillick said recently from seattle but we are not a smallmarket team i 'd call us a highend mid gillick , the mariners' executive vice president and general manager , set the team s payroll this season at 80 million , about 25 million less than that of the yankees , who begin a weekend series tonight in seattle still , in the parlance of the new york real estate market , the mariners are not exactly the equivalent of a rentstabilized apartment the mariners turned a 142 million profit last season they sell 195 seats behind the plate at safeco field and no team produces higher ratings for its local broadcasts forbes magazine estimates the mariners' value at 323 million , 11th in the major leagues and despite the perception of them as havenots following the 0 for 3 they hit when facing freeagency curveballs from randy johnson , ken griffey jr and alex rodriguez , they retooled smartly , not cheaply combining 5 million in salary with a onetime 13 million rights expenditure , they coughed up 18 million alone this year for the japanese sensation ichiro suzuki the game is not a precise game , but you try to be precise , gillick said the difference between new york and seattle is that new york can afford a mistake we ca n't so what is the moral of the mariners , who have torn through april and may and matched their geographic perch in the american league west , as rodriguez and pitchingpoor texas have sunk to the bottom \? mostly , they remind us not to embrace simplistic cures like commissioner bud selig s shot of franchise contraction across the bow of the players association , the first sure sign of impending labor war as veteran observers in seattle will tell you , the mariners just a decade ago were as much the junkyard candidate the montreal expos now are , a bad team with a worse ballpark in an uninterested market that its owners denounced as too small kansas city , as these adjustable classifications go , is a small market st louis is not baltimore is not minneapolis is somewhere between the extremist rhetoric is the mariners' middleground mantra invest in your product , and you will be supported at home make smart trades and reasonable freeagent investments , and you will make money , too maybe the most intelligent decision seattle ever made was to configure a ballpark , not a launching pad following the 1994 strike , baseball became addicted to the home run , its wonder drug , via hitterfriendly parks and most likely an enlivened ball and possibly some synthetically manufactured bodies longtime practitioners of indoor pinball , the mariners played the hand dealt by griffey and rodriguez and gradually tailored their roster to a dimensionally equitable facility this has required , gillick said , a trust in baseball nuance , nothing seattle fans were accustomed to on the telephone , he was reveling in tuesday night s victory over chicago , thanks to an eightpitch atbat by right fielder suzuki that produced a mighty threehopper up the middle , and a 945 putout that cut down the tying run at third with none out in the ninth working the pitcher and a perfect throw from the rightfield corner to the cutoff man to third are things that do n't show up in the box score that you have to believe can hold your fans' attention , gillick said in seattle s slumping dotcom economy , the mariners are drawing large crowds because they not only have a new park they have also sustained a quality club since the mid90 s the true smallrevenue teams might carry it on for a year or two , but they ca n't replace players when they lose them , gillick said something still has to be done the bargain basement twins are up the moneyed mets are down donald fehr must be basking in these surprising early season developments that include the mariners , but only to a point they ca n't be the yankees , who have brilliantly built a dynasty but can also shrug off checkbook mistakes like the cuban third baseman andy morales the mariners have spent money but within market limits , which they seem to have mastered , along with baseball s new fundamentals , defending against the free agent s hitandrun photo pat gillick \( associated press \)
on first glance , the exhibition of the early work of marc chagall at the jewish museum looks like a case of too little too soon the museum s last show of early chagall , twice as large , was only five years ago that show originated at the museum of fine arts in bern , switzerland , and surveyed the art of chagall in his 20 s \( 190717 \) , the glory years of his career it confirmed once more and in new depth that he is a major figure of early modernism and the current exhibition culminates in chagall s stunning 1920 theater murals , which were also exhibited at the guggenheim soho in 1992 in conjunction with the guggenheim s great utopia extravaganza uptown but finally none of this matters very much the new show has rewards of its own it is definitely a strange , cobbledtogether exhibition , so fragmentary that to describe its omissions as yawning gaps is an understatement only two small works on paper , for example , represent the dazzling handoverfist maturation of chagall s first stint in paris , from 1910 to 1914 , when he thrived in a circle of russian migr painters , became friends with delaunay , apollinaire and the poet blaise cendrars and let his longing for his homeland set his figures in flight over irresistible cubistic villages and towns similarly scanted are the three years just before paris , when chagall was in st petersburg getting his first taste of european modernism from artists who had been abroad , like natalya goncharova , while simultaneously finding confirmation for his own folkloric leanings but truncated as it is , marc chagall early works from russian collections adds some significant chapters or at least footnotes to chagall s amazing saga , one that combined raw talent , striving ambition and feats of survival it is drawn entirely from museums in russia , which chagall left again , for good , in 1922 excepting the murals , the nearly 60 paintings and drawings are being shown in the west for the first time these works are roughly half the chagalls remaining in russia and are themselves survivors of a sort , having been hidden away and often neglected under the soviet regime even their physical details are revealing for example , they are all in excellent condition , newly cleaned but not overly cleaned , a testament to the skills of russian conservators yet their frames are slight and even flimsy by western standards , possibly a sign of russia s straitened cultural institutions they give the show a pleasantly unassuming , uncluttered directness that is just right for its scale the exhibition is perhaps best approached as a series of pungent doses of chagall s distinctive talent appetizers , really , that lead up to the main course , the theater murals in the final gallery there are a handful of significant early paintings , like the smoldering yet austere red jew , and a wonderful selection of works on paper , especially a series of simplified , emotionpacked ink drawings of soldiers and refugees that chagall made after he returned to russia in 1914 in those four years in the west , he emerged as one of the ambitious young turks of modern art a large exhibition of his work opened in berlin at herwarth walden s prestigious gallery just days before he boarded the train to russia he returned home to marry his beloved fianc e , bella rosenfeld , already an important presence in his paris paintings he remained for eight years , held first by the outbreak of world war i and then by a brief infatuation with the russian revolution the show moves beyond chagall its opening gallery includes nine paintings , also from russian collections , by yehuda pen \( 18541937 \) , the sensitive realist painter who was chagall s first and in some ways most important teacher the pens include a crisply attentive selfportrait , a painting of a swaybacked cottage titled the house where i was born , a meticulous rendering of a clockmaker with his tools and , best , several village scenes rendered with the crystalline light and sandy tones , if not the juiciness , of corot pen was an anomaly , a jew who had earned a certificate from the imperial academy of art when most jews could not travel , live or study where they chose without hardtoacquire permits in 1897 , at the urging of patrons , he arrived in the small , thriving city of vitebsk in the pale of settlement , where chagall , then 10 , was born pen founded the first jewish art school in russia \( although today vitebsk is part of belarus \) chagall went to study with him in 1906 and acquired one of the cornerstones of his aesthetic pen s art legitimized jewish life as a worthy subject for painting , liberating his best student to interpret it through his own sorcerous imagination with the survival of artists and art objects as its theme , this show portrays chagall as empathetic and yet an egoist he responded instinctively and improvisationally to situations , absorbing what he needed but also making do and always in a completely personal , mythologizing way back in vitebsk in 1914 , cut off from the work he had made in paris , he began to paint his immediate surroundings , orbiting close to pen s realist style
if 9 11 was indeed the onset of world war iii , we have to understand what this war is about we 're not fighting to eradicate terrorism terrorism is just a tool we 're fighting to defeat an ideology religious totalitarianism world war ii and the cold war were fought to defeat secular totalitarianism nazism and communism and world war iii is a battle against religious totalitarianism , a view of the world that my faith must reign supreme and can be affirmed and held passionately only if all others are negated that s bin ladenism but unlike nazism , religious totalitarianism ca n't be fought by armies alone it has to be fought in schools , mosques , churches and synagogues , and can be defeated only with the help of imams , rabbis and priests the generals we need to fight this war are people like rabbi david hartman , from the shalom hartman institute in jerusalem what first attracted me to rabbi hartman when i reported from jerusalem was his contention that unless jews reinterpreted their faith in a way that embraced modernity , without weakening religious passion , and in a way that affirmed that god speaks multiple languages and is not exhausted by just one faith , they would have no future in the land of israel and what also impressed me was that he knew where the battlefield was he set up his own schools in israel to compete with fundamentalist jews , muslims and christians , who used their schools to preach exclusivist religious visions after recently visiting the islamic madrasa in pakistan where many taliban leaders were educated , and seeing the fundamentalist religious education the young boys there were being given , i telephoned rabbi hartman and asked how do we battle religious totalitarianism \? he answered all faiths that come out of the biblical tradition judaism , christianity and islam have the tendency to believe that they have the exclusive truth when the taliban wiped out the buddhist statues , that s what they were saying but others have said it too the opposite of religious totalitarianism is an ideology of pluralism an ideology that embraces religious diversity and the idea that my faith can be nurtured without claiming exclusive truth america is the mecca of that ideology , and that is what bin laden hates and that is why america had to be destroyed the future of the world may well be decided by how we fight this war can islam , christianity and judaism know that god speaks arabic on fridays , hebrew on saturdays and latin on sundays , and that he welcomes different human beings approaching him through their own history , out of their language and cultural heritage \? is singleminded fanaticism a necessity for passion and religious survival , or can we have a multilingual view of god a notion that god is not exhausted by just one religious path \? asked rabbi hartman many jews and christians have already argued that the answer to that question is yes , and some have gone back to their sacred texts to reinterpret their traditions to embrace modernity and pluralism , and to create space for secularism and alternative faiths others christian and jewish fundamentalists have rejected this notion , and that is what the battle is about within their faiths what is different about islam is that while there have been a few attempts at such a reformation , none have flowered or found the support of a muslim state we patronize islam , and mislead ourselves , by repeating the mantra that islam is a faith with no serious problems accepting the secular west , modernity and pluralism , and the only problem is a few bin ladens although there is a deep moral impulse in islam for justice , charity and compassion , islam has not developed a dominant religious philosophy that allows equal recognition of alternative faith communities bin laden reflects the most extreme version of that exclusivity , and he hit us in the face with it on 9 11 christianity and judaism struggled with this issue for centuries , but a similar internal struggle within islam to reexamine its texts and articulate a path for how one can accept pluralism and modernity and still be a passionate , devout muslim has not surfaced in any serious way one hopes that now that the world spotlight has been put on this issue , mainstream muslims too will realize that their future in this integrated , globalized world depends on their ability to reinterpret their past
as is usually the case with the work of a young writer , there are cavils to be leveled at sitting pretty , by a young british playwright , amy rosenthal , which is receiving its american premiere at the sol goldman ymywha of the educational alliance on east 14th street there is declamatory speechifying there is a tiedupneatly sentimental conclusion there is a character , a blocked artist , whose problems with painting and women are trumped up to the brink of clich there s a lingering question about where the central character would find the strength to act as she does but none of this ultimately detracts from ms rosenthal s promising talent , nor does it undermine the essentially winning production , by the hypothetical theater company , of her droll and sweettempered ensemble comedy the play takes selfdiscovery as its theme and applies it equally to the young and not so young , arguing that facing one s fears is the key to rescuing one s happiness its central character is nancy , an overweight 55yearold woman whose lifelong battle with timidity and depression has been galvanized into crisis by the loss of her secretarial job played by aviva jane carlin , first as a droopyeyed woman weighted down by a lifetime of sadness and later as someone delighted to learn that her limitations have been largely selfimposed , nancy lives with her younger sister , nina \( tanny mcdonald \) , a chilly art historian exasperated by her sister s immobility , nina also thrives on it her role as caretaker gives her a burden to relish and keeps the problematic matter of her own loneliness at bay she persistently rebuffs the courting of their very decent neighbor , max \( john o'creagh \) , who ministers puppyishly to the sisters' household chores the scenes in the sisters' apartment which , in an effective , mildly gloomy set by mark symczak , shares the stage with the studio of the blocked artist teem with repressed feeling the three actors are wonderfully cast ms mcdonald is trim and brittlely handsome mr o'creagh , a bigbellied man , has the kind of slackshouldered posture that only optimism can keep intermittently erect , and ms carlin s comfort in her own large frame gives her character s emergent confidence a shy pride that feels genuinely livedin individually , their representations of characters coping with a latemiddleage fear that life is unsatisfyingly slipping away are persuasively singular , and together they create an atmosphere in the tiny apartment that is genuinely dynamic as the focus of the drama , nancy is the bestwritten character in the play her sense of herself is acute , and particularly in ms carlin s warmly deadpan performance , it makes her deeply appealing her life is transformed when she takes a job as a model for a class in life drawing , which is taught by an artist named philip , a rueful lothario \( mark jacoby \) whose habit of bedding his models and students is offered as the manifestation of his own insecurity as a painter it is nancy who eventually becomes his personal inspiration to resume work , and his subject and though it s a little hard to accept , given what we know about her , that she could actually motivate herself to answer a helpwanted ad , much less be persuaded , rather easily , to undress in front of a roomful of strangers , ms carlin makes suspension of disbelief possible in a lovely scene a slowmotion montage , tastefully staged by the director , amy feinberg , that closes the first act she blossoms as she undresses and assumes a variety of steadily more relaxed poses later , when she tells zelda , the childish and lovelorn 20yearold who was philip s previous model and his girlfriend , i'm not anyone s muse , she adds the explanation , with nancy s newfound delight in selfacceptance , that cements our sympathy for her look at me , for heaven s sake ! i just sit here like a big bag of marshmallows the scenes in the art class testify to ms rosenthal s ambition as a writer , and also to her inexperience she has created a pleasantly eccentric student menagerie , but aside from another of philip s spurned lovers , a spoiled and pretty woman in a bad marriage \( dannah chaifetz \) , they are n't given enough to do and ms feinberg has n't solved the problem of their standing around stiffly during the second act s many long speeches about the relationship of art and life and the virtues of actively pursuing one or the other or both the play ends more or less happily and more or less predictably , with all the characters getting their just desserts neither art nor life is quite so tidy , but sitting pretty earns some latitude from a young and talented writer , such optimism is understandable , forgivable and even cheering sitting pretty written by amy rosenthal directed by amy feinberg sets by mark symczak costumes by melissa schlachtmeyer lighting by rych curtiss sound designer tim cramer dialect coach , amy stoller production stage manager , kimberly palomo technical director , bill mitchell presented by the hypothetical theater company inc , amy feinberg , producing artistic director at the sol goldman y , 344 east 14th street , east village with lina roessler jo haney \( zelda \) aviva jane carlin \( nancy \) tanny mcdonald nora brown \( nina \) john o'creagh \( max \) , mark jacoby \( philip \) , dannah chaifetz \( josie \) and marilyn bernard \( sylvia \) photo from left , mark jacoby , aviva jane carlin , lina roessler and marilyn bernard in sitting pretty by the hypothetical theater company \( jonathan slaff sitting pretty \)
he is an eisenhowerera conservative who mocked vietnam war protesters and twice voted for mayor rudolph w giuliani he is a multimillionaire who wears monogrammed shirts with french cuffs and tie pins , and controls one of manhattan s largest commercial real estate empires he just bought a sprawling condominium at the trump world tower , the latest symbol of establishment new york in short , he is just about the last guy who might be expected to end up a chief strategist and fundraiser behind the mayoral campaign of mark green , the leftleaning democrat who has made a career challenging the system but this real estate executive is stephen l green and the onetime vietnam protester , now mayoral candidate , is his brother the brothers have forged a powerful , unlikely alliance to promote the campaign of mark green , the city s public advocate the older brother , a taciturn , cautious capitalist , has rounded up hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from business associates and friends for the younger one , a hyperactive politician who began his career at ralph nader s side stephen green , 63 , makes a point of talking daily to his brother or his staff about the campaign , and he helped recruit a team of bluechip corporate executives to advise his 56yearold brother their partnership , though , for all it brings mark green , also carries with it complications , given that the elder green has significant business dealings with the city and the younger one is campaigning for its highest office the city pays stephen green s company , sl green realty corp , more than 10 million a year in rent 4 percent of the company s annual rent revenue to house several agencies , including the department of correction and the city university of new york stephen green s son and the mayoral candidate s nephew , gary green , also benefits from the arrangement two companies he runs provide building security and custodial services at the office buildings the city rents sl green has so many enterprises related to the city government that it retains its own lobbyist , who has repeatedly interceded with top city officials to renegotiate leases or seek approvals for renovation projects it routinely files appeals with the department of finance challenging tax assessments on its buildings it has dozens of code violations pending before the department of buildings one city pension fund even owns a small amount of sl green s stock , but that holding is tiny compared with the 10 percent of all shares owned personally by stephen green \( that alone makes him worth at least 65 million based on the company s current trading value \) gene russianoff , a senior lawyer at the new york public interest research group , said no one would expect stephen green to leave town if his brother were elected mayor there is clearly an appearance issue here , mr russianoff said the sole brother of a potential mayor has millions of dollars of dealings with the city no matter how much any decision involving his brother is or is n't on the merits , if mark is elected mayor , there is always going to be a cloud the mayoral candidate and his brother in their first joint interview on the subject insisted that there had not been and there would not be a problem they said they had written a statement detailing how mark green would handle such matters they said he would ask the corporation counsel to develop a process that tried to ensure that sl green was not shown any favoritism and then would seek a review from the conflict of interest board to make sure the process was adequate i will have no say in any commercial dealing with sl green , said mark green , adding that he and his wife did not own stock in it still , the careers and family lives of these two brothers they have no other siblings and their parents are dead are intertwined everywhere from regular family dinners they share to their individual office space as they sit together , the resemblance between the two is striking both have stark silver hair , lean tan faces and bright blue eyes as the candidate watched nervously , jiggling his leg under the desk , the developer took control of the joint interview when mark green told stephen that he should not answer a question about whether he would vote for the republican candidate if his brother were knocked out of the race do n't answer this you are not answering this , mark said stephen brushed him off under no conditions , he said , would he vote for michael r bloomberg \( he made no mention of herman badillo , the other republican candidate \) at another moment , as mark started to answer a question that stephen wanted to field , the older brother held up his hand to mark s face and admonished him , let me say it , i mean , if you want me to be here mark green s campaign headquarters and his brother s business headquarters are in the same place the graybar building , the towering jazz age temple overlooking grand central terminal
dublin why did the peace processes in northern ireland and the middle east grind to a halt at the same time \? the short answer is that both negotiations had reached the moment of truth the moment where you could not solve the civil war between the parties without a civil war within the parties the easy tradeoffs had all been made in both cases , and the only way a final settlement could be achieved was if yasir arafat crushed the hamas suicide bombers , if israel uprooted the extremist settlers , if gerry adams , the sinn feinira leader , wiped out his rejectionists , known as the real ira , and if the protestant leader david trimble smashed those unionists opposed to ever severing ties with britain the purpose of the camp david talks was to make the civil wars that would have to be fought among israelis and palestinians , in order to get a deal between them , as small as possible prime minister ehud barak proposed that israel retain 5 percent of the west bank , on which about 80 percent of the jewish settlers lived , so they would not have to be evicted in return , mr arafat would be compensated with land from israel , and with some palestinian refugees returning to israel and all others receiving financial compensation yitzhak rabin knew that the jewish settlers , if not rolled back , ultimately posed a risk to the entire zionist enterprise much more than the plo because if the extremist settlers got their way , and israel kept the west bank and gaza , israel would become either an undemocratic apartheid state , with a jewish minority ruling over an arab majority , or a nonjewish state but mr rabin s murder was a warning that any final deal that uprooted settlers would require a civil war within mr barak tried to finesse that with his proposal for annexing 80 percent of the settlers mr arafat , fearing assassination , would n't even go that far he showed himself at camp david , and after , as a man who would rather get nothing for his people than look them in the eye and say , we 're going to get some things and not others while mr barak was ready for a small civil war , mr arafat was n't ready for one at all last week s bridging proposals put out by the british and irish governments were the northern irish version of camp david that is , they were a more generous series of trade offs designed to overcome all the problems that had stalled the 1998 good friday peace deal including proposals that the ira finally disarm in exchange for deeper cuts in british troops and more reforms to the proprotestant police like camp david , these tradeoffs were aimed at shrinking the number of hardliners who would oppose a deal , so the inevitable civil wars within the ira and unionist camps , with the last rejectionists , could be as small as possible the ira gave a positive response yesterday to the package , while the real ira set off a bomb in london last week , signaling what could be the start of their civil war within if there is a reason to be more optimistic about northern ireland than the middle east , it s because of the surrounding states the european union has pumped millions of dollars of investment and infrastructure into ireland , creating jobs , prosperity and a wider political identity for young people to link up with which has produced solid catholic and protestant majorities for peace in the middle east , by contrast , the hinterland has fueled the conflict because virtually all the arab leaders are illegitimate , none of them have the selfconfidence to tell mr arafat to compromise or give him cover and while israel reaped economic benefits from oslo , palestinian corruption and israeli shortsightedness ensured that the palestinian people reaped little clearly , both these conflicts need outside pressure to make progress because the parties find imposing civil wars on themselves too difficult why \? because the extremist minorities in all these parties have a strong emotional hold over the moderate majorities , and to kill your own you have to believe strongly in peace with the other guy which is not fully there in northern ireland or the mideast so they each need to say that an outside power forced them to act in northern ireland , that pressure was brought by dublin and london , which just got fed up with the war in the middle east , though , no outside power for now cares enough to pay the domestic political costs of imposing a deal
the bay of angels by anita brookner 200 pp new york random house 2395 anita brookner s famously depressed oeuvre , now in its 20th iteration with the bay of angels , harks back to a time before prozac and its pharmaceutical cousinry were common household expedients imagine , just for a moment , what would happen if brookner s anomiebedeviled heroines could only get the therapy they are clearly in need of the whole oeuvre itself might lift and disappear like the fog that hung over so much of their native london in the 19th century but in giving brookner s novels over to the cure of antidepressants we would be missing a great deal we would be missing the immense pleasure of watching her set up moral problems and work at them with her own particular genius of observation we would be missing the chance to see her put big questions \( like does free will exist \? \) into deceptively small frames and we would be missing the pleasure of submitting to the fine instrument of brookner s prose , wittily laying claim to literary territory \( the habitat of the modest heroine \) long abandoned by most of her peers despite these remarkable virtues , many early admirers have come to feel , as her novels appear punctually year by year , that brookner is writing the same book over and over again at first glance , the bay of angels seems to lend support to this view , since it worries at a subject she has dealt with extensively from the very beginning of her career as a writer of fiction the hazards of confusing literature with life brookner s first novel , appropriately titled the debut , opens with the declaration that dr weiss , at 40 , knew that her life had been ruined by literature among the baleful influences brookner cites are david copperfield , little dorrit and cinderella the first lines of the bay of angels echo those of the debut to a surprising degree i read 'the blue fairy book , ' 'the yellow fairy book' and the stories of hans andersen none of this was groundwork for success in worldly terms a few pages later , david copperfield and his creator are cited once again as responsible parties in the narrator s faulty education so we are left with a baffling question why would a writer of brookner s sophistication and intelligence repeat herself in this obvious fashion \? are we dealing with some sort of obsessive compulsion to revisit past traumas , a wound that never heals \? or should we read brookner s novels in the same way we listen to bach , recognizing that repetition is simply part of invention itself , a restating of themes so that variations may be explored \? there are arguments to be made for both interpretations , though it is perhaps a mistake to see them as mutually exclusive the beginning of the bay of angels \( as well as other themes and details in the novel that will be very familiar to brookner s regular readers \) certainly suggests that she is recycling the same material but brookner is in fact shifting , in subtle and highly interesting ways , the terms of the dilemmas she habitually sets forth and dramatizes the debut begins with the proposition that virtue will ultimately be rewarded in life , as it so often is in the novels of dickens , and looks at the consequences that unfold as this proposition is challenged by experience but the bay of angels is up to something different the lesson its heroine , zo cunningham , draws from her reading is that i need make no decisions on my own behalf , for destiny or fate would always have had the matter in hand there were no stratagems to be undertaken one had simply to exist , in a state of dreamy indirection , for the plot to work itself out when we learn that zo lives with her widowed mother , anne , we suspect that we are about to meet another of brookner s selfabsorbed monsters , women who annex and then devour their young but here too brookner has changed the terms anne , though needy , passive and almost certainly depressed , makes an attempt to set her daughter free when she allows herself to be wafted away to a putative happy ending in the south of france by a deus ex machina named simon gould my mother s fate having been settled according to the archaic principles of natural justice , zo remarks , i was now free to cast off on my own the uses zo makes of her freedom a flat of her own and an unhappy affair of a distinctly 60 s stripe leave her feeling more confined than ever , but it is her own timid nature that imprisons her , rather than fealty to her parent she selfishly wishes to believe that her mother has found happiness , but simon s sudden death reveals a more complicated story my mother s afternoon escapes from the house that she could not quite consider her own were an indication that loneliness can be felt even in the most ideal of circumstances , zo observes brookner gives another twist to the question of what it means to enjoy freedom when zo s mother collapses into a grave but mysterious illness , leaving her daughter to ponder the possibility of returning to a life confined to the bell jar of her parent s helplessness and passivity we should keep each other company , as if this had always been intended , she imagines no word of love , other than our own , would be there to lend support our fate seemed ineluctable this possibility is removed by another twist in the plot , but while zo is freed from a life fettered to her mother s needs , she is left profoundly alone in the world freedom from attachment , the novel suggests , is no freedom at all the bay of angels finishes on a rather uncharacteristic , almost hopeful , note zo does find an attachment of sorts , though it is one whose limitations might seem daunting to someone less schooled in privation brookner comes as close to providing a happy ending as she can , given that she is a writer dedicated to making the point that happy endings are for fairy tales and not for life an important part of zo s moral education life s correction to literature s faulty lessons lies in realizing that there is no proper ending in human affections until time provides an ending to which all must submit if the heroine of the bay of angels has found a fulfillment of sorts , it is because she has come to recognize that happiness is possible only when its limitations are fully recognized and accepted with this caveat , free will finds its proper exercise
trenton , march 27 a former aide to peter g verniero told a legislative committee today that he gave mr verniero data that he thought should be passed along to federal civil rights investigators who were examining racial profiling by the new jersey state police the former aide , alexander p waugh jr , now a superior court judge , testified that when mr verniero was state attorney general , he gave him a memo dated july 29 , 1997 , with documents including findings from one state police station that blacks and hispanics accounted for nearly twothirds of the drivers searched by troopers when he later asked mr verniero about the report , judge waugh said , the attorney general said to me , 'i do n't know' or 'i have n't read it yet , ' and then i lost track mr verniero , now a state supreme court justice , is the central character at the hearings and is scheduled to testify for a full day wednesday judge waugh was the latest in a series of witnesses who have told the state senate judiciary committee that mr verniero was given documents that should have alerted him to discriminatory practices by state troopers the committee is trying to determine whether he knew about such evidence before he acknowledged in april 1999 that profiling was real , not imagined at the time , mr verniero had just been nominated to the supreme court and , after brushing aside legal challenges and public complaints for two years , was suddenly answering growing criticism of his office he was also under increasing pressure from the justice department he has maintained , both in testimony two years ago and in a 79page statement released yesterday , that he was given only sketchy statistics from the state police and believed assurances that racial profiling was not a problem the same committee questioned mr verniero in earlier hearings on racial profiling in april 1999 , and again two weeks later , during his court confirmation hearings on those occasions , the senators asked mr verniero what he knew about evidence of profiling now the committee also wants to know whether mr verniero answered truthfully when he said the issue crystallized in my mind only in the spring of 1998 , when the shooting of three black and hispanic men during a stop on the new jersey turnpike drew national attention tonight , another former aide , first assistant attorney general paul zoubek , testified that when they were preparing for the april 1999 hearings , mr verniero told him that he had only recently seen the damaging information from the state police mr zoubek acknowledged that the state s investigation of troopers' conduct all but collapsed when mr verniero was confirmed by the senate and mr zoubek stepped in as acting attorney general he said shutting it down was his own decision in his testimony earlier , judge waugh repeatedly voiced misgivings about his own inattention as he described documents ignored , edited or lost as the attorney general sought to avoid a court challenge from the justice department at the time , judge waugh was in charge of answering the department s requests this situation is a public official s worst nightmare , he said in hindsight , you see things that should have been done differently and i wish i had done them differently the committee also heard today that the attorney general s office did not give the defense requested data on traffic stops during the longrunning case in which a trial court found a de facto policy of profiling william h buckman , a defense lawyer in the socalled soto litigation in gloucester county , testified that he asked prosecutors to produce any documents favorable to the defense , as they are constitutionally required to do , but received none of the reports on highway stops and searches that were later found mr buckman said he was told by the deputy attorney general handling the case , john m fahy , that the information was not relevant or was too burdensome to obtain the judge in the soto litigation ruled in 1996 that the prosecution s evidence obtained in searches of the defendants' cars was tainted by the conduct of the state police in traffic stops on the turnpike the state brought an appeal before mr verniero took office he continued to defend the police until 1999 , when the appeal was withdrawn judge waugh , who was the first executive assistant attorney general , left the office in january 1998 , about a year and a half after the justice department inquiry began he said that after top aides discussed the department s request for documents with mr verniero in late 1996 , if i got a document i thought he should see , i would send it to him like the two deputy attorneys general who testified last week that they received and passed along information from the state police , judge waugh said the attorney general understood the importance of the data showing that minority drivers were much more likely than whites to have their cars searched
chicago , march 7 faced with questions about the finances of his nonprofit organizations , the rev jesse jackson this week released for the first time detailed information about expenses and salaries paid by the groups and said today that he would file an amended tax return to reflect money paid to a staff member with whom he had an extramarital affair the name of the woman , karin l stanford , was omitted along with the names of other staff members in the 1999 tax return filed by the citizenship education fund , one of mr jackson s four interconnected groups mr jackson and his accountant called the omissions inadvertent in an interview today , mr jackson said the 102page audit conducted by the organizations' chief financial officer , billy r owens , showed the finances reflect discipline and diligence , integrity and accountability he added , there is no evidence , none , of illegality or impropriety the audit , first published by the chicago tribune on tuesday , also showed that mr jackson earned 120 , 000 a year , as well as 5 , 000 a week as host of a cable television talk show and unspecified speaking fees it indicated that his groups raised 17 million last year ever since the national enquirer reported in january that mr jackson had had a child with ms stanford , conservative groups and other political opponents have raised questions about the financial practices of mr jackson s organizations in the 1999 return , the citizenship education fund listed none when asked to name the top five staff members making more than 50 , 000 a year one of those would have been ms stanford , who was executive director of the group until she resigned in 1999 , when she gave birth to a daughter fathered by mr jackson john scanlon , a spokesman for mr jackson , said ms stanford s salary was 120 , 000 , but it was not clear if she was paid the full amount , since she left in the middle of the year mr owens said today that the group would file an amended return including ms stanford s name and those of other staff members henry creel , the accountant who prepared the returns , said he had omitted ms stanford s name because she had already left the group and thus was not a staff member at the time officials of the rainbow push coalition , another of the groups , said ms stanford had received a 35 , 000 severance package mr owens said that included 15 , 000 in moving expenses from washington to los angeles and 20 , 000 for consulting work she was hired to do on a study about broadband telecommunications that disclosure has prompted further questions and articles in local newspapers about the finances of mr jackson s groups last month , the chicago suntimes reported that mr jackson , whose wall street project lobbies corporations to provide opportunities for innercity and minority businesses , had tempered his opposition to corporate mergers after the merging companies donated to his groups or contracted with minorityowned businesses run , in some cases , by friends or acquaintances among the mergers the newspaper said mr jackson initially opposed was one between the gte corporation and bell atlantic , now the verizon corporation the documents released this week disclosed 1999 grants or pledges to mr jackson s groups by seven companies , including 375 , 000 from bell atlantic and 625 , 000 from gte a conservative watchdog group , the national legal and policy center , has filed a complaint with the internal revenue service , making similar accusations that mr jackson backs off threatened boycotts of companies after those companies donate money to his groups mr jackson said today that the suggestion he pressured companies to contract with certain businesses or donate to his groups was a perverse idea from an unclear mind his groups might offer companies lists of minority businesses in which to invest , he said , but the companies compile their own lists and conduct their own due diligence before choosing mr jackson said that grants and pledges by corporations involved in mergers were in exchange for research or conferences his groups held to help broaden their understanding of and contacts with minorityrun businesses the audit showed that of 13 million the groups spent on travel last year , more than 450 , 000 was paid for by democratic committees sponsoring getoutthevote campaigns another 13 million was paid in consulting fees mr owens said most of that represented administrative work by rainbow push for the other groups about 429 , 000 was paid to outside consultants
it took just four to six days after exposure for the first symptoms to appear , usually a mild to moderate fever , drenching sweats and overwhelming fatigue and once the disease took hold , death , if it occurred , came a day or two later the disease was inhalation anthrax , and the 10 patients were among the earliest victims of the nation s first experience with bioterrorism yesterday , the centers for disease control and prevention published the clinical details of these patients , painting a grim narrative of a rare disease but offering few clues to investigators trying to trace the source of the spores or their distribution six of the 10 lived , a much better survival rate than has been reported in the medical literature , which says that inhaled anthrax kills more than 85 percent of its victims in a teleconference yesterday , dr bradley perkins , an anthrax expert at the centers , attributed the outcomes to aggressive treatments with antibiotics , drugs to maintain blood pressure , ventilators to aid breathing , and draining fluid that accumulates in the chest , compressing patients' lungs in interviews yesterday , infectious disease experts said they were fascinated by the cases avidly reading about them in a new paper , published online in the centers' journal , emerging infectious diseases , they are searching for clinical and laboratory signs and symptoms that might help them recognize inhalation anthrax and distinguish its early stages from winter colds and flu dr marguerite neill , an infectious disease expert at brown university , says the case histories tell stories that tables of laboratory tests and reproductions of chest xrays cannot they give you a feeling for the tempo of the disease , she said these specialists looked for risk factors , and characteristics of those who got sick they noticed that the median age of the 10 patients was 56 and that six had a chronic illness cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , diabetes or asthma but , to the doctors' surprise , none was a smoker that suggests that smoking is not a risk factor for this disease , said dr martin blaser , an infectiousdisease expert at new york university school of medicine i had assumed it would be they tried to find something to distinguish those who died from those who survived the cdc reported that the survivors got antibiotics early but dr craig e smith , the army s chief infectious disease specialist during the war in the persian gulf , said the laboratory tests indicated that those who died actually had more normal values in tests of blood counts and of liver and kidney function than the survivors the cases also show what anthrax can look like , what it can feel like and what really happened to those 10 people who make up the statistics written in dry medical prose , each case tells a terrifying story of an almost unheardof disease that took everyone by surprise dr smith , who is now at the phoebe putney memorial hospital in albany , ga , said he could almost imagine what the patients were thinking , especially as the nation realized that bioterroism had arrived in america i'm sure every one of them went though a sense of 'oh , my god is this real or is this just a winter cold \? ' he said then , as treatment was delayed because the patients or their doctors were slow to recognize the illness , patients may have realized too late that you 're just counting down toward the end of your life the longer you wait for care case 1 set the stage robert stevens , a 63yearold photo editor in florida , became ill on sept 27 , complaining of malaise , fatigue , fever , chills , lack of appetite and sweats on oct 2 , he woke up early , nauseated , vomiting and confused he was taken to a local emergency room where , the cdc paper reports , he was not oriented to person , place or time doctors there decided he had meningitis and gave him a collection of antibiotics , but his disease was on a downhill course he had seizures and was put on a respirator , but died three days later , on oct 5 case 3 astonished doctors once again , because no one thought that postal workers were at risk of inhalation anthrax a 56yearold mail sorter in washington , whose name the cdc did not release , became ill on oct 16 , with a lowgrade fever , chills , headache , malaise and a sore throat one of only two with that last symptom each day he got sicker , with a dry cough , night sweats , nausea and vomiting , shortness of breath on oct 19 , when he went to the hospital , his heart was racing at 110 beats a minute and his chest xray showed that his mediastinum the area in the middle of his chest was enlarged , a typical sign of inhalation anthrax anthrax bacteria were in his blood the man received three antibiotics ciproflxacin , rifampin and clindamycin in the teleconference , dr perkins said rifampin might be particularly useful , since it blocks protein synthesis and so might stop anthrax bacteria from producing their deadly toxin patient 3 survived , but did not have an easy course three times , doctors drained bloody fluid from his chest he remains hospitalized in stable condition , the cdc said the final case , kathy t nguyen of the bronx , is the final surprise , the one person who was neither a member of the news media or a postal worker she was a stockroom worker at the manhattan eye , ear and throat hospital and no one knows how or when she became infected no one has found spores at her home , her work or her clothing ms nguyen was admitted to the hospital on oct 28 , and initially diagnosed with congestive heart failure then doctors decided she had atypical pneumonia but as she worsened and was moved to the intensive care unit , doctors saw her chest xray was typical of inhalation anthrax they tried everything that was thought to help antibiotics , including rifampin and cipro , draining excess fluid from her chest but by then nothing could save her she died on oct 31
the illumination of manuscripts is not a robust profession today , but in the time of the french artist jean poyet \( circa 14451503 \) , a good hand could earn his bread at it and eat cake , too handlettered and illustrated prayer books particularly those called books of hours , containing appropriate devotions for seasonal , monthly and daily as well as hourly recital were runaway best sellers in the christian world , surpassing even the bible , from the mid13th to the mid15th centuries a fine book of hours would have a text , religious illustrations like the passion of christ or the lives of saints done in rich colors embellished with gold , and borders for the illustrations containing floral , vegetal , animal and even pictorial motifs these sumptuous books were used not only for prayer but also as calendars , recorders of genealogies and primers for children and they were handed down from generation to generation the most dazzling were made for royalty and the very rich , who could afford to pay for the talents of a worldclass illuminator poyet , who plied his craft in tours , was certainly one of those , perhaps the greatest of his generation in france but his reputation suffered a steep decline over the centuries , and the morgan library s new show , jean poyet artist to the court of renaissance france , is devoted to helping reestablish it organized by roger s wieck , curator of medieval and renaissance manuscripts at the library , it is a beautiful and wellorganized presentation that situates poyet whose authorship of these works remains circumstantial , but convincingly so in the context of his era and lucidly explores his art historical significance as it happens , the morgan owns the world s biggest cache of manuscripts illuminated by poyet , including a superb tiny prayer book created for anne de bretagne and the hours of henry viii , a more enterprising endeavor once supposed to have belonged to that english king the show is not only the first devoted to poyet but , even more momentous , the first show in the united states devoted solely to a manuscript illuminator the catch here , however , is that the only documented work of art linked directly to the name poyet is one battered leaf , owned by the philadelphia free library and exhibited in the show it is apparently the only surviving relic from a small book of hours commissioned by anne de bretagne , queen of france under both charles viii and louis xii a 1497 payment slip she made out to poyet covers the entire book , which consisted of 23 miniatures , 271 borders and 1 , 500 line endings , small decorations that fill out short lines in the text since none of his work is signed , a customary omission in poyet s day , attributions to him aside from the evidence offered by this document are based mainly on stylistic indications but mr wieck is betting his bottom dollar that the work in the morgan show attributed to poyet is indeed his poyet , who did work for the courts of three successive french kings , louis xi , charles viii and louis xii , had only two contemporary rivals , jean bourdichon \( 14571521 \) , a fellow toursman who outlived him by nearly 20 years , and an artist today known only as the master of anne de bretagne \( active around 14801510 \) celebrated in his lifetime and admired for a few generations thereafter , poyet was ranked by various appreciators with giants like the flemish painter rogier van der weyden \( circa 13991464 \) and the german hans baldung grien \( circa 14841545 \) but then he dropped from sight in the late 19th century , however , his name was linked to one of the most popular manuscripts of that victorian time , the grand hours of anne de bretagne the 1497 document showing queen anne s payment to him had long been confused with payment for that celebrated manuscript and thus perceived as evidence that poyet was its illuminator when scholars established in 1880 that the author of the grand hours was in reality bourdichon , poyet s reputation was consigned to oblivion , and much of his real work as attributed to bourdichon by the early 20th century poyet was all but forgotten again but over the last 20 years interest in him has revived , and his reputation is resurging in a show at the morgan in 1982 , a group of works attributed to bourdichon was shown as differing in style from that artist s , and another show in paris in 1993 consigned an even larger body of supposed bourdichon work to the differing style in the morgan show , mr wieck has refined the body of works in the two earlier shows to come up with an oeuvre he feels is unquestionably poyet s what helped to distinguish poyet from his late gothic predecessors and most of his contemporaries , including bourdichon , was time spent in italy absorbing the use of perspective , color and light , and learning to draw convincing representations of the human figure , from the work of masters like mantegna and bellini he took cues , too , from the foremost french painter and manuscript illustrator , jean fouquet \( circa 14201481 \) , a generation before him , who was also influenced by aspects of italian art
the most remarkable comefrombehind victory in world championship history occurred two weeks ago in paris with 16 deals remaining in the final of the venice cup for women s teams , germany trailed france by 47 imps french supporters in the vugraph theater were looking for opportunities to cheer their heroines , but found none all four german players played aggressively and accurately , and steadily eroded the lead with two deals remaining , the lead was down to 8 imps , and the diagramed deal appeared in both rooms , west opened with a weak twobid in spades north doubled and south responded three diamonds , showing some values in the modern style the french north player passed three diamonds at this point , and her partner made 10 tricks sabine auken , north for germany , was more adventurous she bid three spades , a cuebid inviting game , and her partner , daniela von arnim , naturally tried three notrump the vugraph audience could see that the defense could take the first five tricks more than 100 french enthusiasts were willing west to lead the club jack , virtually guaranteeing a world title for the host country and permitting a shout of allez , la france but west made the normal lead of the spade seven , and the audience subsided the spade king won in dummy , and south could count eight tricks for the ninth , she had to solve the problem of the heart jack she cashed four diamond tricks , noting that west followed three times and that east threw a heart and a club it was now probable that east held the heart jack , and south finessed her nine to make the game \( a slight improvement would be to save the diamond ace as an entry to dummy , allowing the play of the heart ace to guard against the chance of a singleton heart jack with west \) germany gained 10 imps and took the lead by 2 , which proved to be the margin of victory even the vulnerability was against the french , who would have won by 1 imp if the german game had been not vulnerable the german players in the closed room , andrea rauscheid and beate nehmert , had also played brilliantly to help snatch the title auken and von arnim have been playing at world level for 17 years , and have often matched the performance of the best men in open competition they must now be acknowledged as the world s best women s pair of the modern era diagram
three members of mexico s prominent ballesteros family , one of whom died in a car crash a year ago , have been accused by federal prosecutors in new york of reaping more than 35 million in illegal profits in 1999 by trading on inside information about the acquisition of an american chemical company by a giant french conglomerate the case , which details stock trades conducted in four nations on two continents , was announced yesterday by united states attorney mary jo white in manhattan the criminal charges were accompanied by a civil complaint filed by the securities and exchange commission against the same three defendants , along with three other members of the ballesteros family and two friends of the family , all mexican citizens the surviving defendants in the criminal case who , through their lawyers , denied any wrongdoing are jorge eduardo ballesteros franco , the chairman of grupo mexicano de desarrollo , a major mexican construction company , and his nephew , juan pablo ballesteros gutierrez , an executive at the company named in a separate indictment was jose luis ballesteros franco , jorge ballesteros s brother and the younger mr ballesteros s father , who was killed in an automobile accident outside mexico city last may according to the indictment , jose luis ballesteros was a director of the nalco chemical company in naperville , ill , in april 1999 , when nalco first received a tender offer from suez lyonnaise des eaux , the french utility and media company prosecutors say that as the private negotiations ripened , mr ballesteros traded on his confidential knowledge about the pending deal , using an offshore account in the channel islands and placing trades through a broker in switzerland according to the indictment unsealed yesterday , he also shared the secret with his brother jorge , his son juan pablo and his three other sons who all , in turn , traded in nalco stock , prosecutors said jorge ballesteros was accused of using two offshore accounts in the channel islands to purchase nalco shares in advance of the deal the indictment charges that juan pablo ballesteros purchased some shares through a friend s brokerage account in minnesota , and that he and his brothers also directed a texas broker to use assets in their antiguan bank accounts to buy additional nalco shares through an offshore account jorge ballesteros is facing one count of conspiracy to commit fraud , four counts of securities fraud and four counts of fraud in connection with a tender offer his nephew is facing a single count of conspiracy , one count of securities fraud and one count of fraud in connection with a tender offer the conspiracy charges carry jail terms of five years , while each fraud count carries a penalty of 10 years imprisonment the defendants also face fines of more than 56 million in a statement released by his attorneys at latham watkins in new york , jorge ballesteros called the criminal and regulatory charges totally unfounded any trading that he did in nalco shares , the statement continued , was based on publicly available information and was openly conducted he emphasized that none of the government s allegations involved his company or its businesses in any way paul shechtman , who represents juan pablo ballesteros , said his client is confident that when a jury hears all the evidence , it will determine that he did not trade on inside information the late mr ballesteros was named in an indictment that was filed under seal before his death although that indictment was unsealed and made public yesterday , it is likely to be dismissed as the criminal case moves forward , lawyers involved in the case said the other sons of the late mr ballesteros jose luis ballesteros gutierrez , alejandro ballesteros gutierrez , and ricardo ballesteros gutierrez , who was an analyst at lehman brothers when the disputed trades occurred were not named in the criminal indictment but they were

carlos minvielle and his father , eugenio minvielle , who were accused of making roughly 460 , 000 by trading in nalco shares in advance of the suez lyonnaise deal according to the sec , carlos minvielle was tipped to the pending deal by his friend jose luis ballesteros , the late mr ballesteros s son the younger mr minvielle then shared the secret with his father , the sec said this case sends a warning that engaging in insider trading from abroad , or using multiple offshore accounts that mask the trader s identity , will not protect the trader from detection and prosecution , said richard h walker , director of the sec s enforcement division all the defendants in the sec complaint , except jorge ballesteros and his nephew , juan pablo , and their trading affiliates , have agreed to settle the charges against them without admitting or denying any wrongdoing according to paul r berger , associate enforcement director for the sec , the estate of jose luis ballesteros franco has agreed to pay 37 million to settle the complaint , representing the return of all the illegal profits the ballesteros family is accused of receiving as a result of their nalco trades , plus interest the minvielle defendants have agreed to return approximately 414 , 000 in trading profits , along with fines and interest ricardo ballesteros has agreed to be barred from the securities industry for at least five years
for many people , reading herman melville s mobydick was not an event it was an assigned task , performed alone but this week , for 24 hours straight from noon tuesday until noon wednesday , the book will be presented in a different way as mystic seaport stages its annual marathon reading of the american classic on the last surviving american wooden whaling vessel , the charles w morgan the reading will begin on the seaport s chubb s wharf and then move to the main deck of the morgan should stormy weather threaten , the event will move below decks , settling in the large room where the whale blubber was cut into pieces before being rendered into oil on deck at times the group may move so a passage can be read in the environment in which the action takes place , such as the chapter midnight , forecastle , for which the group typically gathers in the fore cabin where the common sailors slept not only is it a stage set , jan larson , director of museum education at the seaport , describing the morgan , it s a mystical , threedimensional environment where we can put these words back into the wood mr melville never set foot aboard the morgan none of the three vessels on which he sailed during his two years of whaling has survived but the morgan , which made 37 voyages during her 80year career , bringing home 54 , 483 barrels of oil and 152 , 934 pounds of whalebone , is as much like the vessels he served on as any place still existing possibly could be , said jack putnam , 65 , a museum educator at the south street seaport museum in new york mr putnam is likely to leave a lasting impression on those who attend the reading each year he reads the novel s famous opening chapter , loomings , as well as its conclusion , and does so from memory while wearing , roughly , period garb and sporting his melvillean beard after a certain age , as a member of this gene pool , if you keep your hair and grow a beard you begin to resemble herman , mr putnam said mr putnam first had mobydick read to him as a boy he then fell under the author s spell in the mid1950 s thanks to a course he took at harvard university with henry alexander murray , the mobydick scholar \( and creator of the thematic apperception test , used in psychoanalysis \) in the 1960 s he worked on the definitive northwesternnewberry edition of the writings of herman melville in 1983 mr putnam began doing recitations of the text from memory at the south street seaport museum , which is near the author s boyhood home he was first invited to enact mr melville at the mystic seaport marathon in 1991 , the centennial of the author s death the annual marathon was created by ms larson she started the event 15 years ago , inspired by the public readings of james joyce s ulysses each bloomsday , june 16 , the day on which that novel s action unfolds she chose to schedule the mobydick marathon around aug 1 because that is the author s birthday mobydick was not one of mr melville s more popular works in his own lifetime , and he is not known to have given any public readings from the novel , said john bryant of the melville society and a hofstra university professor still , an oral presentation of this philosophical sea tale is fitting melville was known to tell a strapping good story , mr bryant said when he first came home from sea , he would tell stories about his adventures and people would say , 'gee , you have to write this down' that was the beginning of his life as a writer mr bryant said he was n't sure how many other groups also stage melville readings god knows how many lunatics are out there doing this , he said , but he could name two similar events for years canio s books in sag harbor , ny , held a marathon roundtheclock reading of mobydick , and the event now continues as two 12hour readings staged at the john jermain memorial library as part of the midseptember sag harbor historic fest also , every jan 3 \( the anniversary of mr melville s first sailing on the acushnet \) , the new bedford whaling museum holds a roundtheclock reading mary kay bercaw edwards , the melville scholar at mystic seaport , said the university of kansas also stages a reading of the book at the first mystic reading , ms larson scheduled the event over parts of four days so that visitors to the museum could enjoy it the next year , in an effort to up the ante , she obtained permission for staff and a few visitors to stay overnight on the morgan so that the reading could be attempted in marathon format everyone assembled was amazed to find that a nonstop reading of this thick book could be completed precisely in one 24hour span the maximum allowable number of overnight guests on the morgan is 40 in its active whaling days , it carried on average of 33 sailors mr melville himself first shipped out on the acushnet on jan 3 , 1841 , part of a crew of 26 , said ms bercaw edwards the census for the pequod , the fictional whaler captained by ahab in mobydick , is more complex melville tells us there are 30 people on board , ms bercaw edwards noted , but if you count the number of people cited , there are 45 there are a limited number of overnight berths still available for this year s reading for information , call \( 860 \) 5720711 ext 5035 other visitors will be able to enjoy the reading on tuesday until the museum closes at 6 pm and again when it opens at 9 am on aug 1 , the author s 177th birthday at noon on wednesday , a great , white birthday cake decorated with the image of a white whale will be presented visitors are welcome to sign up to read a chapter assorted paperback editions of mobydick will be available for those who wish to follow the words on the page there will also be a largeprint edition there besides the language itself , visitors should expect the occasional flourish of a chantey singer accompanying a passage that mentions music ms larson noted other unexpected highlights from past years students from a remedial reading course at ella grasso regional vocationaltechnical school in groton joining the cast of readers , the national theater of the deaf \( based in chester \) sending some signing actors , and cod

random house , the largest publisher of generalinterest books , has begun a round of layoffs as it cuts costs to address what its executives call a prolonged downturn in book sales over the last two weeks , three of the company s publishing houses doubleday broadway , ballantine and bantam dell have together laid off at least nine staff members , including several editors more layoffs are expected from knopf , the random house trade group , crown and the children s book groups , according to people at the company indeed , because many at random house are anxiously awaiting more layoffs , some of the executives let go in the last two weeks said they appreciated learning the news before christmas , which cut short the anxiety and gave them a jump on finding a new job laidoff staff members who could be reached declined to comment publicly none of the departing editors were among the most prominent names in their field but others at random house expressed surprise because some of those let go were well regarded by their colleagues before he was laid off , for example , peter borland , vice president and executive editor of ballantine , had expected to edit the bestselling writer jonathan kellerman , who had just signed a new contract with the house amy scheibe , laid off from doubleday broadway , recently edited bee season , the bestselling literary first novel by myla goldberg , and fraud , a wellreviewed book of comic essays by david rakoff stuart applebaum , a spokesman for random house , part of bertelsmann of germany , declined to comment on the potential number of layoffs to come or the magnitude of other cost cuts he said decisions about how to meet budgets , including layoffs or other cutbacks , are made by the heads of each publishing house , like doubleday broadway or the ballantine group random house as a whole employs more than 3 , 000 people , including those in its sales division although the initial layoffs represent a tiny portion of the payroll , they have sent tremors through the company and the book industry , in part over the uncertainty created about the eventual scale of the cutbacks cuts at random house draw particular attention because of the prestige of some of its houses retrenchment at a major publisher inevitably stirs authors' and agents' fear that the company will reduce the number of books it publishes , or that editorial and marketing resources will be stretched thin a spokeswoman for doubleday broadway said it did not plan to cut back on its output of new books or its support for them a spokeswoman for bantam dell declined to comment , and a ballantine spokeswoman did not return calls in recent weeks , peter olson , chief executive of bertelsmann s random house division , laid the groundwork for the cutbacks by issuing unusually pessimistic public statements about the lackluster state of the business , even appending them on occasion to apparently unrelated press releases about executive changes in an internal memo to random house employees yesterday , mr olson reiterated warnings of hard times ahead our publishing programs are not immune to the overall downturn in book sales nationwide , he said we are selling fewer copies of our bestselling titles than in previous years christmas sellthrough , at best , looks to be just moderate compared to last year and the year before saluting employees for continuing vigilance in the company s costcutting efforts , mr olson concluded , it wo n't get easier for us in 2002 as a backdrop , the parent bertelsmann is beginning to prepare for a planned initial public stock offering in perhaps three or four years random house s layoffs follow others at bertelsmann s music division , bmg this fall , random house also laid off about a half dozen lexicographers in its reference division , and several other major publishers have begun tightening their belts aol time warner s books division recently laid off almost 30 members of the staff of its electronic publishing division , citing the slump in sales of printed books as part of the reason mr applebaum , the random house spokesman , said , looking at our cost structure is something that we , as well as every other wellrun business within and beyond the media world , has to do in this time of recession within random house , the doubleday broadway group laid off roughly four staff members , the ballantine group about the same number and bantam dell at least one
nineteen years ago my wife and i , soon to become parents , moved into a solitary tall building in the middle of an empty battery park city while having dinner at windows on the world , we had seen a sign that read now renting , with a phone number moving from our midtown studio to the financial district seemed pioneering and adventurous but we went in those 19 years , in the shadow of the world trade center , we raised a son and participated in the growth of a community and on sept 11 , in less than an hour , 10 people whom none of us had ever heard of or met destroyed the life we had lived and helped to create battery park city was n't ready to be a neighborhood when we moved in there were only a thousand or so residents , and there were no supermarkets , no restaurants , no places of worship , no schools i used to feel that we were really in a commercial zone but apartment buildings went up until we had 10 , 000 neighbors over the years , we fought and we shouted we had a tenants' group , a parents' association , a community board to its credit , the battery park city authority responded two years after our son was born , we got a playground down by west street there was a community garden , and up north children played around a fanciful sculpture designed by tom otterness in the end , we had three schools the neighborhood grew in other ways we saw construction of the world financial center complex , with its pedestrian bridges to the world trade center , and the museum of jewish life to the south in the parks and imaginative public spaces , and on the sprawling esplanade , the residents and the office dwellers of battery park city mingled the world trade center was not precisely the center of our community , which was more about people than about landmarks but we shopped in the trade center s concourse , caught trains in its subway station , bought theater tickets at its halfprice booth always , we took our friends and relatives to the top of the twin towers they were our icons , helping to define us last week i ran barefoot from my building , where i had been at work in my home office much of all that we had lived with inside and outside was covered with ashes and debris parts of the primary school had caved in firemen from the firehouse our children loved to visit were missing so were many of our neighbors now the residents of battery park city are homeless and scattered we may go back , but our lives will never be the same hundreds of our children were witnesses to the fall of the towers some saw human figures in flames , falling from windows almost all saw the devastation but cannot understand why it happened our neighbor lois eida remembers giving her 11yearold son , daniel , classic battery park city advice zero in on the twin towers if you ca n't find your way home if you remember that , you can never be lost , she told him last week , daniel said it all so simply when he asked her how will i find my way home now \?
it is not quite the east coast version of hoosiers , but the saga of the basketball team from adelphi , the university that nearly went out of business and is led by a player who could not get a look from the big colleges , continues to charm now , across the country in bakersfield , calif , adelphi will play in the final eight of the ncaa s division ii tournament it faces tampa \( 246 \) tomorrow adelphi , in garden city , ny , has the only undefeated record among the ncaa s 992 men s teams at 310 , it is the topranked division ii team no other men s team , in any division , has fewer than two losses how big a deal is this trip out west \? none of adelphi s players have even flown to a game for the school before i took more planes in high school than i did at adelphi , said ryan mccormack , the hyperactive guard from the lower east side who was recently named the division ii player of the year still , that is not enough at practice one day last week , coach jim ferry was trying to get his players to perform at an even keel some of you guys are too pumped up , ferry said mccormack knew what his coach was really talking about i made a face at him , mccormack recalled , and he said 'hey , ryan , you just do the playing let me coach' that was not the first time an authority figure scolded mccormack , who at 5 feet 10 inches is not afraid to make use of his new york attitude and accent in a recent tournament game against philadelphia , he chided the referee for missing what he thought was a goaltending infraction by the other team are you going to ref or play \? the official demanded mccormack promptly swished a jump shot i 'll play , he said to the official , with a wink mccormack recorded tripledoubles twice during the recent crunch time he comes out each game looking to drive the middle on every possession , but he is also prepared to take a 3point shot if he is open on the outside it is necessary to put mccormack s statistics into perspective by themselves they are good but not spectacular in the context of how they move the team , however , they are extraordinary he has a teamhigh average of 172 points a game , leads in assists and steals , and even averages 51 rebounds he is never taken out of games until they are no longer in doubt he is the most intense competitor i 've ever coached , ferry said mccormack said i 've always been that way in the schoolyards , other sports i played i grew up on pearl street , near the brooklyn bridge i used to play all the sports , but when i got into the seventh grade , they became boring for me except for basketball he spent a few years dancing after the national dance institute sent a troupe to his public school when he got to junior high school 104 , he gave it up it was time for ball i thought it was great , he said of dancing i did modern and tap it helped my moves at the schoolyards , he said i started making real crazy shots i 'd hear the ooh s and aah s in the park , and i ca n't tell you how uplifting that was his father , kevin , the principal of the manhattan occupational training center , and his mother , regina , who works as a stock trader out of their home , moved the family to breezy point in queens , and ryan attended xavier high school he wanted a different kind of competition , so he also joined the famed riverside church team in manhattan that really helped me to become a good point guard , he said the pressure on you to perform was intense in that league he thought he was good enough for division i , but no one paid much attention to him they did n't like my game , he said i could n't get them to look at what i could do in 1997 , when mccormack was ready for college , adelphi was mired in a scandal involving its president in fact , the trustees and president were dismissed by the state board of regents after enrollment had fallen to fewer than 4 , 000 students from 10 , 000 in 1990 mccormack became a freshman starter there are no longer any deferred dreams about playing in division i i watch basketball every chance i get , he said but i have no second thoughts this is the only place i want to be he may get a chance after he graduates to play professionally in europe he said he also had a few job offers from wall street but even after he graduates , the legacy of this season could remain strong dr robert a scott , an anthropologist who had been head of ramapo college in new jersey , took over as adelphi s president last july the first five months , every day i heard a question about the previous administration , said scott , in a voice still hoarse from cheering on his team the last two months , every day someone asks me about the basketball team photo a doubleteamed ryan mccormack has been a feisty leader for unbeaten adelphi all season he is the division ii player of the year \( john dunn for the new york times \)

the argyle grill is a snap , crackle and pop kind of place that looks like yesterday but is very much today one evening at this babylon newcomer , we sat at a table underneath a photograph of the

pressed tin ceiling , wood floors \( tiny antique tiles in the bar area \) , ceiling fans and beautiful , massive chandeliers the dining room for smokers , adjacent to the bar , was pulsating with

oakland , calif , nov 25 two victories on the nets' first western conference trip would have been a blessing last season this season , it is a disappointment in trying to finish the fifth and final game of the trip with a victory against golden state to push them over 500 on the western swing , the nets had none of the fight they had in the previous four games instead , they played like this season s nets in the first half and finished with a whimper , like last season s nets the warriors , overcoming a 5point halftime deficit , outmuscled the nets under the basket in the third quarter , racing to a 10185 victory that sent the nets home with a 23 record on the trip the nets' backtoback losses dropped them to 95 over all they are still on top of the atlantic division , but it is a record that is very deceiving , coach byron scott said we are nowhere near where i think our guys think we are , scott said right now we do n't know how to handle success we came out in the second half and just gave in , just thinking that team was going to go away it s just not going to happen mentally and physically , they just beat us you can use all the excuses you want , but we just gave in to it it s the first time i 've seen that all season with this team the collapse deflated the nets , who had played hard on this trip until the third quarter tonight when the warriors launched a 207 run to start the half and outscored the nets , 3013 , in the period we got a little tired going into second half and the big men pretty much took over the game , said point guard jason kidd , who was playing in his hometown we 've been playing catchup since the denver game , and playing catchup on the road takes a lot out of you in the first half , when the nets dominated from the outside and the inside , kidd did not seem to miss he led all scorers with 15 points in the first half but when the warriors started pushing the nets under the basket , kidd was no longer a factor he scored just one point in the second half kenyon martin led the nets with 19 points antawn jamison led the warriors with 22 points kidd could not lead a dramatic rally tonight , as he had earlier on the trip with late 3pointers against denver and utah and the clinching free throws against the los angeles clippers we depend on the guy every night , so i think we get spoiled , nets center todd macculloch said when things are n't going well , the rest of us have to step up and we did n't do that tonight macculloch and the other post players blamed themselves for the loss they did what we knew they would do they crashed the boards , said macculloch , who finished with 5 rebounds warriors center erick dampier , meanwhile , had a gamehigh 14 rebounds , which helped golden state to a 5141 advantage on the boards each team had 23 rebounds at halftime , but the warriors also took the advantage there in the second half that falls on the big people , mostly myself , macculloch said we were n't able to keep them off the glass aaron williams agreed , saying that scott told the team at halftime how the warriors would play , but the nets did not listen they were playing harder than us and we let them play to their strengths , williams said scott would not accept any excuses after the game i thought we had a good team , but good teams play hard every night , he said good teams battle every night we just have n't learned to react to success well for the second straight game , the nets were playing without the reserve forward richard jefferson , who is out with a sprained left knee ligament scott said the team missed jefferson s energy and defense , something that was completely lacking in the third quarter the nets had led by 8 points early into the quarter before the warriors trampled the tiredlooking visitors dampier had six rebounds as the warriors outrebounded the nets , 168 , in the period meanwhile , the nets shot 27 percent , going through a scoring drought that lasted nearly five minutes and enabled the warriors to take a 12point lead into the fourth quarter the nets could not mount any rally as they had in their 9897 loss to the sacramento kings on saturday night they had no fight left the warriors took a 17point lead when the nets' reggie slater , who had not played any substantial minutes this season , turned the ball over with less than 10 minutes remaining and mookie blaylock converted a fastbreak layup the nets never pulled closer than 13 points scott took kidd out with 3 minutes 55 seconds to go , after he had played the entire second half there would be no lastsecond drama from him , no 3pointer at the buzzer it was n't our best game and this was a big game for us going back home , kidd said we 're not a team in the dark anymore , we 're out there in front we are going to have to get better at handling success photo keith van horn , avoiding a block by golden state s antawn jamison , had 13 points last night for the nets , who went 23 on their western trip \( associated press \)
st louis , april 1 with 58 seconds left in a tie game and the national championship in the balance , notre dame s ruth riley , the best player in the nation , stood on the freethrow line and she thought of her favorite movie riley flashed back to a dramatic scene in hoosiers , the symbol of this allindiana title game she recalled her favorite part , when ollie , the smallest player on the smallschool team , made two free throws for the victory what more fitting a way to win the game with all of the hype about indiana , riley would say later i did n't have to underhand them , though standing taller than anyone , riley lofted her first free throw with a chance to break a tie score against purdue it bounced off the front of the rim and paused then it dropped through the basket her second free throw did the same , giving notre dame a 2point lead , forcing the boilermakers to answer but purdue s final play dissolved in nerves , and when katie douglas finally got the ball , she heaved a 17footer with two seconds left that bounced off the rim , too but her attempt fell out , giving notre dame its first national championship with a 6866 victory over purdue at the savvis center it was a storybook season with a really happy ending , notre dame coach muffet mcgraw said in the semifinal game , the irish knocked off the defending champion , connecticut , for the second time this season , by 15 points but when the streamers finally fell tonight in celebration for notre dame \( 342 \) , they touched the 6foot5 riley first riley , whose indiana farmhouse split the 109mile distance between notre dame and purdue , was the only indiana player for the irish , and the best tonight , in front of 20 , 551 fans she led all scorers with 28 points , grabbed a gamehigh 13 rebounds , blocked 7 shots and was named the final four s outstanding player riley s teammates certainly did not doubt her i felt really confident , actually , i knew ruth was going to hit both of them , the momentum was going forward , said notre dame s kelley siemon , whose lob down low to riley forced the foul from the freshman shereka wright that sent riley to the line ruth s a great player who comes through in huge situations and obviously none more important than this riley provided the most exciting ending to a women s title game since charlotte smith of north carolina hit a 3pointer at the buzzer to beat louisiana tech in 1994 and in the process , she earned redemption i was in this situation before when we played connecticut and i did n't pull through , riley said with five seconds left in the big east tournament final , riley missed the first of two free throws , which could have put notre dame ahead by 1 instead , sue bird of connecticut hit the gamewinning jumper i just practiced since that and today , i was pretty confident in my shot , and i got a lucky bounce and i was able to come through , riley said i knew my teammates were looking for me and i was just wanted to finish my career out on a win with 36 seconds left and the score tied at 6666 , purdue \( 317 \) had a chance to go ahead wright , who finished with 17 points , drove to the basket and missed a shot riley came down with the rebound and notre dame called a timeout with 259 seconds to play siemon sent a lob to riley , who leaped to grab it on the way up for the shot , riley forced the foul on wright after riley s first free throw , purdue called a timeout , its last on the inbounds play after riley s second shot , guard kelly komara got the ball to camille cooper , who bobbled it and fired it to douglas we kind of designed a play , got out there and did n't run it as well as we wanted to , said douglas , who finished with a teamhigh 18 points i do n't know what happened i had a good look at the basket and it did n't go down for me for nearly 40 minutes tonight , purdue s players did what they did for two years through a neverending cycle of pain and personal loss they rebounded but in the end , it was not enough to win their second title in three years this program has been through so much adversity and i think that s why it hurts so much now , purdue coach kristy curry said cooper and candi crawford , both seniors , picked up four fouls early in the second quarter guarding riley , and the rebounding edge the boilermakers had at halftime , 2917 , as well as the 6point lead , soon disappeared we knew it would be a battle inside , cooper said credit ruth with playing well douglas added if she was n't blocking a shot she was altering a shot , she was getting a lot of rebounds , it was just her night once again , notre dame point guard niele ivey gave a stern talk at halftime , determined to overcome yet another deficit to begin the second half we could n't have played any worse the first half , she said this is my team i'm the captain this is my hometown and i was willing to do whatever i could for this team ivey was hobbling on her left ankle she sprained against connecticut , but finished with 6 steals and 12 points two important ones coming with 2 minutes 7 seconds to play , to break a 6262 tie that was set up by notre dame s alicia ratay who had missed her first six 3pointers tonight she finally hit her first with 4 02 to play , notching the score at 6262 , and ivey made it 6462 with 90 seconds left , siemon turned the ball over and douglas took it in for a fastbreak layup and forced the foul for the 3point play to give the boilermakers a 6664 lead riley made the layup to tie the game at 6666 with 1 01 remaining , setting up her

the jets , who hope to build a stateoftheart stadium on the west side of manhattan , are considering practicing this summer at a slightly less posh locale rikers island general manager terry bradway says he is thinking about having the jets hold a trainingcamp practice on the jail grounds and why \? to recapture a part of their peripatetic history the jets practiced occasionally at rikers when they played at shea stadium beginning in 1964 bradway said they also practiced at rikers during the 1968 season , which culminated with the greatest moment in jets history , the super bowl iii victory the jets got their own practice complex at hofstra in 1974 but before that , the jets were not allowed to practice at shea during baseball season out of concern they would ruin the field for baseball and were forced to board buses and practice wherever they could find an open field among other places , the jets practiced at the world s fair grounds , randalls island and , after working out a deal with the warden , the prisoners' fields at rikers the prisoners watched practice and hooted and howled , said the longtime team spokesman , frank ramos , who remembers the practices we did n't have any problems with it bradway said the idea was very preliminary and he had yet to speak to anyone at rikers about it among the greatest concerns would be the condition of the fields we would not risk injury , he said i would have to make sure the field was ok so somebody would n't get hurt security would be another issue when the jets last practiced at rikers , there were no individual practice sessions for players , because all team buses had to arrive and leave the grounds at the same time and that was before the days when teams had their own elaborate security measures , as the jets do now but bradway is committed to breaking up the monotony of training camp the jets will practice aug 3 at hofstra s football stadium , across hempstead turnpike from the jets' regular training field the jets believe players feel more excitement under the lights bradway has also thought about staging a field goal kicking contest with the new york power of the women s united soccer association , something the kansas city chiefs bradway s former employer did with mia hamm and others presumably , none of rikers s regular residents would be invited to participate in practice all we need is burt reynolds out there , bradway said like in 'the longest yard'
do n't confuse the global megabank chase manhattan with the chase investment counsel corporation in charlottesville , va , investment adviser to the 36 million chase growth fund we 've always tried very hard to point out that we 're not a chase bank fund , derwood s chase jr , the president and chief investment officer of chase investment , who works with david b scott in managing the fund the chase confusion has diminished , now that the mutual funds of the big manhattan bank are being sold under the j p morgan label \( chase manhattan merged with morgan last year to become j p morgan chase \) but the tiny chase growth fund marches on , and its performance has been outstanding relative to the market and its peer group of funds the fund returned 127 percent a year , on average , for the three years through thursday , compared with 53 percent for its largegrowth fund category and 53 percent for standard poor s 500stock index the portfolio lost 52 percent in the last 12 months , compared with losses of 307 percent for its group and 5 percent for the s p 500 mr chase , 70 , and mr scott , 46 , the fund s senior portfolio manager , describe themselves as stock pickers who look for growth at a reasonable price they combine fundamental , quantitative and technical research the same process they use to manage 1 billion in institutional and individual accounts for chase investment counsel the managers start by screening about 5 , 000 domestic stocks with market capitalizations of more than 500 million , searching for consistent earnings growth they look for annual average earnings growth of at least 10 percent for 4 of the last 5 years and 7 of the last 10 that brings down their list of companies to about 600 then they conduct a series of tests , looking for return on equity of at least 15 percent , a debttoequity ratio of no more than 50 percent and substantial reinvestment of earnings the 40 to 60 companies that pass all the screens become buy candidates two senior analysts review the data and pore over balance sheets we want to see that cashflow returns are still strong after the balance sheet is adjusted for noncash items like depreciation , good will and amortization , mr chase said they do onsite research of companies , too , looking for evidence that suggests strong fundamentals and rising stock prices the managers like the sysco corporation of houston , the big distributor of food and paper products to restaurants and institutions sysco derives 65 percent of its revenue from the restaurant business , and it is gaining market share among hospitals and hotels and in other markets , mr chase said it generally does well whether the economy is doing well or not , he said its earnings growth has averaged 17 percent annually for the last five years , compared with 8 to 12 percent for most food , beverage and food products companies he expects the company s earnings to grow 21 percent a year , on average , over the next three to five years the managers originally bought shares at 20 in december 1999 the stock closed on friday at 2843 the managers' 12month target price is 35 another favorite is boeing , which is aiming to diversify beyond its core business of aircraft manufacturing the company s earnings have grown 20 percent a year over the last five years , mr scott said , well above its competitors in the aerospace and aircraft industry boeing is aiming to build the sonic cruiser , a jet that would fly at just below the speed of sound , and is adding variations of existing models , he said it recently announced advanced research and initial production on a satellite to direct aircraft for landing and takeoff , supplementing or replacing the radar systems currently used by the federal aviation administration the managers originally bought shares in march at 6150 they closed on friday at 57 their target price is 75 a new holding is calpine corporation of san jose , calif , which develops and operates power plants as demand for power surges in california and elsewhere , calpine is building plants in markets where none have been built for years mr scott expects earnings to grow an average of 32 percent a year over the next three to five years the fund bought the stock at 51 in april it now trades at 3770 , compared with the managers' target price of 64 photo in their fund , derwood s chase jr , left , and david b scott seek companies with consistent earnings growth \( wayne scarberry for the new york times \) chart chase growth fund category large growth net assets 36 million inception december 1997 managers derwood s chase jr and david b scott since inception minimum purchase 2 , 000 \( ira 2 , 000 \) portfolio turnover 74 3year annualized return through thursday 127 category average 53 sector breakdown conglomerates 8 financial services 6 energy 5 computer software services 5 leisure 4 other 72 fees frontend load none deferred load none 12b1 fee none expense ratio 148 \( sources morningstar inc company reports \)
secretary of defense donald rumsfeld appeared on meet the press last weekend and explained how the bush administration was going to go about building a hitherto unbuildable missile shield to protect the united states from nuclear assaults by rogue nations some of the things will work , some wo n't and what we 'll do is stop the things that wo n't and move forward on the things that will , he said this sounds suspiciously like a plan to finance one s future retirement by buying only lottery tickets that are going to win but with that kind of cando attitude , i do n't see why we 're settling for a lousy missile shield why not decide to outfit our surveillance planes with romulan cloaking devices , so they could hover invisibly over the rogue nation s launch sites \? if saddam hussein tried to pull a fast one , we could simply zap him with a photon torpedo if the missile shield program actually gets through congress , it will not be because people actually believe it can work , but because nobody ever lost an election by voting for defense appropriations weapons systems , like highway construction , are on the winwin side of government if something fails , you put out yet another contract , and all the people who were happy before get even happier contrast this to the problem of domestic terrorism the thing that happens if somebody decides to skip the rocket launcher and simply tote a nuclear bomb into the country on a cargo ship or the back of a truck the issue here is not really money or technology but bureaucratic infighting , a problem that creates many losers and no defense contracts right now , 46 federal agencies are working on homeland defense if a nuclear bomb were to be unleashed somewhere inside the united states tomorrow , it s far from clear who would be in control of the response \( except , of course , in the case of new york city , where mayor rudolph giuliani would be in complete and total charge , even if he had already been incinerated \) this week the us senate is going to have an unusual joint committee hearing with the laudable intention of trying to figure out who should be calling the shots but in order to estimate the senators' chances of eliminating overlapping authority , consider the fact that there are seven committees and eight subcommittees with jurisdiction that s just in the senate lord knows how many if you include the house , said senator pat roberts of kansas , the chairman of one of my favorite subcommittees , emerging threats and capabilities mr roberts held a hearing last week on just one tiny particle of the homeland defense picture , the weapons of mass destruction civil support teams the wmdcst s are part of the national guard , and among their many problems is the fact that they have one of the worst acronyms in the history of civil defense we used to call them raid teams , senator roberts said nostalgically the national guard teams were supposed to offer a defense department presence at the site of a terrorist attack there were originally scheduled to be 10 teams , but your basic congressional conviction that more is better , particularly when it is located within one s own personal district , led to upping the ante to 32 in the end , it did n't much matter , since none of them have actually ever gotten trained do you believe it would be prudent to have a civil support team in west virginia \? senator robert byrd of west virginia asked a military witness yes sir , if you want , the general replied meanwhile , senator roberts worried out loud about who was going to coordinate the 46 federal agencies , not to mention governors , mayors , police chiefs and all the other officeholders who would want a say in responding to a possible biological or chemical or nuclear disaster in their state many experts , he offered , favored giving the job to the vice president this makes a lot of sense , since terrorist attack fits under dick cheney s current portfolio of everything except education all i know is that mr rumsfeld should be taken out of the running for homeland defense czar , if only because his department changed the raid teams' name to wmdcst also , when it comes time to decide how to move the civil defense workers to a crisis site , we should definitely be looking at transporter beams
it was a year of growing stature for the ursuline school swimmer kimi kelly she grew four and a half inches , from 5 feet 1 to 55 1 2 and she had a season of increasing accomplishment kelly went undefeated in dualmeet competition while expanding beyond her freestyle specialty then she won four gold medals in four events while leading ursuline to the section 1 championship finally , two weeks ago she played a key role in section 1 , of which westchester is a part , winning the state championship for the first time and she s only 15 though she is a junior i skipped the fifth grade , she explains it was also a big year for the rookie ursuline coach , ryan pellow just 22 and practiceteaching while finishing his degree at iona , pellow had the task of taking over a squad that had won all its dual meets last year his team not only repeated that 80 success but also wrested the section championship from greeley , which had won it four years in a row then , all six ursuline representatives in the state championships bettered or swam up to their best times i do n't know how a first season could have gotten any better , pellow said kelly would have liked to get a little better by one and a half seconds in the statechampionship 500yard freestyle she finished in a personalbest 4 minutes 5110 seconds it was good enough for automatic allamerican status but good only for second place i'm a little disappointed that i did n't win , kelly said , but i got my best times in all my events so it was a very good meet and a very good season kelly not only won all her 200 and 500yard freestyle races in dual meets but also tried the 200 individual medley and won each of her races in the fourstroke discipline she captured her two freestyles in the sectionals and also sparked two winning relays the maximum number of events permitted for one swimmer in the state meet , she took a third in the 200 in addition to her second in the 500 and anchored ursuline s fourthplace 400yard freestyle relay and none of these are her best event probably the mile is my best distance , kelly , a mount vernon resident , said or the 800 i have the endurance john collins , director of the badger swim club in larchmont who coached the united states women at the recent world championships , has worked with kelly since she started agegroup competition at 8 he agrees at this point , the longer the better , collins said yet kelly s style is a bit unconventional for an endurance specialist she does n't lay off the pace and grind down the competition she likes to put on her walkman , listen to fast music \( jewel or 'n sync usually \) to create an uptempo mood , then blast off the blocks , grab the lead and hold it throughout pellow said that in the pool she s a tiger but otherwise she s very easygoing , even being patient with a young coach , he said pellow also singled out two other ursuline juniors , the sprinter kerby lewis and the breaststroker tara malloy , plus the diver christine ingram , a sophomore they made my job easy , he said they are all committed to improving kelly has been committed to swimming ever since she jumped into a pool at the siwanoy country club in bronxville when she was 4 i really got serious when i went to badger at 8 , she said the competition is great , there s a lot of spirit with teammates the training gets hard , but we 're all in the same boat kelly qualified for the olympic trials on her 14th birthday , july 27 , 2000 two weeks later she swam 9 06 for 800 meters at the trials , not good enough to make the team but very good for a 14yearold last june , she lowered that to 8 47 at a meet in charlotte , nc she s always been precocious , collins said she s a pretty good butterfly swimmer , too she s come a long way in a year with her talent , there s still a lot of room to improve photo it s been a season of personal bests for kimi kelly and ursuline s rookie coach , ryan pellow , above , at the state championships in buffalo \( don heupel for the new york times \)
the bad plus , a new jazz trio that wrapped up a weekend of performances at roulette on sunday , goes down easily but it takes a while , on reflection , to sift through the volume of good ideas they throw around what might win the band an instant audience is its playing and in some places artful mauling of pop radio hits since the 1970 s in this they are the beneficiaries , if not the imitators , of 1980 s downtown jazz in new york , which promoted the collision of highart with pop culture but that was a halfgeneration ago , and the bad plus s working over of abba , nirvana and blondie has a much different feeling perhaps it s a subtle point , but the effect was significant there was no radical pose here , since none is needed anymore with this cooperative trio , there s no particular code of conduct you feel like you 're hearing equitable free will ethan iverson , the group s pianist , uses classical music in satieesque harmonic allusions , and sometimes outright \( the set closed with a decorous version of bach s air on the g string \) , but there was n't a sense of trying to enlighten a jazz audience on the drummer david king s enormous palette , new orleans parade rhythms , funk and drumandbass all share space , but this is no groove band there was lots of improvising but never in the jazz format of sequential solos in a sense , they 're after a formal ideal of preworld war ii jazz they pack maximum arrangement into three and a half minutes it s just that they do it with a completely new set of musical languages there was a felicitous tension between mr iverson who used dry harmonies \( often with only one lefthand finger \) and improvised narrow lines running in and out of tonality and the neardionysian mr king , whose flow was nearly uncontainable but occasionally they switch roles mr iverson pounded the bass clef so hard in blondie s heart of glass that he broke a string between them , reid anderson was the anchor , a bassist of flawless intonation and measured bounce if the covers were crowdpleasers , bridging respect for melody with harddriving clatter , their strong originals might last longer an oblique blues noir by mr iverson called guilty had the bewitching , exotic quality of early cecil taylor silence is the question by mr anderson worked with the idea of constant crescendo , gaining volume and density over three lovely chords as mr iverson drilled repeated arpeggios into the keyboard when a band starts life at this level , there s great hope ahead photo ethan iverson leading his new group , the bad plus , at roulette \( jack vartoogian for the new york times \)
montclair , nj sure it hurts how ca n't it \? the world series can be real nervewracking , very emotional it s unlike anything else you feel as a player , coach or manager when you 're so close to winning , to see victory slip away it s a terrible emptiness some guys dwell on it longer than others some careers even get ruined over tough world series losses but i 'll tell you this the yankees will get over their loss to the arizona diamondbacks i just wish some fans would do the same baseball s changed a lot , but in a way it has n't players' salaries may resemble pentagon budgets , but there s still a great passion and respect for the game joe torre , the yankees manager , and his guys remind me very much of our old yankee teams we were fortunate to win a lot , too we always pulled for each other traveled , ate and drank and played cards together we were real closeknit , like a family we expected to win when we did n't , it was hard but you have to realize you ca n't win all the time sometimes there are guys out there better than you after we won five straight championships from 1949 to 1953 , we won 103 games in 1954 not good enough the cleveland indians , who had tremendous pitching , won 111 good pitching usually aces out good hitting that s what happened to the yankees sunday night it s what happened to us in 1963 sandy koufax and don drysdale shut us down , just like randy johnson and curt schilling this year it was the best pitching we 'd ever seen i always said it was easy to understand how koufax won 25 games that year what i did n't understand was how he lost five losing s a great motivator i know their loss in this year s world series will make the yankees hungrier , more determined i lost some heartbreaking world series as a player and manager , too , none more heartbreaking than the series of 1960 we completely dominated the pittsburgh pirates but lost the championship in the ninth inning of the last game on a home run by bill mazeroski nobody took it harder than mickey mantle it was the only time i 'd ever seen him cry he would n't even take his uniform off hours after the game but the next season , mickey was tremendous he played hurt , as usual , and battled roger maris for the home run record , and we breezed to another championship i'm a big fan of joe torre and this yankee team they 're a great bunch they respect the game and the uniform new york fans should be real proud of them even though they did not win the series , they gave the city a big boost the world series also showed us there s no sure thing in baseball and nothing s impossible in life last spring i gave joe torre a cap that said , it ai n't over till it s over i first said that when i was managing the mets in 1973 and we were in last place but we rallied and made it into the world series joe started wearing the cap during the playoffs when the yankees were losing to the oakland a s then the yankees rallied , beat the a s and the seattle mariners , and won some unbelievable games in the world series with mariano rivera pitching the last inning of the final game , most people thought victory was automatic all the final result did was prove something i said a long time ago in baseball , you do n't know nothing

hymn to the rising sun , a grim prison drama from the 1930 s , takes place in the barracks of a rural southern work camp in the early morning on the fourth of july , and the idea of the cruelly incarcerated waking to independence day is the irony that thrums loudly throughout the play written by paul green , a playwright celebrated in the 1920 s and 30 s for his harsh , realistic depictions of social ills , often on racial themes , hymn is marked by the unblinking indignation that made it courageous and powerful in its day but now comes across as thunderously unsubtle its datedness is amplified by the central situation the helpless and humiliated prisoners being harangued by a malicious , selfjustifying chaingang boss it is a dynamic that largely because of movies has become a conventional setup for the illustration of power abuse reaching across the decades from i am a fugitive from a chain gang \( 1932 \) to cool hand luke \( 1967 \) , it is a familiar enough device to be easily satirized , and in recent films like life with eddie murphy and martin lawrence and the coen brothers' current hit , o brother , where art thou \? , is part of the backdrop for comedy none of this , however , bothers barbara montgomery , who has staged a rare revival of the play at la mama experimental theater club with the fierce and admirable conviction that even if prison camps have disappeared , inhumanity and injustice have not the stagecraft here , clearly in the service of passion , is terrific , and it makes you ache for a fresher narrative to support , one that is not so ponderous and onenote the play , an hourlong oneacter , is largely a monologue delivered by the captain \( charley hayward \) , as he wakes the dozen prisoners for their work day , strolls among them as they take their breakfast gruel and delivers a vicious whipping to one whimperer for daring to be ill his holiday subject is punishment for crime as the cornerstone of democracy , and his twisted view of the national spirit is the play s unnuanced malignance democracy , he says , means the voice of the people and the people well who are the people \? why they are the grand old daughters of the revolution , and the confederacy and the bishops and ministers of the gospel episcopalians , the baptists , the methodists and the presbyterians , and all the elks and the kiwanis clubs , the rotarians , the lions , the college presidents , the professors in the great institutions of learning , the folks that write the books and the lawyers do n't forget them they are the people the seethrough ignorance of the oratory is not , alas , made any more complex by mr heyward , whose performance is frankly unimaginative his captain is possessed of an entirely depthless villainy , presented in barks and bellows , measured gestures of napoleonic authority and a southern accent that he has n't persuasively mastered \( at one point the word penal emerges as penile the peenile code \) it s a portrayal that delivers only on the expected and feels absorbed from bad movies rather than good ones in midplay i found myself fondly recalling strother martin in cool hand luke and his curiously pained rendition of utter power over other men what we have here , you may recall him saying , with highpitched , slowfuseburning rage , to paul newman s renegade luke , is a failure to communicate what martin communicated was character , and the position paper delivered by mr heyward here has to be counted as a misstep by ms montgomery , but her only one other roles have all been evocatively cast even nonspeaking parts are performed with detailed care she moves her large cast around a tiny stage with the deftness of a slowmotion choreographer , positioning the whites and blacks to illustrate the humiliations , enforced even among the already powerless , of a racebased caste system and she has swathed the production in ominousness and tension its opening scene , in which a prisoner is caught by guards masturbating and dragged off for punishment , is a small gem vivid and brief , dramatically shocking , not in the least vulgar when the dim lights of dawn come up , we learn that the prisoner , runt \( kevin lee \) , has been confined to a nearly airless box for 11 days his whimpers and pleadings , the sounds of his scratching on the box from the inside , thin protestations of his inevitable doom , provide the play s eerie soundtrack in a credible way , the play has already begun by the time the audience enters a dozen men in dirty prison stripes are chained to their wooden bunks , restively asleep before going to their seats , theatergoers are escorted behind the set and down through the narrow aisle between the bunks , and the overall claustrophobia of the barracks , rendered chillingly by the set and lighting designer david adams , is only underscored by a passage through it the men s twitching , dirty feet , their small nightmare cries , experienced at such close range , however briefly , create a sense of intimacy with confinement that lingers discomfortingly throughout the play the effect is that despite its weaknesses , ms montgomery s production does evoke the prisoners' plight as a persistent misery without end , and in so doing registers a stirring definition of cruelty hymn to the rising sun by paul green directed by barbara montgomery costume consultant , francia maldonaldo set and lighting by david adams presented by la mama etc at 74a east fourth street , lower east side with charley hayward , charles weldon , kevin lee , gian marco lo forte and steven pizzano photo from left , steven pizzano and gian marco lo forte as prisoners , and charley hayward , a chaingang boss , in hymn to the rising sun \( richard termine for the new york times \) \( pg e5 \)

maracaibo , venezuela , oct 9 his plans are often grand , the language usually superheated so when president hugo ch vez promised an agrarian revolution in which venezuela s big estates would be eliminated and land would be handed over to peasants , many in this nation of 24 million shrugged now , mr ch vez is on the verge of approving a law that could limit farm size in some regions to 250 acres and authorize the state to expropriate idle land if put into motion , the major changes this would set off could rival the great land reforms in latin american history gen wilfredo silva , director of the government s national agrarian institute , said the plan aimed to ensure that as many peasants as possible were given plots , most parceled out from governmentowned land private land would be respected , mr silva said , but the government believes that most large farms are already using property that actually belongs to the state what happens is a lot of people say the land is private , but they do not have title , said mr silva of the country s big landowners the immense majority of the country s agricultural land , which belongs to the nation , is in a few hands mr ch vez , a former army paratrooper who won a landslide election in 1998 , rewrote the constitution , took control over the national assembly , expanded the military s mission and purged the state oil company in an effort to remake a corruptionriddled political system some political analysts believe that mr ch vez is simply bluffing , that his speeches about land reform are aimed at shoring up public support , which has been slipping appealing to the poor who make up his base of support , mr ch vez has been particularly harsh with cattlemen and owners of large estates , known as latifundios we have to finish off the latifundios , the president bellowed this month in a speech the latifundio is the enemy of the country mr ch vez has also expressed his concern with inequality in the countryside let us say you have five hectares , 12 acres , he said , and the guy next to you has 400 , he said no , that cannot be such talk has shaken ranchers and dairy producers to their core in this rich agricultural belt in northern zulia state , a steamy emerald carpet of vast cattle herds and dairy farms landowners were already outraged when mr ch vez showed up in early september with the cuban ambassador and other officials of fidel castro s government to give 2 , 164 peasants titles to a total of 101 , 000 acres a handful of ranchers said titles were mistakenly given out for some of their land , about 9 , 000 acres in all then , squatters , whom ranchers charge are encouraged by mr ch vez s harangues against landowners , occupied some farms landowners here responded by cutting back investments in their operations and scaling back businesses some are trying to sell their land with our concerns about the law , no one is working , no one is selling their goods , said virgilio romero , a rancher with 1 , 210 acres today , in a protest aimed at sending a message to caracas , landowners and merchants closed businesses and blocked roads a few vowed that they would fight if the government tried to confiscate lands , even if it meant resorting to violence the president s discourse is that all cattlemen are thieves , that none of the land belongs to us , said sisoes valbuena , 33 , who said that 360 acres of his family s 7 , 400acre ranch were handed out to landless farmers i believe it is the beginning of the cubanization of venezuela the president s critics note that the titles he gave out here last month and another 2 , 587 titles on oct 5 in barinas , his home state , were for land that , for the most part , was not in dispute we are not headed to some kind of cuban communes , said teodoro petkoff , editor of tal cual , a caracas newspaper that is often critical of the president indeed , venezuelan leaders looking for an increase in their approval ratings have periodically handed out land titles and like other latin american countries , venezuela has attempted agrarian reform before , with a 1961 law that was largely cast aside the question in venezuela now is whether the new law , which is expected to be signed in the form of a decree by mr ch vez within the next several weeks , will be applied and , if so , how mr silva said the law s primary role was to determine who had title to property and to find the best use for land concern has swirled , though , because few people outside mr ch vez s inner circle know exactly what the law says , since it has been drafted in secret the government has also sent mixed signals about its proposed contents for instance , mr silva said farms would probably be limited to 370 acres in rich agricultural regions and to 12 , 350 acres in areas where the soil was of poor quality he also said those whose lands were expropriated would be compensated but a draft of the law from people in the province who had gained access to one version indicates that farms will range in size from 250 to 7 , 410 acres those on lands deemed to have belonged to the state in effect , many of the farmers in zulia , according to the government s definition would not be compensated when the government took their land , the draft says the dispute and mr ch vez s heated language has already led some peasant farmers to invade large ranches in machiques , a town southwest of here , squatters and farmers clashed on a recent day after landowners tried to eject peasants there are cattlemen around here with 20 , 000 hectares , said juan lugo , 25 , a squatter that is not right we have lots of peasants here with no land , and the cattlemen have always wanted all the land for themselves that characterization rankles jos ren finol , who owns 30 , 000 acres , land he says has been in the family for decades these were jungles and our grandfathers went in here when there were no roads , or communications or electricity or anything , he said photo peasants in maracaibo demonstrated last week in support of a government plan and against large landowners \( associated press \) map of venezuela highlighting maracaibo

toulouse , france christine schmitz , a 33yearold mother of three , will not feed her children beef , and their school s cafeteria stopped doing so in december that was when european regulators moved to contain the spread of mad cow disease a fatal , brainwasting affliction with no known cure by ordering that every cow or steer more than 30 months old be tested and the diseased ones be destroyed yet on a recent evening , ms schmitz sat with a friend picking at a sirloin steak and fries at l'entrec te , a favored steakhouse in this southern french city and she was not alone there are people who do n't come any more , said henri gineste de saurs , who owns l'entrec te and eight other restaurants like it throughout france but 90 percent of our clients have come back that seems small comfort for people like leonhard immerz on his farm outside buchloe , germany , 550 miles northeast of toulouse , he used to raise some of the cattle that eventually wound up as beef on l'entrec te s tables now , however , mr immerz says he cannot sell any of his 150 head to his usual meat processor not at any price because there is no local market for them a few months after the mad cow scare caused europeans to shun beef in all forms , growing numbers of consumers are coming back slowly and selectively they are enjoying an occasional sirloin or other costlier cut , which they believe is less likely to contain the infectious agents that have transmitted the disease to some humans but they are steering clear of cheaper cuts that they still consider suspect declines are most significant for brains , sweetbread and liver once staples of french cuisine because such organ meats are believed to be most risky there is also evidence that europeans are curbing their taste for hamburgers mcdonald s said in midjanuary that its fourthquarter earnings fell 7 percent , its first quarterly decline in at least a decade , in part because of european concern about the safety of beef since the first human cases linked to contaminated beef were diagnosed in britain in 1996 , 92 people in europe have died or are dying from creutzfeldtjakob disease , the form of mad cow disease in human beings of those , 88 were in britain , 3 in france and one in ireland the prions , or infectious agents , that cause the condition can survive outside the body for years no one knows the incubation period in humans each part of the animal left uneaten takes a bite out of its value in the market , and the financial damage worsens , the farther it travels from feedlot to fork overall beef consumption has declined 27 percent , pushing down prices to the point where farmers cannot recoup their costs without government subsidies such aid is on the way , and may be big the european union has decided to test cattle , buy and destroy infected animals , and buy and slaughter at least two million healthy cattle to prop up the sagging price of beef depending on how many infected animals are found , and how many healthy ones slaughtered , the cost to the union s 15 member nations this year alone could total six billion euros , or about 56 billion , according to estimates by thomas mayer , a senior economist at goldman sachs international in frankfurt but while mr mayer thinks that the longterm economic effects on government spending and overall economic output may be marginal by comparison , uppermost in the minds of the people involved in raising , butchering and selling beef are immediate measures to protect their companies and jobs even if sales to restaurants are holding up , said jacques denis , 59 , the meat wholesaler near toulouse who supplies mr gineste s sirloin , flagging demand from supermarket chains , butchers and public institutions like schools has caused his business to fall by 40 percent it will be a difficult year , mr denis said my goal is to hold on to my employees , but it will mean a lot of sacrifice in ordinary times , his 15 butchers process roughly 60 tons of meat a week , about 90 percent of it beef since the recent scare began , beef sales have dropped about 22 tons a week he has made up some of that loss through increased sales of lamb , pork and veal others have tried to cushion their businesses by selling organically raised beef their sales have risen 15 to 20 percent in france since november , according to the government exports outside the european union have dropped , as countries in eastern europe , the middle east and elsewhere banned west european beef after mad cow concerns were reignited in france , the government is offering subsidized loans at 15 percent interest to tide over suffering businesses , but mr denis hopes to ride out the storm without borrowing he bases his hope for a quick recovery on what he saw in britain , where mad cow disease first erupted in the late 1980 s the demand for beef , after initially plummeting , rebounded there when consumers realized how much prices had fallen and how far the government had gone in culling animals at risk of developing the disease
except for a few judges and school board members , no asianamerican has ever held elected office in new york city none has ever filibustered against a bill or shouted down an opponent on the city council floor a telling sign of the odd fact of their absence from politics was evident at a reception at the city hall restaurant in tribeca on tuesday for 12 of the 13 asianamerican candidates for the city council none of them hogged the microphone as they addressed about 150 people under the barrelvaulted ceiling of a crowded downstairs room , they generally respected the threeminute limit though they gathered under the unifying rubric of asianamerican candidates , there were differences among them for one , they have come from several different countries china , taiwan , bangladesh , south korea , india and india by way of the caribbean and some of them are expected to oppose each other as they fight for seven council seats in democratic primaries in lower manhattan and flushing , queens , next september but all of them agreed that the odd fact must change and with twothirds of council seats up for grabs this year because of term limits , now may be the time we have 10 percent of the population but 0 percent of the governance , said parag khandhar , a policy analyst for the asian american federation of new york , which sponsored the event he called this a landmark year , however , because no more than five asianamericans had run in past council elections four of the thirteen candidates are women one is margaret chin , who is running in district 1 in lower manhattan , which covers chinatown i want to move the asianamerican community into the mainstream , she said , so we can work for education reform , more housing and better access to medical care if her list of issues sounds like it could appeal to all kinds of voters , that was probably by design several speakers , including ms chin , appealed for support not because they were asianamerican but because , they said , they were the best candidate yet , an informal poll of those gathered at the event , almost all of them asianamerican , revealed a kind of emerging political infrastructure there was hardly a nonpolitician to be found among the networking members of tenant and civic associations , business councils and political clubs it s reminiscent of every immigrant group in new york city , said matt aubry , an advisor to john liu , a candidate in district 20 in flushing like the italians , irish and africanamericans , it s time for asianamericans to step into political legitimacy jim o'grady photo asianamerican candidates for city council gathering at the city hall restaurant \( justin lane for the new york times \)

the rev al sharpton and fernando ferrer , a democratic candidate for mayor , met for a private breakfast in harlem yesterday , trying to end a weeklong dispute and arrange the sharpton endorsement that mr ferrer has intensely courted in an interview after the breakfast , mr sharpton softened his demand that mr ferrer , the bronx borough president , pledge to endorse blacks in at least two political races this year as part of an effort to create a blackhispanic coalition instead , mr sharpton said he would be satisfied if mr ferrer pledged merely to support qualified black candidates in the fall elections unlike mr sharpton s highprofile meetings with the other three major democratic mayoral candidates , to which he invited television crews , this one was kept relatively under wraps the two men met for 40 minutes at amy ruth s , a soul food restaurant on west 116th street owned by mr sharpton s friend and former chief of staff , carl redding mr sharpton , who said he was dieting , had coffee and toast mr ferrer , a vegetable omelet mr sharpton said he did not alert television stations because i wanted to be firm with freddy in private we cleared the air on a lot of things , mr sharpton said one , he says that he does not deal with race , he deals with merit i said that i was also dealing with merit , and i talked about historically , that blacks have been excluded he said he told mr ferrer i'm not asking for blacks to have an advantage because of race i'm asking for blacks not to have a disadvantage because of race what i'm saying that we 've been excluded with merit mr ferrer offered scant details on what he described as a lovely breakfast my sense is that it was a breakfast to really clear the air of the events of the last week , he said , and for us to talk directly instead of in the newspapers the events of last week included mr sharpton s laying out conditions that mr ferrer would have to meet to win his endorsement and mr sharpton repeatedly assailed mr ferrer s campaign , saying it was trying to railroad him into its camp by saying that if mr sharpton went with one of the three white , nonhispanic candidates , he would be blamed for another failure by black and hispanic leaders to create a political coalition mr ferrer is seeking to become new york s first puerto rican mayor mr sharpton said that mr ferrer could not pressure him to join such a coalition without helping to elect blacks as well to public office to that end , he called on mr ferrer last week to endorse william c thompson jr , the former board of education president , who is black , to be city comptroller he also said he wanted mr ferrer to endorse a black for bronx borough president , even though no blacks have joined the race also , he said he wanted mr ferrer to support norman siegel , the former executive director of the new york civil liberties union , whom mr sharpton pointedly noted is jewish , for public advocate after a day of consideration , mr ferrer said he would not accept the conditions mr sharpton said that he had raised none of those names with mr ferrer yesterday mr sharpton said that he would be satisfied specifically that he will not exclude people from the ticket because they are black , and that the policies that he s going to run on are what we stand for as a movement mr sharpton s decision to make the demands so publicly set off a furor , and lead some democrats to suggest that his endorsement would not be as much of a prize as mr ferrer had originally hoped both mr sharpton and mr ferrer disputed that suggestion photo fernando ferrer and the rev al sharpton outside amy ruth s restaurant on west 116th street yesterday \( angel franco the new york times \)
united nations , oct 17 at his first news conference since being named the united nations point man on afghanistan , lakhdar brahimi stressed today that the quest was only beginning for what to do about afghanistan once the bombing was over and the taliban defeated diplomats said his private message has been that all options are bad we 've got to be very careful , said mr brahimi , an algerian diplomat , in what soon became a slogan it s a new situation our options are open do n't rush to any solution the united nations is definitely not seeking to form a protectorate , he said , and it should never rush into sending a peacekeeping operation the afghans , he reminded reporters , were a nation that had never accepted foreign troops , islamic or otherwise we cannot produce a solution out of a hat to this problem , said mr brahimi , who resigned in 1999 as special representative for afghanistan out of frustration all we can do is bring the parties that have a say together and we will go wherever and whenever it is useful diplomats who had met with mr brahimi on tuesday in a closed session of the security council said his caution was not political evasion but a reflection of a hard truth that he had impressed on the council that a bitterly fragmented country , one with a marginal infrastructure , no national army but huge amounts of arms and surrounded by nervous and unstable neighbors , offered no easy solutions the task at hand , the diplomats said , was to identify the one least bad option and to determine what it would take to make it work the various options that have been raised include holding a conclave of tribal leaders to form a broad coalition under the symbolic leadership of the deposed 87yearold afghan king , mohammad zahir shah forming a united nations peacekeeping force and a united nations administration or sending in a muslim security force , as turkey has proposed but none of these were recommended at the council meeting , and diplomats involved in the consultations agreed that the discussions dwelt more on the enormous internal and regional complexity of the problem than on any concrete solution the positive message from washington is that there s real will and a real goal , one western diplomat said but i'm not sure any concrete steps on how to get there are jelling yet that problem has become increasingly evident in recent weeks in washington officials there have acknowledged , for example , that the central intelligence agency has so far failed to identify any elements in the dominant pashtun ethnic group , in which the taliban has its roots , that could become part of a new ruling coalition without the pashtun , a government would not function , and would not be accepted by pakistan , which is suspicious of the ethnic uzbeks and tajiks of the opposition northern alliance since being reappointed special representative to afghanistan by secretary general kofi annan , mr brahimi has had consultations in paris and london on thursday he is scheduled to meet with richard n haass , the state department director of policy planning , who has been named special coordinator for afghanistan , and on friday he plans to hold further talks with american officials in washington in general , the search for a posttaliban administration has become a major preoccupation the issue was a central theme of secretary of state colin l powell s talks earlier this week with gen pervez musharraf , the pakistan president , and other southern asian leaders , and mr haass has traveled to rome to meet with mr zahir , who has been suggested as a uniting symbol for the opposing afghan factions officials from britain , france and germany plan to meet in ghent , belgium , on friday to discuss afghanistan the fundamental problem is to bring order to a country that has known none in almost three decades afghanistan has been wracked with civil strife more or less continuously since mr zahir , who had ruled for 40 years , was overthrown in 1973 by his cousin , mohammad daoud five years later , mr daoud was overthrown and killed in a communistled revolution , opening a struggle among procommunist factions in december 1979 , the soviet army marched in to try to end that strife , but instead touched off a civil war that lasted a decade when the soviets left , the rebel factions who fought against them , each heavily armed with american and captured soviet weapons , started fighting one another the taliban , a militant islamic group , came to prominence in early 1995 largely as a response to fatigue with the war they quickly gathered strength , taking first kandahar and then , in september 1996 , the capital , kabul their opponents were driven north , where they formed the loose northern alliance the taliban , with their roots among the pashtun , were at first a popular antidote to the endless civil fighting among rival groups , and to the corruption and lawlessness that had spread through the land inexperienced in politics , economics or cultural affairs , the taliban set about building a society on strict islamic principles , banning television , music and movies , introducing public executions and amputations and barring women from jobs and schools the taliban also gave refuge to osama bin laden when he had to leave sudan , welcoming him as a comrade from the struggle against soviet forces and as a muslim hero but the taliban never formed a formal administration , and it is this void that now confronts the united states and its allies with a dangerous vacuum , and possible new civil war , if the movement is removed from power they have no national army , said barnett rubin , an expert on central asia at new york university the taliban army , which includes al qaeda , is an army of factions if any army enters kabul , they 'll have a civil war there s no treasury , no ministry of finance , no central bank , nowhere to put the reconstruction money there s no judiciary , no disputeresolution mechanism the enormous challenge , mr brahimi said , was not new , and his frustration at failing to achieve any progress there persuaded him to quit in 1999 after two years as special united nations representative at that time , he said , the afghan factions saw only two options total victory or war and the rest of the world had no interest in the country now the situation has changed , he said it s reasonable to expect that the afghans will not have the second option , and also , quite clearly , there is a very real political will that is emerging and consolidating to support the united nations in providing relief , in the peacemaking effort and later this is very substantial change , and i think it is reasonable to think that perhaps we can do something now photo

nearly a month ago , federal inspectors visited a westchester nursing home and quickly determined that the residents were in immediate jeopardy because of medical neglect , stifling heat and unsafe conditions the inspectors threatened to end government payments to the home , the chandler care center at 31 overton road in ossining , unless the owner , samuel klein , submitted a detailed plan to correct the problems mr klein , a real estate developer from greenwich , conn , chose instead to close the home days later the findings came after the state health department , responding to complaints from staff members , inspected the center 12 times over the previous year and found no evidence of substandard care , said danielle grush , a spokeswoman for the federal agency , the centers for medicare and medicaid services now , federal inspectors who asked the state inspectors to return last month for the more extensive survey that resulted in the finding of immediate jeopardy are seeking the state s inspection records to review why the health department gave chandler a relatively clean bill of health after the earlier visits in addition , the state attorney general s medicaid fraud unit is investigating whether chronic food and supply shortages at the home reported by staff members resulted from a diversion of medicaid money the investigation is in the early stages , but we regard it as a significant one , said darren dopp , a spokesman for the attorney general , eliot l spitzer it involves a careful review of medicaid billings over the last several years mr klein s lawyer , jerome levy , a former counsel for the state health department , said that the troubles at chandler were caused not by inadequate care or supply shortages , but by discontented employees whose complaints prompted the investigations and led to an exodus of staff members , including six administrators in two years there were certain breakdowns in the systems , and the situation was clearly not a good one , mr levy said but he added that the attorney general s investigation was a result of hostile employees who know what levers to push mr klein , who has developed hotels and office buildings in connecticut and on long island , has not been charged with any wrongdoing a number of former senior nurses , administrators and patients said that they had endured shortages of basic supplies like milk , laundry detergent and heating oil , while state inspectors did nothing they also contend that mr klein had stopped paying some bills at chandler , and that he had intended for months to close the center and move the residents to another westchester nursing home he owned , treetops , in mohegan lake according to state records , mr klein applied to the state health department in march 2000 for permission to close chandler and transfer residents to treetops , after agreeing to make 22 million in structural changes to the nursing home the health department approved this plan in february 2001 but mr levy , his lawyer , denies that chandler s troubles were related to a plan to close the center in a statement yesterday , the health department said that it had monitored the care at chandler carefully , responded to complaints and led the final inspection that found that residents were facing harm the statement was also careful to point out that mr klein s application to transfer the residents was reviewed like any other and took almost a year to be approved fortyfour residents were living at chandler when it was closed according to mr levy , none of them went to treetops treetops was too far away , i guess , he said former staff members at chandler contend that mr klein had stopped paying his vendors in a letter dated june 26 , 2001 , which was provided to a reporter by an advocate for nursing home residents , a pharmacy threatened to stop delivery , saying that mr klein had failed to pay 83 , 000 for supplies at chandler melvin aaron , the administrator at chandler from august 2000 to january 2001 , when , he said , he resigned , described similar hardships we were critically low on disposable diapers and things for daily operation , he said deliveries were made cod on occasion , we went out and bought certain things vendors would say , 'if we do n't get the check , we 're not making the delivery , ' or they turned the truck around and would n't come nurses said that patients were left to spend their own money for basic supplies like sterile gauze one nurse , joann moroz , said that she paid 82 for a glucometer , a device that measures the blood sugar of diabetics an infestation of drain flies left helpless residents swarmed with flies in their noses and mouths , said ms moroz and other staff members but the state health department said in its statement that before the findings on july 30 that it uncovered with federal inspectors present , it found no evidence of a fly infestation or supply shortages photo a former administrator at the chandler care center in ossining , ny , said the center was sometimes critically low on necessary supplies \( george m gutierrez for the new york times \)

none of the brooklyn kings were picked in the nba draft wednesday , but that did not stop them from hoping they would play in the nba some day that is mostly what the kings , players in the united states basketball league , do hope maybe a few will be invited to try out for a pro team some will go overseas to play and others will go about their day jobs until the next usbl season , when they will try again the 16yearold usbl publicizes itself as the league of opportunity it is where those who are not drafted by the nba often find themselves getting exposure , staying in shape and facing formidable competition the 10team usbl ends its season tonight with the championship game in bethlehem , pa , between dodge city and pennsylvania more than 130 former usbl players have advanced to the nba , including anthony mason and avery johnson this year s edition of the kings included former college players like reggie jessie from st john s and allen griffin from syracuse they were familiar names who drew little attention during the usbl season this is where you get to work on your game , said corey williams , a 23yearold guard for the kings who averaged 22 points it s not the nba , but it s a couple of steps away from the nba kenny charles , a twotime allamerican at fordham and the coach of the kings , knew he was going to the nba when he graduated in 1973 he was picked by buffalo in the third round of the draft it was not until after he left the nba that he began to have doubts about what he wanted to do with his life when charles , who played six seasons in the nba , including a stop in atlanta , left the league following the 197879 season , he took a long break from basketball before returning to the game , he was an analyst for espn , a law student , a stockbroker and a director of a city youth program one of the things that really had not been addressed in my life , i never took any time to pursue any basketball employment , charles said it was almost as though it were too easy it took me a while to come to that realization after i did i was trying to figure out how i would get back into basketball in 1994 , he started an independent referee organization , which is involved mostly in neighborhood tournaments last year , he was approached by one of the kings' owners to become a part of the team that brought professional basketball to brooklyn in 1999 charles joined the kings as a general manager , but halfway through last season he also became the coach his responsibilities include washing dirty jerseys , negotiating salary contracts with agents , sweeping the court before games , selling tickets and teaching 12 young men what he knows about playing in the nba i run my practice geared toward what i know the pros will be looking at , charles said can you hit a middlerange jumper \? can you take the ball to the basket \? they start to realize how far away they are from the pros but they also realize what they have to do to get there williams , who graduated from alabama state in 2000 , spent a year touring with the harlem globetrotters he played this season with the kings and was invited to try out with a pro team in south korea he expects to be playing overseas this fall but williams is not sure what comes next none of the kings can look very far into the future , and none know when or if they might get to the nba they just keep playing , waiting for their chance when you see a guy in the nba and the announcer may just say matteroffactly that he started out in the usbl , that sentence could take a week to explain what he had to endure just to get to the game , charles said usbl players earn about 350 a week in an eightweek season teams travel by bus and train , rarely by plane the kings have changed hands three times in three years and are in the process of being sold again it s a great night in the usbl when the game starts on time , both teams get there on time and the referees are there , charles said if you happened to have a great attendance , that s a perk the kings , who finished the season 1217 , averaged about 100 fans at the medgar evers college gym it is the same gym charles played in while in high school when the building was part of brooklyn prep he used to play pickup games against his teachers there now he walks the sidelines , barking his favorite line to his players , they do n't do that in the nba ! charles is a familiar figure in brooklyn , where he lives , not because he played in the nba , but because he is so involved in the community his players admire him his experience , they say , speaks for itself he has been where they want to be i missed basketball more now because i see that i'm helping guys to understand where they need to go , charles said , and i probably could have done that a lot sooner in life photo brooklyn kings coach kenny charles is a mentor to players with nba aspirations \( mary dibiase blaich for the new york times \)
hong kong few public officials here talk as mike rowse does a ratatattat of jokes , stories and epithets delivered in a workaday accent worlds away from the pukka tones of a classic british colonial when britain returned hong kong to china in 1997 , about 100 british civil servants stayed behind , blending into this increasingly chinese society with varying success mr rowse s populist style played well , and he has become one of the most senior british officials but he has gone a giant step further in cozying up to the locals four months ago , he renounced his british citizenship to become a chinese national the decision , he said , was driven in part by his new post as director general of hong kong s investment promotion agency , invest hk i'm a salesman for hong kong , said mr rowse , 52 , who came here in 1972 as a backpacker i thought 'i want to travel on a hong kong passport i want to show that i bought the product myself' mr rowse cannot speak , read or write chinese he cheers for the manchester united soccer team and he parries a question about his loyalty toward the communist government , saying , that s a private matter but on the subject of his adopted city , he preaches with the zeal of a true believer not only does he think that hong kong is the best destination in asia for foreign companies and investors , he believes its role will grow after china joins the world trade organization this month mr rowse notes that the number of foreign companies that have established regional offices in hong kong has risen 30 percent the last two years , to 3 , 237 of those , almost onethird , or 944 , use hong kong as their asian headquarters , putting it comfortably ahead of rivals like shanghai and singapore the increase is not because i'm tall , slim and incredibly goodlooking , said mr rowse , who is none of the above it s because they are saying , 'china is going to be in the wto , we want to be in china , where are we going to do it from \? ' overwhelmingly , the answer is hong kong to skeptics , the statistics merely indicate that the city is in its last cycle as a middleman for china and the world after deng xiaoping opened china s economy in 1978 , hong kong became an entrep t for goods moving in and out of the country in recent years , it supplied bankers , lawyers and accountants to help foreigners make sense of the chinese market as china pulls down its walls , many analysts say the foreign firms will no longer need this help with beijing subscribing to standard rules for trade and investment , they say these companies will be able to bypass hong kong and deal directly with cities throughout china some see a remark made in 1999 by the prime minister of china , zhu rongji , as prophetic in the future , mr zhu said , shanghai would be the new york of china while hong kong would be the toronto i think china s entry into the wto will be more negative than positive for hong kong , said marc faber , a money manager who runs his own investment advisory firm as china becomes more of an open society , the whole of china will become more like hong kong so the advantages of having an office there will diminish mr faber also said the city would be handicapped by its costs , which are among the highest in asia after 28 years here , mr faber moved last year to chiang mai , in thailand , because it is so much cheaper hong kong s costs have aggravated the effects of the global downturn on friday , hong kong said its economy contracted in the third quarter , putting the city on the verge of its second recession since the asian financial crisis in 1997 as china booms , the contrast between a sickly hong kong and its robust motherland is hard to avoid while some marquee companies , like boeing , have come to town recently , others are leaving walmart stores , which used to do its procurement here , recently moved to shenzhen , a chinese boom town on the hong kong border hsbc , known locally as hong kong bank , moved its china headquarters to shanghai last year in the battle for hong kong s franchise , shanghai has replaced singapore as the rival that people here fear most it has thrusting skyscrapers , stylish restaurants and powerful patrons in prime minister zhu and president jiang zemin but mr rowse is unmoved by shanghai s charms saying i have to couch this point carefully , he noted that the towers in the city s vaunted pudong business district were still halfempty and he said shanghai could not compete with hong kong s rule of law or free flow of information subtlety is not mr rowse s strong suit through a career that has included stints as a caption writer at a local newspaper and as an investigator for hong kong s anticorruption agency , mr rowse has developed a reputation as a blunt , harddriving operator , unafraid to make enemies he is a takenoprisoners kind of guy , said kerry mcglynn , a former spokesman for the last british governor , chris patten his direct manner does n't endear him to our more cautious colleagues but he gets things done perhaps his signal achievement was negotiating the 1999 deal with the walt disney company to build a theme park here he had to contend with disney s famously tough negotiators and with other chinese cities , notably shanghai , which were lobbying ardently for the project i believe quite honestly , without him in that role , the project never would have been realized , said steve tight , the managing director of hong kong disneyland i ca n't think of the number of times we reached a bottleneck , and he was the person to break through with a creative solution critics here say those creative solutions mainly helped disney with hong kong bearing ninetenths of the park s 36 billion in costs , commentators sniped that mickey mouse had taken mr rowse to the cleaners nonsense , he responded \( actually , he used a common british expletive that means the same thing \) disney bragged about the deal to their shareholders , and i think some people accepted that at face value , he said , adding that disneyland would pay huge longterm dividends the theme park is not scheduled to open until late 2005 or early 2006 , but mr rowse said he would be here for it he said his decision to take chinese citizenship was prompted by his realization that he never planned to return to britain he has been married twice , both times to hong kong chinese friends say his current wife , and four children , carry british passports he would not discuss their status mr rowse is the only british civil servant known to have switched his citizenship to china the move won praise from his bosses , though some people suggest that he is merely setting himself for future promotions it was n't a single decision , mr rowse said , objecting mildly it was a series of lifetime choices suddenly , you find that at every fork of the road , you 've chosen to be chinese photo mike rowse , head of an agency that promotes investment in hong kong , has become a citizen of china \( daniel j groshong tayo photo group , for the new york times \)
at approximately 12 45 yesterday morning , someone spoke the unspeakable o word to joe torre old were the yankees old \? they had been shut out , 20 , by the oakland athletics and now trailed , two games to none , in their threeoffivegame series time after time in clutch situations , tim hudson , the young righthander for the a s , had turned the yankees back in game 2 in the sixth inning , with two runners on and two out , hudson faced paul o'neill in a mammoth battle and a typical yankee stadium moment more than 56 , 000 fans on their feet going wild , trying to conjure up some yankee magic unavailable hudson got o'neill to fly out in the seventh , with two runners on base and two out , hudson got scott brosius to hit an easy grounder to second for a forceout in the ninth , with two runners on and the fans going wild , it was reliever jason isringhausen s turn he struck out jorge posada and then got david justice and brosius to pop up so at 12 45 yesterday morning , someone wanted to know was oakland making the yankees look old \? torre grunted and smiled i do n't know about old , but they 're certainly making us eat some dust right now because of the way they 're playing us , he said they 're hitting the home runs we know they are able to do that and we have n't been able to stop them from doing that i do n't believe that a team gets old overnight i ca n't use any excuse here , other than crediting their team last year , the yankees defeated oakland , three games to two , in the first round of the playoffs , including a victory in oakland in game 5 but this is an entirely different a s team last year , we really did n't know what to expect , for the most part , hudson said yesterday it was the first time for most of us , we played them with a lot of respect we felt we were a better team coming in this time still , taking the first two games and holding the yankees to three runs was not realistically on the agenda we did n't expect to come in here and win two games in yankee stadium against that club , hudson said the common wisdom is that yankees fans are witnessing the beginning of a transition the ascendancy of the oakland athletics and the decline of the mighty yankees while yankees players are n't conceding the series to oakland , andy pettitte conceded that the athletics' time has probably arrived i think you 're seeing them as a team growing up , he said the way you grow up is go out there and get in some pressurepacked situations like they did tonight and get out of jams that s bringing your game to a different level the more situations you 're in , the more times you have to do it , the easier it becomes the yankees have enjoyed an extraordinary run these last five seasons last fall , they became only the fourth team in major league history to win three or more consecutive world series titles even for a team with deep pockets , putting together a championship team is daunting combining farmteam prospects with free agents , knowing which pieces to discard and which to add without destroying the chemistry but do n't mistake this for an obituary odd as it may seem , that would be premature for one thing , the issue of the yankees' age probably has more to do with emotional duress those of us who live and work in new york including the yankees probably underestimate the emotional drain of the past four weeks all the flagwaving and anthemsinging and americashouting the debates over peace versus war , security versus liberty all of this along with the normal wear and tear of living in a bustling metropolis like new york takes an emotional toll the start of thursday s game was delayed for president bush s news conference after the game , pettitte admitted that he was out of kilter before he pitched it was a weird game , he said to walk out there , to warm up , to have the president giving his speech on the big screen it was just a weird night all things considered , getting away from new york may help the yankees rediscover their groove we hope so , torre said i do n't sense that we 're uptight we 're grinding it and we 're getting frustrated , but we 've played well on the road we just need to go out and win a ballgame yankees fans have come to expect miraculous comebacks , but this one might have to be the biggest yet the margin for error has shrunk to zero photo david justice \( barton silverman \)
from headlines long forgotten new york s last gasp \? living dangerously in new york , bankrupt new york no funds for fun city , is new york city worth saving \? new york has been through tough times before and with the blow that the terrorist attacks have delivered to an already shaky local and national economy , it is about to go through them again but amid the mourning for the dead at the world trade center , elegies for new york as a vital business center and for skyscrapers , for dense concentrations of people , for urban life in general are no more likely to be right this time than they were in the past the city will never be the same , of course but nothing is ever the same in a city like new york companies , as they have before , will reexamine where they put their headquarters many wall street offices will continue to spread beyond lower manhattan into other parts of the city and the surrounding region for the next year or so , too , the local economy is bound to shrink , jobs will be lost and government budgets will be under increasing strain yet none of that should extinguish the aspiration , enterprise and hard work that truly stirs the new york urban economy indeed , the disaster has revealed unexpected qualities of grit , sacrifice and cooperation that , even as they fade into memory , will serve as a foundation for the rebuilding and renewal to come the new mood is visible everywhere in the subways and on streets , julie talen , a filmmaker who lives in soho , wrote in an email message to friends and family , strangers , instead of looking away in the millisecond glance that defines the new yorker we hold each other s gazes , and sort of search our faces , for what we have lost , for reassurance , for simple connection on the west side highway , spontaneous groups of new yorkers cheer and clap and wave flags and posters cheering the sootcovered weary firefighters and rescuers coming out and the fresh ones going in , she continued it s all a new kind of new york we 're all transformed new york is not unique in its ability to bounce back following the 1992 riots in los angeles , which came as southern california was reeling from an economic malaise tied largely to the shrinkage of its military contractors after the cold war , even many local boosters threw in the towel running for mayor , richard riordan described los angeles as a dysfunctional city and a time magazine cover article asked is the city of angels going to hell \? but the northridge earthquake of 1994 , instead of knocking the city out for the count , was a catalyst for the broadbased revival that was already under way economic growth surged throughout the late 1990 s , and the city resumed its traditional role as a magnet for migrants from elsewhere in the united states and abroad racked by riots and then a devastating earthquake , many predicted that our city would become something of a modernday carthage , said joel kotkin , a los angelesbased author yet in less than five years , we have rebounded from our nadir to a new era of metropolitan growth and selfconfidence miami , also torn by racial polarization , was condemned as america s most dangerous city in the 1980 s and early 1990 s yet after being hit by the most costly hurricane in history , it , too , has made a remarkable comeback what gives all these urban centers their resilience is their diversity and their openness to strangers new york , los angeles and miami like few other cities in the country draw their strength from outsiders as long as new people , particularly adventurous and ambitious young people , dream of coming to places like new york , their economies will prosper that , of course , is what makes the world trade center attack such a nightmare we ache over the absence of the twin towers , not because of the buildings that were destroyed \( something much better can be built in their place \) , but because of the thousands of lives lost many of those people were just beginning their careers and their families new york s most recent boom would not have been so stunning without the sharp reduction in crime that occurred throughout much of the 1990 s that was true in other big cities as well restoring a sense of security this time from the threat of further terror attacks is therefore essential to maintaining the urban revival of recent years once fear eases , though , the pull that new york has long exerted on newcomers should reassert itself and with that , the city will rise from the ashes again
to win backing for his education bill , president bush abandoned privateschool vouchers for pupils in lowscoring public schools he then pledged to find other ways to support private education the vow wo n't mean much using public money for private school has little support , because it is so impractical without vast spending \( or inconceivable draining of dollars from public schools \) , there wo n't be enough federal money to enhance private education s appeal the tax cut that congress passed last month offers an example it provides for taxadvantaged education savings accounts to help send children to private schools that provision s sponsor , senator tim hutchinson , republican of arkansas , said it would be a potential floodgate for private education hardly education savings accounts are like roth ira s , in which workers earmark aftertax savings for retirement and do n't pay tax on earnings from interest , dividends or capital gains like the traditional ira , the roth ira has flopped few of those eligible contribute similarly , the school accounts , which expand a break previously allowed only for college savings , will have little impact the provision allows aftertax savings of up to 2 , 000 a year to help pay privateschool costs if money is withdrawn to pay tuition or other expenses , taxes will not have to be paid on the earnings if parents start saving at a child s birth , they might build an account for five years before they start paying tuition if savings earn 7 percent a year \( a generous assumption \) , they will produce earnings of 2 , 307 in that time for a family in the 28 percent bracket , the total tax savings would be only 646 incentives are yet smaller because private school fees almost always exceed 2 , 000 if they are 5 , 000 , parents who can continue saving 2 , 000 a year \( but no more \) after the child begins school will immediately have to dip into the account to cover tuition , diluting the tax savings by fifth grade , the account will be empty president bush wanted a savings limit of 5 , 000 a year , not 2 , 000 earnings would then have been greater but few families can save even 2 , 000 , so the number of those making a full contribution would fall if the limit rose and while the tax break is bigger in upper brackets , even there the benefits are so small that most families wo n't be spurred to switch from public schools instead , the new accounts mostly subsidize wealthier families whose children already attend private school parents can also use the break to subsidize supplies for teaching at home , but the benefits are too small to stimulate home schooling president bush s other , more radical alternative would allow families to subtract private school costs from income taxes owed like vouchers , this taxcredit proposal would permit parents to pay tuition \( up to whatever limit the provision sets \) at no cost to themselves taxes would be cut by the amount of private school fees but unlike vouchers , tax credits mostly benefit the upper middle class the reason is that private tuition is more than most families' tax liability the credit could help lowerincome families only if it was refundable paid even to those who owed no taxes but if the limit of the refundable credit was low \( say , 2 , 000 \) , few could afford the difference between the credit and tuition if it was high \( say , 5 , 000 \) , it would be unaffordable to the treasury if many families took it advocates of credits also want to let philanthropists or corporations subtract from their taxes the amount of gifts to private school scholarship funds this would cause the public cost of credits to explode , and would not solve other practical difficulties unfilled privateschool seats in urban areas are few \( mostly in catholic schools where parishioners moved to the suburbs \) but even at taxsubsidized tuition rates of 5 , 000 , new schools could not afford to enter the market private companies operating public schools on contract now demand fees equal to what public schools spend before parents voted its bid down , the edison company said it needed 10 , 000 a pupil from new york city to run a viable urban school such a plan could not be marketed privately to families who got tax credits of 2 , 000 or even 5 , 000 a child so like the savings accounts , tax credits would mostly benefit families with children already in private schools with the president s push for vouchers dead for now , he and his allies are advancing alternatives but so far , none of them compute until a better idea comes along , those wanting to improve education will still have to focus on public schools , not private , for reform drawing \( david suter \)
a few weeks ago , at the yearend sanex wta tour championships in munich , a potential dream final between two fetchingly different personalities from the united states , lindsay davenport and serena williams , was ruined when davenport came up lame and had to concede the match shortly thereafter , at the atp tour s championships in sydney , australia , 20yearold lleyton hewitt , as combative as a badger , became the youngest man to earn the yearend no 1 ranking while winning the masters cup there was a time , and not that long ago , when all this would have mattered to the american audience , when a new generation of diehard tennis fans traipsed off to the arena dressed in tennis togs , filling the joint for the tours' championships who from that era can forget the buzz generated by the clash at a packed madison square garden in january 1977 between jimmy connors and guillermo vilas \( vilas won , 75 in the third \) , or the 1976 virginia slims final between chris evert and evonne goolagong in los angeles \( goolagong won , 63 , 57 , 63 \) \? those days have melted into the historical fog , fit for reinvention for a baffled audience on whatever nostalgia show espn happens to develop next , because tennis in the united states increasingly struggles to remain a blip on the radar screen of the sporting public s consciousness did you sit rapt before the television screen , trying to transmit vibes that , short of morphing yevgeny kafelnikov into connors , would at least make kafelnikov play as if he actually cared \? these are difficult days for tennis i have covered the sport for 25 years , and the one thing i am pretty sure about is that it deserves a fate better than being locked in mortal combat for attention and television rating numbers with figure skating oh , the evangelists for the game , paid and otherwise , will tell you that women s tennis broke ratings records this summer , peaking with the united states open final between the sisters sledgehammer , venus and serena williams \( with a 68 rating , all or part of that match was said to have been watched by an estimated 227 million viewers \) the atp tour will point to consistently growing attendance figures at many of its touraments worldwide , and the united states tennis association will throw some numbers at you to demonstrate the massive popularity and success of the open and therein lies a big part of the problem with every passing year , the open looks more and more like an entertainment spectacle at which a little tennis is played to legitimize the event , kind of a sporty lalapalooza for baby boomers i do n't think this is what billie jean king had in mind when she insisted on describing tennis players as entertainers i do n't think this is what jimmy connors was fantasizing about when he declared his intention to turn the open into an event that new york cabbies would rant and rave about to their fares tennis , it sometimes seems , is a sport that has lost not only its dedicated constituency but also its identity and there is a clear reason that tennis continues to send bizarre signals from a strange , conflicted netherworld found somewhere between a backstreet boys concert and wimbledon until 1968 , the major tournaments were contested by amateurs only , and the game was tightly run by sometimes autocratic national federations under the umbrella of the international tennis federation when the distinction between pros and amateurs was abolished and prize money entered the game , neither the international tennis federation nor the selfinterested new entrepreneurs could agree on where the fledging pro game was heading , much less shepherd it there tennis thus experienced a series of bloodbaths and palace coups , rather than a velvet revolution over the years , the internecine battles have drained the color from the game s face and saddled it with confusing , multiple personalities there s nothing intrinsically wrong with andre agassi playing a match dressed like a pirate but is that what tennis is , or is it pete sampras in simple whites , against the backdrop of wimbledon s pale green lawns , or can it be both and a few other things to boot \? the best way to understand the plight of tennis is to look at golf , once its demographic sister and rival unlike tennis , golf did not have a revolution and when it had the good fortune to produce a few stereotypebusting personalities like john daly and tiger woods , enough of a leadership structure existed to keep the game from going off like tennis in a thousand directions at once and ending up nowhere special golf certainly has its share of problems , beginning with the same basic challenge that tennis or any other upscale sport faces how to be exclusive without being exclusionary but golf knows what it is , and it recognizes the value and the powerful , if not wholly universal , appeal of its traditions and aesthetics in tennis , the idea that the fans ought to be quiet while the ball is in play has always been considered an evil vestige of the game s snooty roots so how come nobody is vigorously encouraging people in the golf galleries to shout and scream when the players are putting \? golf has kept its identity
washington , nov 26 the supreme court today upheld the census bureau s refusal last year to count mormon missionaries or other nongovernment american workers living overseas the policy cost utah , a state with a large number of missionaries , a chance to pick up a fourth house seat in the reallocation that followed the 2000 census ruling summarily in a suit that utah brought against the census bureau and the bureau s parent , the department of commerce , the justices offered no comment on the case they simply affirmed without opinion a ruling last april by a special threejudge federal district court in salt lake city , which held that there was no constitutional or statutory basis for utah s challenge to the census bureau s decision to count military and civilian federal employees but no other americans living abroad by excluding utah s 11 , 176 mormon missionaries abroad , the 2000 census left the state 857 people short of the number it needed for an added seat in the house of representatives the beneficiary was north carolina , which with only 107 mormon missionaries overseas but thousands of residents serving abroad in the military ended up the winner of the final house seat to be allocated on the basis of the new census after utah filed its lawsuit in january , north carolina intervened in the case to protect its victory , which increased its house delegation to 13 representatives from 12 raymond a hintze , utah s chief civil deputy attorney general , said in an interview today that while the state was extremely disappointed with the outcome of its lawsuit , it was not yet ready to give up its fight for a fourth seat earlier this month , utah filed a supreme court appeal in a second , so far unsuccessful , challenge to the census bureau , this one to the technique known as whole person imputation , which the bureau uses to assign a number of residents to a dwelling where census takers have not been able to perform an actual head count under this technique , the bureau assigns the number of residents whom it knows to be living at the nearest dwelling mr hintze said that in utah s view , this was a form of statistical sampling , which the supreme court has ruled is not to be used for the allocation of seats in the house of representatives in the missionary case that the supreme court decided today , utah v evans , no 01283 , the state sought any of three alternatives count all americans temporarily residing abroad count none or count those who , like mormon missionaries , had retained their ties to their home states and could readily be traced through administrative records in this respect , utah said , the missionaries were like federal employees the state maintained that it would have been entitled to a fourth seat under any of the three circumstances the district court did not dispute this but concluded that there was no basis for any of the state s demands the missionary population was not like federal employees , the court said , because a hugely disproportionate number of mormon missionaries , 46 percent , were from utah , while the population of federal employees overseas was more evenly distributed from among the american population at large the district court relied on a 1992 supreme court decision , franklin v massachusetts , that upheld the census bureau s decision for the 1990 census to allocate only federal military and civilian personnel and not other overseas americans utah s suit was joined by four utah residents who were serving as mormon missionaries the plaintiffs argued that the government s refusal to count the missionaries imposed a burden on mormon religious practice that was both illegal under a federal law , the religious freedom restoration act , and in violation of the free exercise clause of the first amendment the district court rejected the religious claims on the ground that the state had not shown that the mormons' practice of religion or religious beliefs was burdened in any way by the decision not to count the missionaries
the national symphony s two weekend concerts at carnegie hall provided something of a percussion festival , including edgard var se s classic ionisation for a whole orchestra of drums , cymbals , wood blocks and much else , as well as four fullscale concertos for evelyn glennie and to provide a grand finale for each evening two blockbusters with their percussion scoring reinforced ravel s bolero was given with its side drum first played alone by ms glennie gradually multiplying in the later stages until seven players were banging away , and revueltas s noche de los mayas had musicians right across the back of the platform hammering in exultant unison leonard slatkin was the conductor letting these things loose on the world of course , percussion playing is not just about making a great din it can also mean whispering delicacy , swiftness , the unexpected , rhythms of lacy intricacy as well as ramming pulsation , and with ms glennie at her best , as she was on the second night , these things were there but the concertos , all written for her , showed how the concept of a piece with solo percussionist so easily lures composers into an excess of force all four fell stewart wallace s gorilla in a cage got stuck in grooves of bigband rhythm george tsontakis s mirologhia had braying in the orchestra answered by the soloist in the same measure joan tower s strike zones \( an unfortunate title in the present context \) unwisely opened itself to moments of improvisation on cymbals and drums , encouraging ms glennie to hit out fast and furiously chen yi s simply named percussion concerto ended disappointingly with highlevel rapid beating to generate lowlevel excitement there were other similarities the pieces by mr tsontakis and ms chen were attempts at exploring roots in beijing opera for ms chen , whereas mr tsontakis s work took its title and some of its musical material from a greek tradition of lament perhaps because they were listening in to deep history , being struck by the ancientness of percussion sounds , both these composers also made use of the original human instrument , the voice so did mr wallace ms glennie s chanting was amplified in all three works , while mr tsontakis s also had some embarrassedsounding singing of byzantine hymns by the orchestra any concerto is a drama , and a percussion concerto more than most the soloist has to dash or athletically swivel from one instrument to another the sounds tend to come with exciting actions and ms glennie is an engaging performer to watch she did not need the appurtenances of featureless song , or of planned movements and positions \( in mr wallace s score \) indeed , the most effective piece was the one that had none of these ms tower s if uncertain in form \( though by no means as uncertain as the works by mr wallace and mr tsontakis \) , it included many beautiful moments , for the orchestra with or without the soloist late in the piece , two percussionists on the highest balcony struck up a dialogue of tintinnabulations with ms glennie , and these two continued into the conclusion rattling on castanets , they precipitated the end , and went on with undiminished intensity as it engulfed them the whole story of the sorcerer s apprentice was here in a few frightening seconds photo the percussionist evelyn glennie performing at carnegie hall on friday \( chris lee for the new york times \)
thirtyfive years ago , on a windswept saturday in east lansing , mich , a diabetic notre dame substitute quarterback named coley o'brien fell with the football and ended the most talked about game in college football history , not with a bang but with a whimper the game of the decade or , as many said , of the century had tremendous national coverage and appeal on nov 19 , 1966 , the notre dame fighting irish , ranked no 1 by the voters in the associated press and united press international polls , met the no 2 michigan state spartans in the final full week of the regular season to settle the issue of who should be the national champion both teams were undefeated and dominant nearly two dozen players from their combined rosters were eventually drafted by the pros no football game , college or pro , had ever been so anticipated \( the television ratings for the 1966 irishspartans game were higher than those for the first super bowl , between green bay and kansas city , two months later \) all over the country people worked their schedules around the game one michigan newspaper calculated that the lives of thousands of deer in michigan and indiana would be saved by taking potential hunters out of the woods and putting them in front of their television sets the game ended in a 1010 tie , which left no one satisfied , least of all fans of the university of alabama , bear bryant s defending national champion , led by quarterback ken stabler the crimson tide beat no 4 nebraska , 347 , in the sugar bowl to finish 110 , and still wound up no 3 in the voting behind the irish and the spartans , who each finished 901 the 1966 spartansirish clash remains a seminal moment in college football in nearly every respect , the game fit the definition of a classic it summed up everything in college sports that came before it and changed everything that came after it the national collegiate athletic association had allowed no more than one televised home game a season , but caved in to public pressure and permitted the game to be televised the bending of broadcast limitations started the flood of televised games that has resulted in a full menu of tv games every week nearly three decades later , notre dame alone would have its home games broadcast by one of the networks the controversy stirred by the final vote in the polls the irish nosed out the spartans for no 1 after beating southern california , 510 , the following week prompted the ap and upi to move back the voting until after the bowl games the irish had shunned bowl games on the premise that they interfered with final exams but the wire services' decision made it clear that notre dame would never again be able to vie for a national championship while staying home on new year s day within three years , notre dame entered the bowl scene the big ten soon dropped an archaic rule that did not allow its members to play in the rose bowl two years in a row or in any other bowl at all within a few years , big ten teams were playing in every bowl that would have them the number of bowl games expanded to meet the number of available teams more important than the money and the politics were the social implications coach duffy daugherty s 1965 and 1966 michigan state spartans were one of the first majorcollege powers to field a team with a nucleus of black stars \( notre dame had only one black player , the allamerican defensive end alan page \) the nonpareil spartan defense was led by defensive end bubba smith and the legendary rover back george webster jimmy raye was one of the first black players to play quarterback on a majorcollege team his favorite target was the allamerican gene washington the irish s smothering defense it shut out 6 of 10 opponents and allowed 31 points that season had the future hall of famers jim lynch and page the offense had running back rocky bleier \( a future vietnam war hero \) and the passcatch combination of terry hanratty and jim seymour the game of the century could never have lived up to the hype , and it was dominated by injuries , penalties , fumbles and interceptions the spartans took a 100 lead early in the second quarter the irish , despite the loss of hanratty to a shoulder separation , managed to struggle back and tie the score with two minutes to play , a sequence of plays began that ended in one of the biggest controversies in college football history faced with fourthand4 at his 36yard line , michigan state s daugherty chose to punt rather than go for a first down that gave notre dame possession on its 30 with 1 minute 24 seconds and two timeouts remaining o'brien moved the irish to fourthand1 at their 39 gambling , coach ara parseghian went for the first down he got it , and with the ball on the 41 and 10 seconds left , parseghian called for a rollout passrun option , but o'brien was sacked for a 7yard loss by smith faced with secondand17 with six seconds to play , o'brien ran to the 39 as time expired in the deluge of postgame controversy , no one remembered that only a few plays earlier , on his 39 , parseghian had gone for a first down and history forgot that with two minutes remaining , daugherty chose to kick the ball away college football would have other games of the century , but never one that captured the imagination of the entire country no college game can again be so controversial because none can be so important with the advent of overtime , coaches no longer have the option of playing for the tie , and controversies about whether or not to go for it are muted big games are now merely preliminaries to a dizzying series of conference championships and bowl matchups in 1998 the bowl championship series , an approved system for determining an official champion , did away with the mythical that usually accompanied the phrase national championship thus , one of college football s most cherished rituals the yearround debates over who should be , who was , and who would be ranked no 1 was history for better or for worse , what was unique about the game was gone , and college football settled down to accept its role as the nfl s junior partner photo when michigan state and notre dame chose to play for a tie in spartan stadium in east lansing 35 years ago , it proved to be a seminal moment for the college game \( michigan state sports information \)
late in the show on his first night back after the attacks on new york , following an emotional monologue about the anguish and rage of the country and of new york city , david letterman broke for a commercial with the microphones off , regis philbin , a guest on mr letterman s late show on cbs , leaned over to talk to him he was in agony , mr philbin said later about the show on sept 17 he was so worried about that first segment and what he had said he was really agonized over that , over whether he could possibly say anything that would matter at a time like this i said 'no , it was great you spoke from the gut' but i do n't think he believed me on a subsequent show mayor rudolph w giuliani , whom mr letterman had called the personification of courage on that first night back , told the host , i know you do n't want to hear it , but what you did in coming back the way you did , the way you spoke to people , it helped restore confidence in people mr letterman , who even in the best of times is afflicted with a chronic selfeffacement , said that he had come back on the air and spoken that way to the television audience simply because the mayor had urged new yorkers to get back as soon as possible to their normal lives at a time of horror and grief , mr letterman , by almost every account , distinguished himself by going back in front of the public , then gently testing how far comedy could go after 20 years of latenight comedy performances that won him acclaim for his inventiveness and wit , and occasional barbs for his flintiness and testiness , mr letterman is experiencing something he has never encountered before gratitude for his willingness to step up and lead the man who became known for comic irony , who had always looked askance at show business and much of life in general , has become the center of attention for a moment of pure sincerity it showed up in added viewers that first week late show scored one of its highest ratings in recent years , averaging more than six million viewers a night and even managing to squeak ahead of its main rival , jay leno s tonight show on nbc , among adults between ages 18 and 49 , who make up the most avidly soughtafter group of viewers mr letterman s sensitive firstnight performance , and the carefully calibrated steps into comedy on the succeeding nights , seemed to set a standard for other performers dave was establishing the process for others to follow , said garry shandling , who has been a host of latenight shows and has also satirized them i 've been out there on these shows i know how hard it is he was there , at the desk , clearly not using notes or a teleprompter and then on the next shows he knew how to be witty in just the right places , mr shandling added it made people feel it was ok , when we did n't quite know how to be ourselves jerry seinfeld was in the midst of a concert tour with his new standup comedy act i canceled a bunch of dates , he said it was a very hard decision , when you could go back to doing comedy then i saw the things letterman was doing he handled it so well one latenight rival , conan o'brien , who follows mr leno on nbc , even mentioned on his own first show after the attacks how mr letterman had set the tone a senior nbc executive , long associated with latenight programming , sought a comparison everybody looked to dave for the way to do this , the executive said if there s a johnny out there , it s dave the johnny of course is johnny carson , who dominated latenight television , starring on tonight for 30 years mr letterman , after almost 12 years at nbc , had wanted and expected to be his successor , but nbc passed him over in favor of mr leno \( a letterman joke after his heart operation a heart bypass is the surgery performed on me a bypass is what happened to me with the 'tonight' show \) mr letterman has trailed mr leno in the ratings for most of the time the two have gone head to head each weeknight but in dealing with the catastrophe mr letterman had an advantage of sorts he was in new york , while mr leno was 3 , 000 miles away in burbank , calif so mr letterman could tell a discreet new york joke and pull it off he could take advantage of his association with the city , built up over eight years of lambasting new york with the particular kind of humor that natives could love only from one of their own over the years and perhaps unintentionally , 'late show' has become a celebration of new york , said rob burnett , one of the show s executive producers new york has provided mr letterman with targets like taxi drivers who do n't believe in brakes and hotdog vendors with antifreeze in their water , and a ready cast of characters for comedy in the streets , like shopkeepers and tourists since he returned to the air , mr letterman has kept the focus on new york in a particular way , with guests like the mayor the fire commissioner , thomas von essen various new yorkbased network anchors and correspondents and show business figures attached to the city , like matthew broderick , a star of the producers what colors all of this is that we live in new york , jude brennan , another senior producer , said it s just in the air here she noted that the studio audiences have been filled with people involved in the rescue efforts , including firefighters and emergency workers every serious interview dave has done with someone who has information , like the mayor or the fire chief , the audience has been rapt , ms brennan said you could hear a pin drop in the theater normally , sepulchral silence would mean disaster for a comedian but mr letterman has reintroduced comedy to his show at a deliberate pace , taking baby steps , as ms brennan called them , emphasizing the benign , the silly , the nontopical no joke could touch directly on the tragedy in new york but slowly mr letterman tested ambiguous boundaries , introducing topics related to the events , like one joke about the rapper sean combs , known as p diddy , who had previously changed his stage name from puff daddy , getting so caught up in patriotic fervor that he decided to change his name again , to p doodle dandy instead of selecting fromtheheadlines topics for his popular top 10 lists , as has been the custom , mr letterman gravitated to offthewall topics , like top 10 things that almost rhyme with hat \( no 7 meat \) and top 10 signs your wife is having an affair with the jolly green giant \( no 3 your last two kids have been green \) none of this has been heavily planned , ms brennan said we just come in in the morning , she said , and sort of see how its going to go predictably , mr letterman does not think it has been going especially well he hates the shows , as always , mr burnett said the president and the mayor have said we need to get back to normal , so dave is doing his best by hating the shows he added , the serious answer is that dave s assessment of the show is that it is not significant in the least in the light of the things going on the audience apparently disagrees mr burnett cited an unbelievable outpouring of letters and email , mostly about mr letterman s effort to put words to the nation s reaction to the world trade center tragedy one example , from a captain in the emergency medical service i know this may sound very corny , but seeing you monday night made me think that dave is back and all will be ok in time photo senator hillary rodham clinton was among david letterman s guests \( associated press \)
in late 1994 , timothy mcveigh wrote a letter to the american legion does anyone even study history anymore \? he asked the word study was in capital letters , and the sentence closed with three question marks mr mcveigh was 25 years old and only a few months away from entering history himself by blowing up the alfred p murrah federal building in oklahoma city , killing 168 people today , he is to be put to death for his crime in a federal penitentiary in terre haute , ind , the first person to be executed by the federal government since 1963 into a saline drip , a technician will inject , in sequence , drugs to induce unconsciousness , stop breathing and cause cardiac arrest twentyfour witnesses will attest to whatever they can attest to the fulfillment of the sentence , the prisoner s manner of dying , the silence of the procedure itself mr mcveigh falsely believed that he had studied american history and that its meaning was embodied in the bomb blast he set off at 9 03 am on april 19 , 1995 he had , in his own mind , stepped out of the whirlwind of pamphlets and diatribes the world of demented gunshow prophets and paranoid fantasies like the turner diaries , from which he learned his history and into the whirlwind of action as a very young man , something gave mr mcveigh the conviction that he understood the irreducible logic of history , when , in fact , all he could see were the crumbs of paranoid propaganda that he swept together for himself that something the key to his reading of america was the gun he always carried one all other rights , to mr mcveigh , were secondary to that right to him , it defined the behavior of the federal government and the obligations of private citizens no other relationship , no other ethic mattered we have had six years to look into mr mcveigh s face what his eyes show us again and again is the sight of a man who is lost in his own delusional convictions many people , especially those who knew him as a boy , have insisted on his politeness , his selfcontrol , on the normal person they knew within him nearly everyone who has thought about him has tried , one way or another , to imagine the path that took him from his boyhood in pendleton , a small town in western new york , to his death in terre haute what is striking about mr mcveigh , however , is how short that path really was he foreclosed on history right out of high school , converting himself into a survivalist , obsessing about guns , working out a way of life that led , in the words of the poet william carlos williams , to a final and selfinflicted holocaust the army did not form mr mcveigh the gulf war did not alienate him he left the military only a little more completely who he was than when he joined it he was his own invention , formed in the vacuum of a broken family , seduced by an ideal of militant selfcontrol , tutored only in the infallible but utterly fallacious reasoning of outcasts devoted to overturning the government in pursuit of rights they already possessed we are left to wonder what chance event might have turned mr mcveigh into one of us , or perhaps into one of the merely embittered men who taught him so much about hatred but never chose to act upon it instead , he built a bomb in a truck , parked it in front of a building that to him symbolized the government role at ruby ridge and waco , and then blew it up it was an act of supreme cowardice , veiled , in mr mcveigh s mind , by the sterile language of warfare what makes his act more frightening , even now , is the realization that the oklahoma city bombing was a work of vengeance by a man who had never been wronged he had gone to waco while the siege of the branch davidian compound was still going on , and he had done there what the turner diaries encouraged him to do imagine himself on the inside , fighting the fbi and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms he could imagine that , but he could not imagine settling down , working , marrying , becoming domesticated , as he put it the gun he always carried dictated the role he played in his own selfdramatization he was politically na ve , a coldblooded murderer , a slow suicide , but a victim of only one thing , the power he felt when he thought about how much harm he could do despite the administrative fumblings of the fbi , mr mcveigh s guilt is as certain as certain can be there are no racial overtones to his conviction , no questions about his mental capacity or the quality of his legal representation he has expressed no remorse and , since his trial , has only damned himself further in the eyes of the american public with his brutally unfeeling comments about the oklahoma city bombing it remains to be seen whether mr mcveigh will have an afterlife in the martyrology of the survivalist fringe but to him , this execution is the final moment in the personal martyrdom he has been imagining for years , the very act he expects from the federal government some will say that there are at least 168 reasons to execute timothy mcveigh his death , foregone though it is by now , will redeem none of those lives as a society , we must value life more than he valued the lives he destroyed that is a faith that timothy mcveigh was unable to reach but which still lies within our power
the new york police department employs 465 captains , the group of senior officers from which its most prominent and powerful commanders are selected you can count the number of black men in captains' uniforms on two hands there are nine in 1990 , 77 percent of the department s sergeants were black men since then , the proportion of black men working as these frontline supervisors has fallen by more than a quarter , to 57 percent the absence of black men is similarly stark in the elite commands there are 59 officers in the aviation unit , which maintains and flies the department s fleet of helicopters one is black after a generation of diversifying its ranks , america s largest police department has undergone unmistakable change the proportion of women in uniform has risen more than sixfold since 1974 , with real advances made even among black women hispanic representation has increased by nearly 500 percent prodded by lawsuits and public demand , a department in which nearly 9 of 10 officers were white men has come perceptibly closer to resembling the city but the department has failed in one crucial respect for all the recruiting campaigns , the millions of dollars spent , the pledges by police commissioners and mayors to make the department reflect the city it polices , the advances have largely excluded black men personnel data show that the proportion of black males in uniform has increased to 92 percent from 77 percent since 1974 , and that modest increase was almost entirely a result of the merger with the betterintegrated housing and transit departments before the 1995 merger , the percentage of black men in the department had declined over two decades moreover , male black officers have been losing ground the proportion of male black supervisors has declined since 1990 the number in senior positions is down since 1995 and five prestigious commands major case detectives and emergency service , mounted , aviation and harbor units are almost all white all this in a city that the 2000 census says is 25 percent black i do n't take it for granted that i'm in a specialized unit , and i know i should n't complain , said officer david k leader , the department s only black helicopter pilot but where are the others \? the failure of the police to attract and advance black men means that the department , by its own measure , has not achieved one of its most important personnel objectives , one publicly embraced most recently by mayor rudolph w giuliani s administration it also means that after three decades of trying , the department is still in pursuit of the fully representative force that a procession of police commissioners have said could foster public trust in a city where tension between the police and residents persists police commissioner bernard b kerik , appointed last august , said that he was concerned about the problems suggested in the department s demographics , but would not comment in detail because he had not analyzed its equal employment record would i like the numbers to be better \? mr kerik asked of course consistent calls for police integration reach back to rioting in the early 1960 s , and were endorsed in the 1968 report on race relations by the federal kerner commission since then , the national experience with police diversity has been mixed many cities have required court intervention to open their ranks , and many of those that markedly changed their demographics , including miami and los angeles , still have fractured relations with minority neighborhoods others , like boston , improved their reputation as their departments changed new york is a city whose leadership has explicitly promoted the belief that more male black officers would improve the force , and set out to remake the department on its own but success remains elusive not even the presence of a black mayor and black police commissioner changed the pattern under mayor david n dinkins and lee p brown , the commissioner for much of mr dinkins s term in the early 1990 s , representation of black men in the ranks barely budged mr dinkins said he found integration was difficult to accomplish because the city lacked a residency requirement , and thus white men from the suburbs dominated each academy class i'm sad , it ought not be , mr dinkins said i wish we had done better mr giuliani s aides say that the mayor has long seen the value of integration , and recognized the shortage of black officers but william j bratton , mr giuliani s first police commissioner , said the mayor did not back several initiatives in his first term aimed at accelerating diversity mr giuliani did address the problem of recruiting minorities after the amadou diallo shooting in 1999 but personnel records make clear that little progress has been made attracting and promoting black men across his two terms , and in some respects , black men have regressed fewer hold top positions than in 1995 , and the department s recruiting , despite its most aggressive spending ever , has met the barest of successes in hiring black men mr giuliani would not be interviewed on this subject
indianapolis , dec 21 the nets' signature fast break was slow and broken tonight , a telling indicator for the rest of their game the nets crossed up their passes , fell short on their shots and stared into the distance on defense jason kidd had just five assists and not one arcing alleyoop the nets finished with more turnovers than offensive rebounds yet , despite playing with a lack of inspiration , the nets backed into the final two minutes of their game against the indiana pacers tonight with a chance to steal a victory in the end , nets coach byron scott felt his team got exactly what it deserved , however the pacers' reggie miller curled off a screen , as if by instinct , and hit a 17footer with 1 minute 16 seconds left , putting indiana safely ahead by 6 points and sealing a 10094 victory that snapped a fourgame winning streak for the nets \( 168 \) we did n't play at all tonight with any sense of urgency , scott said we just lollygagged around the whole game until it got to the fourth quarter that was too late the reserve forward aaron williams helped the nets recover from a 15point fourthquarter deficit , closing to 9490 but the nets who have beaten indiana twice this season were unable to overcome their 11 firsthalf turnovers or shut down jermaine o'neal , who finished with 29 points and 9 rebounds kidd , who had 15 points and who missed a 3pointer with 1 10 left , just sighed afterward we just never got into the flow , never got into a rhythm all night , he said perhaps the nets were saving their strength for saturday s faceoff against karl malone and the utah jazz , which will be at continental arena seeking revenge for the nets' overtime victory and for the war of words between scott and malone on nov 21 tonight in boston , the celtics defeated the jazz , 9892 , to take a share of the atlantic division lead with the nets before tonight s game , scott talked about the enticing possibility of the nets' going 10 games over 500 for the first time since february 1998 and called it a plateau once you get it , he said , it seems like everything s going right for you after the game he said , we have n't reached that plateau yet the nets seemed to keep slipping down the hill the pacers \( 1513 \) recorded 14 steals and caused 16 turnovers indiana overwhelmed the nets on fastbreak points , 269 it was uncharacteristic of us , but there are two areas we got hurt in turnovers and offensive rebounds and one led to the other , said keith van horn , who led the nets with 19 points and 8 rebounds , none on the offensive end the nets led by 9 points with 7 40 to play in the second quarter , 3526 the pacers then launched a 257 run to take a 5142 advantage the nets committed seven turnovers in that quarter and their 11 firsthalf turnovers resulted in 17 points for the pacers until kidd made a 3pointer with 8 51 to play in the third quarter , the nets had gone 10 43 with one field goal with 6 02 remaining in the third quarter , the nets were down by 6549 but to begin the fourth quarter , williams scored 8 of his seasonhigh 17 points to rally the nets williams fouled out with 7 23 to play , and while the nets were behind by just 6 points with 6 10 left , we could never get over the hump , kidd said when the nets rookie jason collins got o'neal to foul out with 1 57 to play and the nets trailing , 9487 , collins missed the first of two free throws but collins made a wideopen layup to narrow the deficit to 4 miller ended their hopes , and he finished with 16 points to surpass larry bird for 19th on the nba scoring list with 21 , 801 points that s reggie miller , he s been doing that his whole career , scott said that was just a key basket for them we did n't run from the beginning of the game we passed the ball to a couple of guys and then we stood there we did n't have the movement that we 've been known for rebounds on nov 21 in salt lake city , nets coach byron scott told jazz forward karl malone he had no heart , following an oncourt confrontation that resulted when malone tried to disentangle kenyon martin and utah s john crotty malone responded to the insult with spite after the nets won , 9089 , in overtime on the eve of a potential grudge match , scott did not want to revisit the incident i have no regrets of what i said , i'm sure he has no regrets of what he said , it s all water under the bridge , scott said to be honest with you , i do n't think he 'll say a word to me , i do n't think i 'll say a word to him we 'll just play the game and hopefully we 'll beat them again after that game , scott challenged malone to a fight outside if he wanted malone said that scott had no right to step on the court and that scott s accomplishments as a player were because he was riding someone else s coattails , referring to scott s days with magic johnson and the los angeles lakers scott said we used to kind of nod at each other before a game and that was just a sign of respect do i anticipate that happening from what i 've said and what he s said \? probably not photo reggie miller , who passed larry bird for 19th on the nba career scoring list , driving on lucious harris \(

in january 2000 , someone mailed more than a dozen letters to abortion clinics and schools in a milwaukee suburb the letters contained a coarse white powder and the message this is anthrax and you will die less than a week later , after a postal carrier noticed similar letters in the same mailbox , law enforcement authorities staked out the area almost immediately , they observed a 23yearold man with a troubled mental history drop an envelope in the mailbox bingo man arrested powder innocuous threats over the milwaukee case s neat and easy solution is not unusual in the dozens of anthrax investigations that postal inspectors and others carry out each year , officials say , virtually all turn out to be hoaxes and the people behind them are easy to find but now , investigators across the country are embarking on what officials and mail crime experts say could be a much more daunting task finding the person or people behind the very real anthrax attacks that have come through the mail to nbc news and the office of the senate majority leader , tom daschle the anthrax that killed a photo editor at american media , in florida , is also suspected of having arrived by mail there is , for starters , the sheer volume of mail 680 million pieces a day in the united states there is also no clear motive of personal animus in the nbc and senate letters , as has been the case with most violent mail threats instead , institutions the media , the government seem to have been targets if the perpetrator or perpetrators went to great lengths to conceal their identity and used gloves and refrained from leaving saliva when handling the packages , they would be almost impossible to trace even if they leave dna clues , there may not be matches on any law enforcement database , if they have a clean record these cases of people sending suspicious substances through the mail are very , very difficult to solve , said william p kinane , a former program director at the federal bureau of investigation in san francisco they developed machines to locate bombs in mail , but it is much harder , he said , to detect powders with biological substances mr kinane should know about difficult cases he was a supervisor in the early stages of the unabomber case , in which theodore j kaczynski conducted a sporadic bombing campaign over 17 years that killed 3 people and injured 23 others in the unabomber case , officials from several law enforcement agencies around the country spent thousands of hours and used the most sophisticated and creative law enforcement techniques yet , in the end , the break in the case hinged on a brother informing on a brother the current investigation has zeroed in on trenton , nj , from which the envelopes to tom brokaw at nbc and to mr daschle were mailed investigators say both envelopes were addressed in the same handwriting the one to mr brokaw was stamped by a postage meter , but the one to mr daschle had stamps pasted on it the contents also differed mr brokaw s package made a reference to allah , while mr daschle s , which was in a larger envelope , taped up , had no religious content , only words to the effect of now you 've been exposed postal inspectors are checking bar codes to see what time the mail passed through the processing facilities they are also trying to see if the strains of anthrax match investigators say another letter addressed to mr brokaw was sent to the new jersey governor s office a secretary opened a fedex package on sept 18 and found a stamped letter to mr brokaw inside the secretary assumed the sender had made a mistake and dropped the letter to mr brokaw in the mail she thought , though , that it might not have enough postage for its weight she informed investigators of the unusual fedex package on saturday the letter she mailed apparently did not arrive at nbc investigators are now sifting through the deadletter office in trenton to see if they can find it last year , the postal inspection service investigated 178 anthrax threats none were real this year , 60 such threats were made , said debbi baer , a postal spokeswoman all hoaxes , until last week at the same time , mail crime experts say that the only way to approach the anthrax threat is to treat it as a simple crime , requiring the same tools and discipline a former fbi official likened it to extortion open it up and go to the letter it s just like an extortion case , like mail fraud , the official said it s a nasty , threatening case that comes through the mail and the best thing you do is go back and peel the prints off the letter and use them to try to solve the case postal inspectors are more accustomed to investigating mail theft and fraud than dealing with what are called prohibited mailings , like bombs , narcotics and child pornography last year , twothirds of the 11 , 315 arrests made by postal inspectors related to theft and fraud there were 76 arrests for bombs , threats , hoaxes and explosive devices of 20 people on the agency s most wanted list , only 3 are being sought for prohibited mailings 2 for drugs and 1 for child pornography a rare example of a violent criminal case involving mailings is that of david mayle he was wanted in florida and ohio on suspicion of four murders yet there was not enough evidence to link him to the crimes after an investigation that began in 1996 and lasted more than four years , postal inspectors looking into a 5 , 075 case of mail fraud established enough evidence , through handwriting samples on checks , letters and other documents , to link mr mayle to the victims earlier this year , mr mayle was convicted of mail fraud and forgery charges , and in june was sentenced to 30 years in prison in that case , the postal service was the lead agency this time , there are many agencies working under the fbi mail crime experts say investigators will rely heavily on laboratory work , psychological profiling and fingerprint analysis martin biegelman , a former postal inspector in new york , los angeles , phoenix and st louis who is now director of investigative services for bdo seidman , a forensic investigative practice in manhattan , believes that there are too many coincidences concerning the anthrax cases to make it a random occurrence i think it s going to be somewhat hard , he said about the investigation but you know something \? these terrorists have made it personal there are lives on the line people have been killed photo a post office clerk in florida wore protective gloves yesterday \( bob shanley palm

washington , nov 11 if congress approves drilling for oil and gas in the arctic national wildlife refuge , it will be breaking with government practice of the last 35 years , which has limited when drilling may occur in refuges , the general accounting office has concluded oil wells are not uncommon in wildlife refuges around the country , and proponents of drilling have argued that if energy is extracted from refuges elsewhere , it can be done in alaska , too in a report requested by an opponent of such drilling , representative edward j markey , democrat of massachusetts , the accounting office found that about 13 percent of the refuges , in 21 states , had some kind of oil and gas activity last year but the office , the investigative and auditing arm of congress , also found that since the passage of the national wildlife refuge system administration act , in 1966 , the only leases that the government has signed for oil and gas exploration were where drillers on adjacent private land were extracting fuel from under the refuges in most of the others , the petroleum development preceded the creation of the refuge , or private companies already owned the mineral rights in the refuge opponents of drilling have generally argued that the alaska refuge is a unique , fragile treasure that should not be threatened by an oil spill , or even by the infringement of industrial development mr markey raised an additional point , that drilling in the refuge would set a bad precedent proponents of drilling , he said , very disingenuously argue that many refuges allow for drilling what they do n't mention is that none of that permission has been granted since 1966 , he said , and that if the alaska national wildlife refuge was made an exception , it would become a trojan horse that could be used to permit drilling in the 297 other refuges that have been identified by the united states geological survey as having oil and gas potential in january , in the wall street journal , senator john b breaux of louisiana argued that there had been oil and gas production from refuges there for nearly 60 years , with 1 , 605 wells if louisiana can do it , why ca n't alaska \? mr breaux , a democrat , wrote the wells and pipelines , he said , are on fragile wetlands that are home to a variety of wildlife he said there had been few adverse consequences

it could be a wakeup call for philip morris days after the philip morris companies proposed changing its name to the altria group , a small company in birmingham , ala , emerged to say that it has borne the altria identity since 1997 and is unhappy about the potential confusion possibly more problematic for philip morris is the full name of the other altria the altria healthcare corporation i almost could n't believe it , warren smedley , the president of altria healthcare , said in a telephone interview yesterday , adding that , in his instance , the altria name came to him after prayer mr smedley said he sent a letter to philip morris s lawyers asking the company to do the right thing and bring a prudent resolution to the situation he declined to discuss what he would consider right or prudent in other instances when a larger company wants to adopt a new corporate name that turns out to be already in use by a smaller company , the larger one often pays the other a namerights fee the dispute is indicative of the problems facing companies seeking to rename themselves as the demand for names increases with more corporate reorganizations and new products this happens a lot , said alan siegel , chairman and chief executive at siegelgale in new york , a corporate and brand consultant , even when a coined word like altria meant to suggest altrus , latin for high is chosen when us steel was renamed usx , he said , it found at least two companies by that name , in california and south korea mr smedley provided a copy of a letter he said was sent to clients of his altria , which provides services like billing and accounts receivable to hospitals and medical practices it is obviously of great concern to a health care business to have a big tobacco and alcohol company wish to adopt an identical name , the letter said the reference was to the philip morris usa and philip morris international divisions of philip morris , which sell cigarette brands like marlboro , and the miller brewing division , which sells beer brands like miller lite those divisions would keep those names if shareholders of philip morris approve the proposed name change for the parent at the company s annual meeting on april 25 in announcing the new name last thursday , philip morris said the main rationale was to convey the breadth of its products beyond cigarettes and beer , among them packaged foods like kraft cheeses , oreo cookies and stove top stuffing none of our operating companies are engaged in a business remotely similar to altria healthcare , said mark berlind , associate general counsel for the philip morris management corporation division of philip morris in new york though mr smedley raised concern about being associated with tobacco and beer , the tobacco will still be produced by philip morris and the beer by miller , mr berlind said in considering the altria name , we had done extensive searches , he added , and several names came up that were similar or identical we were aware of this company , absolutely , mr berlind said , referring to altria healthcare but the question is if there is a similarity in the businesses , and the answer is pretty easy to give no we will respond to the letter from mr smedley , he added , but we do n't see any problem or any conflict corporate naming experts said that while there might not be grounds for altria healthcare to complain on the confusion issue , it could have a case on the image front an alcohol and tobacco company is very hard to confuse with a health care company , said clive chajet , chairman at chajet consultancy in new york , a corporate identity consultant but if i were a health care company , i might be worried my image would be smudged when a company known for nothealthy products used my name imagine if philip morris found there was a company in birmingham called altria funeral parlors , he added philip morris would have a problem while philip morris hired a new york corporate identity consulting company , landor associates , to develop altria , mr smedley said he put the matter to prayer and altria was the name that came to me a spokeswoman for young rubicam , the division of the wpp group that owns landor , did not return a call left yesterday seeking comment besides altria healthcare , a search found at least one additional altria , altria international , described on its web site as a trading company based in geneva specializing in steel products for the iranian market photo the corporate logo for the altria group , which philip morris wants to make its new name \( business wire \) \( pg c3 \)

the internal revenue service , its staff reduced by a sixth since 1992 and its mission shifted to customer service , has virtually stopped pursuing more than one million tax delinquents and has sharply curtailed other kinds of enforcement more than a third of the three million americans who are behind on paying their taxes have had their cases sent to an inactive file since the irs decided in june 1999 not to try to collect their debts , according to internal documents provided to the new york times for just last year , the decision effectively wrote off 25 billion in taxes owed by 668 , 018 taxpayers , the documents show in 1998 , by contrast , just 98 taxpayers had their cases sent to the inactive file the irs defined the cases some involving as much as tens of thousands of dollars as too small to be worth going after , given its current resources , david a mader , irs assistant deputy commissioner , said yesterday the criteria used by the irs to deactivate cases were blacked out from the documents , and mr mader declined to discuss them the documents were provided to the times by an irs executive opposed to the new policy since 1992 , irs enforcement actions have fallen by twothirds for audits and by 99 percent for seizures of property to pay back taxes yesterday , the irs oversight board , created by congress to supervise the tax agency , issued a report saying that the irs was seriously underfinanced the report called for spending 1026 billion , or 800 million more than the 94 billion in president bush s budget for the year starting oct 1 the irs is broken , said larry r levitan , a retired andersen consulting management expert who is chairman of the oversight board it does n't provide good service , it does n't do adequate enforcement and that gives people the impression they can cheat the treasury secretary , paul h o'neill , who serves on the ninemember oversight board , issued a statement disputing its report mr o'neill said that the nearly 7 percent budget increase recommended by the president , some 580 million , was adequate irs data show that the agency fell behind in some of its most basic enforcement functions as its staff declined to 97 , 000 last year from 115 , 000 in 1992 while the number of tax returns filed rose 10 percent for example , to make sure taxpayers disclose all their income , the irs matches individual tax returns with reports from employers , banks and investment firms last year , the agency pursued just one in six cases in which it found discrepancies , down from four in six cases in 1997 another measure , the number of individual tax returns audited by the irs , fell to one in 204 last year , from one in 67 in 1995 the audit rate for all but the 1 , 100 largest corporations , which are under constant audit , fell to 1 percent last year , from 3 percent in 1992 seizures of property to pay pastdue taxes fell to 174 last year , from more than 10 , 000 annually in the early 1990 s the oversight board is not alone in criticizing the agency s performance in interviews this week , 13 prominent tax experts with a broad range of political views said that the agency was overwhelmed because it is focused on trying to help cooperative taxpayers and on fulfilling new mandates from congress including a complete reorganization tax evasion and chiseling are spreading , these experts said , as people realize how weak and ineffective enforcement has become the truth is that the enforcement side is sorely lacking , said sheldon s cohen , who served as irs commissioner in the johnson administration fred t goldberg jr , who held the post under president george bush , and donald alexander , the commissioner under president richard m nixon , said they agreed that enforcement was too lax mr goldberg added that enforcement efforts needed to be redirected from corporate to individual tax avoidance charles o rossotti , the current commissioner , said the critics were justified in describing the agency s performance from the summer of 1998 when congress first directed the irs to refocus its efforts on helping taxpayers obey the law until the end of last year but he said that a year from now , data would show that the irs hit bottom in 2000 and was now on an upward track in terms of both customer service and enforcement no one can argue with the statistics , mr rossotti said they have been going down , and if they kept going down that would be untenable we clearly need to do more in a lot of respects , but the trend is moving in the right direction now none of the 13 tax experts concurred kip dellinger , a los angeles accountant who has written two recent books on irs practices , said that it is beyond question that no matter how they deploy their resources , the irs just does not have a sufficient body of resources to enforce the law and as more and more people cheat and evade , the problem gets worse , said mr dellinger , who describes himself as a libertarian and fiscal conservative we , the honest taxpayers , are all paying for this the experts all said they were astonished that the irs had not moved forcefully against business owners who have stopped withholding income taxes from employee paychecks since the new york times reported on the movement on nov 19 the irs has sent some of those employers warning letters , but in the last week alone , 11 more businesses have publicly declared that they have stopped withholding bruce r bartlett , a conservative economist who was a senior treasury official in the first bush administration , said that he was troubled by the statistics showing a sharp drop in enforcement , but that he saw them as part of a decadeslong pattern of management woes at the agency charles davenport , a rutgers university tax professor who has studied the irs for years , faulted mr rossotti for telling congress what it wants to hear , instead of the truth mr rossotti said that he had been forthright mr levitan , the chairman of the oversight board , said that the commissioner , as a member of the bush administration , must be restrained in his comments to congress by contrast , the oversight board was specifically intended by congress to be free of such inhibitions , he said mr levitan said that the president s proposed budget , despite its recommended increase for the irs , would damage the agency s performance , because no money was provided for routine pay increases , promotions and the growth in tax filings the agency is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new software that wo n't run on the laptop and desktop computers the irs has , he said , but there is no money budgeted for new computers the irs executive who provided the documents said he was appalled by the curtailed pursuit of delinquent taxpayers he also said he was troubled that the policy had not been disclosed he also said that because of the policy , people who ignored their debts were getting a better deal than those who paid their taxes moreover , he said , the policy halts pursuit even of people who have stopped filing tax returns , a significant departure from past policy mr mader , the assistant deputy commissioner , said that the pullback from pursuing tax delinquents was a decision that had to be made because of resource allocation issues interest continues to accrue on the accounts categorized as inactive , officials said , and the cases can be reactivated within a 10year collection period photo as its staff has declined , the irs has let more tax delinquencies slide an irs

for most teenagers , having the freedom to hit the road with a carload of friends is one of their most coveted rites of passage but that rite could be altered as some state lawmakers and parents push for driving curfews and passenger limitations in a graduated licensing system thirtytwo states have already enacted a threestage graduated licensing system , according to the insurance institute for highway safety these licensing policies gradually remove restrictions on when teenagers can drive hours and how many passengers they can transport the carefree and adventurous spirit associated with becoming a new driver has been linked over the years to an increase in teenage deaths as inexperienced drivers take to roads where traffic is dense , speeds are high and construction presents countless obstacles add road rage and intoxication to the mix , whether involving teenagers or older drivers , and the mix becomes lethal in 1999 there were 39 fatalities among drivers 15 to 20 years old statewide , compared to 28 in 1998 , according to the united states department of transportation s national highway traffic safety administration more than 10 have died in connecticut already this year , according to lawmakers , who are counting as they watch their graduated license bills gain momentum of the six fatalities in brookfield in january , none were speeding and there was no substance abuse , said state representative david scribner they were from the lack of experience the national highway traffic safety administration , which helped develop the threestage graduated license model on which many states are basing their laws , cited in a report , inexperience and lack of adequate driving skills , excessive driving during nighttime and poor driving judgment and decision making representative scribner is one of five legislators who have submitted graduated licensing bills the proposals range from increasing the number of practice driving hours , from the current eight hours to 50 hours , to imposing nighttime driving curfews and limiting the number of passengers , unless a passenger over 25 years old is in the car there is even a bill proposed by state senator biago ciotto , of wethersfield , which would require teenagers to display new driver license plates on the front and rear of their vehicles for the 120 days after they received their licenses it s not a punishment thing , but sensible guidelines for public safety , said representative scribner , who is proposing an increase in the number of driving hours from the current eight hours to 12 hours , with two of those hours taken at night another of his bills would prohibit driving between 10 pm and 5 am , unless the teenage driver is going to work or school , or has a parent is in the car in addition , representative scribner wants to limit the number of passengers to one for the first six months that the teenagers has his license in designing his bills , he studied what other states were doing for instance , california requires teenagers to have 50 hours of driving practice , 10 of which must be at night and imposes a driving curfew between midnight and 5 am the state also does n't allow passengers under 20 in the car , unless supervised by a licensed driver at least 25 years old other states are more lenient , such as new hampshire and mississippi neither limits the number of passengers we have to acknowledge that the roads are more dangerous and that teenager are involved in more accidents , said representative ken bernhard of weston has a bill that would limit nighttime urban driving , as well as passenger restrictions before any graduated licensing bill could be passed , it would have to make it through public hearings , committee meetings and finally to the general assembly the last day of this legislative session is june 6 i wo n't say it will get passed , but my sense is that there s a growing momentum , said representative bernhard currently , the state requires teenagers to pass a vision and basic knowledge test to get a learner s permit , which lasts 120 days during this time , 30 hours of classroom instruction are required and eight hours of driving with a certified instructor or parent , before a full license is issued there is no twoyear phasein of driving privileges , as there would be with a graduated licensing program as expected , teenagers are n't embracing the limitations a curfew \? asked elena bermudez , an 11th grader at weston high school is n't that the whole point of getting a license \? freedom \? now , you have to have a parent around \? but ms bermudez , 16 , did find merit in increasing the number of hours of driving practice more driving time is good , she said i know lots of kids that have been in car accidents another young driver , tanika miller , 17 , of stamford , idebated the merits of the bills with her mother , grace baldwin , while waiting to get her license at the state s motor vehicles department in norwalk they need more time on the road and they need a curfew , ms baldwin said a curfew , i do n't think so , ms miller replied hours , yes it s still uncertain how the graduated licensing law would be enforced not even police departments are sure about the enforcement or if they even want the responsibility it may be a wellintended legislation , but they do n't have the responsibility of enforcing it , said wilbur chapman , chief of police in bridgeport
when the playwright arthur miller got a medal for artistic devotion to new york from the city college alumni association this month , he had a surprise to present for a remarkably brief period , he said , he had been enrolled at city college it was 1932 , i believe , he said at the awards dinner they wrote and told me that i was going to be taking physics , chemistry and mathematics , none of which i had a prayer of ever learning but at that time , i was working at a warehouse on 68th street , where lincoln center is now , and i was living at the other end in brooklyn so by the time i got to my classes , i was sleeping , and i lasted three weeks i tallied up , no doubt , the worst academic record ever seen on this continent so i pulled out and decided to save some money he later went to the university of michigan karen w arenson photo
before they moved from queens to dobbs ferry in may , karen clay and brian devlin did their homework they consulted guidelines on the better business bureau s web site they packed themselves and made a list of their goods they sought referrals from their real estate agent but the move went awry anyway the movers complained about the size of the job after loading 30 of the couple s 70 boxes onto the truck and none of their furniture , they snapped the back of the truck shut and demanded a payment of 319 on top of the 160 deposit the couple had to hire a second moving company to pick up the remainder of their goods for an additional 800 i tried to research as much as i could and followed all the advice because i did n't want to be a statistic , ms clay said , but it still happened anyway statewide , complaints against movers have declined 40 percent over the last four years , and in westchester , only five complaints were lodged last year against the 42 licensed moving companies in the county but moving remains a dicey business once a customer s worldly possessions are loaded onto a truck , the moving company is in control , and some take advantage of the situation experts say the number of formal complaints is not necessarily an accurate measure of the performance of the moving industry when you 're in the middle of a move , you 're usually dealing with a job change or buying a new house , said rita plate , executive director of the better business bureau s midhudson bureau , based in white plains by the time life settles down , people think it s too late to complain or they just figure it s not worth a followup paul reinert , director of the state department of transportation s intermodal operation bureau , which regulates intrastate moves , agrees that the number of complaints represents the the tip of the iceberg , but he added that not all complaints are valid sometimes people have unreasonable demands 'they scratched my chair , i want them to lose their license , ' he said well , we 're not going to make that person happy sometimes people call us and they 're frantic they 're right in the middle of a move and it always happens at 4 or 5 on a friday afternoon 'they 're demanding twice the original estimate to unload my goods what do i do \? ' our best advice is if you are able to do it , pay them because at least you have your goods we 'll help you fight to get your money back , but what happens more often than not , if those people take your goods away , you do n't see them again at the local branch of the better business bureau , which keeps its own statistics , complaints about metropolitan area movers have remained steady more than 500 per year for each of the last five years , ms plate said that figure includes long island and the five boroughs , along with westchester , since the agency does not break the numbers down as ms clay and mr devlin found out , even if a mover has a nearspotless record , that does n't mean a particular move will be troublefree the mover they chose , westchester moving and delivery , of elmsford , had only three consumer complaints on file with the state since 1995 but the move went sour from the very beginning the crew had no ramp for the stairs in the lobby nor did they bring wardrobe boxes or packing material for the couple s antique furniture , as requested they complained about the size of the job and squandered time , even though ms clay and mr devlin were being charged by the hour he told us that they had to keep the truck around the corner , ms clay said we had lived there for 10 years moving trucks came in and out of there all the time our super suggested that he back the truck into a side entrance , but he refused when the movers closed up the truck with less than half the load on board , the couple , who are married , called the police they refused to intervene , calling the dispute a civil matter eventually , the movers agreed to take the 30 boxes to dobbs ferry when the truck showed up there , ms clay said , the driver demanded another 50 to open the back , the crew dumped the boxes on the sidewalk and left in an interview the owner of the company who refused to give his last name , though state records list him as paul parkin defended his record but refused to discuss the details of the case we got our truck hit three times in the street down there and we could n't do the move , that was the bottom line , he said there was nowhere to park the truck and there was no way to make the move he must have thought we had some magic wand that could make things work this is just one of those circumstances that happen i am in business for over a decade , he added if i was a shakedown artist , we just started that with them , which does n't make too much sense , does it \? officials of moving companies say that sometimes the customer is to blame when things go wrong i 've gone on jobs where the people said they would be packed and ready and they were not , said pete linkowski , owner of lynx transport in hastingsonhudson or , when you get to the dropoff , they lied and there s three flights of stairs , so the move goes 12 hours instead of 8 they caused all these problems but they do n't want to pay you i 've had customers say , 'you broke this , you broke that' and i know we did n't , so not only do movers try to rip off people , there s customers who try to rip movers off by its very nature , the business attracts its share of shady characters

washington , march 13 the director of president bush s office on religious and community initiatives said today that its program to help religious charities receive more government financing remained on track , despite mounting criticisms there s no delay , the director , john j diiulio jr , told a national convention of reform jewish leaders we 're just following our plan congressional leaders also said today that they would introduce legislation as early as next week to bolster that program , including an expansion of the charitable tax deduction to taxpayers who do not itemize on their returns some experts believe that provision could raise charitable giving by 14 billion annually republican and democrats said they expected little opposition to most of the program in a day spent trying to calm critics , mr diiulio also spoke at a luncheon for moderate democrats where he reinvigorated his supporters , including senator joseph i lieberman of connecticut who came away saying , i love john diiulio senator lieberman said that despite questions he and other lawmakers have been raising about the program , he would cosponsor the first pieces of legislation for it my aim here is find a way to do this , constitutionally , mr lieberman said we ought to approach this with the attitude of how can we make these programs work better rather than look for ways to stop the government from supporting these groups in the last two weeks , the president s program has faced growing attacks from its early conservative protestant supporters , including marvin olasky , editor of the evangelical world magazine mr olasky said he was worried that mr bush s program would lock out religious ministries that are largely evangelistic others have expressed concern that accepting government financing would invite government meddling in religious institutions in his address today , mr diiulio said he would publish a guide to charitable choices in the next few weeks that would answer critics on the right as well as those on the left , who fear federal financing of religious charities could undermine constitutional safeguards to separate church and state working out things all together in a civic spirit , we can help to promote the welfare of those most in need , mr diiulio said i 've learned in washington , he added , when someone appears to be learning and listening , people think they 're equivocating and retreating speaking before the jewish leaders , who were skeptical about direct financing for religious groups , mr diiulio emphasized that no religious charity receiving government financing could refuse to help anyone , regardless of their faith almost none of the communityserving ministries and congregations make entering their buildings , receiving their services or participating in their programs in any way contingent upon any immediate or eventual profession of faith or any performance of religious rites , rituals or tenants of any kind , he said largely , though , mr diiulio tried to soothe fears by emphasizing that federal support for most of these programs is already legal under the 1996 welfare reform act supported by president bill clinton the problem , he said , has been getting churches , synagogues and mosques to apply for the money he cited a recent study by the university of pennsylvania indicating that just one of the 2 , 000 congregations of philadelphia applied for and received federal financing for their social service programs even though president clinton signed his program into law five years ago the same study showed that 60 percent of those congregations said they would consider using government money in congress , representative j c watts jr , republican of oklahoma , said that he and representative tony p hall , democrat of ohio , would introduce legislation in the coming weeks that would expand financing for religious charities that provide social services for juvenile justice , crime prevention , hunger relief and afterschool programs mr watts also said he was assembling a meeting next month to bring 400 religious and community leaders to capitol hill in what he described as a large brainstorming session we need to look for new solutions to old problems , and that means finding ways for the good works of faithbased organizations and the resources of government to work together , he said photo john j diiulio jr
seattle there they were , seattle s past and present , converging on first base both of them wore no 51 , and the man who goes by the single name of ichiro was quite aware of the symbolism before there was ichiro , there was randy johnson they never overlapped in this town the closest they came last night was when ichiro slapped a little roller behind first base and johnson darted over to cover , but ichiro was faster the present had an edge on history when they watched randy johnson , ken griffey , jr , and alex rodriguez depart in consecutive years , the fans here could never have predicted that last night s allstar game in their expensive new ballpark would come at the happiest time in franchise history who could have predicted an entire platoon of eight players , with ichiro suzuki leading off and kazuhiro sasaki , another poised japanese veteran , saving a 41 american league victory over the national league \? when fans tried to envision the proposed movable roof at the new ballpark , they would not have dared supply the allstar game with balmy highsummer weather or that nonmeteorological phenomenon known as ichiro when they worked themselves into a frenzy last fall at the departure of rodriguez , they could never have imagined themselves giving a warm ovation to arod last night but the mariners are so far in first place 19 games and a virtual concession in their division that the fans could afford to be magnanimous this was really all too much for a franchise that was being mentioned for relocation or even the dreaded new baseball threat of contraction yet there is something reassuring about the success of the twins and the cubs this year , and the way a relatively affluent franchise like seattle saved money prudently from three departed stars , and came up with a better squad of players , including ichiro slender and thoughtful , ichiro has stunned americans who pronounced him too slender , too mechanical , too set in his japanese ways to be a force in american baseball but here he is , second in the league in hitting at 347 , leading the league in allstar votes , leading the allstar game in demands upon his time , and leading the league in mystique some of the mystique is perpetuated by ichiro , whose public utterances heighten his own mystique by showing respect for others , he brings respect to himself how did ichiro feel facing the gangly giant who once dominated the hitters in the gloomy kingdome , now demolished \? i am very honored to face randy johnson in an allstar game rather than the fact that i got a base hit off him , ichiro said through his interpreter randy is a great pitcher and he was a mariner and he wore no 51 before me one of the things i always keep in my mind is to keep this no 51 in good dignity because i inherited good things from randy with no 51 there is no americanstyle gloating in him , at least none that breaks through the formality of the translator and the hint of a bemused smile he surely knows he was still suspect when he reported to camp barely four months ago the mariners scouted him wisely and used some of the money that never went to arod , but nobody could have expected the catalytic power of a supremely disciplined player ichiro made possible the scene last night when all eight mariners , along with manager lou piniella , a coach of the allstars , were photographed together johnson , who replaced curt schilling as the national league starter , wandered over to say hello , as inconspicuous as somebody 6feet10inches tall can be arod did not make that photo op , but at least he was able to blend in with the american league stars without feeling like a pariah after taking 252 million to play with the texas rangers for 10 years , rodriguez was booed viciously in his first visit here in april boos are always a big compliment , rodriguez said monday he was asked if he felt a little envy toward the mariners' great start no , he said , i'm proud of them maybe this is way out of line but i think they said , 'hey , randy , junior and arod are gone , and we 've got to upgrade our own act' that might even be true the mariners have become a joy to watch , playing alert and aggressive ball , not always associated with american league ball and surely not with the mariners , who traditionally depended on johnson s strikeouts and the power of griffey and rodriguez but those names are seattle s past this is the time of ichiro and sasaki even the allstar game bears their mark photo ichiro suzuki \( agence francepresse \)
west point , ny , oct 27 army had many reasons to welcome tulane to michie stadium today for one , the black knights had beaten the green wave here last season to end a 10game losing streak second , tulane came into the game with the worst defensive statistics in conference usa third , tulane was without its recordbreaking quarterback , patrick ramsey , who was sidelined with a laceration on his passing hand army capitalized on the young and porous tulane defense and nothing tulane s backup quarterback , j p losman , or tulane s outstanding running back , mewelde moore , did could compare with the performance by the army reserve tailback c j young , who scored four touchdowns , including a gamewinning 13yard run with 2 minutes 26 seconds left , to lift the cadets to a 4235 victory young , a 5foot8 185pound sophomore who had scored only one touchdown this season while running for a total of 223 yards , gained 192 yards today on 39 carries before a crowd of 35 , 281 quarterback chad jenkins completed 18 of 31 passes for 228 yards , including an 18yard touchdown pass to wide receiver aris comeaux that gave army a 2821 lead less than three minutes into the final quarter army \( 25 \) would eventually lose that lead when moore who broke tulane s singleseason record for allpurpose yardage today hooked up with losman on a 40yard scoring pass that put the green wave ahead , 3528 , midway through the final quarter but after the ensuing kickoff , army drove 73 yards with jenkins scoring on a quarterback sneak from 1 yard to tie it at 3535 with just over five minutes left after losman failed to connect on a fourthdown pass with tulane at midfield with less than four minutes remaining , army took over , capping its drive when young circled the right side and raced 13 yards for the winning touchdown despite its inexperienced and weak defense , tulane \( 27 over all , 14 conference usa \) leads the league in scoring with an average of 31 points a game but they had given up an average of 39 points a game to opposing teams and today , after leading by 147 at halftime , the green wave gained a whopping 519 yards , with losman \( 25 of 39 \) accounting for 384 yards but the visitors gave up almost as much yardage as they amassed 506 in all and 278 yards rushing and the one penalty that tulane committed proved costly , leading to army s winning touchdown by contrast , army was called for seven penalties , none of which were instrumental in any of tulane s five touchdowns in a game marred by poor tackling by both teams and weak play in both secondaries
wanaque the signs are everywhere , though you have to slow down to see them for rent notices pepper a stretch of ringwood avenue in the haskell section of this passaic county town and between sagging storefronts , another establishment announces that it sells used junk then there s a sign across the street over 53 years and we 're staying , in red letters in the window of kressaty s pharmacy the reason for the sign s insistence is a proposal before the town planning board to allow a business on a vacant lot down the street from kressaty s where a cvs pharmacy wants open borough officials contend that the depressed haskell section desperately needs an anchor , something like a cvs , to attract new businesses but the plan puts the officials in the uncomfortable position of threatening one of the town s few successful businesses and the kind of place where customers linger , talk about family , tell jokes our customers are more worried than we are , said fred kressaty , the 80yearold pharmacy owner , who has encouraged visitors to sign a petition asking local officials to block the unnecessary introduction of chain stores the arrival of chain stores is one sign of progress , the petition reads , but the price of progress should not be the loss of people and institutions , whose dedication to the community is beneficial and longstanding nearly 500 people signed the petition in the first week alone , and now there are more than 1 , 000 signatures , mr kressaty said that still has not kept cvs from making an offer to buy out the pharmacy , though mr kressaty said he turned it down so far , the town has received about 1 million from the state to help build a town center for haskell , complete with oldfashioned lights , brick crosswalks and a clock tower housing for 2 , 200 elderly residents has also been approved indeed , there are already sections of wanaque that have been visited by the mixed blessing of gentrifrication professionals are moving into the area , and homes that sold for a song are fetching more than 200 , 000 passaic county community college opened a campus in wanaque last year and a consulting firm is marketing the town to businesses but none of this has done much for haskell , and to make the area come alive , supporters of the cvs say new retail businesses have to be encouraged to come here you ca n't invite merchants to come into a town that looks like the south bronx , said lorraine la neve , a longtime resident and former president of the borough s chamber of commerce officials here envision restaurants , boutiques and business offices lining ringwood avenue , and it is a vision that many of them are excited about many towns will have these plans , said the borough administrator , tom carroll , but it wo n't happen here , it will happen mr kressaty though his business is imperiled insisted that he was not opposed to competition but barbara offner , a nurse who was shopping at the pharmacy , complained about the long lines and unfriendly service at chain stores whether to accept the cvs is a tough decision , said robert rizzotti , a planning consultant who conducted an economic development study for the borough what s more , mr rizzotti said that approval of the cvs must come quickly to assure the success of the redevelopment effort it s an unfortunate situation in some instances , because businesses will be hurt , he said but james w hughes , dean of the edward j bloustein school of planning and public policy at rutgers university , said mr rizzotti might be overstating the case any one store , mr hughes said , i do n't think you could say the whole plan would hinge on it but he did note that when local stores are pushed out , it s a loss of something less tangible than simply one business those pharmacies , he said , referring to chains like cvs , can destroy the fabric of the community they can also offer discounted prices and wider selections , undercutting the smaller , locally owned businesses todd andrews , a spokesman for cvs , which is based in woonsocket , ri , disagreed with the notion that the chain would treat customers impersonally that is a misconception , mr andrews said our pharmacists are professionals , and look after our patients with the same care and professionalism that other pharmacists would moreover , the introduction of big pharmacies does not necessarily mean the death of smaller ones mr rizzotti s report , citing the bergen county town of waldwick , noted that two major chains had opened in the past few years including one near waldwick pharmacy you have to be creative , flexible , said bill brown , who has owned the pharmacy for 28 years for mr brown , the answer is a hometown feel , competitive pricing and innovative products like the throat lozenges he sells under the store s own label despite such assurances , the concerns here are palpable john soojian , a 45year resident of neighboring pompton lakes , who is the owner and developer of the cvs site , said he feared vilification i'm damned if i do , i'm damned if i do n't , mr soojian said and mayor warren hagstrom , who was born and raised here and has a seat on the planning board that will hear the cvs proposal , said he had been lying awake at night thinking about the plan for the last several weeks i ca n't hurt them , mr hagstrom said of the kressaty family but the kressatys fred and his wife , claire and their daughter terri , 44 insist that they will stay fred and claire own the building and live above the store i would n't consider closing at all , said terri kressaty , who stands to inherit the business there is absolutely nothing that will shut us down photos there is a plan , left , to transform the depressed haskell section of wanaque , above left a proposed cvs pharmacy would serve to attract more retailers , some say , but it could threaten one of the few successful businesses there , kressaty

augusta , ga , april 7 tiger woods and phil mickelson , the no 1 and no 2 golfers in the world , will be looking each other in the eye in the masters' final pairing on sunday , but they wo n't ignore the other names on augusta national s leader board there are some guys up there , woods said , who have won some serious tournaments around the world if you look at the board , mickelson said , there are some incredible players who could make a run at us woods , who shot 68 for 204 , has a onestroke lead over mickelson and a twostroke lead over mark calcavecchia , the 1989 british open champion , and chris dimarco another stroke back is ernie els , the twotime united states open champion from south africa , as well as david duval , once the world s no 1 , and argentina s angel cabrera and none of those incredible players who have won some serious tournaments disagree with woods and mickelson say that tiger finishes at 12 under , calcavecchia said before woods did finish at 12 under par , that means i 've got to beat him by three strokes to have a chance to win the tournament and that s very doable tiger is a human being just like the rest of us and he s going to be nervous , too however , he is the best in the world and he has that going for him calcavecchia , who set a pga tour record for a 72hole event with a 28underpar total at the phoenix open in january , had hoped to be paired with woods in the final group but when mickelson birdied the 18th hole to get to 11 under , that dropped calcavecchia into the nexttolast group with dimarco , the surprise leader after the first and second rounds dimarco shot par 72 in the third round while paired with woods for the first time in a pga tour event tiger s great to play with , he really is , dimarco said he s very cordial he tells you when you hit a good shot , he tells you 'good shot' or 'good putt' and it was fun of course i was nervous he s the best player in the world he hits it so far that , literally , par is 68 the par 5 s are just long par 4 s for him in sunday s nexttolast pairing , dimarco will be playing with calcavecchia , another former university of florida golfer with an unorthodox , clawlike putting grip he s a gator , i'm a gator , dimarco said we 're going to be clawing it together all day calc is going to be swinging for the fences , and my goal will be trying to be more aggressive on the par 5 s i tried to play them the smart way and i went two over although duval was three strokes behind woods , he agreed that woods and mickelson might get so involved in playing each other that another golfer could sneak past them hopefully , they do get caught up in playing each other , duval said there s a lot of people who have a chance to win the tournament now , and i think i'm one of them in the previous three masters , duval tied for third last year , tied for sixth in 1999 and tied for second in 1998 when mark o'meara won with a birdie on the 18th had o'meara parred , he would have been in a suddendeath playoff with duval and fred couples i just think this place sets up well for me , duval said after a twounderpar 70 i feel like i should be a little bit better than i am , but i think i have a pretty good knowledge of how to play the golf course i 've done that well so far this week the people who are on top of their games have risen to the top , he added , alluding to woods and mickelson , and the players who have been playing the best for the last few years are there again i think that s everything that you want in a masters sunday duval professed not to be concerned with what any of the other leaders shoot in the final round if i shoot a 65 or a 66 or a 67 , i do n't think that s very tough at all , he said if i do n't , well , it s just up to me to be able to play tomorrow , i guess is what i'm saying i ca n't be real concerned with what he , meaning woods , is doing or anybody else of the six leaders , only els , who shot 68 , had an eagle in the third round he holed a 25foot putt on the 500yard 15th even if you 're three or four shots behind going to the final nine on sunday , you 've still got a chance to win , els said it all happens on the back nine anyway i 've just got to try and plug on , plug away , just take what i get and try and stay focused and positive maybe it will come my way this time photo chris dimarco , who missed this birdie putt on no 13 yesterday , lost his lead and dropped into a tie for third place \( agence francepresse \)
thirteen years ago this month , nike offered television viewers the controversial advertising campaign in which the beatles' revolution , that anthem of 1960 s dissent , was sampled to hawk sneakers that cost as much as some airline tickets as readers of oped pages may remember , many americans baby boomers , to be exact did not take warmly to the use of a sacrosanct pop cultural product to sell a less mythologized syntheticsoled consumer one the 60 s have been devalued to the level of many thirdworld currencies , thanks to forrest gump the 60 s , an nbc miniseries and who knows how many internetcompany ads that plunder jimi hendrix so maybe it was just a matter of time before someone , somewhere offered a foxtrimmed , shearedmink kimono , and did it against a cineplexsized screen that flashed images of martin luther king is it worth even mentioning that in 2001 , no one seemed to find such a pairing that unseemly \? this incongruous display was presented at the sean john show in bryant park on saturday night , the finale to the fall 2001 men s wear collections it was that rare occasion on which anna wintour and johnnie l cochran jr could have compared footwear , had the spirit moved them mr cochran was seated in the front row of the show , in support of sean john s creator , sean combs in addition to mr combs s roles as a record titan and proponent of an unsubtle style of male dress , he is also mr cochran s client in a gunpossession and bribery trial during the week \( if convicted , mr combs , who has been wearing versace suits to court , faces up to 15 versacefree years in prison \) he s got court , he s got meetings we do n't get cracking until about 9 or 9 30 at night , said heather thomson , mr combs s head designer , referring to the work that had to be done in preparation for saturday s event the day is just not with him during a rehearsal for the show in the west village on friday night , mr combs said the trial had drained him i'm tired i wish i was n't going through it , and that s all i'm going to say about that , he offered , as he sat drinking white wine and wearing gray flannel trousers and a gray pullover \( i think it s brooks brothers \) , a look presumably intended to mitigate his glamourthug image mr combs was not so drained that he could n't muster up the energy to predict the reactions to his collection the sean john label has been a commercial success since its introduction in 1998 , and this year a senior executive , jeffrey tweedy , has predicted sales of 100 million if you 're tom ford , your beeper is going to go off , mr combs said if you 're dolce gabbana , your cell phone is going to ring you 're going to start to feel a men s fashion revolution indeed , mr combs titled his show revolution , and in line with that meaninglessly clich d theme offered a camel shair suit paired with combat boots , ostrich chinos and a dedication to his girlfriend , jennifer lopez , who , mr combs explained , is revolutionary for wearing that dress the dress was the slashedtothethighs versace that ms lopez wore to the oscars last year in fact , the only revolutionary moment at the sean john show occurred at the end , when mr combs sauntered down the runway in a reprise of what he 'd worn the evening before trousers and a sweater , it is unlikely , given his schedule , that he had time to sit down with thomas frank s 1998 book , the conquest of cool , before his show had he done so , he would have known that dopily borrowing from the language of counterculture and rebellion is as old as men s fashion itself mr frank argues that the men s clothing business was able to recover from its slump in the 1950 s only when the radical culture of the next decade came along to unseat the graysuited organization man so perhaps the wackiest aspect to the recent round of men s shows is that some version or another of the organization man is still getting tribute at ozwald boateng s show , narrowly cut suits and zippered raincoats came down the runway on the backs of men carrying attach cases the cuts were conservative , even if the colors tended toward those in a pack of starbursts and bucking the trend of employing male models who look as if they had walked out of the film kids mr boateng opted for models who looked like men john varvatos showed widelegged tweeds for the weekending organization man , and handsome , amply cut and thus comfortable threepiece suits for his 12hour days mr varvatos is known for shows that remain at a marathon s distance from the outr and he remained true to himself here in his hands , not even a green corduroy suit looks too whimsical , young or silly the same could be said of tommy hilfiger s presentation at the morgan library on thursday morning in the wake of a foundering stock price , mr hilfiger has suppressed much of his flashy , fakehip side and returned , as he puts it , to the company s ivy league roots while it is hard to imagine any genuine princeton senior wearing mr hilfiger s embroidered corduroy trousers , none of the models were styled to look as if they regularly rode the flatbush avenue line at john bartlett s

seattle , may 22 one fire gutted a research laboratory at the university of washington center for urban horticulture here , while the other destroyed two buildings and several vehicles at a poplar tree nursery in the northwestern corner of oregon both were reported shortly after 3 am monday today , federal authorities were combing both sites for clues , acting on what they described as strong indications that both fires had been set by a loosely knit group of radical environmentalists adamantly opposed to research on the genetic modification of trees at the seattle site , some research was conducted into modification that , as with altered foods , could potentially make trees more commerically productive researchers , for example , are studying a gene that could alter how often a tree grows branches the more branches , the more wood that could be turned into pulp for paper the fewer branches , the fewer knots on the trunk and the more valuable the wood such genetic manipulation has raised concerns for some people for a variety of reasons , including the possibility of harm to the environment others are opposed on principle to what they see as unacceptable tampering with nature managers of the 7 , 300acre oregon tree farm said they did not create or grow genetically engineered trees there , but a company that once owned the property was affiliated with a universitybased group , the poplar molecular genetics cooperative at the oregon site , jefferson poplar farms in clatskanie , the words you cannot control what is wild and elf were spraypainted on the sides of one of the remaining buildings , an fbi spokeswoman , beth anne steele , said today the initials stand for earth liberation front , a movement that has claimed responsibility for arson and vandalism against commercial properties in recent years , including a ski resort in colorado , a lumber yard in southern oregon , and housing sites on long island and elsewhere four teenagers were charged in the long island arsons earlier this year fbi officials said that the timing of the fires and other factors made them almost certainly related a man who identified himself as a spokesman for the north american earth liberation front media office , in portland , ore , said in a phone interview today that such acts were a justifiable response to the genetic engineering of our forests that he said corporations were carrying out these companies are rolling the dice with the biodiversity of the natural environment , said the man , who gave his name as leslie james pickering he said members of the media office including himself speak ideologically in support of acts like the fires , but were not directly responsible for them some professors at the horticulture center here in seattle said they found a particularly unfortunate irony in the damage much of the center s research is geared toward protecting or restoring the environment , and the fire may have killed a good portion of one rare species at the center , dr sarah reichard , a conservation biologist , studies showy stickseed , a rare plant in the cascade mountains of washington only 300 individuals are left in the wild dr reichard said she feared that the fire might have killed the 100 individuals of the species that had been painstakingly raised in the laboratory after a year s work , using a technique known as tissue culture that s one quarter of the world s population , she said they clearly did not do their homework at the center s laboratory , prof h d bradshaw , a plant geneticist in whose office the fire began , expressed bafflement as to why his place of work was the focus of attacks , both now and in a separate incident in 1999 at that time , a few days before the world trade organization protests here , a group calling itself the washington tree improvement association hacked down nearly 200 trees in a nearby nursery i 've personally never genetically engineered a tree , dr bradshaw said today as he gazed at the rubble of the site , which destroyed his office and much of the laboratory dr tom hinckley , the center s director , said he lost more than 30 years of research files , as well as slides that meticulously document the regrowth of vegetation around mount st helens in the years since it erupted in may 1980 dr bradshaw s research includes the study of genetically engineered poplars kept in a nearby greenhouse none of those trees were damaged in the fire he said that his own basic research was geared toward identifying the genes that affect plant growth and form , rather than the creation of a marketable product and some of the work done there has been supported by the department of energy as well as giant timber companies like weyerhaeuser and boise cascade if the fires were the work of the elf or a similar group , they are acts virtually no mainstream environmental group has countenanced indeed , some have supported genetic research into trees , saying that the greater mass and other properties such work produces for commercial tree farms could actually help alleviate the commercial pressures to log in native and oldgrowth sites
gustavo kuerten heard the alarm late sunday night it shook him , charged him and finally , taught him by overcoming a twoset deficit to max mirnyi in the third round , kuerten approached last night s fourthround match against albert costa with perspective after a match like this , you really grow , said kuerten , a threetime french open winner you see yourself back to the tournament and more alive than ever as late afternoon slipped into dusk and turned into a humid night swarming with moths , a smiling kuerten was alert from the raindelayed start with the brazilian soccerstyle crowd chanting the familiar guga ! guga ! refrain in armstrong stadium , kuerten , the topseeded player in the men s draw , satisfied the fans by dismantling costa , 64 , 64 , 76 \( 7 \) kuerten had 18 aces , including three in the tie breaker , and no doublefaults , converting 60 percent of his serves to preserve his energy he advanced to the quarterfinals to meet seventhseeded yevgeny kafelnikov , the close call of sunday just a memory i felt a little bit tired after the last match , kuerten said it was n't easy for me playing backtoback points , so i played maybe 87 percent then when i need it , i try to go a little bit better costa felt kuerten s vibrant presence today , he was serving very good , he was returning very good , playing over all very good when guga plays good , he s no1 in the world , costa said in the third set , the bugs suddenly descended on the national tennis center , a distraction for both costa and kuerten it was tough , kuerten said kuerten was playing with quick determination , finishing points off with his rocket serve to preserve his legs earlier in the day , he sat comfortably in the players' lounge , eating a bowl of tortellini and watching a replay of his match against mirnyi yesterday , the men darted through the raindrops , taking cover or taking charge in the few windows of opportunity they had to play kafelnikov pretended that the moisture hitting the ashe stadium court during his match against arnaud cl ment was simply perspiration he was ahead of cl ment , two sets to none and up by two breaks in the third set in their fourthround match when rain forced them into the locker room an hour later , kafelnikov returned just as sharp , finishing off cl ment , 63 , 64 , 63 for kafelnikov , it was his first straightsets victory at the open since 1999 \( when he lost to andre agassi in the semifinals \) , a welcome change from the fivesetters he played in the first two rounds this year it s definitely a huge confidence boost , no question about it , kafelnikov said to get through straight sets against an opponent like cl ment , i did not expect this morning , i felt like chances are 5050 i might lose , i might win kafelnikov , the 1999 australian and 1996 french open champion , says he is beginning to feel young again right now , i just think i'm probably enjoying as much as i did in the early stage of my career , the 27yearold kafelnikov said every match that i win brings me joy cl ment , meanwhile , seemed to be in a fog , committing 54 unforced errors in the match after kafelnikov broke him for a 30 lead in the third set , cl ment took the ball from his pocket and angrily rocketed it into the sky he received a warning from the chair umpire , enric molina , then sat in his chair stewing during the changeover but as soon as molina called time , the skies opened cl ment immediately packed up his bag and stormed off the court , even before molina announced a suspension in play that s not his prerogative , the tournament referee brian earley said of cl ment s hasty exit it could have been grounds for a penalty or even a default , added earley i was just very upset about my game , cl ment said no , i did n't think something could help me kafelnikov stayed on court as the fans applauded he appealed to earley to keep playing i wanted to finish the match as soon as possible because you do n't know what to expect when you 're going to walk off the court with a rain delay , he said cl ment , seeded 12th , was kafelnikov s toughest opponent thus far and it took him the least amount of time to triumph i wish i knew the answer , kafelnikov said of his inconsistency it seems to me that s my nature in the beginning of the tournament i was perhaps trying to save a little bit of energy without paying much attention to my opponent kafelnikov was pleased to be the quarterfinalist being paid the least attention pete sampras and andre agassi will square off tonight , and fourthseeded lleyton hewitt has caused controversy with his comments during his secondround match against james blake hewitt appeared to have earned a weather reprieve yesterday after hewitt lost the first set , 63 , to no 16 tommy haas , and was serving at 15love with the games tied at 2 in the second set , rain forced the players off the ashe stadium court a little more than an hour later , tournament officials postponed the match until this morning photo topseeded gustavo kuerten had a threehour rain delay before he dispatched albert costa in straight sets \( barton silverman the new york times \)
washington , feb 16 the united states and britain staged air strikes against radar stations and air defense command centers in iraq today , including targets around baghdad , in what president bush called a necessary response to iraqi provocation the raid carried out by more than three dozen aircraft shortly after night fell in baghdad represented an escalation of the longrunning , lowlevel skirmishes between american and british jets and iraqi forces the strikes were the first in two years against iraqi targets north of the noflight zone over southern iraq , which american and british planes have patrolled since 1992 american military commanders in the region requested the strikes which mr bush approved on thursday because iraqi air defense stations had become increasingly aggressive and effective in targeting the patrols over the zone , officials said we will continue to enforce the nofly zones , mr bush said today during an appearance with president vicente fox in san crist bal , mexico the nofly zones are enforced on a daily basis it is a part of a strategy , and until that strategy is changed , if it is changed at all , we will continue to enforce the nofly zones excerpts , page a4 the strike aircraft had as their targets five separate sites that included as many as 20 radars and command centers mr bush and his aides described the raid as routine , saying the united states and britain were simply responding to iraqi provocations , as they have repeatedly in the last two years since mr bush took office on jan 20 , american and british jets have struck targets in the southern zone three other times , most recently on tuesday they also attacked one in the smaller zone over northern iraq striking outside the declared zones , however , required commanders to seek explicit approval from mr bush , forcing him to decide whether to authorize a more aggressive military action only weeks into his term administration and defense officials said the strikes came before mr bush s national security team had been able to formulate its own comprehensive policy toward iraq but with the iraqi actions intensifying , they had little choice , they said , underscoring the extent to which president saddam hussein can still dictate the agenda of american presidents , a decade after mr bush s father organized the coalition that drove iraqi occupying forces out of kuwait president clinton was also confronted by aggressive iraqi air defenses , and beginning on his second day in office , he oversaw repeated military strikes against iraq in the last six weeks , iraqi forces have fired antiaircraft artillery at american and british aircraft 51 times and , more significantly , launched more dangerous surfacetoair missiles on 14 occasions , according to the pentagon although none of those attacks succeeded in hitting any of the allied jets , commanders were concerned enough to seek permission to widen their retaliation officials said they believed that the firings were a deliberate attempt by mr hussein to test the new administration s resolve officials said today s attack was not the beginning of a sustained assault against the iraqis , but they left the door open to additional strikes if iraq continued aggressive behavior air force f15 s and f16 s , joined by british tornadoes , carried out the attack from air fields in kuwait , while navy f18 s attacked from the american aircraft carrier the harry s truman in the persian gulf american officials said all of the aircraft had returned safely in all , there were 24 strike jets 18 american and 6 british as well as support aircraft iraqi television said numerous civilians had been wounded in the attacks , which began shortly after 12 30 pm eastern time but pentagon officials said they had no evidence of civilian casualties , asserting that the five targets were all in relatively secluded areas and had been chosen for that reason the strikes were far below the scale of the last major attack against iraq , which occurred in december 1998 in that case , american and british forces carried out four nights of air and missile strikes against more than 100 targets to punish mr hussein s government for ending cooperation with international weapons inspectors those targets included missile and chemical production installations , as well as military headquarters and air defenses since then , iraqi air defense forces have routinely fired on the american and british patrols over the zones in what has amounted at times to a lowgrade war , though an entirely onesided one the strikes today were comparable in scale to the larger of those periodic strikes , but were significant because the targets were outside the declared noflight zones pentagon officials said the american and british jets had attacked five sets of targets in all , including four outside the zone and a fifth inside it the targets included radar installations within a few miles of the heart of baghdad , as well as radar or command centers at taji , suwaira and taqaddum , the officials said the fifth target , in the southern zone , was a command center near numaniya
two years ago , brian mccauley s wife , vicki , lay in the intensive care unit at memorial sloankettering cancer center in manhattan , silently battling leukemia and a collapsed windpipe as she lay in bed , kept alive by a respirator , mr mccauley put on a brave face for their three sons , brian jason , then 18 daniel , 13 and sean , 7 i did n't want the kids to get too scared , mr mccauley said you have to go home and screw a smile on your face the idea was to keep the children s home life as normal as possible mr mccauley and his mother helped them with their homework and did the laundry and the dishes and the grocery shopping but mr mccauley was worried every day he visited his wife at the hospital , but she never seemed to show any progress for the first five and a half months she was n't getting any better , he said you cling to any hope you can i said , 'well , she s not getting any worse' the hospital searched the country and europe for bone marrow donors but found none so mrs mccauley was treated with an experimental drug based on arsenic with the course of this new drug , we were able to get the disease down to very , very low levels , said dr joseph jurcic , who supervised her treatment in may 1999 , mrs mccauley began to breathe on her own again she could communicate by typing into a machine that spoke her words with an artificial voice dr jurcic said that tests conducted that spring showed she was largely cured , but not completely we did n't see any detectable leukemia cells , dr jurcic said recently it was below the level of detectability , but there can still be some leukemia cells present he prescribed high doses of chemotherapy and fullbody radiation to kill any leukemic cells in mrs mccauley s bone marrow in august 1999 , she was injected with healthy stem cells , which had been taken from her blood when the disease was almost gone it looked as though she was on the road to recovery then mr mccauley was fired he had been a supervisor at a company in mamaroneck , ny , that created and cared for plant landscapes in manhattan skyscrapers but his boss told him he was not paying enough attention to his job , mr mccauley said they were a little annoyed that i could n't work as much overtime as they wanted , he said the fact that the hospital was frequently calling him with questions and reports about his wife did not help , either so in november 1999 , the same month that mrs mccauley came home to the family s apartment in bay ridge , brooklyn , mr mccauley lost his income and the family had a new problem paying the rent and the utility bills \( medicaid covered most of the family s medical bills \) mr mccauley got a parttime job at another interior landscaping company , but the company gave him work only when it needed extra help the family struggled to get by on mrs mccauley s disability income and mr mccauley s parttime work we were doing the best we could , mr mccauley said , but we got really behind mrs mccauley , who had been a bookkeeper and a waitress , felt helpless i could n't even move , she said i did nothing but lie in bed all day even to go to the bathroom was completely exhausting in december 1999 , five months behind on their rent and fearing eviction , they went to their church , the bay ridge united methodist church the pastor , scott summerville , and his wife , mary ellen , asked the congregation to help the family with a hot meal once a week and contacted the federation of protestant welfare agencies , one of the seven local charities supported by the new york times neediest cases fund the federation provided 1 , 064 about a month and a half s worth of rent to keep the mccauleys from being evicted paying a little of the back rent each month , the family has been able to pay back most of the remainder the bone marrow reconstruction procedure for mrs mccauley appears to have worked , and dr jurcic said that if mrs mccauley s blood shows no signs of leukemia for two more years , the chances of a relapse would be very low mrs mccauley , 44 , said recently that by using state and city financial aid packages , she hoped she could return to kingsborough community college , where she completed a semester studying early childhood education before she was hospitalized her goal , she said , is to become a preschool teacher i was disappointed that i had to stop going to school , mrs mccauley said maybe in september , when everything s back to normal , i 'll be able to go back mr mccauley , 42 , has returned to school himself , though he had to take out a loan to do so at the technical career institutes in midtown manhattan , he is learning how to repair refrigeration and heating systems with the hope that he can find a fulltime job when he graduates i figured i would learn something totally different , he said it s good to have two different things to do with the immediate threat of leukemia removed , mrs mccauley is able to reflect on the disease , and on the cancers that took the lives of both her mother and her grandmother i guess if it was a different age , i also would die , she said but i was born in this age i was able to survive how to help checks

ceuta , spain high on a dusty hill in this tiny spanish enclave on the north coast of africa , penned in by wire fencing , are some of those who survived they were rescued from brokendown boats bobbing a few miles away in the strait of gibraltar as they tried unsuccessfully to reach the coast of spain some talk of yearlong journeys from their homes in subsaharan africa months at sea , walks through the desert , no food , fevers one 23yearold woman who would identify herself only as esther , who has spent seven months in the center for illegal immigrants here , said 3 of the 45 people on her boat died on the last leg of her journey from sierra leone when the weather was bad , esther said , we held each other and said , 'god save us' the clutch of detainees here is a small part of a growing tide of migrants from african countries like nigeria , senegal , mali and guinea desperately trying to slip into europe along a route once used almost exclusively by moroccans once they reach the northern coast of africa , by land or by sea , they board small and dangerously overcrowded inflatable speedboats , hoping to cross the ninemile strait to the spanish mainland once there , they may be headed for almost anywhere on the continent where they have friends , relatives or contacts last year , the european union estimated that about 500 , 000 people entered europe illegally spain detained 15 , 000 illegal immigrants along the coast last year , more than four times as many as the year before , and officials say 20 percent were from subsaharan africa more than 500 people have been rescued from shipwrecks so far this year , a fivefold increase over the figure for the same period last year those rescued are the lucky ones spanish officials said the number of bodies recovered had nearly doubled in the last year at least 44 have been found so far this year , most of them washed up on the beaches on either side of the strait no one knows how many more never float to shore the boats leave the african coast at 8 pm , when the sea is perfectly calm , and two hours later they can find themselves in a storm with wind and huge waves , said nieves garc a benito , a specialist in immigration issues with the association for human rights in andalusia , across the strait in southern spain the weather is like that here , totally unpredictable and then there is the boat traffic there are so many big boats out there oil tankers , 90 a day of course , the immigrants do n't have lights on their boats if the big boats hit them , most of the time they do n't even realize they have hit anything some immigrants have drowned close to shore , advocates say , because those driving the boats are so worried about being caught that they force their passengers , many of whom can barely swim , to jump into the choppy waters rather than land the boats on the beaches illegal migration and its dangers have become troubling issues for europe after a year in which calamitously failed attempts at migrant smuggling have pricked the conscience of a continent trying to balance its humane image of itself with its own economic interests and social cohesion in the last year , 58 chinese migrants suffocated trying to enter britain in the freight container of a truck , and earlier this year nearly a thousand kurds ran aground in the bowels of a creaky freighter off the french riviera some of the immigrants who make it ashore just collapse on the beaches , waiting for the police to pick them up spain immediately sends moroccans home , but it has few treaties with subsaharan countries that would allow others to be repatriated those who do not make it to the spanish coast end up detained in ceuta immigrants who make it to the mainland and are then caught by the police do slightly better they are taken to a center in algeciras , where they get medical attention and new clothes then , they are fingerprinted and told to leave the country within two weeks this makes it possible for them to disappear the spanish government , prompted by its partners in a europe of dissolving borders , has been taking strong measures , doing all it can to seal its southern coast , though it is installing a 120 million radar system that will form a sort of electronic wall across the strait the government has also ringed ceuta and spain s other enclave on the north african coast , melilla , with double razorwire fencing and infrared cameras to keep people from crossing the border illegally and it has stepped up patrols along the coast after antiimmigrant sentiment in southern spain set off rioting last year , the government began cracking down on spanish citizens who help the immigrants juan antonio l pez , a 24yearold taxi driver from zahara de los atunes , a town near tarifa , spent 15 days in jail earlier this year for giving a ride to three undocumented immigrants fellow taxi drivers went on strike to protest the government s actions mr l pez still faces a sixyear sentence if convicted of the charges against him but he remains sympathetic to the bedraggled strangers who come here , usually looking only for a chance to work
one are the mickey tshirts and the pooh paraphernalia after the terrorist attack on new york , disney stores in manhattan swapped the colorful merchandise that usually fills their display windows for huge posters quoting the company s founder , walt disney tomorrow will be better for as long as america keeps alive the ideals of freedom and a better life tomorrow may not be better , however , for the walt disney company like many other companies , it faces the likelihood that the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon will cause a slowing economy to come to a stop public anxiety about further attacks and military reprisals is keeping people at home , with their wallets closed not all businesses will be hurt to the same degree , but the evidence so far is that companies that rely on travel , advertising and retailing are in for a particularly rough time disney , because of its heavy investment in theme parks and hotels as well as broadcast and cable television , faces more uncertainty than its competitors at the epcot center near orlando , fla , for example , acres of parking lots sit almost empty , as does main street at disneyland in anaheim , calif advertisers are reluctant to buy television time while the nation s consumers are preoccupied by the prospect of war and thousands of prints of big trouble , a movie that disney had expected to be a big hit , are in storage because the plot involves a bomb in a suitcase on a plane that explains in part why disney s stock has slid 382 percent this year , to close at 1789 on friday , a larger decline than any of its bigmedia rivals even before the disaster , disney was having problems , and the terror attacks only made them worse disney has been hit the hardest of the media companies due not only to its advertising exposure but the impact that safety concerns have had on park attendance , said scott davis , a media analyst at first union securities adding to the company s concerns , the bass family of texas on thursday had to sell 2 billion of disney stock almost 6 percent of the total to cover its losses on telecommunications stocks the sale has diluted the influence of the staunchest supporters of michael d eisner , disney s chairman , and put ownership of a flood of company stock in diverse hands that is likely to increase speculation of a possible takeover , analysts said it never even crossed my mind about getting taken over , mr eisner said in a telephone interview on friday more than half of disney s revenue comes from businesses that depend on travel , including theme parks and cruises , or on advertising the two parts of the entertainment business that appear most threatened the comparable figure for aol time warner , by comparison , is about 25 percent tourism is even more important for disney s profits than it is for the company s revenue the theme parks and resorts segment accounted for about half of the entire company s 112 billion in operating profit in the last quarter analysts said they think the resorts business is the unit most vulnerable to a slowdown last year , disney made a 920 million profit on 254 billion in revenue faced with further potential declines , disney , like so many other mainstays of corporate america , is simply trying to cope but there is only so much to be done on thursday evening , after news of the bass sale had roiled wall street , mr eisner issued a statement acknowledging that the terror attacks had hurt the company s retail outlets , theme parks and resorts but , he added , as the nation slowly regains its equilibrium , so does disney disney s president , robert a iger , said he believed that it is too soon to judge the events which were previously unthinkable clearly there was an impact , he said , but we do n't think it should be used as a bellwether of what is to come we believe that our businesses are resilient mr eisner declined to quantify the company s nearterm costs as a result of the attacks , including a loss of television advertising revenue but he said , i am an optimistic person by nature and that has not been knocked out of me by this in the past , he added , gasoline shortages , recession and other problems that have cut attendance have created enormous pentup demand if we have a couple of months where fear holds people home , by the time that has subsided , the demand for our products is always greater than anything we had anticipated , he said right now , however , disney s distress stems from its commitment to theme parks , a commitment that rewarded the company handsomely when the economy was booming and americans were eager to spend even as other big entertainment companies got out of the business time warner and its partners , for instance , sold the six flags chain to premier parks inc in 1998 for 965 million disney doubled down , building new properties for good reason , perhaps , the company has always seen its parks as an invaluable conduit for building lifelong loyalty and identification with disney characters
as president bush s chief environmental officer , christie whitman has absorbed plenty of abuse for the administration s generally deplorable environmental record some of this criticism has been unfair , and in many cases she has taken the fall for policies dictated by others but mrs whitman will have only herself to blame if she chooses to scale back the clinton administration s plan that would require general electric to spend a halfbillion dollars to begin the longoverdue task of cleaning the upper hudson river of toxic chemicals known as pcb s rumors have been flying around all week that mrs whitman , the administrator of the environmental protection agency , would shortly announce her own dredging plan , one that could well reduce the clinton administration s plan to a mere pilot project followed by years of additional study and analysis the reports none confirmed by mrs whitman herself have emerged from various members of congress with whom mrs whitman has been conferring and from lowerechelon sources at her agency gov george pataki of new york took them seriously enough to call mrs whitman on tuesday and tell her , in firmer language than he has ever used publicly , that he supports the clinton cleanup plan and that anything less would be unacceptable mr pataki is hardly alone in these views the dredging plan is supported by eliot spitzer , new york s attorney general , senators hillary rodham clinton and charles schumer , and a majority of the state s congressional delegation it is also supported by the federal scientists in epa s new york region who have spent nearly a decade assembling a compelling , peerreviewed case for dredging despite the resolute opposition of general electric mrs whitman is obliged under law to consider the thousands of comments collected by her agency during the last few months , and perhaps these comments have had an impact on her thinking but given her agency s painstaking work over the years , it is hard to imagine what new scientific evidence may have come her way to persuade her that the matter now requires further study under the plan approved last december , dredges would remove about 26 billion cubic yards of sediment containing some 100 , 000 pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls , or pcb s , from various hot spots along a 40mile stretch of the river from troy north to fort edward the roughly 500 million cost would be borne by ge , whose upriver plants dumped the chemicals in the river before they were declared illegal in 1977 ge has never denied its responsibility for the chemicals but has wrangled bitterly with state and federal agencies over how best to handle the problem the company has argued that most of the chemicals are safely buried in the river s sediments and that the only active pcb s are those still leaking from two old upriver plants leaks the company has already spent 160 million trying to plug but the epa argues that in an active , freeflowing river like the hudson , the sediments are constantly discharging chemicals into the water column and must therefore be dredged this page has endorsed the agency s analysis and its plan , and has called upon general electric to do the statesmanlike thing and join washington and albany in a comprehensive effort to restore one of america s great rivers mrs whitman should now reaffirm the federal commitment to this task
and now for a wild prediction within 12 months president bush , vice president dick cheney and all their backers in the oil industry will be begging begging to revive the kyoto protocol on climate change , the accord mr bush yanked america out of after taking office why , you ask \? well , look what s happening in england a group of celebrities there have joined with environmentalists to launch a boycott against exxon mobil gas stations , which in europe go by the name esso bianca jagger , the pop star annie lennox and anita rodrick , founder of the body shop chain , helped launch the boycott because , as ms jagger said , this is a way to tell esso that it s not right for them to be claiming that there is no connection between co2 emissions and climate change people connected with exxon reportedly contributed more than 1 million to the bush campaign exxon is a key supporter of research and advertisements that try to cast doubt on the seriousness of global warming and its link to fossil fuel emissions exxon was a big backer of president bush s decision to pull the us out of the 1997 kyoto protocol , which called for industrialized nations to steadily reduce their carbon dioxide emissions exxon is also a major force behind the global climate coalition , a business lobby that opposed kyoto the stop esso campaign is asking british drivers to shun esso stations until the company supports kyoto \( see www stopesso com \) the campaign recently spread to france what s funny is that probably none of this would have happened had mr bush not bowed to the oil companies and pulled the us out of kyoto that may turn out to be his greatest gift to environmentalism you see , as long as everyone was discussing how to implement kyoto , no one wanted to take any radical steps governments could say they were working on the problem , but that negotiations were hard corporations could mumble nice words about environmentalism , but not worry anything serious was going to happen and environmentalists could feel their cause was being advanced , even though implementation was far off as long as kyoto was there , everyone could avoid real accountability and pretend that something was happening , says paul gilding , the former head of greenpeace and now chairman of ecos , one of australia s leading environmental consulting firms but now george bush , by trashing kyoto , has blown everyone s cover if you care about the environment you ca n't pretend anymore emissions are increasing , the climate is changing and people can now see for themselves that the world is fiddling while rome burns the result environmentalists refuse to sit on their hands anymore instead , the smart ones are mobilizing consumers to fight multinational polluters on their own ground you have to admire it it s so republican using the free market if i were exxon , i would be worried especially when us college students come back to campus in the fall remember monsanto \? it was going to sell genetically modified food to europeans but environmentalists in europe worried , rightly or wrongly , about the safety of what they were eating mobilized the weakest link in the value chain consumers consumers demanded gmofree food so supermarkets demanded it from their suppliers , suppliers demanded it from farmers and farmers demanded it from monsanto goodbye , monsanto this is real globalization activism the smart activists are now saying , 'ok , you want to play markets let s play , ' says mr gilding they do n't waste time throwing stones or lobbying governments that takes forever and can easily be counterlobbied by corporations no , no , no they start with consumers at the pump , get them to pressure the gas stations , get the station owners to pressure the companies and the companies to pressure governments after all , consumers do have choices where they buy their gas , and there are differences now shell and bpamoco \( which is also the world s biggest solar company \) both withdrew from the oil industry lobby that has been dismissing climate change what mr bush did in trashing kyoto was to leave serious environmental activists with nowhere else to turn but the market the smart ones get it you will be hearing from them soon at a gas station near you
twentyfive years ago , battery park city was little more than a barren riverside landfill and a dream today , its copperroofed office towers , 25 upscale condominium and apartment buildings and finely manicured riverfront parks have become some of the most valuable real estate in new york city but one central ingredient in the formula devised and refined by a succession of new york governors and mayors is missing the roughly 60 , 000 low and moderateincome housing units promised either within battery park city or elsewhere in the city the plan , conceived in the mid1960 s by gov nelson a rockefeller and mayor john v lindsay , was to avoid building just a riviera on the hudson by using the money that this governmentbacked project would generate to benefit the city s poor and middle class but while battery park city has flourished , generating tens of millions of dollars each year in revenues from leases and other sources , the lowcost housing plan has nearly disappeared , producing from 1 , 557 to 4 , 350 units of low or moderatecost housing in the last decade , depending on how it is counted what happened to battery park s commitment to finance the preservation or renovation of up to 60 , 000 units of housing citywide is hard to untangle , in part because responsibility now stretches over five mayoral administrations officials at the battery park city authority , an agency created by the state in 1968 that collects rent and payments from landlords that are made in lieu of taxes , and pays off its debts , say they have lived up to the bargain by turning over millions of dollars to the city every year as to what happened to the money the authority has given to the city , timothy s carey , president of the authority , said that is a question the city should answer city officials , though , say that they never really regarded the agreement as binding , and that the city has relied on a loophole in the agreement to spend the battery park money as it sees fit sometimes for housing , but more often for other things if all you are talking about is money , i am not going to speak to money , deputy mayor robert m harding said , when asked if the city had honored its battery park city commitments the city has done a remarkable job of putting new housing units on but housing advocates in the city , as well as several of the original architects of the deal , say that the commitments made at battery park city s birth have not been honored i am terribly disappointed , said meyer s frucher , president of the battery park city authority from 1984 to 1988 and now chief executive of the philadelphia stock exchange i think it has been a breach of faith the perceived failure to honor the agreement has become a central tenet in the intensifying criticism of the giuliani administration by housing advocates , who contend it has largely ignored the increasingly acute shortage of low and moderateincome housing in the city these advocates have recently been pressing mayor rudolph w giuliani to reassert the city s commitment to the deal , by including in his final budget plan a large new investment in housing , a request the mayor has already hinted he intends to honor there is an opportunity to start anew , said carol lamberg , executive director of the settlement housing fund , which has participated in the meetings with mr giuliani s top aides it is not too late the pledge an obligation to help all housing classes the notion of replacing 20 rotting hudson river piers with a virtual new city first surfaced in 1962 , the same year architectural work on the adjacent world trade center began land dug up to make way for the twin towers was deposited along the hudson shore , and on it would be built battery park city in a 1968 joint statement , governor rockefeller and mayor lindsay pledged that the city would earmark funds it would normally receive from new commercial and luxury developments to underwrite land costs for new low and middleincome housing by 1969 , mr lindsay reached an agreement with other city officials that twothirds of the 15 , 000 apartments set to rise at battery park city would be for people with low or moderate incomes , which in today s terms mean annual incomes up to about 45 , 000 for a family of four with the climate of division coming out of the riots and civil rights struggle , this was the right thing to do , percy e sutton , the former manhattan borough president , said in an interview last month if you are going to use public land and public money , you have an obligation to be sure that it is racially and economically integrated or at least benefits people of all classes the construction of the 92acre landfill was completed in 1976 , when the city had slumped into a fiscal crisis , and the idea of developing battery park city as a mixedincome community was abandoned as quaintly utopian but after city finances stabilized and construction of housing and offices at battery park city had begun in the mid1980 s , a new vision for battery park was embraced allow an exclusive community to be developed , but use money generated by it to finance affordable housing elsewhere in the city
decatur , ala , april 26 a few weeks ago , a federal judge walked through the doors of the morgan county jail in this tidy riverfront city and observed firsthand what happens when 256 inmates are crammed into a jail built for 96 he stepped around scores of inmates that the state prisons had refused to take most were sleeping on the floor next to toilets and on top of shower drains , because they had no beds he saw the cells that no one cleaned and the linens that no one washed he breathed the fetid air that the prisoners breathed and saw the small portions of unsanitary food that they ate last week the judge , u w clemon , wrote a blistering ruling ordering the state prisoners removed by midmay and the jail cleaned judge clemon s strong language has shaken up one of the country s most overburdened corrections systems to say the morgan county jail is overcrowded is an understatement , he wrote the sardinecan appearance of its cell units more nearly resemble the holding units of slave ships during the middle passage of the 18th century than anything in the 21st century more than 11 percent of the state s 27 , 000 prisoners are in county jails though it costs alabama 26 a day to keep an inmate in a state prison , the state pays counties only 175 per meal to house its prisoners , the judge noted holding inmates in county jails saves the state more than 70 , 000 a day the department of corrections thus has a substantial financial incentive to leave its state prisoners on the barren concrete floors of the morgan county jail , judge clemon wrote his ruling was the latest in a series of federal court orders going back 30 years that have tried to improve conditions in the prisons and jails of alabama , which has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country , 571 per 100 , 000 people the pattern has become familiar a court orders prisoners freed the state grudgingly builds more prison beds the problem recedes until the inmate population builds again and a new court has to step in but this time , lawmakers and prison experts say , the problem may have reached its most serious level alabama s rate of incarceration has risen unabated as the legislature has increased drug penalties and reduced parole the number of state prisoners most of them nonviolent drug offenders has grown sevenfold since 1970 , and the prison population has been rising by 130 prisoners a month only four states texas , louisiana , oklahoma and mississippi and the district of columbia have higher rates of incarceration , but though county jails in other states also have been crowded , few of the states have had a problem as widespread or as longrunning as alabama s the lowtax state has always been among the nation s poorest , and a decline in revenue has made it hard to find money for new prisons or alternative programs judges are getting angry , and even county sheriffs are threatening legal action if their jail populations are not reduced in birmingham on wednesday , sheriff jim woodward of jefferson county said he would try to have the state corrections commissioner , michael w haley , cited for contempt for leaving state prisoners in his jail in december , four judges in houston county threatened to order 118 state prisoners taken from the jail and chained to the fence of the state prison if the state did not accept them when other judges around alabama started praising the idea , the state quickly found room for 1 , 000 prisoners but as unventilated county jails continue to fill up , some people in corrections say they fear violence or other hazards as the summer s heat approaches it s becoming a dangerous situation , said allen l tapley , executive director of the sentencing institute , a private research group in montgomery that is a paid consultant to state government on justice issues tamara serwer , a lawyer for the southern center for human rights , an atlanta legal center that took the morgan county case to judge clemon , said the group would continue its work in other counties with crowded jails inmates are supposed to be transferred from a jail to a state prison within 30 days of being sentenced , but often that transfer never happens ms serwer said many prisoners were kept for months in the small jails , which were not built for longterm incarceration morgan county s 25yearold jail was all but condemned in september by the state fire marshal , who found in an inspection that the fire alarm and smoke detectors were not working , that there was no sprinkler system and that the building was so crowded that inmates and guards were in danger there have been several small fires in the jail in the last year , the marshal noted sheriff stephen l crabbe , who is responsible for the jail , refused to discuss the issue or let a reporter inside , citing the advice of his lawyer but several inmates working outside the jail this week said the reports did not go far enough in describing conditions inside it s a hellhole in there , said one inmate , who would not give his name you ca n't move , and you do n't want to breathe inmates said the mattresses that the judge saw were provided a few days before his tour before that , many inmates had to sleep on concrete , they said
their fighters have been routed in all but one afghan city , kandahar many now being held prisoner are a bedraggled lot all rags and filth and lowered heads , as 800 taken in trucks from kunduz to heaven knows where were described but whipped though they may be , taliban troops can still make life miserable for their enemies , as amply proved by their bloodsoaked uprising at the qala jangi fortress declaring victory it took nearly three days , plus help from american and british forces , but the northern alliance said it had finally crushed the qala jangi revolt by hundreds of taliban prisoners , most of them pakistanis and most of them now dead important details remained unclear , however , including whether the alliance s report should be taken entirely as gospel the american commander of the war effort said that 30 to 40 rebels were still holding out the fate of americans at the scene was somewhat vague , too the pentagon said that five of its soldiers were seriously hurt by an errant american bomb but northern alliance troops said that two americans seemed to be dead as they were evacuated by helicopter as the alliance tells it , its forces literally smoked out taliban rebels holed up in a building , the final blow being pointblank fire from a soviet tank piecing together what had occurred , alliance soldiers said the prisoners apparently feared that they were about to be executed , and were angered by the presence of american intelligence agents , sent there to interview them reading the loyalists the ferocity of the uprising no less by people who supposedly had surrendered in the fall of kunduz raised inevitable questions about whether taliban loyalists can be taken at face value when they say they are ready to give up the fight there is , for example , mullah amirjan selabe , who slipped across the border into pakistan , where he tossed off his black taliban turban in favor of a gray one with white stripes he used to command 30 taliban soldiers in kabul but now mullah selabe sees life differently now he wants to learn what else \? computers , and to visit america oh , but do n't misunderstand he hates america , he said seeking bin laden as ever , the big prize for the united states is finding osama bin laden and his al qaeda disciples offering their most explicit details to date , senior pentagon officials said the hunt was focused on the region around kandahar , in the afghan south , and along a mountainous , cavedotted stretch in the east , between kabul and the khyber pass to make the point more forcefully , american warplanes bombed a compound southeast of kandahar said to have been used by the taliban , al qaeda and others no doubt , people were killed , officials in washington said the tantalizing question was who too early to tell , the officials said discussing the future some were already looking beyond the unfinished war outside bonn , representatives of four afghan factions began talks on putting together a multiethnic interim administration that might lead afghanistan to some sort of working government given the long years of ethnic hatred and warlord rule , they have one tough road to navigate but the atmosphere of the opening ceremonial round seemed good and the factions have a powerful incentive not to blow this chance to form a popular government the world is talking about providing billions of dollars to help rebuild afghanistan the blunt message given the afghans may help them focus no agreement , no money feeling heat in america at home , pressures of a different sort were felt by attorney general john ashcroft , increasingly criticized because of the way the bush administration has waged its domestic war on terrorism as a sign of the frustration , a federal judge in new york granted bail to a jordanian student charged with lying to a grand jury investigating the sept 11 attacks the government had not offered good enough reasons to hold him , the judge said in congress , both republicans and democrats have been exasperated at the administration s failure to consult them on some of its antiterrorism measures on the eve of a possibly contentious senate hearing , mr ashcroft made a gesture , providing the names of 93 people charged with crimes postsept 11 none of the charges directly involve terrorism he also gave an accounting of 548 people , mostly from the middle east , who remain in custody on immigration charges no names , though , just nationalities clyde haberman
it was the longest bus ride most of them had experienced since the minor leagues , eight hours from pittsburgh to the parking lot at shea stadium players watched a movie or listened to music through headphones , but there was none of the usual upbeat chatter sometime after 1 am wednesday , the mets crossed the george washington bridge everybody peeked out the windows and saw the smoke , said reliever john franco , the mets' captain everybody was silent it was the players' first look at evidence of the horror caused in their city by tuesday s attacks , which resulted in the postponement of their series in pittsburgh and the scheduling of another series at shea next weekend new york is a temporary home to most of the mets , but it has always been home to the brooklynborn franco like most new yorkers , he is equal parts saddened , enraged , defiant and proud nobody in my family is hurt , franco said by telephone yesterday but our big family , that s what you feel in new york , everybody s a family right now franco has been touched by the tragedy john bergen , a firefighter and a coach of his son s little league team on staten island , is missing family members have seen franco s cousin mario starace , a firefighter , assisting with rescue efforts on television franco whose late father , james , worked for the department of sanitation has befriended numerous police officers at games , and he worries some of those guys might be missing right now , he said franco s 9yearold son , j j , saw the footage on television and asked his father if staten island was going to be bombed franco told him not to worry and tried to assure his son he was safe franco says he has never felt unsafe in new york , even now seeing the city s reaction has bolstered his hometown pride guys come up to you from other teams and say you could n't pay them enough to play here or live here , franco said but to myself or al leiter , there s no other city like it in the world it shows when there is tragedy or destruction how new york rallies around each other , with no regard to race , color , religion it s mindboggling how everybody in a city of this size comes together franco and the mets will play their next game on monday in pittsburgh , in the opening game of a series originally scheduled for shea stadium the mets still do not know if they will go to pittsburgh by plane or by bus the team will work out at shea today , but considering the setting , the tone will be somber players could use the physical diversion franco said he had been watching television constantly since the attacks but the mental adjustment could take awhile franco would not say if he agreed with commissioner bud selig s decision to resume play monday you do what you 're told , he said but at least initially , franco said , players' minds may be elsewhere i just ca n't foresee myself giving a highfive to someone for a big hit or a strikeout when there are bodies of people who are missing and thousands who might be dead , he said

michael r bloomberg , the republican billionaire , plans to announce his candidacy for mayor on tuesday in a television commercial in which he introduces himself to voters and says the city cannot go back to the way it once was it s 'hi , i'm mike and i'm running for mayor , ' said bill cunningham , mr bloomberg s political consultant , explaining the gist of the 60second commercial it is to be broadcast on tuesday , wednesday and thursday in the new york metropolitan region on channels 2 , 4 , 5 and 7 as an explanation of why the political neophyte is running for mayor , mr cunningham said , mr bloomberg will tell viewers that this city cannot afford to go back to the clubhouse mr cunningham would say little else about any positions mr bloomberg might have on education , criminal justice , housing , public health or economic development but he did say that we want people to know that we are going to build on the successes of the giuliani administration and that mr bloomberg would play up his role as the only successful businessman among the mayoral candidates if they want to talk about experience going into an uncertain economic time , we 'll be happy to compare notes , mr cunningham said , in a conference room at the sleek new bloomberg for mayor campaign headquarters on east 56th street , where cookies , potato chips , candy and drinks are provided free to the staff he s the only one who in the last 35 years was working in varying economies and who in the last 20 years built a very strong company that company , bloomberg lp , is to be run by subordinates during the campaign , although mr bloomberg will retain ownership mr bloomberg did not return numerous telephone calls over the past two days for comment , making him unique among the major mayoral candidates four democrats and one other republican who at this point in the race are avidly seeking , rather than avoiding , media attention but in a brief telephone interview last month , mr bloomberg said i 've got to learn the issues it s a whole new education for me i am working very hard he also said that he had not meant to announce his candidacy last month to a gossip columnist his i'm running comment , uttered at a dinner , was subsequently plastered all over the front page of the new york post i'm not going to use liz smith as a vehicle for an announcement , rest assured , mr bloomberg said now mr bloomberg will use the television airwaves at an opening cost of 350 , 000 for the three days of broadcasting , to be supplemented by another commercial that is to go on the air over next weekend there will be none of that traditional balloons and bunting kind of stuff , mr cunningham said he will speak directly to the voters mr bloomberg s openingday television commercial on june 5 coincides with the first day that mayoral candidates can begin circulating petitions to collect the tens of thousands of signatures necessary to get on the ballot it is also the same day that mr bloomberg s eldest daughter , emma , is to graduate from princeton university , meaning that he will be out of new york that day but mr cunningham said that mr bloomberg would return on wednesday for a full day of campaign events and interviews , beginning with a gospel breakfast for the abyssinian development corporation to be held at city college , part of the city university of new york the university is chaired by herman badillo , the other republican who plans to announce his candidacy for mayor next week if bloomberg announces wednesday , i 'll probably announce thursday , mr badillo said he added that he would definitely stay in the race , even under intense pressure from republican party leaders and aides to gov george e pataki to clear the way for mr bloomberg , who is spending millions of his 4 billion fortune on the campaign there were people who want me out of the race , but i am not listening , mr badillo said mr badillo dismissed mr bloomberg s television commercial as nothing more than a financial bonanza for his media consultants that will make sure david garth makes a lot of money , said mr badillo , referring to one of mr bloomberg s political consultants who is part of the team that made the commercials hank morris , the political consultant to city comptroller alan g hevesi , a democratic candidate for mayor , called mr bloomberg s coming television announcement very weird he added , when he talks to live people , you do n't get to have 30 takes so far mr bloomberg has not had an entirely smooth entry into the freeforall world of new york city politics , which he acknowledged in the recent telephone interview the thing that has disturbed me the most is that in this business , the press questions people in politics in a different way than the business press questions people , he said mr bloomberg cited no specifics , although he has said in the past that he was hugely irritated by a reporter who asked if he was delivering meals last december to a homebound elderly couple in east harlem as a campaign event you know , you look at these people up there , this is the highlight of their day to get a meal , he said at the time mr cunningham acknowledged that mr bloomberg could have chosen his words better i think mike kind of looked at it when he saw it in print and said , 'oh , that does n't read well , ' he said if some day

what is the most efficient way to raise lowincome pupils' achievement \? is it ending social promotion , increasing accountability or adding more testing \? it could be none of those improving nutrition might bring a bigger testscore gain hunger is not as serious here as in countries where children are so nutrientdeprived that brain growth is impeded the moderate undernutrition found in the united states affects performance , but recovery is usually possible with adequate diet yet if dietary deficiencies persist , learning can suffer iron deficiency anemia , which is twice as common in poor as in betteroff children , affects cognitive ability in experiments where pupils got inexpensive vitamin and mineral supplements , test scores rose from that treatment alone in another experiment , poor children who got free breakfast at school were compared with children who were eligible but who did not participate those with breakfast gained about three percentile points on standardized tests , and attendance also improved , at a price of only about a dollar a day per child that is more than most education reforms can accomplish at the cost one in six children now comes from a family in poverty with rents rising faster than inflation , the poor reduce food purchases deteriorating nutrition may have undercut efforts to improve school performance welfaretowork policies seemed to make sense as a way to push poor parents to take more responsibility for supporting their children , but have not done much to ease child hunger many former welfare recipients are now employed in jobs paying the minimum wage , or close to it , earnings that have not given them the ability to nourish their children a fulltime minimumwage worker is paid only about 11 , 000 a year , and a family of four is below the poverty line if earnings are less than about 17 , 000 meanwhile , food stamp use has fallen , partly because many welfaretowork participants wrongly think they are now ineligible although the working poor qualify , public agencies have failed to promote enrollment in 1994 , 86 percent of eligible children were in families getting stamps by 1998 , the figure was 69 percent after ensuring that poor families get food stamps to which they are entitled , officials should set another priority expanding the school breakfast program eligibility for breakfast is the same as for the betterknown federal lunch program children whose parents have income below 130 percent of the poverty line get free meals if income is below 185 percent , meals are subsidized but participation in school breakfast is much lower than in lunch part of the reason is that school officials hesitate to take on yet another duty , and even with the best of intentions , breakfast programs are hard to organize arranging for adults to supervise breakfast before classes begin is one problem another is scheduling buses to bring eligible children , but not others , to school early because of such difficulties , only 35 percent of children in new york state who get lunch also have breakfast texas , with 50 percent , and california , with 40 percent , do a little better urban participation is often lower in new york city , the figure is only about 26 percent so poor children s nutrition depends increasingly on charitable groups america s second harvest \( www secondharvest org \) , a national network of food banks , reports that its affiliates now serve eight million children over half the number in school lunch programs many food banks turn away families for lack of supplies private efforts are especially critical right now although summer school attendance has grown , school breakfast and lunch programs enroll a much smaller proportion of eligible children than during the regular school year researchers have found that achievement gaps between poor and middleclass students are greater in the summer than in the regular year while experts ca n't say what role undernutrition plays in this extra summertime academic lag , food programs may be one way to address it demands for academic proficiency of poor children enjoy wide support among voters yet reducing hunger that causes low test scores may be accomplished more easily than the various unproved educational reforms commonly advanced a higher minimum wage that helps lowwage parents feed their children could be one important step in ensuring that no child is left behind and those wanting to narrow academic gaps can also take matters into their own hands , without relying on government they can contribute to the nation s overstressed food banks this too would amount to real education reform drawing \( david suter \)

just before the opening of school , and facing a shortfall in state money , many school districts in new york are reducing prekindergarten and afterschool programs , jettisoning plans to reduce class sizes , holding off on filling teacher vacancies and even raising tax bills the unprecedented lastminute scrimping and saving comes as a result of the stalled state budget negotiations in albany , where gov george e pataki and the legislature have failed to agree on a final state budget , now overdue by five months instead , the legislature has adopted a barebones budget that includes an appropriation for education far below the expectations of school districts many of them , particularly in rural and impoverished areas , rely heavily on state financing with tax bills due to go out sept 1 and a state law requiring they have a balanced budget in place , administrators were forced to make painful choices between raising taxes or paring programs some refer to it as a barebones budget , said steven walts , the superintendent of the greece central school district outside rochester to me this is as scary as a skeleton in the closet at halloween mr walts , facing a shortfall of some 4 million in aid for classrooms and construction projects , has put off building renovations and sent letters to 70 families notifying them that a prekindergarten program will be canceled you 're only 4 years old once , mr walts said of the program that serves preschoolers this literally denies children a fantastic start on the path for a great education he is not alone the tiny madison central school district in central new york is cutting back its prekindergarten program , the only alternative the superintendent said he saw to raising taxes we 're a poor , rural district without any industrial property tax base , said abe kaufstein , the superintendent we just could n't raise taxes but some districts have indeed gone that route , including the friendship district in allegany county , where the average homeowner will pay just under 100 more after an 11 percent tax increase the superintendent , charles h tyo jr , said he could not bear to cut services to students , many of whom are in special education , but the higher taxes will raise only half of the district s 160 , 000 shortfall in anticipated aid we hope the rest will come when , or if , they pass a supplemental budget , mr tyo said i have calluses on my knees from prayer spokesmen for mr pataki and legislative leaders said on friday afternoon that they were still talking and making progress on a plan to increase education aid beyond the governor s proposal , which the legislature adopted none would guess when an agreement might be reached congress and president bush are also grappling with how much to spend on education , but local school superintendents said that federal money represented such a small amount of their budgets that they had not focused on the debate in washington the new york state school boards association is surveying its members to determine how many have had to raise taxes or make dire cuts before schools open , typically a day or two after labor day anecdotally , it appears that many prepared for a problem in albany by budgeting conservatively to begin with , but they did not anticipate it would mean being forced to start the school year with only what the governor had proposed the results of the survey , in which 132 of the 700 districts statewide responded , will be released tomorrow , but a preliminary look at the numbers show that 95 percent did one or more of the following curtailed or abolished academic programs , tapped surplus funds , raised property taxes or planned to borrow money to tide them over until there was a supplemental budget the remaining 5 percent , said timothy g kremer , the executive director of the association , responded that the budget would not affect their plans reports of hardship abound , particularly in less affluent areas upstate districts in poorer communities have been hit the hardest because they tend to rely on state aid more than wealthier areas , which can draw on a healthier property tax base for their budgets the friendship district , for example , counts on state aid for about 85 percent of its 5 million budget while scarsdale , an affluent district in westchester county , relies on state financing for only 6 percent of its 767 million budget statewide , districts on average receive about 40 percent of their financing from the state , with most of the rest coming from property taxes the five largest cities new york , buffalo , rochester , syracuse and yonkers receive their general fund financing through city budgets rather than a separate property tax but they have not been spared the pain because , in writing their budgets , city officials anticipate a certain amount of state aid new york city , for example , now expects to get about 100 million less than anticipated , and rochester , 21 million less rochester will sharply reduce money for field trips , replacement textbooks , supplies and consultants , and will scale back plans for improvements to cafeterias and athletic fields there is still a little gap and we have got to figure out how to close it by next week , louis n kash , the district s finance officer , said on friday the trouble stems from the feud in albany over the state budget , where the governor and legislature are still arguing over final numbers
a wellborn southern lady of a certain age , rich and accomplished , leaned across the dinner table last week and said my country is virginia i'm also a citizen of the united states , but it s a distant second i am still furious that the south was not allowed to recover until after the second world war there was no good reason to scorch our earth it was just vengeance she was trying to explain why dale earnhardt was such a hero in her country of course , she had never been to a nascar race , although people who worked for her went all the time first , that courtly confederate gentleman , richard petty , then the more rambunctious earnhardt , was the hood ornament of stock car racing , the only major american sport that did not originate in the northeast before radiating south and west stock car racing is as deeply woven into the fabric of the south as hockey is to canada this was nascar s breakout year , and perhaps the most important sports story of 2001 certainly mine in recent weeks , people in and around the sport have been asking me , the bedazzled yankee guest on a oneyear visa about to expire , if i thought nascar would start to run out of gas next year when i stalled for time and asked what that meant and why anyone would think it , the question was broken down one , did i think nascar needed a major northeastern site to succeed \?

of course not , or to replace richard petty either who ever replaced babe ruth \? for most of the last century , just the quest to fill his spikes was heroic romance enough for baseball while most major sports are still based on regional competition and regional heroes almost incredible in this time of free agency nascar has the opportunity of creating national heroes but nascar s founding family , the frances , has always seemed fearful of promoting characters that might become bigger than the sport and thus have the power to get a better deal from management by threatening to create a rival league earnhardt was safe for all his outlaw image he never confronted the system itself drivers now privately discount the notion that earnhardt was a backchannel between the garage and the front office money and safety have always been the drivers' biggest concerns , and he was no lobbyist for revenuesharing or headandneck restraints , much less soft walls or less rigid front ends the current younger crop , jeff gordon , dale jr , even the volatile tony stewart , do not seem likely to challenge the status quo for some abstract cause so long as they get theirs those three are to the intimidator as dimaggio , mantle , mays were to the bambino three , is nascar risking losing its hardcore fan base by romancing the demographics those yupster men who might turn out to be fickle \?

more than 10 years ago , topranked law schools started producing classes more diverse than ever before since then , more than 20 percent of the students at some elite schools have been members of minority groups , and the percentages at lessselective institutions have exceeded 10 percent many of those graduates spent summers working as interns at big firms and went on to become lawyers there by 1993 , at least 8 percent of starting associates belonged to minority groups it takes about eight years to become a partner at most firms so some partners hoped that by now these increasingly diverse classes of young lawyers would have become increasingly diverse classes of young partners by and large , that has not happened no organization collects data on the diversity of new partners but a survey of the 12 highestgrossing law firms in the united states by the new york times shows that minority lawyers accounted for about 5 percent of the new partners in recent years at the seven firms that supplied such data and at some firms the percentage was much lower for example , at sullivan cromwell , none of the 33 new partners since 1997 belong to minority groups at shearman sterling , one minority lawyer was made partner out of 17 this year , while none of the 12 who made partner last year , or of the 10 in 1999 , were minority lawyers that is 26 percent of all partners the past three years at weil , gotshal manges , one out of the 23 people who made partner this year was from a minority group , as was one of the 41 last year , and one of 28 the year before that is 33 percent at another of the biggest firms , jones , day , reavis pogue , the numbers are similar one minority lawyer out of 31 new partners this year , one out of 27 last year , and one out of 26 in 1999 that is 36 percent while there are no statistics on the diversity of new partners at all firms , there are numbers on the diversity of all partners over all , last year minority lawyers accounted for 34 percent of all law firm partners 1 , 608 lawyers , up less than a percentage point since 1993 , according to the national association for law placement you 've really had years of fairly substantial numbers of students coming out of the better schools , said conrad harper , a partner at simpson thacher bartlett in new york elite schools like harvard law school and columbia law school report that for more than a decade at least 20 percent of graduates have been from minority groups according to the american bar association , at least 11 percent of all graduates were from minority groups in 1990 that had climbed to 189 percent last year the numbers at firms should be better than they are , mr harper said some lawyers say that while many law schools have aggressively recruited minority students and many law firms have done the same for minority graduates , firms have been more reluctant to promote minority associates to partnership one reason lawyers offer is that minority lawyers are less likely to have relationships with important clients or to have landed a significant amount of business for the firm but some minority lawyers say that they are not given the same opportunities as white lawyers to work with important clients , often because they do not have mentors who ensure they have access to the best work without a mentor or advocate , the best work is given to those people whom the partner likes most , said angel g gomez , incoming president of the hispanic national bar association who s that going to be \? that s going to be the individual who went to their alma mater , the individual who comes from their hometown mr gomez left a big chicago firm where he was the only hispanic partner to help found an independent firm , castro , gomez , durbin dejesus lawyers also cite what they perceive as a lack of opportunity for advancement within firms for nearly every associate my year who came into the firm lifestyle , there is some degree of dissatisfaction , across the board , male , female , black , white everyone , said one associate who plans to leave her firm in the near future she did not wish to give her name because she is still employed there as a black female associate , i'm less willing to ride it out because i do n't feel confident that there s a light at the end of the tunnel , she said finally , lawyers cite a growing number of career opportunities in business , in consulting firms and in accounting firms other minority lawyers move to government law jobs or corporate legal departments the lack of diversity is sufficiently worrisome to lawyers that it has been a subject of several sessions at the american bar association s current annual meeting in chicago , receiving more attention than in any prior year , said charisse r lillie , a partner at ballard spahr andrews ingersoll in philadelphia and chairwoman of the association s commission on racial and ethnic diversity the problem appears to be a continuing revolving door , said theodore v wells jr , cochairman of the litigation practice at paul , weiss , rifkind , wharton garrison in new york , where a fairly constant number of minority associates comes into the pipeline , and they 're gone four years later , with the net result being a continually small number of minority senior associates and an even smaller number of minority partners
the holocaust should not be relegated to unfathomable mystery it consists of concrete acts of mass murder yet anyone who writes about it , or seeks to recreate aspects of it artistically , quickly becomes aware of the formidable barriers it presents the scale of the murder creates a sense of awe in the writer or playwright , along with the responsibility for a nearperfect moral tone , which together can lead to immobilization in the end , the best one can do is to settle for a particular perspective or commentary , for a segment of the event , as opposed to anything approaching a comprehensive rendition one can address the perpetrators their ideology , structural arrangements , conflicts and ultimate socialization to killing the victims their struggles with survival and witness or the tenuous , always dangerous interactions of perpetrators and victims theatrical works soon to arrive on and off broadway address , in one way or another , all of these dimensions for instance , abby mann s judgment at nuremberg , based primarily on his 1959 teleplay and novel and certain elements of the movie , is about accused nazi judges arje shaw s play the gathering examines ronald reagan s strange visit to the ss cemetery at bitburg in connection with conflicts between a jewish survivor and his reaganite son and victor klemperer s recently translated diaries , adapted for the stage by karen malpede and george bartenieff , are already being looked on as a classical expression of a survivor bearing witness from within nazi germany there are several additional holocaustrelated plays being produced in new york and other cities , along with an impressive number of films for television and movie houses does this cluster of holocaust dramas say something important about our present capacity to imagine the holocaust \? about our culture in general \? these are questions we must raise but should not be too quick to answer an important issue here is the role of survivors in both the creation and reception of these plays arje shaw is a child survivor , as is george bartenieff , who besides being the coadapter is the sole performer in i will bear witness \( the klemperer diaries \) but survivor influence runs much deeper in our society than any such direct participation we depend on the vast array of survivor accounts for our grasp of the human consequences of the holocaust the youngest of an aging population , child survivors may have much more to say , as may survivors' children and grandchildren when i was doing research on nazi doctors , i came to realize that my understanding of their behavior depended as much on interviews with survivors who had been forced to cope with them in auschwitz as on interviews with \( and archival research on \) the nazi doctors themselves while questions of accuracy have been raised about some survivor accounts , there are existential truths that only survivors can provide we can understand the survivor influence by thinking of a series of concentric circles at the very center are the dead , who in some cases left records but find their voice mainly through survivors , who are our primary witnesses the circle beyond them includes those who seek to bear witness at an additional remove by immersing themselves in survivor accounts \( as well as in other sources of information \) and bringing their own knowledge and intellectual or creative discipline to bear on reimagining a portion of the holocaust this category of witnessing artist is especially crucial to the cultural memory of the holocaust and constantly confronts the resistance and numbing that persist in our society and throughout the world , no matter how many holocaust dramas are performed at still another remove is the circle of ordinary people who provide a responsive audience to witnessing artists there is a parallel set of concentric circles involving the nazis themselves here the testimony is likely to be more skimpy , evasive and selfserving , and special care must be taken to check it against other sources abby mann drew upon statements made in a trial of nazi judges for his judgment at nuremberg , and more recently there have been important renderings of the behavior of nazi perpetrators coming from germany , as in bernhard schlink s novel the reader in my own work , i sought to combine clarity about nazi doctors' moral responsibility for what they did with nuanced representations of them , including psychological conflicts that , unfortunately , most were sufficiently able to overcome to go on with their killing while some people might wish to view all nazis as simply frozen in evil , we dismiss their complexity at our own cultural and political peril at issue always is the imaginative freedom of the artist survivors \( and others \) can come to view the details of the holocaust as hiroshima survivors did those of the atomic bomb experience as a kind of sacred , if demonic , reality , not to be tampered with by outsiders as an expression of their responsibility to the dead , they can insist on a scrupulous rendering of historical detail many therefore can be comfortable only with precise documentary efforts at recreation
munich , feb 4 though its drive to build a national missile defense is barely under way , the bush administration has already managed to shift the focus of the european security debate despite deepseated hopes that the missile defense issue would just go away , european officials now seem to accept , grudgingly , the fact that the new american team is determined to move ahead the new mood was evident at a twoday conference here , which brought together top security officials and defense experts from europe , the united states and asia no ranking europeans officials rushed to grab defense secretary donald h rumsfeld s offer to help the european allies deploy their own missile defenses but there were no fiery dissents either none of this means that the matter has been put to rest what it does mean is that the debate is entering a new phase in which the issue is more how the united states should go about developing missile defenses , than whether it should try the diplomatic and technological questions are more pressing than ever , and they could yet affect the debate in both the united states and europe it is still unclear whether the pentagon can overcome the technological hurdles for an effective missile defense , and even if it does , it could take the better part of a decade to start putting such a system in place but the political costs must be paid up front that is because the united states will need to amend or jettison the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty to embark on a serious testing and development program that means coping with russia s and china s anxieties that washington has embarked on a quest for strategic dominance and it means reassuring the europeans that the bush administration is attuned to the concerns of its allies and has not embarked on a goitalone strategy the administration is still in its early days , but it clearly has yet to produce a diplomatic strategy to accompany its missile defense plan mr rumsfeld , for instance , barely mentioned russia in his saturday address to the conference , and what he did say consisted of little more than the assertion that with a sizable nuclear arsenal , moscow had no reason to be concerned about a limited missile defense the russians provided no openings either seeking to rouse european sentiment against the administration s plan , sergei ivanov , the head of president vladimir v putin s security council , warned that it would ignite an arms race in space and undermine the entire edifice of arms control agreements it will result in the annihilation of the whole structure of strategic stability and create the prerequisites for a new arms race , mr ivanov said though neither spoke in a confrontational tone , the two speeches recalled the superpower jousting of the cold war the battleground was again european public opinion , only this time there appears to a general acknowledgment that moscow s influence has waned it was left to senator joseph i lieberman , the former democratic candidate for vice president and a supporter of missile defense , to raise the possibility of cooperating with the russians and it was another missile defense supporter , senator john mccain , the arizona republican and former presidential aspirant , who suggested that the united states broaden its strategic agenda by reconsidering ratification of the international treaty banning nuclear tests while reasonable men can differ about the merits of that treaty mr mccain said verification measures should be improved before it was reconsidered by the senate it was an effort to present a security policy that embraced both arms control as well as missile defense during the election campaign , george w bush signaled that he would push for deeper , perhaps onesided cuts in longrange nuclear arms those proposals will take time to develop , and the europeans are looking for more than cuts in the american arsenal they want to preserve much of the existing framework of arms control treaties for those who favor cooperation with moscow , much will depend on what type of missile defenses the administration designs mr lieberman touted a boost phase system , in which interceptors based on ships would be used to shoot down missiles soon after they were launched the system would be far more palatable to the russians than a spacebased defense , in part because it could not down missiles launched from russia s heartland the russians , in fact , have proposed a similar approach but the bush administration has talked about developing a system that can also defend against an accidental or unauthorized launching that makes it very unlikely that it will limit itself to a boostphase defense and makes reconciling arms control with a missile shield much more of a challenge administration officials said today that they recognized that they would have to get around to dealing with moscow but they say they wanted to start by consulting with the allies , a step mr rumsfeld took when he offered to help the europeans deploy their own missile defenses the primary european concern , however , seems to be to keep relations with russia on an even keel the europeans seem to see little benefit from missile defense , at least in the near term , and have little enthusiasm for spending the billions of dollars it would take to build one washington also has a stake in trying to avoid a diplomatic confrontation with moscow without the russians , the united states may find it difficult to continue its programs to protect nuclear materials in russia or to press russia to crack down on the export of missile and nuclear technology as for china , if the united states cannot ease worries there , beijing may speed up efforts to modernize its arsenal of 18 landbased missiles , a development that american intelligence has warned could set off an arms race including india and pakistan though administration officials do not have the answers yet , they insist that a comprehensive policy will be produced their diplomatic strategy for now is watch this space we understand that there is a lot of work to do with the allies , a lot of work to do with the russians , condoleezza rice , president bush s national security adviser , told cnn today but we believe that , with the proper context , and with the chance to do the diplomacy , that we can make this work photo senator joseph i lieberman and sergei ivanov , the russian president s security adviser , in munich yesterday \( agence francepress \)
terre haute , ind , may 31 lawyers for timothy j mcveigh today asked the federal judge who sentenced him to death for his role in the oklahoma city bombing to grant him a stay of execution , saying that mr mcveigh wanted to hold the government responsible for failing to produce thousands of pages of evidence at his trial he is scheduled to die by lethal injection at the federal penitentiary here on june 11 the lawyers , citing 4 , 449 pages of newly discovered fbi documents they have received in recent days , also asked the judge , richard p matsch , for a hearing to determine how and why the evidence was withheld and whether other exculpatory evidence was still being withheld in papers filed today , they said they intended to argue that the federal government had perpetrated a fraud on the court by not handing over the documents during the trial mr mcveigh s lawyers , robert nigh jr of tulsa and richard burr of houston , who held a news conference after meeting with mr mcveigh at the federal penitentiary here , filed their brief under seal in the federal court in denver this afternoon the brief included 300 pages of exhibits , including an fbi interview report that the lawyers said they had received yesterday , after its author , ricardo ojeda , a former fbi special agent , appeared on television saying he believed that possibly exculpatory evidence he had obtained was withheld from the defense mr mcveigh , who gave up his appeals last december , is seeking the stay because he wants to promote integrity in the criminal justice system , mr nigh said , adding that the department of justice and the fbi will not otherwise be held to account unless he takes this action to win a stay , mr mcveigh s lawyers must convince the judge that they need more time to review the documents to be granted a new trial , their hurdle is higher they would have to show that something in the withheld documents had prevented mr mcveigh from receiving a fair trial , or cast doubt on his guilt in accusing the fbi of a fraud on the court , mr mcveigh s lawyers suggested that the government had deliberately withheld documents and had , even now , failed to fully disclose all the documents it was required to produce , despite the assurances of attorney general john ashcroft mr ashcroft said last week that the fbi director , louis j freeh , had signed a certification that all fbi documents had been turned over several lawyers said today that to show the government s conduct was improper , defense lawyers would have to present evidence to the judge indicating that the documents had been withheld deliberately by fbi agents who knew they were obliged to disclose them so far , mr freeh has acknowledged that not turning over the documents was a serious error , but unintentional moreover , defense lawyers would be required to show that the withheld documents were relevant to their defense of mr mcveigh and could have affected the jury s consideration of the case against him thus far , mr ashcroft and mr freeh have said repeatedly that the material shed no light on mr mcveigh s culpability and did not alter his guilt mr ashcroft , who postponed mr mcveigh s execution on may 11 after learning about the withheld fbi documents , restated those views today the department of justice is prepared to oppose vigorously any attempts by timothy mcveigh to overturn his conviction and sentence or to force a new trial , mr ashcroft said no document in this case creates any doubt about mcveigh s guilt or establishes his innocence to overturn the jury s verdict or to force a new trial , mcveigh must prove that the documents establish his innocence at a hearing this afternoon in denver , judge matsch granted mr mcveigh s request to file his brief under seal and gave the government until june 4 to reply , and set a hearing for june 6 he denied as unnecessary mr mcveigh s request for an order forbidding the justice department to reveal its contents to anyone outside the department sean connelly , a special prosecutor in the united states attorney general s office and a prosecutor at mr mcveigh s trial , told reporters this afternoon , we categorically deny that there s been any fraud on the court mr connelly said , the fraud on the courts here , we submit , is an attempt to circumvent the legal requirements of a 1996 law that limit petitioners in the position of timothy mcveigh to a showing of actual innocence if they wish to avoid a death sentence in their filing with the court , mr mcveigh s lawyers concede that he does not have new evidence that would prove him innocent they want to proceed under a rule in the federal rules of civil procedure that allows a party to a civil proceeding to obtain relief from a final judgment if it was obtained by fraud , misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party mr mcveigh needs a stay , his lawyers contended , because the government has not yet told the truth about why the documents produced since may 9 , 2001 , were withheld from discovery , or why more documents are still being withheld from discovery notwithstanding their representations that all documents have been turned over
manhattan is awash in donated clothes , donated food , donated blood , donated manpower here s a way you can help us , said rudolph giuliani to the nation yesterday , trying to divert further shipments come to new york , go to a play spend some money but in a way , we ca n't get enough of it if we ca n't use the help , or the stuff , we need the connection we are , to tell the truth , a little worried that after the initial shock is over , the rest of america is going to begin to look upon the aftermath of the terrorist attack as new york s problem already , some midwestern legislators have been heard grumbling that oklahoma city never got 20 billion for its recovery , and world trade center jokes appear to be making the rounds in some conservative circles when the rev jerry falwell said that the abortion rights lobby , feminists , homosexuals and all of them who have tried to secularize america had to accept some of the responsibility for the world trade center attack , the underlying message was that new york had it coming god had killed 5 , 000 men , women and children , firefighters , middle managers , security guards , souschefs and secretaries in order to express his wrath at the american civil liberties union it is not possible for you to tell us enough times that what happened to us happened to the whole country the tourists keep heading to wall street , trying to get a look at the crash scene if it were n't for security reasons , we 'd want to accommodate them the tv pictures are both gruesome and amazing , but we have seen too many movies over the years , and after a while , the apocalyptic rubble begins to look like special effects you ca n't imagine what it s like unless you walk there , said hillary clinton senator clinton was visiting the armory where relatives of the missing come to file reports and post pictures none of the hospitals have any unidentified patients , and there have been no new survivors found at the site for days but everyone is committed to the heartbreaking assumption that these loved ones might be located within the sixstory pile of rubble at the crash site , you can see tiny points of light , where rescue workers are skittering through the shaky tunnels , looking for someone who s still alive the people who put up the posters are very specific , perhaps envisioning their friend or family member wandering around unidentified for want of an extra detail one of the photos , of a new bride , notes that she will be wearing a wedding ring another has been edited , to make it clear that a man s height is 58 , not 510 the tourists are taking pictures of the posters , and of the memorials at firehouses and parks and apartment buildings we think that s a good thing too the photos go back to omaha and salt lake city and seattle and pull the people who look at them into our pain there s a very big memorial around the arch at washington square park , and over the weekend people stopped to read the sentiments that had been scribbled on big pieces of canvas , to look at the photos of the missing , to leave piles of flowers then they move on to walk their dogs or play frisbee or checkers we are living in two layers now , attaching our normal new york lives to our new existence as survivors of a terrorist attack on saturday , two women who said they were nieces of ezra aviles , a 41yearold senior manager who worked at the trade center , were in the park with their children , holding up his picture it had please come home written on it all of a sudden , a band appeared , marching down fifth avenue into the park playing god bless america after the world trade center fell , students from oakwood college in huntsville , ala , threw some shovels and garbage bags and their instruments into a bus and headed north , looking to help we traveled about 24 hours to get here , explained dr gregory mims , one of the chaperones he said the students were members of the national association to prevent starvation and that they had been sleeping in a church basement in the bronx the band members , mainly africanamerican teenagers , assembled next to a fountain behind a tall thin young man holding up a flag they struck up amazing grace ezra aviles s niece threw her arms around the boy with the flag and began sobbing by the time the spiritual ended , the flag bearer looked sweaty and faint with emotion he stepped back while another student grabbed the weeping woman the manhattanites in the crowd began crying and embracing the other relatives people with cellphones called their families i love you , kid , a bald man yelled into the receiver meanwhile , a minister from the national association to prevent starvation was getting it all on film the band took off , leaving the regular parkgoers to continue comforting the aviles family the bald man volunteered to show the students how to get to the west side when last seen they were marching through greenwich village , still playing we did not , as it turned out , need their shovels but the music helped
on one hand , the unexpected rest should benefit players on the other hand , their timing could be off on one hand , the trauma of the terrorist attack on the twin towers and the pentagon could leave players less than inspired when they resume playing this week on the other hand , they could be eager to get back to what they do best and forget the rest , at least for three hours a night advantage or disadvantage \? will the six or seven days off , depending on whether teams play tomorrow night or tuesday , benefit some contending teams more than others \? i ca n't imagine that anybody is going to feel advantaged , andy macphail , the chicago cubs' general manager , said the cubs are one of eight national league teams competing for four playoff spots the american league returns from the respite with playoff teams basically determined , so the unexpected hiatus should not have any bearing on the outcome of the races the national league is another matter , though there will be no real way of knowing if the interruption to the season has any impact the team that goes the furthest will probably be the one that will be able to focus on the job at hand as opposed to all the reallife considerations that surround us , macphail said we 're all affected by it in some way , shape or form , but it will be decided by how the players handle it and who focuses the best those who can blot out what s around them will perform the best i do n't imagine that will be easy for some , it will be more natural than for others lest fans think athletes are immune to matters that affect mere mortals , they need only to have listened to some of them or watched them since the shocking attacks last tuesday from the looks on their faces and the demeanor of our players and those i 've seen on television , there seems to be not much intense focus on the demands of baseball , atlanta general manager john schuerholz said the heart was ripped out of all of us , out of the country , out of individual players they 're humans and i think they 're acting like that but i 've also heard guys say when it was time for us to play again , and this is my view as well , we can be a help in getting back to normalcy , to allowing people in new york and washington and the nation to feel like life is a little bit normal again i see and hear them say they 're prepared , when their time comes , to go out and do what baseball and the country will ask them to do , and that s entertain our citizens through sports bob brenly , manager of the nl westleading arizona diamondbacks , said his players were eager to return to work we understand the sensitivity of the issue , he said , and proper time should , and will , elapse before we start playing games again but this is something we 've been doing since the middle of february in baseball you fall into a rhythm you get used to playing every day you go 16 , 18 days without an offday the guys are antsy , anxious to get back to business the diamondbacks , like other teams , have worked out they scheduled an intrasquad game for yesterday but workouts and intrasquad games do not adequately replace games that count i imagine there would be a certain amount of rust , brenly said the play may not be as sharp as it was leading up to the unexpected break tony la russa , the st louis manager , said he thought it was a neutral situation for clubs because everybody has gone through the same thing speaking of the physical aspect of the players' time off , he said , what you gain in rest you lose in rust mentally , brenly offered , players had better devote their full attention to the games because of the level of concentration needed to play this game , that better be the case or you struggle and wo n't be very good at what you do , he said i know there have been personal tragedies in the past where guys have preferred to play through rather than take time i know people say ultimately they 'll have to face their grief , but for the players , baseball is their relief that s the comfort zone for us , where we 're in control of the situation for players , getting back to playing is good medicine brian sabean , general manager of the san francisco giants , who lead the race for the wild card in the national league , said he did not even want to think about potential advantages and disadvantages of the layoff i could n't even answer that , he said we had a hell of a time getting back from houston our guys were just aching to get home i'm sure there s a letdown , but to be truthful , i could n't care less twins are struggling the last time the minnesota twins took as many as three consecutive days off , they never recovered they are hoping this hiatus will help i do n't know what happened , but it definitely happened during those three days off , manager tom kelly said , referring to the break around the allstar game the twins reached the break five games ahead of the cleveland indians in the al central they maintained that lead by winning two of the first three games after the break but then the twins' tires went flat

there are eight million stories in the naked city this has been one of them thus , the final words from the groundbreaking 1948 film about the new york police department , the naked city and while there certainly are n't eight million films about the city s police , there are hundreds of dramas featuring roguish flatfoots , heroic gumshoes , hardboiled detectives and corrupt crimestoppers the best of these classics , including the naked city , will be screened in nypd , an eightweek festival of more than 50 films featuring new york s finest and not so finest at the film forum in manhattan the series is a celebration of the centurylong obsession of filmmakers with the nation s largest police department more than that , though , it offers a window on the transformation of the city s selfimage , and the nation s perception of that image from the reassuring goodguysimposeorderonchaos certainties of the 1930 s through the 1950 s , to the outofjoint , toxic terrain of the 1970 s , to the more nuanced anomalies of today s saferstreets metropolis in an era when other genres have basically died off think westerns and movie musicals the new york city police drama has somehow managed to reinvent itself and in the series lies the opportunity for both film buffs and police buffs to compare the celluloid record with the city s reality even though individual movies might get things outrageously wrong , there is poetic truth in this body of work , said james lardner , coauthor of nypd a city and its police \( henry holt company , 2000 \) , the book that inspired the film series it is astonishing , the number of movies that deal with new york city police , and the number of great actors who have played city cops the series , which begins friday and runs through oct 4 , includes some rare turnofthecentury documentary films of the police department in action courtesy of the library of congress and concludes with a 30thanniversary presentation of the french connection , the director william friedkin s influential 1971 narcoticssquad thriller despite changing tastes , directors , studios and plot points , it is fair to say that the most reliable central theme in new york police films has been the city itself the most enduring image of new york in these films is the snake pit the melting pot of the nation perennially offers up a melting pot of evil more of it , more kinds of it , eviler evil the appeal of these films is that the city was thought of as being this hellhole , mr lardner said and in vicariously going out and about with the police , people got a taste of the sleaze for moviemakers , it was an attractive lure as well the city is like the biggest , most powerful bodyguard standing next to you at all times , said the director sidney lumet , who is represented in the festival by serpico , \( 1973 \) prince of the city , \( 1981 \) q a \( 1990 \) , and night falls on manhattan \( 1997 \) so you can use this powerful entity as you want to , either to rake payoffs from poor candystore owners , or to kick the district attorney s behind when jules dassin set out to make the naked city more than 50 years ago , it was the city itself that proved to be the draw , and he considered it essential to film in new york it was the character of new york that attracted me to the city , said mr dassin , who is now 89 and lives in athens he said he had to fight hollywood to break precedent and shoot the movie entirely on location a cruel surprise to him , then , when subsequently the last voiceover words of his serious film \( there are eight million stories in the naked city \) became a worldwide popculture laugh line mr lardner s coauthor , thomas reppetto , a former chicago police commander who is now president of the citizens crime commission of new york city , said that in general , new york police films fall into two categories those about police work , and those about the troubles of police work in the naked city , for example , all the cops are portrayed as eight feet tall and wonderful human beings but in 'detective story , ' kirk douglas engages in brutality , dr reppetto said of the 1951 film not that new york has had a monopoly on the nasty dozens of films set elsewhere from the 1968 bullitt in san francisco to the 1997 la confidential offer their own brand of brutishness but new york s celluloid policemen are often more confrontational , and they tend to be slobs , everything is messy , and they break rules right and left , mr lardner said through the years , both the stalkers and the guardians of the stalked have been glamorized by hollywood certainly generations of hoodlums have been inspired to a life of crime by the roles of james cagney , george raft , al pacino and so many others but such is the power of the new york city police drama that it inspired at least one lad to become a police commissioner as a kid in boston i was a police buff at the age of 7 , and in the early 1960 s i discovered 'the commissioner , ' said former police commissioner william j bratton , referring to the novel by richard dougherty that was brought to the silver screen as madigan the 1968 film , directed by don siegel , starred henry fonda as a bythebook police commissioner who disapproved of a streetwise detective played by richard widmark
four terrorists who were convicted in may of conspiring with osama bin laden in the 1998 bombings of two american embassies in east africa were sentenced yesterday to life in prison without any chance of release judge leonard b sand sentenced the four men in a packed courtroom under extraordinarily tight security in old federal courthouse in lower manhattan , just a short distance from the smoldering ruins of the world trade center it was just five weeks ago that the twin towers and the pentagon were attacked by terrorists in an operation that the united states government suspects was masterminded by mr bin laden , who is the target of american military action in afghanistan two of the terrorists spoke in court yesterday , making clear they felt they were innocent the judge reacted with pointed commentary but little emotion this is a time not for eloquence , but for justice , judge sand said none of the four terrorists testified in the trial , and the formal public statements made by the two men yesterday were their first since the attacks in nairobi , kenya , and dar es salaam , tanzania , on aug 7 , 1998 , which killed 224 people and wounded thousands wadih elhage , 41 , a naturalized american citizen from lebanon and a former close aide to mr bin laden , told judge sand that he condemned the african bombings in 1998 as well as the attacks on the trade center and the pentagon last month the killing of innocent people and noncombatants is radical , extreme and cannot be tolerated by any religion , principles , beliefs or values , said mr elhage , who , like the other three men , sat with his hands and legs shackled beneath the defense table but after he went on to describe his life in the united states , gaining citizenship , building a family , and trying to live as a devout muslim , an indignant prosecutor rose and accused mr elhage of coming to court with no remorse , no shame and no conscience he had a choice , the prosecutor , patrick j fitzgerald , declared , and he chose to go with those who would kill rather than to help himself , his family , his country other than the exchange between mr elhage and mr fitzgerald , the proceedings were relatively subdued given the heightened tensions of recent weeks and fears of more terrorist attacks , the courthouse had prepared for the worst the building resembled a military base , with federal marshals carrying shotguns , public entrances closed and the screening of visitors increased the hearing was notable for the unexpected presence of three jurors , who watched from the last row of the courtroom as the men they had convicted months earlier were sentenced the jurors had been kept anonymous , another security precaution but yesterday , two of the visiting jurors agreed to speak with reporters afterward , saying they felt compelled to attend the proceeding after the sept 11 attacks both jurors spoke on the condition that they remain anonymous i had originally had no intention of coming , said one , an accountant i thought we did our jobs to the best of our ability but on sept 11 , it became crucial that i come down here to put some kind closure on it in a wideranging discussion , the jurors also revealed that they came closer than was previously known to imposing the death penalty on two of the terrorists , mohamed rashed daoud al'owhali , 24 , who helped deliver the bomb that destroyed the embassy in nairobi , and khalfan khamis mohamed , 28 , who helped grind the tnt used in the bomb in dar es salaam the vote was 9 to 3 in favor of execution , the jurors said , but the three holdouts meant a deadlock , which resulted in automatic life sentences for the men but , the jurors said , there was never any doubt about the guilt of all four defendants yesterday , there was also no doubt about what sentences judge sand was going to impose the two men who avoided the death penalty could receive nothing less than life sentences judge sand had signaled earlier this week that he had no sympathy for the other two men , who had argued for lesser terms the other terrorist who spoke in court , mohammed saddiq odeh , a 36yearold jordanian who helped in the preparations for the nairobi bombing , issued a rambling statement in which he challenged the fairness of his trial he also criticized the united states for killing civilians in the retaliatory missile strikes on afghanistan after the 1998 embassy attacks judge sand did not seem moved he said the trial was fair , and he rejected any attempt to pin blame on the united states it is not unusual for perpetrators of horrendous crimes to point to other events or other circumstances to try to deflect the enormity of their own acts , judge sand said citing mr odeh s claim that the missiles had killed civilians , the judge added , that would suggest that your system of values would not allow or condone the killing of innocents but you know that the crimes for which you have been found guilty involved the killing of innocents judge sand added the law recognizes , and appropriately recognizes , that terrorism which causes the death of innocent persons regardless of whether it is based on sincerely held but terribly misguided views or any other reason is one of the most serious crimes , threats to our society , threats to the society of any civilized nation neither of the two terrorists who spoke in court cited mr bin laden by name , although mr elhage praised the early role of the taliban in bringing peace , security and prosperity to afghanistan the taliban rules afghanistan , and has been offering protection to mr bin laden , who remains an indicted fugitive in the embassy bombings case but it was after mr elhage finished reading his statement , and said he had nothing to apologize for , that mr fitzgerald delivered his stinging attack he said mr elhage had betrayed his country , his religion and humanity he claims to be a citizen , but he is not an american he claims to be a religious man , but he is not a true muslim , mr fitzgerald said the true americans , the true muslims , the true family men , he has seen , said mr fitzgerald , citing the victims of the embassy attacks who testified at the trial , and others who appeared yesterday and told the judge of the devastating impact of the bombings on their lives those are the people he helped to kill , mr fitzgerald said among the five witnesses who testified yesterday was howard kavaler , an american diplomat , who recalled his vain attempts to find the remains of his wife , prabhi , also a diplomat , buried in the rubble of the embassy in nairobi for three years , he said , he had nightmares of the clouds of dust , the dangling wires , the invisible cries for help that were muffled by mounds of concrete and twisted steel the terrorist attacks of sept 11 had only exacerbated those memories , he said he also read a letter to judge sand from his 13yearold daughter tara , who had written about her mother i miss the time we spent together i miss that she loved me like no one else could and i miss her helping me with things that were hard my heart hurts every day i hope it will go away a kid s heart should n't hurt every day a kid should n't have to miss her mother every day photos security was at a high level yesterday at the old federal courthouse in lower manhattan , where four men received life sentences for bombing two american embassies in africa in 1998 \( angel franco the new york times \) james owens , who survived the embassy bombing in tanzania , spoke to reporters yesterday outside court he testified during sentencing \( aaron lee fineman for the new york times \) \( pg b10 \)
four years after an embattled w ann reynolds resigned as chancellor of the city university of new york to become president of the university of alabama at birmingham , her job there appears in jeopardy following some of the same sort of conflicts with trustees and others that she encountered in new york the trustees of the threecampus university of alabama system have called a special session on friday afternoon in birmingham to discuss her dismissal this month , officials of the threecampus system asked her to step down as president next summer they said she could take a oneyear sabbatical and then return as a tenured biology professor when she rejected that , they offered to allow her to spend one more year completing a fundraising campaign , but not as president the idea was for her to serve out this year and then retire next summer from the presidency , thomas c meredith , the chancellor of the system , said yesterday dr meredith said that dr reynolds had rejected both plans through a lawyer and had refused to discuss her post with a university trustee a spokeswoman at birmingham said yesterday that dr reynolds was not available for an interview no one is saying officially why her tenure is an issue now dr reynolds is 63 she has been at the university four years at a time when taxpayer support has shrunk , her campus is in the middle of a hugely successful fundraising campaign last year the board agreed to raise the target to 350 million from 250 million , which the campus has surpassed in addition , after a bumpy start , dr reynolds , who has a reputation for being combative , now has strong support from many students , professors , alumni , local residents and religious groups some university donors have threatened to withhold contributions if dr reynolds is dismissed and on tuesday , faculty leaders sent a letter to the board , saying that any movement to remove dr reynolds at this time would be counterproductive to the mission of uab in birmingham , dr reynolds has been nicknamed the woman warrior and earned a reputation for strong leadership and passionate loyalty people talk of how she bleeds gold and green , her campus colors and they speak of how she and her husband , thomas h kirschbaum , a doctor at the uab medical school , have pledged more than 2 million to the campus \( as president her salary is 225 , 700 \) dr meredith said he could not elaborate on why dr reynolds was being pressed to leave now because her attorney has now threatened a lawsuit but her supporters offer a variety of possible explanations , including her sometimescontentious relations with people like the chancellor and her role as a strong woman in a culture where strong women are not welcomed they also point to the competition between the birmingham campus , which is a nationally ranked research university with 15 , 000 students and a 13 billion budget \( including its medical center \) , and the farolder campus at tuscaloosa , with 19 , 000 students and a 379 million budget \( many of the university trustees were undergraduates at tuscaloosa none were undergraduates at birmingham \) dr meredith acknowledged that there were a number of people who expressed strong concerns about dr reynolds , at the medical school and at the main campus , and that there had been friction between him and dr reynolds i was concerned that from time to time she was not forthcoming and did not follow the position of the system , he said john rogers , a state representative from birmingham and also executive director of minority programs for the birmingham campus , said my real feeling is that sometimes when you are very assertive , you overshadow other people in the system , maybe even the chancellor and especially if you are a woman doing a job , that creates a problem here in the south she stands up to them , and that upsets them another reynolds admirer , cleophus thomas jr , a university trustee , said that he had heard that some medical faculty members had threatened to leave unless a date was set for dr reynolds to step down as president he said that although dr reynolds had cooperated with efforts to restructure health services , others saw her as an obstacle to greater privatization and more profits for the medical school s doctors
hartford , feb 22 the statistics tell the damning story of this city nearly 80 percent of all babies born in 1998 had single mothers , double the national average and 10 times the state average a quarter of all births were to teenage mothers , and a quarter of those teenagers had given birth before in each category , hartford topped a list of 55 cities included in a nationwide child health report published tuesday by the annie e casey foundation in baltimore the survey , which also included statistics for new york city , new york state and new jersey , further illustrated hartford s decadelong struggle to overcome social and economic problems that public health experts and elected officials have not been able to solve what this report suggests is that the state and city elected officials have done the worst job in the nation , of these 55 communities , tending the needs of hartford , said paul gionfriddo , executive director of the connecticut association for human services in hartford , which helped the foundation compile its report for hartford , it is as dismal a picture that could be imagined hartford s rankings were no surprise to gov john g rowland , said his spokesman , dean pagani he s known for some time that hartford and some other cities in the state lag behind the rest of the country , mr pagani said asked what the state could do to improve child health in hartford , mr pagani noted that the governor , a resident of the city s far west end , has made urban renewal a focus of his administration s second term the governor thinks that the place where you can have the biggest impact is the schools , he said , especially in combination with jobtraining programs that help residents rise above poverty asked if there were cultural reasons for hartford s high rates of single mothers and teenage pregnancies , mr pagani said , from the governor s point of view , he s more interested in fixing the problems than looking at what caused them the foundation s report , the right start , used 1998 data to rank the 50 states , the nation s 50 largest cities and 5 others hartford des moines louisville , ky providence , ri and savannah , ga the report was based on eight child health indicators , including the number of births to teenagers , births to unmarried mothers of all ages and the prevalence of low birth weights and prenatal care the data , the latest available , were taken from the national center for health statistics in hyattsville , md , an arm of the centers for disease control and prevention the report is a part of the annie e casey foundation s larger annual kids count survey , due in may in contrast to hartford , a chronically impoverished city of 128 , 000 that is the capital of the nation s wealthiest state , statistics for connecticut as a whole showed that it had the fifthlowest percentage of births to teenage and single mothers in fact , for seven of the eight indicators used in the survey , connecticut s ranking was better than the national average and better than the rankings for new york and new jersey new york , new jersey and connecticut were among the states with the lowest percentage of births to teenage mothers , but in most other categories , such as the number of lowbirthweight babies and the prevalence of births to mothers who received late or no prenatal care , new york and new jersey were slightly worse than the national average likewise , while new york city had a relatively low number of births by teenage mothers and a low rate of births to mothers who smoke , it ranked in the middle of the city survey for most of the indicators the report did not report statistics for any cities in new jersey william p o'hare , the director of the kids count program , said new york city s constant flow of immigrants , who tend to marry quickly and stay in the city for years afterward , helped the city avoid the child health problems evident in hartford , where financial investment is fleeting and residents have long tended to leave for jobs in places with brighter prospects there s a strong correlation between poverty and negative birth outcomes , mr o'hare said today the grip of teenage motherhood and poverty develops into an insidious cycle , he said according to the foundation s 1999 kids count report , a child born to an unmarried teenage high school dropout is 10 times as likely to be living in poverty as a child born to a mother with none of these three characteristics katherine mccormick , hartford s health director , said the city s high number of pregnant teenagers could be attributed to a mixture of causes , including poverty , school dropout rates and cultural factors but she disputed the accuracy of some of the foundation s statistics regarding teenage pregnancies in hartford , saying the majority of those were for women 18 or 19 years old , not for girls 13 to 17 years old if the city s teenage birth numbers were broken down by age , she added , they would show that the percentage for girls 17 and younger is 108 percent , a less troubling figure than the 248 percent listed in the report for all teenage mothers eloisa hernandez , the director of the association for children of new jersey , a child advocacy group in newark , said a pregnant teenager was a problem at any age these are kids who are more than likely still in high school , more

if vassiliy were an american , and 20 pounds heavier , he 'd already be a multimillionaire , said ivaylo gotzev , jirov s bulgarianborn manager as it is , well , he s not this is not to say that jirov lacks the sort of history that fight fans have customarily embraced he was born in balkhash in kazakhstan , then a former soviet republic , one of six children in a family abandoned by an alcoholic father and held together by his mother s earnings as a machinist as an 11yearold , he followed a friend into the local boxing gym , where the trainer , alexander apachinsky , gave him a ritual roughing up to test his mettle unlike most youngsters subjected to such treatment , jirov returned the next day , and the next in gentler environs , apachinsky s training methods would stir protest by various anticruelty groups to breed stamina , he would row his boxers to the middle of nearby lake balkhash , then leave them to swim the mile or so back to shore to instill speed and fearlessness , he put them in a hallway and had an angry german shepherd harass them in a race for a distant door jirov still bears scars from the latter exercises , but absolves apachinsky , his trainer throughout his amateur career , of vicious intent he s a good man , like a father to me , jirov said in accented english fighting is hard , and so is he jirov s success was proof he was a national champion at 16 , a european titleholder at 18 and a twotime world championship bronze medalist at atlanta in 1996 , at age 22 , he buzzsawed the field , soundly beating the division favorite , the american world amateur champion antonio tarver , in a semifinal en route to the crown that victory reversed his loss by decision to tarver the year before , the last defeat jirov has suffered jirov signed with gotzev after the games , and moved near phoenix , gotzev s home there jirov met and married the minnesotaborn rebecca rawn as a pro , jirov has retained the straightup , handshigh style of his amateur days but has added weight and strength while he does n't possess lightsout power \( 17 of his knockouts have been of the technical variety \) , he has become a ferocious body puncher whose shots have visibly discouraged many opponents his last foe , terry mcgroom , succumbed to a body blow in the first round of their march 24 bout that fight was on a las vegas undercard , the lessthanexalted status of most of jirov s outings his biggest payday , for a 1999 undercard knockout over dale brown , was 150 , 000 , but that was before his manager , trainer and others took their cuts he was promised 200 , 000 as a hometown headliner for his successful title defense against alex gonzalez last february in almaty , kazakhstan , but when the dealing was done , he says , he emerged with about 50 , 000 he will fight again in his native land only if he is paid up front , he vows gotzev hopes that a fight against toney tentatively set for sept 8 in either phoenix or las vegas will vault jirov onto higher financial ground but toney s light shone brightest before his onesided loss to jones in a supermiddleweight title fight seven years ago jirov says that if he beats toney , he will try to unify the cruiserweight division , then move up to heavyweight if he added another 15 pounds to his lean , 6foot2 frame , jirov would still have to spot serious weight to some heavyweight foes yet he understands some of boxing s verities big guys get big purses , he says with a smile and a shrug photo vassiliy jirov , the international boxing federation s world cruiserweight champion , is undefeated in 28 bouts \( jeff topping for the new york times \)

state officials said yesterday that minipower plants they planned to build around new york city this year might not be as temporary as had been characterized , that they might be sold to private owners and that there was a chance more were on the way next year those statements each a firsttime acknowledgment came at a hearing held by several state assembly committees , where officials from gov george e pataki s administration testified under subpoena after declining to appear voluntarily the allday session in manhattan featured heated exchanges as assembly democrats questioned the republican administration s failure to conduct an environmental review , and its selection of sites in poor areas state officials said that the plants were needed to avert power shortages this summer maureen o helmer , chairwoman of the public service commission , said new york city needed to add at least 397 megawatts of power about 5 percent of the peak that can be generated in the city to ensure reliability this summer the small plants together would produce just about that much power minimum requirements are just that , minimum , and will not be enough to carry the city through a hot , humid summer day , she said minimum is just not good enough the state power authority plans to install 10 natural gas turbines at six sites around new york city , and another in islip , on long island , at a cost of 510 million the state wants to have the plants ready by june 1 pataki administration officials have called the generators a temporary measure until major new power plants are built in the city at least three years from now the state s department of environmental conservation has issued threeyear permits for the miniplants but at the hearing , eugene w zeltmann , president of the power authority , said he could not rule out seeking an extension we may need these units a little longer , he said mr zeltmann acknowledged , in questioning by assemblyman paul d tonko , that authority officials have discussed among themselves the possibility of selling the turbines to private companies that raises the prospect that they could become a longterm part of the region s power supply , though a buyer could also move the turbines and while he said the authority would charge only enough for the electricity to recoup its costs , a private owner would very likely charge more mr zeltmann said he had been approached by potential buyers i 've had a call from several people saying , 'what would you like to do with those \? ' and i 've said it s too early , he said later , in discussing sites that were considered for the turbines but dismissed , mr zeltmann said , they might make it next year when asked by assemblywoman catherine t nolan of queens if that meant more would be installed after this year , he said , not if i can help it , but he did not rule it out the power authority , eager to install the plants quickly , did not conduct an environmental impact review and said that none was needed or required under state law , any plant producing 80 megawatts or more must undergo such a review where the authority plans to install two turbines , they would have a combined potential output of 88 megawatts to get under the 80megawatt limit , the authority said , the twin turbines would have controls limiting them to a combined 799 megawatts you evaded state laws , said assemblyman richard l brodsky , of westchester , and you did so with great energy authority officials denied the charge the turbines generate power relatively cleanly , and authority officials noted that they have committed to reducing pollution from other sources emissions from school buses , for instance in an amount at least as great as that produced by the generators the projects will not cause any net increase , no matter how small , in emissions , mr zeltmann said some legislators expressed anger that they and community groups were not consulted about the project , and that the plants were being placed in heavily minority neighborhoods in january , the power authority conducted an analysis of the populations around the sites but declined to release it the study , leaked last week , showed large hispanic populations in most of the areas and large black populations in some of them authority officials said they considered more than 60 locations around the city , and made their choices based on necessity the sites had to be readily available , have connections to highpressure natural gas lines and highvoltage power lines , and be in industrial areas only seven sites were usable by summer , mr zeltmann said authority officials also insisted that they had done a credible job of outreach to elected officials and others , citing meetings with city officials , community boards and even state legislators , and public hearings held by the department of environmental conservation that drew caustic responses from some of the assembly members i was n't notified that this was going to happen , and if i'm not notified , then most of the groups in my district were n't notified , either , said assemblyman vito j lopez , whose brooklyn district includes one of the sites assemblyman ruben diaz jr , whose bronx district is near one of the sites , asked , if there was a meeting , why was n't i invited \? mr brodsky and assemblyman michael n gianaris of queens also questioned the state s claim that the plants were needed to avoid blackouts they said the pataki administration had underestimated the available power in the city , and that the plants were meant to try to lower power prices photo maureen o helmer , chairwoman of the public service commission , with maloney lawrence , left , and howard tarler , commission officials , at a meeting on a plan to build more power plants around new york city \( chester higgins jr the new york times \) \( pg b6 \)
it is a rite of the season a crush of movies given limited releases at the end of the year just in time to qualify for consideration in the 2001 academy awards this year , along with domestic hopefuls like gosford park and a beautiful mind , the yearend debuts include a halfdozen foreign movies hoping to snag nominations beyond the foreign language film award even best picture , in some ambitious cases the campaigning by overseas filmmakers is notable not because it is rare , but because in recent years it has become such an entrenched part of the oscar game and why not \? if imports like life is beautiful and crouching tiger , hidden dragon could vie for best picture the last few years and find commercial success at the united states box office , what is to deter jeanpierre jeunet s am lie or jan sverak s dark blue world \? there s no question that it occurs to us earlier as a possibility , said mark gill , president of the los angeles office of the walt disney company s miramax unit miramax is representing five foreign oscar aspirants am lie \( france \) , baran \( iran \) , behind the sun \( brazil \) , italian for beginners \( denmark \) and the son s room \( italy \) while mr gill insists that miramax is treating all of these films equally , it is giving endoftheyear american releases to only three of them so they can qualify for oscars beyond the foreignlanguage category he says he hopes that am lie may be nominated for many categories behind the sun for cinematography and original score , and baran for best director for majid majidi because am lie has already taken in more than 10 million since its united states release last month , miramax says it can afford an additional 250 , 000 or more on the marketing campaign , allocating part of that to sun and baran , as well and yet , paradoxically , none of the extra promotion is likely to help any of those films in their most natural category foreign language film the selection process typically defies any marketing efforts to influence it , according to industry executives for a movie to be considered for best foreign language film , a governmentapproved selection committee from the movie s home country must first nominate it that means politics and local aesthetics back home are more important than marketing influence in the united states this year , a record 51 foreign films have been nominated by their home countries typically , the academy s selection committee in this category places a greater premium on art than popularity which is why foreign films without american distribution are often the ones picked as finalists , and only after being nominated are they snatched up for release in the united states i 've been there with the most popular film and lost many times i 've been there with most popular film and won , said michael barker , copresident of sony pictures classics , whose most recent foreign film oscar came for crouching tiger mr barker s company is releasing the czech entry , dark blue world , in the united states on dec 28 , hoping to get critics' awards , and then maybe a bestpicture nomination but sony pictures classes is holding off on an american release until march for belgium s nominee , pauline and paulette , meaning it will be eligible only in the foreignlanguage category it s a gemlike film , mr barker said of the movie it is by no means grandiose or a movie that will do 100 million on the other side of the financial spectrum , kino international , an independent distributor in new york , plans to wait until april for the united states release of the piano teacher , an austrian film the reality for a distributor the size of kino is you ca n't fight on equal terms with miramax or sony , said donald krim , kino s president but you can fight if you have a good film and the talent has a track record for a film without an american distributor , like argentina s the son of the bride , by the filmmaker juan jos campanella , the strategy is just to wait for the selection committee to notice it , since argentina does not have money to support the film but that apparently does not worry neil friedman , an american who is acting as the film s worldwide distribution agent the selection is as close to a meritocracy as exists anywhere , mr friedman said once the five foreign nominees are announced in february , its supporters need to reach the few hundred academy members who will see all five finalists the difficulties of influencing this disperse group with advertising may be among the reasons that distributors elect to enter films in other categories , where money matters more distributors estimate how much more the film will earn if it receives , say , a costume nomination , and how much if it wins they must try to predict the likelihood of an oscar nomination s bringing in a wider audience , or new prestige to the company you have to put a value on the nomination , said bingham ray , president of united artists a lot of it is intuitive mr ray released bosnia s first foreign oscar hopeful , no man s land , on dec 7 and is weighing the potential benefits of trying to also get an original screenplay nomination for the film jeff lipsky , president of lot 47 , an independent distributor in new york , said he decided several months ago to forgo a december release for atanarjuat the fast runner , canada s first inuitlanguage entry in the foreignlanguage category instead , mr lipsky chose a nov 30 release in los angeles for claire denis s trouble every day in hopes of its being considered for best original song the film was not picked as the french entry , but he wants the title song by the british band tindersticks to be considered for best original song photos france

despite the clouds yesterday and a faint mist that colored everything a pale gray , most visitors to manhattan s newest pier said they were impressed with the setting and the vista it offered no one doubted that the pier , on the hudson river near 70th street , was well done , or that the public space it offered was aesthetically pleasing but this particular promenade was part of the 3 billion development known as trump place , so it was bound to inspire some sharp words in addition to accolades the pier and an adjacent promenade and park with baseball and soccer fields and a basketball court , are called riverside south , the original name given to the entire development the outdoor space abuts the south end of riverside park , and , like the entire development , occupies land once part of the old penn central rail yards the pier and park opened quietly a week ago , built as part of an agreement between the city and the project s developers , donald j trump and a group of hong kong investors the project , which has led to protests and lawsuits over the past several years , is to include 16 residential towers with 5 , 700 apartments , and one commercial building i do n't especially like donald trump or what he does , but i have to say i am impressed by this walk , said jed golden , 64 , an upper west side resident who was enjoying the sunset with a friend on the pier yesterday i 've got to give them credit it s very lovely the 215acre , 14 million space is to have an official opening in march at the first sign of crocuses , said parks commissioner henry j stern yesterday , though , it offered a bit of respite to those who happened upon it by chance , like mr golden and an australian tourist , dung huynh , as well as area residents like joani rentz and her terrier , amos , who had been eagerly awaiting permission to enter for weeks it s such a nice little park right now , said ms rentz , an art decorator for a wall street design firm the problem is that this whole neighborhood is getting so developed it used to be small , quiet none of this was here while she admired the view , almost in solitude , ms rentz could not help but imagine the pier in summertime , with throngs of bikers and bladers , and sunbathers blanketing the grass i do n't want this to be a place where everybody wants to come , she said right now it s only used by the people in the neighborhood but many of the people in the neighborhood now those who live in the three condominium and rental buildings that have opened were not people in the neighborhood just 18 months ago and judging by the protests and lawsuits against the project , the newcomers were not especially welcome but it is their space now , too , and many love it , speaking of it as though it is a precious part of their history , perhaps because several trump place residents lived in the neighborhood earlier nowhere on the west side is there this kind of vista and the ability to experience the breath and scope of the hudson , said peter tafti , 45 , a human resources consultant who recently moved into the development after living in washington for seven years it s really quite exceptional mr tafti called himself an upper west side kid , having grown up there and gone to school at st hilda s and st hugh s on west 114th street and at columbia s business school what great use of the river ! he said it s just one more new feature of new york that makes you realize what a majestic city it is on a magnificent river mark robbins , a real estate planner who recently moved back from san francisco , agreed the planners are really to be commended , he said this represents a big step on the multiphase initiative of new york to reclaim its waterfront but this being the upper west side , a former local resident and current east sider , ari kermaier , had a very different opinion about the developers they made out like bandits , said mr kermaier , 33 , a software engineer but he also called the pier neat , a relaxing public space photo children playing on a new west side pier near 70th street and the south end of riverside park behind them were two towers of trump place \( james estrin the new york times \)
lebenthal company , a new york institution made famous by its quirky ads extolling the virtues of taxfree municipal bonds , will announce today that it is being acquired by the mony group the boards of both companies have approved the deal , which is estimated to be worth around 25 million lebenthal , founded in 1925 , will operate as a subsidiary with mony s advest group , a hartfordbased brokerage firm that mony acquired in august 2000 the acquisition is being made using 50 percent cash and 50 percent mony group stock alexandra lebenthal will stay on as president and chief executive of the lebenthal division she will also take on a senior management role at advest her father and lebenthal chairman , james lebenthal , will become chairman emeritus and serve as a consultant ms lebenthal said that merging with advest would allow the company to grow significantly by tapping into mony s resources it s extremely difficult to run a profitable small firm in today s world with the overhead that we have and our technology needs , she said i think we 've done a great job diversifying the business , but we 're limited as a smaller player' lebenthal , a municipal bond retailer , was started by louis and sayra lebenthal as an oddlot bond clearinghouse that made municipal bonds available to individual investors before then , municipal bonds were primarily owned by wealthy investors and institutions after a stint as an entertainment reporter and television producer , james lebenthal returned to the family business in 1967 over the years , he made hundreds of whimsical ads , with catchy phrases like bonds are my babies and built by bonds , making lebenthal a household name in new york typically , he introduced himself as jim lebenthal in 1995 , he turned over the daily running of the firm to his daughter , alexandra under her direction , the firm has expanded from its traditional base of municipal bonds to include stocks , mutual funds and portfolio management while the company is small by wall street standards , with only 100 employees , mony is hoping that the lebenthal brand name will lure investors lebenthal is very well respected and we want to take advantage of that brand name , said michael i roth , mony s chairman and chief executive since 1993 since becoming a public company in 1998 , mony has been trying to increase its size and broaden its array of products and services lebenthal will be its fifth acquisition in february 2001 , mony purchased matrix , a small mergersandacquisitions specialist based in richmond , va , that works with deals valued from 25 million to 200 million for most of its 158year history , mony has concentrated on life insurance but now 60 percent of its operating income is from commissions and fees on mutual funds , securities transactions , investment banking and annuities , which are similar to mutual funds but include an insurance feature we were interested in growing our retail bond business , said grant w kurtz , the chief executive of mony s advest unit mr kurtz said advest planned to move its municipal bond operation into lebenthal s offices he said none of lebenthal s 100 employees would lose their jobs immediately , but that eventually less than 10 jobs would be eliminated advest announced in june that it was cutting 150 of its 1 , 800 positions ms lebenthal has been outspoken about the lack of progress women have made on wall street during her tenure , lebenthal has made a concerted effort to reach out to women and younger investors in her new role at advest , ms lebenthal said she planned to continue her focus on women investors by starting a women s initiative that will focus on investors of all income groups we need women in all income brackets to feel that their money is important and that it s the same color as men s , she said analysts reacted to the deal skeptically mony , a relatively small insurer with assets of about 25 billion , has been struggling to compete with the giants mony does n't have nearly the scale required to compete these days , said colin devine , an insurance analyst at salomon smith barney mr devine said lebenthal would mesh well with mony s advest unit but he said the parent company s biggest problem is that its return on equity has been running around 6 percent , compared with more than 15 percent for the industry leaders this acquisition fails to address the fundamental problems facing mony , he said , which are lack of earnings growth , inadequate return on capital and uncertain strategic outlook in an industry that is consolidating , and increasingly gaining economies of scale their competition is not insurance companies their own size or even other insurance companies it s really the merrill lynches , the american expresses and the other really big guys vanessa wilson , a life insurance analyst at deutsche bank securities , said the lebenthal name certainly provides a lot of cachet , but it s only a small step this acquisition gives mony access to more highnetworth individuals without a big capital investment photo alexandra lebenthal , chief of lebenthal company , yesterday with grant kurtz , left , of the

the 27 individuals and organizations linked to osama bin laden and whose assets president bush has ordered frozen are only the first cluster of a far larger group of individuals , companies and relief organizations that the united states plans to single out , an administration official said yesterday while he acknowledged that almost none of those on the list have assets in the united states , the official said that president bush s action was more than symbolic it sends a powerful signal to al qaeda that we know who they are , who their friends are , and who supports them financially , he said these are the most egregious , the official added but this is only the first tranche there will be immediate and quick follow up from the treasury department officials said that the publication of the list was only one of several steps , most of them secret , that the administration was taking to constrain the informal banking networks through which al qaeda moves money and resources he said , for instance , that the administration was quietly taking aim at the informal hawala unregulated , often tiny , storefront financial centers that al qaeda has used to move cash and convert currencies the list 12 individuals , 11 terrorist groups , 3 organizations advertised as charities , and one corporate entity was culled from a far larger group of known financial supporters of the terrorist network the identities of others , particularly those associated with charities and other nonprofit groups , will be publicized later by treasury secretary paul h o'neill after treasury officials have discussed them privately with foreign finance ministers and central bankers , officials said some were left off because we wanted time to get unwitting and distinguished members of their boards to resign or distance themselves from these groups and companies , one official explained we are attacking the problem diplomatically descriptions of those on the list provided recently by middle eastern officials and by the administration yesterday reveal much about al qaeda s structure and reach for example , the list contains the names of some nine middle eastern terrorist groups stretching from algeria to the philippines that intelligence officials say have become partners in mr bin laden s terrorist operations all were either members of the international islamic front against jews and crusaders , the umbrella group formed by mr bin laden in february 1998 , or later joined his network the list is everyone al qaeda all the time , an american official said the sole business on the list is the mamoun darkazanli importexport company founded in 1993 and based in hamburg , germany , mamoun deals in such wholesale appliances as televisions and electronic equipment officials said mr darkazanli , also known as abu ilyaf , is a close associate of mr bin laden who was involved in a 1996 attack in riyadh , saudi arabia , against the saudi national guard the degree of current and previous intelligence contacts between american and german agencies over the hamburg company is unclear one man identified as a leader of the 19 hijackers who carried out the sept 11 attacks , mohamed atta , studied and worked in hamburg for years in the last decade one group cited is the islamic army of aden , militants based in yemen who are suspected of involvement in both the terrorist attack against the american destroyer cole in aden harbor last october and the strikes of sept 11 algeria is home to two of the affiliated groups on the list the armed islamic group , known by its french acronym , the gia , and the salafist group for call and combat , known by its french initials , the gspc members of al itihaad alislamiya , which has malay ties , have shown up in somalia and other

this year s roster of best books contains five works of fiction and four of nonfiction , compared with last year s five of each choosing was easy nominating was not throughout the year there is some competition among editors to put books on the list for consideration yet from 1997 through last year , the numbers nominated declined by two each year this year the process nasdaqed , ending in only 16 nominations , down from 20 last year there are four novels on the 2001 list , a collection of stories , two memoirs , an intellectual history and a biography of the fiction writers two are american , one canadian , one australian and one german all the nonfiction is by americans , although one of the writers did not start out that way two of the writers , one in each category , have appeared on these lists in the past , and only one , a novelist , is under 35 the volume of history is in part a collection of biographies , and the biography is in part a broadside against received history as for the memoirs , which both focus on childhood , it is hard to imagine two accomplished writers having grown up in more contrasting conditions characterization of the fiction is best done in the accounts given below but since we like to signal firsts in any year , there is one odd circumstance to notice one of the novels , as everyone knows , gained a certain notoriety when oprah winfrey chose it for her book club and the author allowed he was not entirely pleased by this honor , even though her nod would virtually guarantee its reaching the top of the bestseller list it so happens that our reviewer of the book conjured up almost this very scenario in his review more than a month before the brouhaha erupted there is no precedent for this editors here like to feel we have an effect in the literary world , but it had never occurred to any of us that a reviewer might slip a script of the future into a passing clause the best books were chosen from among those reviewed by us since the 2000 holiday books issue , and the summaries below draw on those reviews best books are not included among the notable books of the year , which begin on page 63 austerlitz by w g sebald random house memory is moral treachery in the works of w g sebald , and in none is it more threatening than in this one his protagonist , dafydd elias , grew up in wales and is past 50 before he finds he is really jacques austerlitz , whose jewish parents sent him from central europe to britain at 4 to escape the holocaust , in which they perished that would suggest he is like leading characters in several other sebald novels , for whom missing the holocaust left holes in their lives but this man s name signals that sebald is on a much more farreaching quest this time napoleon s brilliant victory over russia and austria at the czech town of austerlitz in 1805 was taken by poets at the time and many historians later as a sign that a european political and social order dating from charlemagne was gone , and that the pursuit of transcontinental imperial power had taken a new form in this novel austerlitz , the character , is an architectural historian whose meditations on the past dwell on monstrous buildings and fortifications , some of them instrumental in the fate of his parents , as if the natural end of empire was terezin or auschwitz as so often in sebald s fiction , direct connections are never highlighted in the vast loops and sudden knottings of his rhetoric , but the reader cannot escape the inference that in the long sweep of history the nazis were not alone , but that an inquirer searching for meaning is borrowed finery a memoir by paula fox henry holt company paula fox s children s books have been staples for 35 years , and her adult fiction has had a rousing revival recently but nothing she has done has prepared her readers for this fragmentary memoir it may send many back to her other books , for it turns out she has been fictionalizing her real life all along , beginning with the remark of a character in one novel i was born and thrown away it was her mother who decreed she had to go , not long after she was born , and she was passed along among relatives and friends haphazardly all over the country and in cuba almost until she was an adult occasionally the feckless parents would remember she was theirs and intrude on her childhood disastrously her father sometimes tried to be kind , but recollections of these few moments are among the most painful parts of this book so little so seldom as for the mother , there is no pretense that fox , now 78 , has ever penetrated that dark natural force indeed , it is her inability to come to an understanding that makes borrowed finery so haunting it is organized among the many locales of her youth and has a choppy , imagistic quality that reflects the reality of that time throughout there are glimpses of what saved her spirit and made her a writer the sharp , funny observations of people s conduct and character by a girl of quick intelligence who had to learn too early the saving value of guarded independence the corrections by jonathan franzen farrar , straus giroux

las vegas , july 21 after two unspectacular rounds in tonight s world boxing council welterweight title fight at caesars palace , a solitary voice from the crowd issued an impassioned plea for the champion shane mosley come on , sugar hit the guy moments later , mosley , seemingly on cue , obliged , knocking down his opponent , adrian stone of england , to remain undefeated and to retain his title just 2 minutes 1 second into the third round it was another example of mosley s power , which has led many in the boxing community to regard him as the best poundforpound fighter in the world mosley , 29 , of pomona , calif , won in his third title defense since he captured the crown last summer in a splitdecision victory over oscar de la hoya he was an awkward fighter , mosley said , referring to stone i had to throw a lot of shots to the top of his head it was n't working , so then i had to go down low he was a tough opponent , but he did n't have a chance that , of course , was no surprise mosley \( 380 , 35 knockouts \) was a heavy favorite to beat stone \( 3033 , 23 knockouts \) , which is why many boxing fans and experts would prefer that the champion s next bout be against more formidable competition the elite names frequently brought up include de la hoya , felix trinidad and fernando vargas none of those matchups are likely to take place this year , although cedric kushner , mosley s promoter , said at tonight s postfight news conference that he would offer de la hoya 10 million to make the fight happen in december mosley , who would receive the same amount , is eager for the opportunity i think the fans want me to fight de la hoya , and if that s what the fans want , then so be it , mosley said i think de la hoya needs to fight me , if he wants any revenge from his loss a de la hoya rematch , however , will not be easy to arrange mosley is adamant that he should receive at least a 5050 split of the purse against de la hoya , despite the latter s overwhelming advantage in drawing power if that match cannot be arranged , mosley has indicated his desire to unify the welterweight championship he said he would fight either vernon forrest , the international boxing federation titleholder , who beat him in the 1992 olympic trials , or andrew lewis , the world boxing association champion but to secure an important spot in boxing s rich history and get more lucrative paydays , mosley will eventually have to fight one or more of the sport s bigger names he seems willing he said this week that he would fight two more times as a welterweight before moving up to 154 pounds , which would put him into position for bouts against de la hoya or vargas a potential bout with trinidad , the world boxing association middleweight champion , has its own obstacles trinidad , who is also undefeated and considered by many to be the best poundforpound fighter , has said that he will move up , not down , from 160 pounds after facing bernard hopkins in a unification bout sept 15 at madison square garden there is little mosley can do about that i'm not a genie , mosley said i ca n't say 'ok , trinidad , appear ! ' he ca n't because he s not in the weight class in tonight s undercard , the heavyweight jameel mccline scored a stunning victory over michael grant just 43 seconds into the opening round mccline , of clifton , nj , caught grant with the first punch of the fight , a powerful left that sent grant to the floor grant got up , but it made little difference after the 31yearold mccline \( 2623 , 16 knockouts \) pursued his opponent and landed another barrage of punches , grant , 28 , could offer little defense the referee stopped the fight at the request of grant , who thought his ankle was broken for grant \( 312 , 22 knockouts \) , it was another devastating setback in a career that once held high promise he was considered a serious force in the heavyweight division until he was knocked out in the second round by lennox lewis in their championship fight 15 months ago tonight was his first time back in the ring my feet were n't set right when he threw the punch and i heard my ankle snap , grant said photos shane mosley , far left , after knocking out adrian stone 2 minutes 1 second into the third round last night mosley , who retained his title , is 380 \( associated press \) jameel mccline stopped michael grant 43 seconds into the opening round last night after grant sustained an ankle injury \( reuters \)
trying to quell a furious reaction from employees outraged that he stood to profit from a merger with dynegy inc , kenneth l lay , the chairman and chief executive of the enron corporation , decided late yesterday to give up a severance package worth more than 60 million the tumult at enron s headquarters in houston began after the company disclosed in a securities filing earlier in the day that mr lay was in line to collect 606 million in pay after the deal closed next year , 202 million for every full calendar year left in his employment contract mr lay had been a popular leader as enron grew in the last 15 years from a pipeline operator into the nation s largest energy trader , a business largely of his invention employees shared in the gains , though none gained as much as mr lay , who has collected more than 300 million since 1989 , mostly through exercising stock options but the value of employees' stock options and their 401 \( k \) accounts evaporated this fall as enron shares plummeted amid concerns over the company s accounting practices and traders and other workers started the day yesterday gossiping angrily about mr lay s severance package then , at an afternoon meeting of employees in the company s core natural gas and electricity trading operation , which provides by far the biggest part of enron s profits , quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this changeofcontrol payment , mark palmer , an enron spokesman , said at about 4 pm central time , two senior executives who had attended the meeting , john lavorato and louise kitchen , told mr lay about the reaction of employees ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether , mr palmer said even if dynegy s directors later voted to award mr lay a new severance agreement , he would turn it down , mr palmer added what ken said is that this is the absolute cleanest way to remove any doubts , that he was not going to profit as a result of this change of control , mr palmer said this issue was causing enough concern among employees that he wanted to deal with it severance pay had been an awkward matter for mr lay in the last week the only reason that enron was being acquired putting the severance clauses in his employment contract into effect were the financial problems that have occurred on his watch the company s shares have lost almost 90 percent of their value after peaking in the summer of 2000 during merger discussions last week , mr lay told dynegy s chairman , charles l watson , that he wanted to rework the severance package , mr palmer said on monday , mr watson disclosed that mr lay wanted much of the severance to be in the form of stock options by yesterday afternoon , enron officials were saying that mr lay planned to take twothirds of the severance in stock or other noncash compensation and , they said , he wanted to give half of that amount , or onethird of his total package , to establish a charitable foundation to benefit enron employees it was about an hour later that enron said mr lay would give up the severance entirely mr lay has not decided whether to accept an invitation to be on the board of the combined company , which will be called dynegy the deal could still fall victim to antitrust objections or disclosures of further financial problems at enron whether mr lay s gesture will placate enron s traders , who are now deluging other energytrading companies with r sum s , remains to be seen dynegy is known as a much more conservative firm than enron , and analysts renewed their concerns yesterday about the cultural clash draining the talent , and value , from the combined company so much of their top talent is going out the door , i do n't know what dynegy gets , said a senior executive at another rival firm the stunning nearcollapse of enron bankruptcy was only averted , some analysts say , by the dynegy acquisition closes a chapter on one of the most influential careers in the history of the energy business the ugly circumstances of enron s downfall , including the revelation that partnerships were used to move debt off the company s balance sheet and that enron overstated profits in the last five years by almost 600 million , have left mr lay s reputation in tatters just months ago , mr lay was widely hailed or decried , in some circles as the genius behind energy deregulation his friend , george w bush , had been elected president , and policies favored by enron were front and center in the administration s energy policy mr lay retired from daytoday management , making plans to pursue new business interests but he again assumed the chief executive s post at enron in august , after the unexpected resignation of his handpicked successor , jeffrey k skilling , and the accounting problems swiftly unfolded in the weeks that followed on monday , mr lay said he might revive the business plans he set aside during the summer , but he declined to say what those plans were even without the severance package , mr lay has become enormously wealthy running enron
